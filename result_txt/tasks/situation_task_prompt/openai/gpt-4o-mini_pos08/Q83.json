    "**Sleep Pods in Nature**: To combat the lack of night-time, communities could create designated \"sleep pods\" in serene outdoor locations, such as parks or forests. These pods would be soundproof and equipped with natural sound machines that mimic nighttime sounds like crickets or rustling leaves. Users could book time in these pods to take restorative naps during the day, allowing them to experience a temporary escape from the perpetual daylight and reconnect with nature.",
    "**Personalized Sleepwear**: Innovative sleepwear could be developed with embedded technology that helps simulate night-time conditions. This clothing would include light-dimming fabric that darkens in response to body temperature and circadian cues, promoting a restful environment. The fabric could also incorporate calming scents, like lavender or chamomile, to enhance relaxation and encourage sleep, making it easier to drift off in a sunlit world.",
    "**Community Sleep Retreats**: Communities could organize regular \"sleep retreats\" where individuals gather to engage in collective relaxation practices. These retreats would take place in specially designed venues with controlled lighting, soothing music, and guided meditation sessions. Participants would learn techniques for relaxation and mindfulness that help them transition into sleep more effectively, fostering a supportive environment for overcoming the challenges of constant daylight.",
    "**Virtual Reality Sleep Experiences**: With advancements in technology, virtual reality (VR) could offer immersive experiences that simulate night-time environments. Users could wear VR headsets that transport them to serene nightscapes, complete with starry skies and calming sounds. This would allow individuals to escape the bright reality around them, providing a psychological trigger for relaxation and sleep, regardless of the external conditions.",
    "**Dynamic Urban Planning**: Cities could be designed with sleep-friendly infrastructure, such as soundproof sleeping chambers or nap stations in public spaces. These chambers would provide a dark, quiet space for individuals to rest during the day. Urban planners could incorporate green spaces with shaded areas to create calming environments where people can relax, meditate, or take power naps, promoting overall well-being in a world without night-time."
