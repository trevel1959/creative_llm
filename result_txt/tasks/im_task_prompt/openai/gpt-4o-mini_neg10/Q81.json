    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Create a spatula that comes with interchangeable heads for different cooking tasks. For instance, one head could be flat for flipping pancakes, another could be slotted for draining excess oil, and a third could be angled for scraping the sides of bowls. This would eliminate the need for multiple utensils, saving space in the kitchen.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Recipe Guide**: This spatula could feature a small touchscreen display that provides step-by-step cooking instructions or recipes. Users could select a dish, and the spatula would guide them through the cooking process, offering tips on timing and techniques while they cook.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Spatula Made from Sustainable Materials**: Develop a spatula made entirely from biodegradable or recycled materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This spatula could also come with a compostable packaging, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers and promoting sustainability in the kitchen.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Design a spatula that utilizes UV-C light technology to sanitize itself after use. This would not only make cleaning easier but also ensure that harmful bacteria are eliminated, promoting food safety. The spatula could have a simple button to activate the cleaning mode after cooking.",
    "**Color-Changing Spatula**: Create a spatula that changes color based on the temperature of the food being cooked. For example, it could turn from green to red when food is too hot, indicating that itâ€™s time to flip or remove it from the heat. This visual cue would help prevent overcooking and improve cooking outcomes."
