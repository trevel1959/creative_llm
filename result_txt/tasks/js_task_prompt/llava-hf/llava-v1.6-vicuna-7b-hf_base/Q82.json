    "Adaptation to Climate: The new plant species would need to be able to thrive in various climates. It could have the ability to adapt to different light conditions, such as full sun, partial shade, or even shade. This would allow the plant to grow in a wider range of environments.",
    "Drought Resistance: Since plants often struggle with drought, the new plant species could be designed to have better water conservation abilities. This could include deep root systems that access water from deeper in the ground, or the ability to go dormant during dry periods to conserve water.",
    "Unique Nutrient Uptake: The new plant species could have a unique way of absorbing nutrients from the soil. For example, it could have specialized roots that can extract nutrients from rocks or minerals, or it could produce symbiotic relationships with microorganisms to access essential nutrients.",
    "Unique Reproduction: The new plant species could have a unique method of reproduction. For example, it could reproduce asexually through cloning or vegetative propagation, or it could have a specific pollination mechanism that attracts specific pollinators.",
    "Self-Defense Mechanisms: The new plant species could have built-in self-defense mechanisms to protect itself from pests and diseases. This could include toxins in its leaves or roots that deter herbivores, or the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds to fight off pathogens."
