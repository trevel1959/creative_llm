    "**Innovative Toothbrush with Oral Health Monitoring**: Create a toothbrush that not only cleans teeth but also monitors oral health through sensors. This toothbrush can measure factors such as brushing pressure, duration, and frequency, then provide feedback on an app or smart device. Users can receive personalized brushing recommendations to improve their dental hygiene habits.",
    "**Biodegradable Toothbrushes for Environmental Consciousness**: Design a toothbrush made from natural materials like bamboo, which is biodegradable and sustainable. The bristles could be made of recycled plastic or plant-based fibers, making it a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic toothbrushes. This promotes environmental awareness and encourages responsible consumer choices.",
    "**Television Remote-Controlled Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush that pairs with a remote control. The remote allows users to start and stop the brushing session, change settings (like speed or pressure), and even play custom audio content during brushing. This adds an interactive and engaging element to the routine, potentially increasing compliance among users.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Electric Flosser**: Combine a toothbrush with an electric flosser to offer comprehensive oral care in one device. This innovative toothbrush would feature a retractable flossing mechanism that can be activated with a button press. It provides users with an easy way to maintain gum health and prevent plaque buildup between teeth.",
    "**Voice-Activated Toothbrush**: Integrate voice recognition technology into the toothbrush so users can control its functions by speaking commands. This is especially helpful for children or individuals with physical disabilities who might find traditional controls challenging. Voice activation makes brushing routines more accessible and user-friendly, promoting better oral hygiene practices."
