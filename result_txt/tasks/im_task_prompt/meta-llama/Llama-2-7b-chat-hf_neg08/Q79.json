    "Smart Clothes Hanger: Concept: Develop a clothes hanger with built-in sensors that can detect when a garment is placed on or removed from the hanger. These sensors can then send notifications to a user's smartphone or tablet, allowing them to track their wardrobe's inventory and stay organized. Additionally, the hanger can have a built-in charging station for smart devices, providing a convenient charging solution for users on the go.",
    "Adjustable Clothes Hanger: Concept: Create a clothes hanger with adjustable height and angle settings, allowing users to customize the hanger to fit their specific needs. This can be particularly useful for people with limited mobility or those who have difficulty reaching high shelves. The adjustable hanger can also be used to hang clothes in different positions, such as folded or flat, to prevent wrinkles and creases.",
    "Clothes Hanger with Integrated Steamer: Concept: Design a clothes hanger with an integrated steamer function, allowing users to quickly and easily steam their clothes without the need for a separate steamer. This can be achieved through the use of a small, portable steamer unit that is attached to the hanger, or through the use of a heating element that is built into the hanger itself. This feature can save time and effort for users who want to quickly refresh their wardrobe without the need for additional equipment.",
    "Collapsible Clothes Hanger: Concept: Create a clothes hanger that can be easily collapsed and stored when not in use. This can be achieved through the use of a collapsible frame or a hanger with a compact, foldable design. This feature can save space in closets and drawers, making it easier for users to store their clothes when they are not in use.",
    "Clothes Hanger with Built-in Storage: Concept: Design a clothes hanger with built-in storage compartments for small items such as buttons, safety pins, and other accessories. This can be achieved through the use of small, enclosed compartments or pockets that are built into the hanger itself. This feature can help users keep their accessories organized and within reach, making it easier to find what they need when they need it."
