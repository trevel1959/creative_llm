    "**Modular Oven Design**:    Create an oven with a modular design that allows users to customize its components. For instance, one module could be a conventional baking space, another could be a steam oven, and a third could be a slow cooker. Users could mix and match these modules according to their cooking needs, and the oven could recognize which modules are in use to optimize cooking times and temperatures accordingly.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology with Eco-Friendly Features**:    Introduce a self-cleaning oven that uses ultrasonic waves and eco-friendly cleaning agents. Instead of traditional high-heat cleaning methods, this technology would utilize sound waves to break down food particles and grease, which can then be wiped away easily. This would reduce energy consumption and eliminate the need for harsh chemicals, making it safer for the environment and the user.",
    "**Multi-Zone Cooking System**:    Develop an oven that features multiple cooking zones, each with its own temperature control and cooking method (e.g., convection, broil, steam). This would allow users to cook different dishes simultaneously at varying temperatures without affecting each other. For example, you could roast a chicken while simultaneously baking bread and steaming vegetables, all within the same oven.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cooking Assistance**:    Integrate augmented reality (AR) technology into the oven's door or a companion device. When the user opens the oven, they could see AR overlays showing cooking times, temperatures, and even step-by-step instructions for their recipes. This feature could also provide visual cues on when to check or flip items, ensuring perfectly cooked meals every time.",
    "**Built-in Air Quality Monitor**:    Equip the oven with an air quality monitoring system that detects smoke, steam, and harmful fumes. This system could alert users through a smartphone app if air quality levels drop, prompting them to ventilate the kitchen. Additionally, the oven could automatically adjust its fan speed to minimize smoke and odors, creating a healthier cooking environment."
