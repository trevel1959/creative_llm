To address this, the summit could employ professional interpreters and provide real-time translation services.

This could include secure transportation for delegates, emergency response plans, and risk assessments to mitigate potential threats. Ensuring the safety of all attendees is essential for a successful summit.",
    "**Logistical Coordination and Venue Selection**: Choosing the right venue is critical for accommodating diverse participants and facilitating productive discussions. The venue should be accessible, equipped with necessary technology (like audio-visual systems), and have breakout rooms for smaller discussions. Additionally, organizers must coordinate travel arrangements, accommodations, and catering to cater to various dietary needs, ensuring a seamless experience for all.",
    "**Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Given the nature of the summit, disagreements may arise during discussions. Establishing clear conflict resolution mechanisms beforehand can help address disputes effectively. This could involve appointing neutral mediators who can facilitate discussions and encourage compromise, ensuring that the focus remains on collaborative solutions rather than divisive arguments.",
    "**Engagement of Youth and Grassroots Organizations**: To create a more inclusive atmosphere, the summit could actively engage youth and grassroots organizations that represent marginalized voices. This could be done through workshops, panel discussions, or open forums where these groups can share their perspectives on peacebuilding. By amplifying diverse voices, the summit can foster a more comprehensive dialogue on global peace efforts."
