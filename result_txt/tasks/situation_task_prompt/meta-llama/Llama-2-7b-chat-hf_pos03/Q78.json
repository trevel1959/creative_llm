    "Nature Play: If all toys disappeared, children could turn to nature as a source of endless play opportunities. They could play in the mud, climb trees, build dams in streams, and create imaginative games using natural elements like rocks, sticks, and leaves. This type of play would encourage children to be creative and resourceful, while also fostering a deeper connection with nature.",
    "Cardboard Box Forts: Cardboard boxes are a staple in many households, and with all toys gone, children could turn them into anything they can imagine. They could build elaborate forts, castles, and spaceships using their imagination and creativity. This type of play would encourage children to think outside the box (pun intended) and use their problem-solving skills to create something entirely new.",
    "Imaginary Friends: Without toys to play with, children could turn to their imaginations to create their own playmates. They could invent imaginary friends with unique personalities, abilities, and adventures. This type of play would encourage children to use their creativity and imagination to create a whole new world of play possibilities.",
    "Music and Dance: Music and dance have long been a source of play and entertainment for children. Without toys, they could turn to these art forms to create their own instruments and dances. They could use household items like pots, pans, and wooden spoons to create a makeshift drum set or use their bodies to create rhythms and movements. This type of play would encourage children to explore their creativity and express themselves through music and dance.",
    "Storytelling: Without toys to play with, children could turn to storytelling as a source of play. They could make up stories, act them out, and use their voices and bodies to bring their imaginary worlds to life. This type of play would encourage children to use their creativity and imagination to create their own stories and characters, while also developing their language and communication skills."
