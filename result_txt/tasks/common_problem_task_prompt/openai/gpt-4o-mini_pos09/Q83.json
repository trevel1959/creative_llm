    "**Communication Barriers**: Traditional radio waves cannot travel through water effectively, making communication with surface teams difficult. To address this, the mission could employ acoustic communication technology or develop a buoy system that relays information to the surface, ensuring constant contact and data transmission.",
    "**Limited Energy Resources**: Powering equipment and submersibles at great depths is challenging. Solar power is ineffective, and battery life is limited. One solution could be the development of bioenergy systems that utilize microorganisms found in deep-sea environments to generate energy, providing a sustainable power source for extended missions.",
    "**Navigational Difficulties**: The ocean floor is largely uncharted, making navigation tricky. Utilizing advanced sonar technology and AI algorithms for real-time mapping could help create detailed topographical maps of the ocean floor, allowing for precise navigation and exploration of targeted areas.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Disturbing the delicate ecosystems at the ocean's depths could have unforeseen consequences. Implementing strict environmental protocols and conducting thorough impact assessments before and during the mission can help mitigate any negative effects, ensuring that exploration is done responsibly.",
    "**Psychological Effects on Crew**: Prolonged isolation and confinement can affect the mental well-being of the crew. To counteract this, the mission could incorporate virtual reality experiences and regular psychological check-ins, providing crew members with immersive escapes and support systems to maintain morale and mental health."
