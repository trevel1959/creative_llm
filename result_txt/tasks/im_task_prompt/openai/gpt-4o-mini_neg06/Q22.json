    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that incorporates solar panels into its design. This would allow the flashlight to recharge during the day when left outside, reducing the need for disposable batteries. A small built-in battery would store energy for use at night, making it environmentally friendly and perfect for outdoor enthusiasts who spend extended periods away from power sources.",
    "**Modular Flashlight System**: Design a flashlight that can be customized with interchangeable parts. Users could switch out different heads for various lighting effects (e.g., wide beam, focused beam, colored lenses for signaling) or attach additional features like a lantern or a power bank for charging devices. This modularity would cater to different user needs and preferences, making it versatile for various activities.",
    "**Self-Adjusting Brightness Flashlight**: Introduce a flashlight equipped with a light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness based on the surrounding environment. For instance, it could dim in well-lit areas to save battery and brighten in dark environments for optimal visibility. This feature would enhance user experience and prolong battery life, making it ideal for everyday use.",
    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Emergency Tools**: Innovate a flashlight that includes essential emergency tools such as a whistle, a small knife, and a fire starter built into the body. This all-in-one tool would be perfect for hikers and campers, providing not only illumination but also critical tools for survival situations, making it a reliable companion in the wild.",
    "**Flashlight with Gesture Control**: Develop a flashlight that can be operated using gesture control technology. Users could wave their hand to turn the light on or off, or swipe to change brightness levels without needing to press buttons. This would be particularly useful for situations where hands are dirty or full, like during a camping trip or while working on a project."
