    "**Bicycle Revolution**: In a scenario where all vehicles cease functioning, individuals could adapt by using bicycles for transportation. Cities would need to create extensive bike lanes and encourage cycling by providing bike-sharing services, bicycle repair facilities, and perhaps even bike-friendly incentives like discounts or reduced fares on public transport. This idea promotes a healthier lifestyle and reduces the carbon footprint.",
    "**Human-Powered Vehicles**: Designing and utilizing human-powered vehicles such as pedicabs, tricycles, or even wheelbarrows could be an innovative solution. These vehicles could be used by individuals or businesses, allowing people to carry goods or provide transportation services within cities. To ensure safety and efficiency, these vehicles would require standardized design guidelines and traffic rules.",
    "**Inflatable Rafting**: If there's access to bodies of water between cities, inflatable rafts or airships could be used for transportation. This method requires lightweight materials and efficient propulsion systems. Safety measures such as life jackets, emergency supplies, and communication devices would be crucial. Coastal cities could establish docking stations to facilitate raft transportation.",
    "**Equestrian Transportation**: In regions where horses are abundant, horse-drawn carriages could become a popular mode of transportation. To support this, cities would need to establish stables, grooming stations, and training programs for both the animals and their handlers. This approach offers a unique, traditional touch while still being practical for long-distance travel.",
    "**Portable Electric Scooters**: Developing portable electric scooters that can be easily disassembled and carried by individuals could be a game-changer. These scooters would have compact designs, long-lasting batteries, and fast charging capabilities. Cities could install charging stations at strategic locations, making it convenient for people to travel short distances between cities. Additionally, they could be used in conjunction with other modes of transportation, like bikes or walking paths."
