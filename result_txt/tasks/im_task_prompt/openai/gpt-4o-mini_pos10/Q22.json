    "**Multi-Function Flashlight with Safety Features**: Create a flashlight that incorporates multiple safety features such as a built-in siren, strobe light, and reflective emergency flag. This flashlight could be particularly useful for hikers or those in remote areas, as it would not only provide light but also signal for help in case of emergencies. The siren could be activated with a simple button press, and the strobe light could serve as a distress signal.",
    "**Modular Flashlight Design**: Introduce a modular flashlight that allows users to customize the length and features according to their needs. Users could add or remove sections that contain different functionalities such as a lantern head, a laser pointer, or a multi-tool attachment (screwdriver, bottle opener, etc.). This would cater to various activities like camping, DIY projects, or emergency preparedness.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with App Integration**: Develop a smart flashlight that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could offer features such as brightness control, battery life monitoring, and a GPS locator to find the flashlight if lost. Users could also customize light modes (steady, SOS, strobe) and set timers for automatic shut-off to conserve battery life.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Flashlight with Grip Enhancements**: Focus on creating a flashlight with an ergonomic design that fits comfortably in the hand. The flashlight could have a textured, non-slip grip and a curved body for easy handling, especially in wet conditions. Additionally, it could feature an adjustable strap for hands-free use, allowing users to secure it to their wrist or belt while performing tasks.",
    "**Color-Changing LED Flashlight**: Innovate a flashlight that features color-changing LEDs, allowing users to switch between different colors based on their needs. For example, red light could be used for preserving night vision, blue light for visibility in foggy conditions, and white light for standard illumination. A simple dial or button could enable users to cycle through colors easily."
