    "**Innate Curiosity**: Humans are naturally curious creatures, but the modern world often suppresses this trait. I'd change human nature to have an innate curiosity that's always on the go. This would manifest as an insatiable desire to learn, explore, and discover new things. People would be constantly asking questions, seeking answers, and pushing the boundaries of what's known. This would lead to a world where innovation and progress are the norm, and people are always striving to improve themselves and their surroundings.",
    "**Empathetic Telepathy**: Humans have the capacity for empathy, but it's often limited by our ability to understand and connect with others. I'd change human nature to have a form of empathetic telepathy, where we can directly sense and understand the emotions and thoughts of those around us. This would foster deeper connections, more meaningful relationships, and a more compassionate society. People would be able to navigate conflicts and challenges with greater ease, and the world would be a more harmonious place.",
    "**Environmental Synesthesia**: Humans have a unique relationship with the natural world, but it's often limited by our inability to directly experience the intricate web of life. I'd change human nature to have an environmental synesthesia, where we can perceive and interact with the natural world in a more intuitive and holistic way. People would be able to see the interconnectedness of all living things, and their actions would be guided by a deeper sense of responsibility and stewardship for the planet.",
    "**Creative Multipotentiality**: Humans have the capacity for creativity, but it's often stifled by our tendency to specialize and conform to societal norms. I'd change human nature to have a creative multipotentiality, where people can effortlessly switch between different creative pursuits and interests. This would lead to a world where artists, inventors, and innovators are encouraged to explore and express themselves in multiple ways, resulting in a more diverse and vibrant cultural landscape.",
    "**Temporal Perspective**: Humans have a limited understanding of time and its impact on our lives. I'd change human nature to have a temporal perspective, where people can see and experience time in a more fluid and multidimensional way. This would allow individuals to navigate the complexities of time, making it easier to learn from the past, appreciate the present, and plan for the future. The world would be a more patient and forward-thinking place, where people are able to make more informed decisions and live more fulfilling lives. </s>"
