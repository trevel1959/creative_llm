    "Create a memory journal: If all photos and paintings disappeared, the next best thing would be to start a memory journal. This could be a physical book or a digital document where you write down your memories of past events and people. You could include details such as dates, locations, emotions, and sensations to help you remember more vividly.",
    "Record audio and video interviews: Another way to remember past events and people would be to record audio and video interviews with them. You could ask them about their experiences, thoughts, and feelings, and save these recordings for future reference.",
    "Create a scrapbook: A scrapbook is a great way to remember past events and people. You could collect ticket stubs, postcards, souvenirs, and other memorabilia related to the event or person and glue them into a book. This would give you a tangible reminder of the experience.",
    "Write poetry or stories: Writing poetry or stories about past events and people can be a powerful way to remember them. You could use your imagination to create a narrative that captures the essence of the experience and the emotions you felt.",
    "Practice mindfulness: If all photos and paintings disappeared, it would be important to practice mindfulness.
