    "**3D Illusion Picture Frame**: Create a picture frame that incorporates optical illusions to create a 3D effect when viewed from certain angles. This can be achieved by using geometric shapes, patterns, or mirrors strategically placed within the frame. The illusion could be subtle, such as giving the appearance of depth or dimension in the picture itself, or more overt, like making objects appear to pop out or float. This type of frame would be a unique conversation starter and a fun addition to any wall decor.",
    "**Interactive Picture Frame**: Design a picture frame that includes sensors or microcontrollers, allowing it to interact with its surroundings or users. For example, the frame could light up or change color when touched, or display different images based on proximity to a specific device (like a smartphone). This kind of frame could be personalized for each user, offering a dynamic and interactive experience.",
    "**Time-Lapse Picture Frame**: Incorporate a small camera inside the frame that takes pictures at regular intervals, creating a time-lapse video when played back. This could be used to capture the daily life of someone or something over time, offering a unique way to document events or changes. It could be triggered manually or set up to operate automatically, depending on the intended use.",
    "**Scented Picture Frame**: Integrate a small scent diffuser into the frame, allowing the aroma of the chosen scent to fill the room where the frame is displayed. This could be used to evoke memories, create a relaxing atmosphere, or simply add an extra sensory element to the viewing experience. The scent could be changed easily through refillable cartridges or replaceable diffuser units.",
    "**Sound-Enhanced Picture Frame**: Combine the picture frame with a small speaker system that plays background music, ambient sounds, or even voice recordings associated with the image being displayed. This could provide an immersive audio experience, enhancing the emotional impact of the photo or artwork. The sound could be synced to the visuals or operate independently, offering versatility in usage scenarios."
