    "**Multi-Functionality**: Design a sandwich toaster that also functions as a grill, waffle maker, and panini press. By including interchangeable plates, users can create a variety of meals with the same appliance. For instance, users can switch from toasting sandwiches to grilling vegetables or making waffles, maximizing versatility and minimizing kitchen clutter.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Create a sandwich toaster with a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add fillings like cheese, sauce, or vegetables while the sandwich is toasting. This could be a small compartment that releases ingredients at the right moment, ensuring even distribution and preventing messes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses steam or high heat to clean the cooking plates after use. This would save time and effort for users, allowing them to enjoy their sandwiches without worrying about the hassle of cleaning up afterward.",
    "**Customizable Toasting Patterns**: Introduce a customizable toasting pattern feature where users can select different designs or patterns to imprint on their sandwiches while toasting. This could add a fun and personal touch, especially for children, making mealtime more enjoyable and visually appealing.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a sandwich toaster made from sustainable, eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. This not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also provides a unique aesthetic that can enhance kitchen decor."
