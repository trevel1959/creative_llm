    "A sense of smell for the eyes: The new human sense, called \"Visual Olfaction,\" would allow people to see and interpret the scent of objects, people, and environments. This sense would be activated through specialized retinal cells that convert odor molecules into visible patterns, colors, and shapes. The more intense the scent, the brighter and more vivid the visual representation would be.",
    "A sense of gravity: The \"Gravitational Sense\" would allow people to perceive the subtle changes in gravitational forces around them. This sense would be activated through specialized sensory cells that detect even the slightest variations in gravitational pull, allowing people to sense the weight and texture of objects, the movement of their own body, and the position of their surroundings in space.",
    "A sense of time: The \"Chrono-Sense\" would allow people to perceive time in a more nuanced and detailed way. This sense would be activated through specialized neurons that track the passage of time, allowing people to sense the duration of events, the speed of time, and the rhythm of their own biological processes.",
    "A sense of temperature: The \"Thermal Sense\" would allow people to perceive temperature in a more precise and subtle way. This sense would be activated through specialized thermoreceptors that can detect even slight changes in temperature, allowing people to sense the warmth or coolness of their surroundings, the temperature of objects, and the thermal state of their own body.",
    "A sense of electromagnetic fields: The \"EMF Sense\" would allow people to perceive electromagnetic fields around them, including magnetic fields, electric fields, and radio waves. This sense would be activated through specialized sensory cells that can detect the subtle changes in electromagnetic fields, allowing people to sense the presence of electronic devices, the strength of magnetic fields, and the radiation levels in their environment."
