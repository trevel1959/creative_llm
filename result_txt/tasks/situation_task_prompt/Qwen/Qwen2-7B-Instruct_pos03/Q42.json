    "**Creating Shelter:** One of the first things to consider when stranded on a deserted island is shelter. You could use available materials like branches, leaves, and vines to construct a sturdy shelter. Utilize the natural environment by creating a lean-to style structure or even a more complex shelter like a teepee. This will protect you from harsh weather conditions such as rain and strong winds.",
    "**Finding Water:** Access to clean water is crucial for survival. Look for signs of water sources such as wet sand, puddles, or plants that are thriving. You can collect rainwater in large containers made from available materials like plastic bottles or tin cans. If you find a fresh water source, ensure it's safe to drink by boiling the water or using a natural filtration method like passing the water through sand or using a leaf filter.",
    "**Gathering Food:** To sustain yourself, you need to find a reliable food source. Learn about edible plants and fruits native to the island. Some common examples include coconuts, which provide both water and nutrients, and fruits like bananas or mangoes if they're available. Additionally, you can fish for seafood using basic tools like a homemade spear or fishing line. If there are no fish, you can try catching crabs or other sea creatures.",
    "**Building a Signal Device:** It's essential to signal for help. You can create a large signal device using materials found on the island. Use long branches to build a cross or a giant letter \"SOS\" to catch the attention of passing ships or planes. Additionally, you can collect white objects like seashells, rocks, or cloth to reflect sunlight during the day or create a fire at night, signaling your location.",
    "**Improvising Tools:** With limited resources, it's important to be resourceful and improvise tools. For example, you can make a bow drill for starting fires using a wooden stick and a smaller piece of wood or a bone. This tool can be used to create friction, generating heat to ignite dry grass or wood. Other tools could include a digging stick for finding roots or digging for water sources, or a simple knife for cutting and scraping."
