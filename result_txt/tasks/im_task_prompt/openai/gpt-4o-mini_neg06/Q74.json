    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Design a watering can that incorporates a self-watering mechanism. This can include a reservoir that holds excess water and slowly releases it into the soil through a wicking system. Users can fill the reservoir, and the can will automatically provide moisture to the plants over time, reducing the frequency of manual watering.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**: Create a watering can with an ergonomic handle and an adjustable spout that can be rotated to different angles. This design would allow users to easily water plants in hard-to-reach areas or hanging baskets without straining their wrists. The spout could also have multiple settings for a fine mist or a steady stream, catering to various plant needs.",
    "**Built-in Fertilizer Dispenser**: Incorporate a compartment in the watering can for liquid fertilizer. As users water their plants, the can would automatically mix a diluted solution of fertilizer with the water, providing nutrients to the plants in a convenient and efficient manner. This feature could be adjustable based on the type of plants being watered.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Develop a watering can with a solar panel on top that powers a small pump inside. The pump could draw water from a nearby source (like a rain barrel) and distribute it to the plants. This eco-friendly design would reduce the need for manual filling and help conserve water by using collected rainwater.",
    "**Collapsible and Portable Design**: Create a collapsible watering can made from lightweight, durable materials that can be easily folded and stored. This design would be ideal for urban gardeners or those with limited storage space. Additionally, it could come with a built-in carry handle and be designed to fit into standard backpack sizes for easy transport to community gardens or outdoor events."
