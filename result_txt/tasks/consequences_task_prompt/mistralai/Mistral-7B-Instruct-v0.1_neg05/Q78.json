    "The weight of the oceans would shift and change the Earth's gravity, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",
    "The oceans would become thicker and more viscous, making it harder for marine life to move and survive.",
    "The oceans would absorb more sunlight and emit more heat, causing global warming and climate change.",
    "The oceans would become more prone to pollution and contamination, as chemicals and waste would sink to the bottom and become trapped.",
    "The oceans would become more difficult to navigate, as the liquid would have different properties such asgradient buoyancy and density."
