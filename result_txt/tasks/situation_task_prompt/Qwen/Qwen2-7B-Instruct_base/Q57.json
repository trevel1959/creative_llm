    "**High-Rise Apartments or Condos:** Given the potential rise in sea levels, constructing high-rise buildings that are built on stilts or foundations elevated above ground level could be a solution. These structures would not only protect residents from flooding but also provide an opportunity for vertical urban development. They could feature amenities like rooftop gardens, observation decks, and emergency shelters.",
    "**Floating Communities:** Inspired by traditional floating villages in places like the Maldives or the Amazon, designing communities that float on water could offer a sustainable living option in areas prone to rising sea levels. These communities would consist of modular, interconnected structures made of eco-friendly materials such as bamboo or recycled plastic. They would be anchored in place using innovative buoyancy systems and renewable energy sources like solar panels.",
    "**Underground Cities:** In regions with vast underground caves or caverns, creating subterranean cities could provide a safe haven from rising waters. These cities would require extensive engineering to ensure structural integrity and include features like airlocks, emergency exits, and self-sustaining ecosystems powered by renewable energy. Underground cities could also incorporate green spaces, vertical gardens, and natural light to create a livable environment.",
    "**Mobile Dwellings:** Building homes on platforms that can be easily moved to higher ground could allow residents to relocate as necessary. These dwellings could be designed as modular units, making them easy to transport and assemble. They would use lightweight materials and be equipped with solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and efficient insulation to reduce reliance on external resources. Mobile homes could be connected via temporary bridges or roads, forming temporary neighborhoods that adapt to changing conditions.",
    "**Tidal Power Zones:** Living in areas designated for tidal power generation could offer a unique solution. By harnessing the energy from tidal movements, these zones could provide a sustainable source of electricity while also potentially mitigating some effects of rising sea levels through the construction of barriers or breakwaters. Homes in these areas would be built to withstand extreme tides and be integrated into the infrastructure supporting tidal energy projects. This approach would require collaboration between developers, engineers, and environmental experts to ensure safety and ecological balance."
