    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that adjusts to the user's grip for maximum comfort, especially for prolonged use. Additionally, the spout can be adjustable in length and angle, allowing users to reach plants in hard-to-access areas without straining their backs or arms. This would cater to both indoor and outdoor gardening needs.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Equip the watering can with a built-in water filter that purifies tap water as it is poured. This would ensure that plants receive clean water free from chlorine and other harmful chemicals. The filter could be easily replaceable, and a small indicator could alert users when it's time for a replacement.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Incorporate a self-watering mechanism that allows the can to draw water from a reservoir or a connected hose. This would enable plants to receive a consistent amount of water over time, especially beneficial for those who travel frequently or have busy schedules. The can could also have a timer to regulate watering intervals.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Create a dual-chamber watering can that allows users to mix liquid fertilizer with water. The can would have a separate compartment for fertilizer, which would dispense the correct amount as the user waters their plants. This would simplify the fertilization process and ensure that plants receive nutrients in conjunction with watering.",
    "**Color-Coded Measurement System**: Design the watering can with a color-coded measurement system on the side, indicating different amounts of water suitable for various types of plants. For instance, a green section could indicate the amount for succulents, while a blue section could be for larger houseplants. This would make it easier for novice gardeners to know how much water to give their plants."
