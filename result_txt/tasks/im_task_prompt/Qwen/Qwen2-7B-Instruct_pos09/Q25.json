    "**Eco-friendly Stapler**: Design a stapler that is made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This stapler could also have a unique feature of being rechargeable using solar energy, making it an environmentally friendly option for offices and schools.",
    "**Stapler as a Smart Device**: Create a smart stapler that can connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, allowing it to communicate with computers, printers, or smartphones. It could provide real-time data on usage, like how many staples are left, or even suggest new staples based on past usage patterns.",
    "**Innovative Staple Technology**: Develop a stapler that uses a new type of staple that is stronger and more durable than traditional ones. This could potentially reduce waste by needing fewer staples per job and be beneficial for heavy-duty tasks.",
    "**Adjustable Stapler for Different Paper Thicknesses**: Design a stapler that can automatically adjust its strength and force depending on the thickness of the paper stack. This would ensure that the stapling process is both effective and gentle on sensitive documents.",
    "**Interactive Learning Tool**: Create an educational stapler that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology. When used in conjunction with a smartphone or tablet, it could guide users through different stapling techniques or show interactive tutorials on how to properly use a stapler for various tasks, making it particularly useful for schools and training environments."
