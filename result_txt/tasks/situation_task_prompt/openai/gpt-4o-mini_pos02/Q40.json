    "**Solar-Powered Smart Surfaces**: Create smart surfaces that integrate solar cells into everyday objects, such as tables, benches, or even clothing. These surfaces would be capable of absorbing sunlight and converting it into energy. For example, a solar-powered table in a park could charge devices wirelessly through integrated charging pads. Additionally, clothing could have small solar panels sewn into the fabric, allowing wearers to charge their devices while on the go, combining fashion with functionality.",
    "**Thermoelectric Generators**: Innovate devices that utilize temperature differences to generate electricity. For instance, a thermoelectric charger could be placed on a hot surface, such as a stove or an outdoor grill, capturing the heat and converting it into usable power. This could be especially useful for campers or outdoor enthusiasts who often find themselves away from traditional power sources. A compact design could allow users to easily transport and set up the device wherever they go.",
    "**Biological Energy Harvesters**: Explore the potential of harnessing energy from biological processes. For example, create a device that captures energy from microbial fuel cells, which convert organic matter into electricity. This could be used in urban settings where food waste is abundant, allowing communities to turn their waste into a power source for local devices. Imagine streetlights powered by the organic waste collected from nearby restaurants, creating a sustainable energy loop.",
    "**Wind-Powered Chargers**: Design portable wind turbines that can be easily set up in various environments, from backyards to camping sites. These small turbines would capture wind energy and convert it into electricity. Users could carry a compact version that unfolds into a small turbine, allowing them to generate power while enjoying outdoor activities. This concept could also be integrated into existing infrastructure, such as streetlamps with built-in turbines to harness urban wind currents.",
    "**Human-Powered Devices**: Create devices that rely on human power through pedaling or cranking. For example, a bicycle-powered generator could allow users to charge their devices while exercising. This could be implemented in community fitness centers, where gym equipment is connected to a power grid, turning workouts into a source of energy. Users could pedal on stationary bikes to generate electricity, making fitness both healthy and sustainable."
