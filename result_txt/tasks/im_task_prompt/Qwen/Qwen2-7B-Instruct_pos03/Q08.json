    "**Intelligent Food Inventory Management System**: Design a refrigerator equipped with sensors and artificial intelligence that tracks the expiration dates of your food items. This system would automatically create shopping lists based on what's about to expire, alert you when items are running low, and even suggest recipes based on your current stock.",
    "**Automated Meal Preparation**: Develop a refrigerator that can prepare simple meals. It could include a small cooking area within it, capable of reheating, steaming, or saut√©ing ingredients. You input your desired meal into the app connected to the fridge, and it prepares it for you. It can also store and organize meal components so they're ready to use when needed.",
    "**Smart Temperature Control and Monitoring**: Enhance the traditional fridge with smart temperature control capabilities. The fridge would adjust its internal temperature based on the type of food stored inside (e.g., meat needs colder temperatures than vegetables). Additionally, it would monitor these temperatures through an app, alerting you if they deviate from the optimal range.",
    "**Biodegradable Packaging Integration**: Introduce a feature where the fridge can identify biodegradable packaging materials. It could then assist in composting food waste or offer suggestions on how to properly dispose of them. This not only promotes environmental sustainability but also helps reduce the amount of trash generated by household food consumption.",
    "**Health and Wellness Personalization**: Create a fridge that adapts to your health goals. It could analyze your dietary habits and preferences through an app, suggesting healthier alternatives and organizing foods accordingly. For instance, if you're trying to eat more plant-based, the fridge might prioritize vegetarian options. It could also remind you to take necessary supplements and provide information on their benefits."
