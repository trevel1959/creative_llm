    "**Smart Washing Machine with AI Integration:** Create a smart washing machine that integrates artificial intelligence to optimize the washing process based on the fabric type, load size, and even user preferences. The machine could learn from usage patterns over time, adjusting water temperature, detergent amount, and spin cycles accordingly to maximize efficiency and minimize energy consumption. It could also be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to monitor their laundry progress and receive alerts for when their laundry is done.",
    "**Energy-Saving Wash Cycles:** Develop wash cycles that are specifically designed to save energy. For example, cold-water washing cycles could use less energy than traditional hot water washes without compromising on cleaning performance. The machine could also have a feature that adjusts its motor speed based on the load's weight and type of fabric, ensuring that it uses just enough power for the task at hand.",
    "**Recycling and Upcycling Feature:** Introduce a feature that allows users to recycle or upcycle used laundry detergents or other cleaning products. The machine could collect and process leftover chemicals into a reusable product or suggest eco-friendly alternatives to reduce waste. Additionally, the machine could encourage users to recycle clothes by providing tips on how to extend the life of garments or suggesting ways to repurpose old clothes.",
    "**Interactive Laundry Sorting System:** Design an integrated sorting system within the washing machine that can help users sort their laundry automatically based on fabric type, color, or even garment care instructions. This system could use sensors to detect different types of clothing as they are loaded, then adjust the wash settings accordingly to ensure optimal cleaning and preservation of each item. Users would simply need to load their laundry into the machine, and it would handle the rest.",
    "**Personalized Fabric Care Program:** Develop a program that allows users to input specific information about their fabrics, such as material type, brand, and recommended washing instructions. The washing machine would then tailor its cleaning process to suit each fabric, ensuring that delicate items are washed gently while tough stains on more robust materials are treated effectively. This program could also provide users with suggestions for fabric care beyond the washing cycle, such as drying methods, ironing techniques, or storage recommendations, to extend the lifespan of their clothing."
