    "**Memory Foam Neck Roll**: Instead of traditional pillows, you could use a long, cylindrical memory foam neck roll. This roll would be designed to fit perfectly under your neck, providing support while allowing your head to rest comfortably on the mattress. The memory foam would conform to the shape of your neck and head, offering customized support that prevents stiffness and discomfort. It could also be adjustable, allowing you to change its thickness or firmness based on your sleeping position.",
    "**Hammock Headrest**: Picture a small, adjustable hammock that suspends your head above the mattress. This headrest would be made of breathable fabric and would cradle your head while allowing your neck to relax fully. It could be attached to the headboard or the sides of the bed, ensuring that it stays in place. The gentle rocking motion of the hammock could also promote relaxation, making it easier to fall asleep while providing the necessary support.",
    "**Weighted Sleep Mask**: A unique approach to head support could involve a weighted sleep mask that conforms to your forehead and eyes. This mask would be filled with small, soft beads that distribute weight evenly, creating a soothing sensation that encourages relaxation. The mask could also have built-in cooling gel layers to reduce any tension headaches or discomfort while you sleep. By resting your head against the mattress with the mask on, you can achieve a comfortable sleeping position without needing a traditional pillow.",
    "**Ergonomic Head Support Frame**: This innovative idea involves a lightweight, adjustable frame that sits around your head while you sleep. The frame would have soft, cushioned edges that provide gentle support for your head and neck. It could be designed to accommodate different sleeping positions, allowing you to adjust the height and angle for optimal comfort. The frame would be collapsible for easy storage, making it a convenient alternative to traditional pillows.",
    "**Body Pillow U-Shape Cradle**: A large U-shaped body pillow could serve as a versatile alternative to traditional pillows. This body pillow would be designed to wrap around your body, providing support for your head, neck, and back simultaneously. The U-shape allows you to rest your head comfortably while also offering support for your arms and legs, promoting better alignment and reducing pressure points. You could customize the firmness and filling to suit your sleeping preferences."
