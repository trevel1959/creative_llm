    "Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Automation:    This smart power strip would integrate energy monitoring and automation capabilities. It would have a built-in energy meter that tracks and displays the energy consumption of each device plugged into it. Users can set up automation rules to turn off devices when not in use, schedule power on/off times, and receive notifications when devices are drawing excessive power. This smart power strip would be a convenient and efficient way to monitor and manage energy consumption, helping users reduce their energy bills and minimize their carbon footprint.",
    "Portable Power Bank with Built-in Solar Panel:    This portable power bank would come equipped with a built-in solar panel, allowing users to charge their devices on the go using sunlight. The solar panel would be designed to be compact and efficient, making it easy to carry around. The power bank would also have a high-capacity battery, allowing users to store excess energy for later use. This product would be perfect for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, and anyone who needs a reliable power source in remote areas.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Flooring:    This innovative flooring system would harness energy from footsteps and movement to generate electricity. The flooring would be equipped with piezoelectric tiles that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. This energy would be stored in a battery and used to power devices such as lights, security systems, and even small appliances. The energy-harvesting flooring would be a sustainable and eco-friendly way to generate electricity, reducing the need for traditional power sources.",
    "Smart Window with Built-in Solar Panel and Energy Storage:    This smart window would integrate a built-in solar panel that generates electricity from sunlight. The solar panel would be designed to be thin and transparent, allowing users to see outside while still harnessing energy. The window would also come equipped with a built-in energy storage system, allowing users to store excess energy for later use. This smart window would be a game-changer for homes and buildings, providing a sustainable and efficient way to generate electricity.",
    "Energy-Efficient Smart Home Hub with AI-Powered Energy Management:    This smart home hub would integrate AI-powered energy management capabilities, allowing users to monitor and control their energy consumption in real-time. The hub would learn the user's energy usage patterns and provide personalized recommendations to reduce energy waste and optimize energy efficiency. The hub would also integrate with various smart devices, allowing users to control and automate their home's energy usage. This smart home hub would be a convenient and efficient way to manage energy consumption,"
