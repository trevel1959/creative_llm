    "Once in a vibrant meadow, there lived a unicorn named Luna, but she was unlike any other; she had no horn. The other unicorns teased her, claiming she was incomplete. Heartbroken, Luna wandered into the enchanted forest, where she met a wise old owl. “Your magic lies not in your horn, but in your heart,” the owl said. Inspired, Luna began to spread kindness, helping lost animals and healing the sick. Soon, her gentle spirit attracted creatures from all around. The other unicorns, witnessing her extraordinary gift, realized that true magic comes from within. Luna shone brighter than any horned unicorn ever could.",
