    "**Smart Bell with Bluetooth Connectivity**: Develop a bicycle bell that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. This bell could not only ring but also send alerts to the cyclist about nearby pedestrians, vehicles, or obstacles through the app. The app could use the phone's GPS to determine when to ring, enhancing safety by notifying cyclists of high-traffic areas.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bell with LED Lights**: Create a bicycle bell that is powered by solar energy and incorporates LED lights. The bell could have a built-in solar panel that charges during the day. At night or in low-light conditions, the LED lights would illuminate, increasing visibility for the cyclist and providing a visual warning signal to others. The bell could also flash in different colors based on the level of urgency.",
    "**Integrated Voice Alert System**: Design a bicycle bell that features a voice alert system. The bell could have pre-recorded messages like \"On your left!\" or \"Excuse me!\" that can be activated by a button or a voice command. This feature would allow cyclists to communicate more effectively with pedestrians and other cyclists, providing a clearer warning than a traditional bell sound.",
    "**Vibration-Activated Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that activates based on vibrations from the bike's movement. Instead of relying on a manual trigger, this bell would automatically ring when the bike is in motion, particularly useful for hands-free operation. This could be especially beneficial for delivery cyclists or those navigating busy urban environments.",
    "**Customizable Appearance**: Introduce a bicycle bell with customizable skins or covers. Users could purchase different designs, colors, or themes to match their bicycle's aesthetics or their personal style. This would not only enhance the visual appeal of the bell but also allow for seasonal designs, encouraging users to switch out their bell's look throughout the year."
