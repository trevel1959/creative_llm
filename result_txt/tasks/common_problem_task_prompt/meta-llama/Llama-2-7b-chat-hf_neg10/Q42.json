    "Equipment malfunction: Another potential problem that could arise during a large-scale scientific experiment is equipment malfunction. This could result in data loss, delays, or even the failure of the experiment altogether. For example, if the experiment requires specialized equipment that is not functioning properly, it could cause the entire experiment to be delayed or even canceled.",
    "Unexpected changes in the experiment's parameters: A potential problem that could arise during a large-scale scientific experiment is unexpected changes in the experiment's parameters. This could result in the experiment not producing the desired results, or even causing harm to the researchers or the environment. For example, if the experiment involves manipulating a specific variable, and that variable changes unexpectedly, it could affect the validity of the results.",
    "Difficulty in collecting and analyzing data: Another potential problem that could arise during a large-scale scientific experiment is difficulty in collecting and analyzing data. This could result in inaccurate or incomplete data, which could lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions. For example, if the experiment involves collecting data from a large number of sources, it could be difficult to organize and analyze the data in a timely manner.",
    "Conflicts among team members: A potential problem that could arise during a large-scale scientific experiment is conflicts among team members. This could result in delays, mistakes, or even the failure of the experiment altogether. For example, if team members have different opinions on how to conduct the experiment, it could lead to disagreements and delays in decision-making.",
    "Ethical concerns: Another potential problem that could arise during a large-scale scientific experiment is ethical concerns. This could result in the experiment being delayed or even canceled, as well as potential legal and social implications. For example, if the experiment involves working with human subjects, it could raise ethical concerns about informed consent and the potential risks to the subjects."
