    "**Incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Personalized Oral Care**: Design an electric toothbrush that utilizes AI technology to monitor brushing habits, track plaque removal, and provide personalized feedback. The toothbrush could analyze the user's brushing style, such as pressure applied, duration, and frequency, then tailor its recommendations accordingly. It might also use machine learning algorithms to improve over time, suggesting adjustments based on past data.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Monitoring Capabilities**: Develop a toothbrush that can monitor oral health and even detect signs of systemic diseases. This smart toothbrush could be equipped with sensors to check for changes in saliva pH levels, which can indicate potential health issues like diabetes or heart disease. The toothbrush would send this information directly to the user's smartphone or a dedicated app, providing immediate alerts if any abnormalities are detected.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Offer a range of brush heads and attachments that can be swapped out based on the user's specific oral care needs. This could include different bristle textures, colors, and even flavors, allowing users to customize their brushing experience according to personal preferences. For example, a user could choose a softer brush head for sensitive gums or a mint-flavored one for fresh breath.",
    "**Integration with Wearable Devices**: Create an electric toothbrush that syncs with popular wearable devices like Fitbit or Apple Watch. This integration could allow users to track their daily brushing habits within their overall health and fitness apps. Users might receive reminders to brush at recommended intervals throughout the day and get notifications about their progress towards daily brushing goals.",
    "**Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Design**: Design an electric toothbrush that prioritizes sustainability by using biodegradable materials, rechargeable batteries, and packaging made from recycled or biodegradable materials. The brush could also feature a system that encourages recycling, such as offering discounts on future purchases for returned old brushes or batteries. This not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also positions your brand as socially responsible and forward-thinking."
