    "Solar Panel Windows: Develop special windows that can harness solar energy even when the sky is cloudy. These windows would be made of a unique material that can convert light from any angle, including indirect sunlight from cloudy skies, into electricity. This would provide a consistent source of power for homes and buildings, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Build tall towers that can pierce through the clouds to reach the sun. These towers would be equipped with solar panels and would be strategically placed in areas with frequent cloud cover. The towers would use advanced technology to navigate through the clouds and reach the sun's rays, providing a reliable source of energy.",
    "Reflective Satellites: Launch a network of satellites that can reflect sunlight towards the Earth's surface on cloudy days. These satellites would be equipped with mirrors or reflective surfaces that can concentrate sunlight and transmit it back to Earth. This would provide a supplemental source of energy, especially in areas with frequent cloud cover.",
    "Cloud-Based Farms: Develop large-scale farms that can harness the energy from cloudy skies. These farms would use advanced technology to convert water vapor in the clouds into hydroelectric power. The farms would be placed in areas with high humidity and cloud cover, providing a consistent source of energy.",
    "Smart Windows: Create windows that can change their tint and opacity to optimize energy harvesting. These smart windows would use advanced materials and technology to adjust their tint in real-time based on the amount of sunlight available. On cloudy days, the windows would darken to maximize energy absorption, while on sunny days, they would lighten to allow more sunlight to pass through. This would provide a passive source of energy that can supplement traditional solar panels."
