    "Sleep Pods: With no nighttime, people could use sleep pods that mimic the natural sleep-wake cycle. These pods would use advanced technology to simulate the darkness, silence, and temperature conditions of a nighttime environment, allowing people to get a good night's sleep. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Circadian Rhythm Adjustment: In the absence of nighttime, people could adjust their circadian rhythms to mimic the 24-hour day-night cycle. This could be achieved through a combination of light therapy, melatonin supplements, and lifestyle changes. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Sleep Bubbles: People could use specialized sleep bubbles that create a self-contained environment for sleep. These bubbles would be equipped with advanced filtration systems to block out any light and noise, and could be inflated with a special gas mixture to promote relaxation and sleep. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Sleep Cocoons: Sleep cocoons are personal, portable sleep pods that could be worn like a blanket. They would use advanced materials to block out light and noise, and could be programmed to simulate the ideal sleep environment for each individual. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Neurostimulation: In the absence of nighttime, people could use neurostimulation techniques to induce sleep. This could involve using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to stimulate the brain's sleep centers and promote relaxation. Confidence score: 0.9"
