    "Job Displacement: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to job displacement for drivers, particularly for those who depend on driving as their primary source of income. This could result in economic and social distress, as the traditional taxi and ride-sharing industries could be significantly disrupted.",
    "Liability and Responsibility: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining responsibility and liability can be challenging. Traditionally, the driver is responsible for operating the vehicle, but with self-driving cars, it can be difficult to determine if the accident was due to equipment failure, human error (if a human was present), or a programming error. This could lead to complex legal cases and ongoing discussions regarding liability and responsibility.",
    "Security and Privacy Concerns: Self-driving cars are heavily reliant on technology that needs to be updated and maintained. This could lead to potential security and privacy risks, such as hacking, malware, or data breaches, which could compromise the safety and privacy of passengers and their personal data.",
    "Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could require significant changes to urban planning and infrastructure, including investments in charging stations, sensor-ready roads, and updating traffic regulations to accommodate these vehicles. Additionally, cities may need to develop specific lanes or areas for self-driving cars to operate safely, which could lead to disruptions to existing traffic patterns.",
    "Ethical Issues: Self-driving cars also raise ethical concerns, such as the potential to prioritize passenger well-being over pedestrians in emergency situations, or whether it is acceptable for an autonomous car to take a fatal risk to save its passengers. These ethical concerns may lead to policy debates and could delay the widespread adoption of self-driving cars."
