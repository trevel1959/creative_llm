    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Incorporate a small UV-C light within the toothbrush handle that activates after each use to sanitize the bristles. This feature would help eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring that users maintain better oral hygiene. The UV light could be powered by a rechargeable battery, making it both practical and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Multi-Functional Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush that includes interchangeable heads for various purposes, such as a flossing attachment, a tongue scraper, or a gum massager. Users could switch heads depending on their needs, making it a versatile tool for comprehensive oral care. This could also be marketed as a travel-friendly solution, reducing the number of items needed in a dental care kit.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**: Design a toothbrush specifically for children that incorporates gamification elements.
