    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Decorations: Create a stunning and sustainable wedding atmosphere by using recycled materials, such as old family heirlooms, repurposed glass bottles, or dried flowers. Instead of buying new decorations, encourage guests to bring their own vintage items to incorporate into the decor. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique and personal touch to the wedding.",
    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Attire: Design and create sustainable wedding gowns, suits, and accessories using eco-friendly materials such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled fabrics. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the wedding but also creates a trendy and stylish look. Consider renting or borrowing clothing instead of buying new outfits for the wedding party.",
    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Food and Beverage: Serve locally sourced and organic food and drinks at the wedding. Choose caterers who use compostable or biodegradable utensils, plates, and cups. Consider a \"Bring Your Own Wine\" (BYOW) option to reduce waste and encourage guests to bring their own reusable wine bottles.",
    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Transportation: Instead of renting traditional limousines or party buses, opt for eco-friendly transportation options such as electric or hybrid vehicles. Alternatively, encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation to get to the wedding. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also creates a unique and memorable experience for guests.",
    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Favors: Instead of giving traditional wedding favors such as candles or chocolates, give guests eco-friendly alternatives such as seed bombs, tree seedlings, or reusable water bottles. These favors not only reduce waste but also promote sustainability and the environment."
