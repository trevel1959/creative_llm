    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Weather Forecast**: Design a coat rack that not only holds coats but also serves as an interactive weather station. It could display the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions using small LED lights or color-changing panels. For instance, if it's going to rain, the rack might turn blue. This would provide a convenient way for people to know the weather before stepping out.",
    "**Automated Coat Rack with Personalized Greetings**: Implement an automated system that greets guests by name when they place their coat on the rack. The system could be connected to a database of names and greetings, which are personalized based on the user's preferences or past interactions. This would add a touch of warmth and personalization to any home or office space.",
    "**Smart Coat Rack with Voice Commands**: Incorporate voice recognition technology into the coat rack so that users can interact with it through spoken commands. For example, \"Turn off the lights\" or \"Show me the weather forecast\" could be commands that trigger specific actions. This would make the coat rack more user-friendly and adaptable to different environments.",
    "**DIY Modular Coat Rack System**: Offer a kit that allows users to build their own coat racks using eco-friendly materials like reclaimed wood or bamboo. The modular design could include various sections for hanging clothes, storing shoes, or even displaying accessories like hats or scarves. This would appeal to DIY enthusiasts who enjoy customizing their spaces and those who are environmentally conscious.",
    "**Therapeutic Coat Rack with Light Therapy**: Design a coat rack that incorporates light therapy to help combat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or improve mood in general. The rack could have LED lights that emit a specific wavelength of light known to boost serotonin levels. This would not only serve a practical purpose but also contribute to users' well-being. "
