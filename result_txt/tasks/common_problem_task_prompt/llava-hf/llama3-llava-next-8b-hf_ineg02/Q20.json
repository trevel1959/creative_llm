    "Liability: Another concern with self-driving cars is the issue of liability in the event of an accident. Currently, most laws hold the driver of the vehicle responsible for any accidents that occur. However, with self-driving cars, it is unclear who would be held liable for an accident - the manufacturer of the vehicle, the software developer, or the owner of the car.",
    "Cybersecurity: Self-driving cars rely heavily on complex software systems to operate. This means that they are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which could compromise the safety of the vehicle and its passengers.",
    "Privacy concerns: Self-driving cars collect a lot of data about their users, including their driving habits, destination, and other personal information. This raises concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse of this data.",
    "Limited range: Self-driving cars are currently not capable of operating without a human driver for the entire trip. This means that they require a human driver to take over when they encounter situations that are beyond their capabilities, such as driving in remote areas or in adverse weather conditions.",
    "Dependence on technology: Self-driving cars rely heavily on technology to operate, which means that they are susceptible to failures in the technology. This could include issues with the sensors, software, or communication systems, which could lead to accidents or other safety issues."
