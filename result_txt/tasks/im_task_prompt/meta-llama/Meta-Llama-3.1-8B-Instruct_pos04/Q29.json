    "Lawn Mower Drone:  A small, autonomous drone that can fly over lawns and trim grass with precision, reducing the need for traditional lawn mowers. The drone would be equipped with a GPS system, allowing it to navigate and map the lawn, and a high-precision cutting mechanism that can trim grass to a specific height.",
    "Smart Lawn Mower:  A self-propelled, autonomous lawn mower that can be controlled remotely through a mobile app. The mower would be equipped with sensors that detect obstacles, such as rocks or toys, and adjust its path accordingly. It would also have a built-in weather station, allowing it to adjust its cutting pattern based on wind direction and speed.",
    "Robo-Mower:  A robotic lawn mower that uses advanced navigation and mapping technology to create a perfect lawn. The mower would be equipped with a high-resolution camera, allowing it to detect and avoid obstacles, and a advanced cutting system that can trim grass to a specific height and pattern.",
    "Lawn Mower Robot Arm:  A robotic arm that can be attached to a traditional lawn mower, allowing for more precise and efficient cutting. The arm would be equipped with advanced sensors and a high-precision cutting mechanism, allowing it to trim grass in tight spaces and around obstacles.",
    "Autonomous Lawn Mower with AI:  A self-propelled, autonomous lawn mower that uses artificial intelligence to learn and adapt to the user's preferences and lawn conditions. The mower would be equipped with a high-resolution camera, allowing it to detect and avoid obstacles, and a advanced cutting system that can trim grass to a specific height and pattern."
