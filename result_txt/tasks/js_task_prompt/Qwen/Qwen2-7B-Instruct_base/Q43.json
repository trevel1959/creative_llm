    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation:** If you had the ability to see through walls, it could revolutionize crime prevention and investigation. You could scan entire buildings or areas for evidence that's not visible from the outside. For instance, if a crime was committed in a locked room, you could quickly check inside without breaking down doors or windows. This could help in gathering crucial evidence faster and solving cases quicker.",
    "**Building Inspection and Maintenance:** Architects, engineers, and maintenance staff could benefit greatly from being able to see through walls. They could conduct inspections of buildings without needing to physically enter each room. This would save time and potentially detect issues like structural problems, water leaks, or electrical hazards that might be hidden behind walls.",
    "**Historical Research:** Historians and archaeologists could use this ability to uncover hidden historical sites or artifacts. By seeing through walls, they could explore the interiors of buildings without damaging them, revealing details about past lives, industries, or architectural designs that are not visible on the surface. This could lead to new discoveries in history and archaeology.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment:** In the medical field, doctors and surgeons could potentially visualize organs and tissues that are typically obscured by skin and muscles. This could aid in diagnosing diseases more accurately and planning surgeries with greater precision. It might also allow for non-invasive procedures where internal structures need to be examined.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring and Conservation:** Environmental scientists could use this power to monitor habitats, ecosystems, or pollution sources that are inaccessible or hidden. For example, they could see through forested areas to assess damage caused by invasive species or illegal logging, or detect underground water contamination that isn't visible on the surface. This could aid in conservation efforts and environmental protection."
