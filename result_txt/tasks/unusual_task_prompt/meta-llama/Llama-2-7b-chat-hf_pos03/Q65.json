    "Virtual Wardrobe: Create a virtual wardrobe feature that allows users to upload images of their clothing items and create a digital inventory. Users can browse through their virtual closet, sort items by category, and even create virtual outfits. This feature would be especially useful for those who have a hard time organizing their physical closet or for those who want to try out new outfits without having to physically change clothes.",
    "AI-Powered Style Recommendations: Implement an AI-powered recommendation system that suggests new clothing items based on the user's purchase history and preferences. The system could analyze the user's past purchases, browsing history, and search queries to provide personalized recommendations. For example, if a user frequently purchases items from a particular brand or category, the system could suggest similar items or complementary pieces.",
    "Personalized Product Recommendations: Create a feature that uses machine learning algorithms to provide personalized product recommendations based on the user's preferences, such as clothing size, style, and budget. The system could analyze user data, such as search queries, browsing history, and purchase history, to suggest products that are tailored to the user's preferences.",
    "Augmented Reality Try-On: Develop an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows users to try on virtual clothing items in real-time. Users can select an item they are interested in and see how it would look on them without having to physically change clothes. This feature would be especially useful for those who want to try out different styles or for those who are shopping from the comfort of their own home.",
    "Social Sharing and Inspiration: Create a feature that allows users to share their shopping cart with friends or family members for feedback and inspiration. Users can share their cart with others and receive recommendations or suggestions for items they may like. This feature would be especially useful for those who are shopping for gifts or for those who want to get a second opinion on their purchases."
