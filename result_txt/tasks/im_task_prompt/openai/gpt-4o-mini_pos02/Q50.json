    "**Modular Components**: Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, a smartphone could be designed with modular components that allow users to customize their device according to their needs. Users could easily swap out parts like the camera, battery, or even the processor. This would enable tech enthusiasts to upgrade their phones incrementally without having to purchase an entirely new device, reducing electronic waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Building on the current trend of health and fitness tracking, smartphones could incorporate advanced biometric sensors capable of monitoring various health metrics such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and hydration. With the ability to connect to health services and provide real-time feedback, this feature could empower users to manage their health proactively and alert them to potential issues before they escalate.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: A smartphone that utilizes augmented reality to enhance everyday tasks could revolutionize how we interact with our devices. Imagine a phone that, when pointed at a recipe book, overlays cooking instructions directly onto the page or allows users to visualize furniture in their homes before purchasing. This AR interface could be controlled through gestures, providing a hands-free experience that integrates seamlessly with daily life.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Instead of a generic virtual assistant, each smartphone could feature a customizable AI that learns from the user’s habits, preferences, and personality. This assistant would not only manage tasks and schedules but also adapt its communication style and suggestions based on the user's mood and current context, creating a more engaging and intuitive interaction.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Charging Solutions**: To address the growing concern over battery waste and environmental impact, smartphones could come with solar panels embedded in their design or utilize kinetic energy from the user’s movements to recharge. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional charging methods but also encourage users to think about their energy consumption and environmental footprint."
