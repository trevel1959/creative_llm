    "**Static Electricity Damage**: While assembling a computer, there's a risk of damaging sensitive components due to static electricity. This is particularly true for parts like the CPU and RAM, which can be easily affected by electrostatic discharge (ESD). To mitigate this risk, it's essential to use an anti-static wrist strap, work on a non-static surface, and handle components carefully.",
    "**Cooling and Airflow Problems**: An often overlooked aspect of building a computer is the cooling system. If the CPU or GPU is not adequately cooled, it can lead to overheating, resulting in thermal throttling or permanent damage. It's crucial to choose the right cooling solution (air or liquid) and to ensure that there is proper airflow within the case. Additionally, poor cable management can obstruct airflow, leading to increased temperatures.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: Selecting the right power supply unit (PSU) is critical. A PSU that does not provide enough power can cause instability, crashes, or failure to boot. Conversely, an overpowered PSU might not be efficient, leading to higher electricity bills. Additionally, the quality of the PSU matters; a cheap, low-quality PSU can fail and potentially damage other components.",
    "**Software and Driver Installation Challenges**: After assembling the hardware, the next step is installing the operating system and drivers. New builders may encounter issues with BIOS settings, boot order, or recognizing the hard drive. Furthermore, drivers for certain components may not be readily available or compatible, leading to functionality issues with hardware like the graphics card or peripherals.",
    "**Cable Management Problems**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered case, which not only looks unappealing but can also affect airflow and cooling efficiency. New builders may struggle with routing cables neatly, leading to a mess that can obstruct fans and increase the risk of overheating. Learning to use cable ties, Velcro straps, and other organization tools can help mitigate this issue."
