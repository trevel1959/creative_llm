    "**Tree Communities**: Trees could form communities and migrate to areas with more favorable conditions, such as better soil quality or more abundant water sources. This would allow them to adapt more quickly to environmental changes and potentially outcompete invasive species. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Urban Forestry Transformation**: In cities, trees could become mobile, allowing urban planners to strategically place them for maximum benefit in terms of air purification, noise reduction, and shade provision. They could also be moved to replace damaged or diseased trees more efficiently. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Forest Fire Mitigation**: With the ability to walk, trees could potentially escape forest fires by moving away from the fire front, which might reduce the spread and intensity of wildfires. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Ecosystem Engineering**: Trees could reshape landscapes by moving rocks, creating new paths, and altering terrain. This could lead to new habitats and influence local ecosystems in unforeseen ways. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Climate Change Adaptation**: Trees could migrate towards cooler climates as global temperatures rise, helping to preserve biodiversity and maintain ecological balance. This could potentially offset some effects of climate change. Confidence Score: 0.85"
