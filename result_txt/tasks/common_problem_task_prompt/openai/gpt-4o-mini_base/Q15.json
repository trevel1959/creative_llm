    "**Pest Infestation**: Gardens can attract various pests that may damage plants. Instead of using chemical pesticides, which can harm beneficial insects, gardeners could create a companion planting strategy. This involves planting certain plants together that naturally repel pests, such as marigolds with tomatoes. Furthermore, installing insect hotels can attract beneficial pollinators and predators to control pest populations naturally.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Over or under-watering can be detrimental to a garden's health. To address this, gardeners could implement a rainwater collection system using barrels. This not only conserves water but also provides a sustainable watering source. Additionally, incorporating moisture-retaining mulch around plants can help regulate soil moisture levels and reduce evaporation.",
    "**Seasonal Planting Timing**: Planting at the wrong time of year can lead to poor growth or crop failure. To combat this, a gardener could create a planting calendar specific to their local climate, using an app that provides reminders for optimal planting times based on frost dates and seasonal changes. This could be complemented by starting seeds indoors to get a head start on the growing season.",
    "**Space Management**: Limited backyard space can restrict the variety of plants that can be grown. A vertical gardening system could be introduced, utilizing wall planters or hanging pots to maximize space. Additionally, implementing a tiered garden design can allow for a diverse range of plants to flourish without overcrowding.",
    "**Wildlife Encroachment**: Local wildlife, such as deer or rabbits, may view the garden as a buffet. To protect plants, gardeners could design a decorative yet functional fence using repurposed materials like pallets or bamboo. Incorporating plants that are unappealing to wildlife, such as thorny bushes or aromatic herbs, can also deter animals from entering the garden."
