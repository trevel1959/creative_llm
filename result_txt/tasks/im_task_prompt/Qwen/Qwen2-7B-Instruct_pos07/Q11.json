    "**Water Bottle Garden**: Design a water bottle into a small garden. The top of the bottle can be cut off to create a small potting area. The neck can serve as a watering device or a place to attach a small solar panel for plant growth lights. This idea is perfect for those with limited space who want to grow their own herbs or plants.",
