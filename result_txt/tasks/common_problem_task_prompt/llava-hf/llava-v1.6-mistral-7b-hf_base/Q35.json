    "Conservation: Another issue that zoos face is the need to contribute to conservation efforts. Many zoos participate in breeding programs to help endangered species, but these programs can be costly and require a significant amount of resources.",
    "Public Education: Zoos play a vital role in educating the public about animals and their habitats. However, this can be challenging as visitors may not always understand the importance of conservation or the need to protect animals in the wild.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Zoos also face ethical concerns regarding the treatment of animals in captivity. Some argue that it is inhumane to keep animals in captivity for entertainment purposes.",
    "Financial Challenges: Running a zoo can be expensive, and many zoos struggle to generate enough revenue to cover their costs. This can lead to a lack of funding for animal care, conservation efforts, and education programs.",
    "Disease Outbreaks: Zoos can also be breeding grounds for disease outbreaks among animals, which can be challenging to contain and can have serious consequences for both the animals and staff."
