    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a hair dryer with a self-cleaning function that utilizes a built-in filtration system to capture hair and dust particles. When activated, the dryer would use a reverse airflow system to expel trapped debris, ensuring that the device remains clean and maintains optimal performance over time. This feature would reduce maintenance efforts and prolong the life of the hair dryer.",
    "**Multi-Function Styling Attachments**: Create a series of interchangeable attachments that not only dry hair but also style it simultaneously. For instance, a diffuser attachment could be combined with a curling wand or straightening plate that heats up as the hair dries. This would allow users to achieve their desired hairstyle in one step, saving time and reducing the need for multiple styling tools.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a hair dryer made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and biodegradable components. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption while maintaining high performance. This eco-friendly design could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in personal care products.",
    "**Personalized Drying Modes**: Introduce a hair dryer that learns from user preferences and hair characteristics over time. By utilizing AI and machine learning, the device could create personalized drying modes based on previous usage patterns, adjusting settings for different hair types, styles, and even the time of day (e.g., faster drying in the morning rush and gentler drying at night).",
    "**Built-in Ionic Generator**: Enhance the hair dryer with a built-in ionic generator that releases negative ions during the drying process. This feature would help reduce frizz, enhance shine, and promote healthier-looking hair by neutralizing static. Users could have the option to toggle this feature on or off, depending on their hair's specific needs."
