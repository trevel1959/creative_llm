    "**Garden Art or Sculpture**: Instead of discarding old bricks, consider using them to create unique garden art. Stack and arrange them in various configurations to form whimsical sculptures or even a small brick tower. You can also carve designs into the bricks or paint them to add a splash of color to your garden.",
    "**Doorstop**: A brick makes for an effective doorstop, keeping doors open or preventing them from slamming shut. This is especially useful in windy areas or during gatherings when you want to keep doors propped open for ventilation. You can personalize it with fabric or paint to blend with your interior.",
    "**Fireplace Base for Grilling**: If you enjoy outdoor grilling, you can use bricks to create a stable base for a portable grill. Arrange the bricks in a square or rectangle to elevate the grill off the ground, providing better heat circulation and preventing the grill from tipping over. This also allows for better airflow for charcoal or wood.",
    "**Weight for a DIY Catapult**: For a fun science project or backyard game, use a brick as the weight in a homemade catapult. By attaching it to a lever system, you can create a simple device to launch lightweight objects, such as marshmallows or small balls, for entertainment or educational purposes.",
    "**Plant Holder or Planter**: Create a unique planter by hollowing out a brick or stacking multiple bricks to form a small vertical garden. Fill the hollowed-out section with soil and plant herbs, succulents, or small flowers. This can add a rustic charm to your patio or balcony while providing a functional planting space."
