    "Create a network of underground pollinators: One idea is to create a network of underground pollinators, such as earthworms, ants, or even microorganisms like bacteria, to transfer pollen between plants. This could be achieved by genetically engineering these organisms to carry pollen or by creating specialized structures within their bodies to store and transport pollen. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Solar-powered pollination drones: Another idea is to develop small, solar-powered drones that can fly between plants and transfer pollen using specialized pollen collection and transfer mechanisms. These drones could be programmed to fly between specific plants and could be powered by solar panels or even harness the energy from the sun directly. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Pollination-enhancing clothing: A third idea is to create specialized clothing that can enhance pollination by providing a surface for pollen collection and transfer. For example, a set of clothes with built-in pollen collection bags or a specialized pollen-collecting hat could be designed to help pollinators gather and transfer pollen more efficiently. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Artificial pollen factories: An innovative solution could be to create artificial pollen factories that can produce pollen artificially. This could involve using biotechnology to create pollen in a controlled environment and then distributing it to plants through a network of distribution centers. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bio-inspired pollination robots: A final idea is to develop robots that mimic the behavior of natural pollinators, such as bees or butterflies. These robots could be designed to collect and transfer pollen between plants, using advanced sensors and navigation systems to navigate between flowers. Confidence Score: 0.9"
