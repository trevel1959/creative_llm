    "Use a Personal Glider: A personal glider is a small, lightweight, and portable aircraft that can be used to travel short distances. With no elevators available, a personal glider could be a viable option for reaching the top of a skyscraper. The glider could be launched from the ground floor and flown upwards, allowing the user to reach the top of the building with ease.",
    "Create a Rappelling System: Rappelling is a technique used to descend a vertical surface using a rope. By creating a rappelling system, individuals could descend the side of the skyscraper, using the rope to slow their descent and ensure a safe landing at the bottom. Once at the bottom, the individual could then make their way back up the building using the elevators or a different means of transportation.",
    "Utilize a Magnetic Levitation System: Magnetic levitation, or maglev, is a technology that uses magnetic fields to suspend objects in mid-air. By creating a maglev system that can transport individuals from the ground floor to the top of the skyscraper, individuals could bypass the lack of functioning elevators. The maglev system would use magnetic fields to levitate the passengers and transport them to the top of the building.",
    "Build a makeshift Escalator: An escalator is a conveyor belt with steps that moves people or goods from one floor to another. By building a makeshift escalator using materials such as wood, metal, and rope, individuals could climb the skyscraper without the need for elevators. The escalator could be constructed in sections, with each section leading to the next floor until the top of the building is reached.",
    "Create a Human-Powered Elevator: A human-powered elevator is a device that uses human energy to lift people or goods between floors. By building a human-powered elevator, individuals could still access the top of the skyscraper even without functioning elevators. The elevator could be designed with a series of pulleys and cables that are powered by individuals using hand cranks or bicycle-like pedals. As more people work together, the elevator could reach higher and higher floors until the top of the building is reached."
