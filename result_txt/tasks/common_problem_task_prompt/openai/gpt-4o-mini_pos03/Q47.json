    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When handling sensitive electronic components, static electricity can pose a significant risk. A small static discharge can damage critical parts like the CPU or RAM. To avoid this, builders should use anti-static wrist straps, work on non-static surfaces, and regularly ground themselves by touching a metal object before handling components.",
    "**Overheating Problems**: If the cooling system is not adequate, the computer may overheat, leading to performance issues or hardware damage. This can occur if the CPU cooler is improperly installed or if there is insufficient airflow in the case. To prevent overheating, builders should ensure proper installation of cooling solutions, consider additional case fans, and monitor temperatures with software tools.",
    "**Cable Management Nightmares**: Poor cable management can lead to airflow restrictions and make troubleshooting difficult. It can also create an unsightly appearance. Builders should plan their cable routes before installation, use cable ties or Velcro straps to bundle cables, and ensure that cables do not obstruct fans or airflow paths.",
    "**Software Installation and Driver Issues**: After assembling the hardware, installing the operating system and drivers can lead to problems if not done correctly. Incompatibility between the OS and certain hardware components can result in system instability. To address this, builders should ensure they have the latest drivers downloaded, use reliable installation media, and check for compatibility with the chosen operating system before starting the installation process.",
    "**BIOS Configuration Challenges**: Upon first boot, users may encounter issues related to BIOS settings, such as incorrect boot order or hardware not being recognized. This can lead to confusion and frustration. To overcome this, builders should familiarize themselves with the BIOS interface and settings, consult the motherboard manual for guidance, and be prepared to reset the BIOS if necessary."
