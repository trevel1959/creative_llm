    "**Coffee-Infused Lip Balm**: Use your coffee grinder to grind coffee beans into a fine powder. This powder can then be mixed with beeswax, coconut oil, shea butter, and essential oils to create a nourishing lip balm.

This syrup can be used to add a unique flavor profile to cocktails, enhancing the taste without overpowering it.",
