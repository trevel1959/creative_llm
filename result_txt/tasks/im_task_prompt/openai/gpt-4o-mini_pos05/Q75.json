    "**Interchangeable Plates**: Design the toaster with interchangeable plates that can create different sandwich styles, such as paninis, grilled cheese, or even waffle sandwiches. Users could simply swap out the plates to suit their mood or dietary needs, allowing for more versatility and creativity in sandwich-making.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a small compartment for storing common sandwich ingredients like cheese, tomatoes, or spreads. The toaster could dispense these ingredients automatically into the sandwich before toasting, ensuring an even distribution and reducing mess in the kitchen. This feature could also help with portion control and ingredient management.",
    "**Multi-layer Cooking Capability**: Create a toaster that allows for multi-layer sandwiches, where users can stack ingredients vertically. The toaster would have adjustable height settings to accommodate different sandwich thicknesses and ensure even toasting throughout. This could also include a feature to toast the top layer while keeping the bottom layer warm.",
    "**Customizable Toasting Patterns**: Introduce a feature that allows users to customize the toasting patterns on their sandwiches. By using a simple interface, users could select from various designs, such as hearts, stars, or even initials, which would be imprinted onto the bread as it toasts. This would add a fun and personal touch, especially for special occasions.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Function**: Develop a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes steam and high heat to sanitize the interior of the toaster after use. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning, making it more convenient for users and ensuring that the appliance remains hygienic. A simple button press could initiate the cleaning cycle."
