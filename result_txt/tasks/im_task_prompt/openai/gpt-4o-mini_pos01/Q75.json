    "**Multi-Layered Toasting Capability**: Design a sandwich toaster with adjustable shelves that can accommodate multiple layers of sandwiches at once. This would allow users to make club sandwiches or multiple sandwiches simultaneously without sacrificing quality. Each layer could be equipped with its own heating element to ensure even toasting.",
    "**Built-In Ingredient Dispenser**: Create a toaster with a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add fillings like cheese, sauces, or vegetables directly into the sandwich while it's toasting. This would eliminate the mess of preparing sandwiches separately and make it easier to create gourmet sandwiches on the fly.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam or a special cleaning cycle to clean the interior surfaces of the toaster after use. This would save users time and effort in maintaining their appliance and ensure that their sandwiches are always free from residue or burnt bits.",
    "**Customizable Plate Designs**: Offer interchangeable non-stick plates with various designs, such as grill marks, patterns, or shapes. This would allow users to create fun and visually appealing sandwiches, perfect for parties or family gatherings. Plates could also be designed for different types of sandwiches, such as paninis or waffles.",
    "**Integrated Recipe Book and Timer**: Embed a digital recipe book with a timer on the toaster itself, providing users with step-by-step instructions for various sandwich recipes. The timer would alert users when their sandwich is done, ensuring they never overcook. This feature could include a library of user-submitted recipes for a community-driven approach."
