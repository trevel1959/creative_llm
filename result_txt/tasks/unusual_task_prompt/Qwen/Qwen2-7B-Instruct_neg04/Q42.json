    "**Glove Garden** - Design a glove that doubles as a garden tool. The glove can be equipped with small, retractable claws or tines on the fingertips. This would allow users to easily plant, transplant, or weed their garden without having to switch between gloves and tools. It could be especially beneficial for those with arthritis or limited hand mobility.",
    "**Smart Glove for Sign Language Translation** - Create a glove that can translate sign language into text or speech in real-time. Each finger would have sensors that detect movement and orientation. Using AI algorithms, the glove would interpret these movements as specific signs and translate them into a language understood by others. This could greatly facilitate communication for deaf individuals and their hearing counterparts.",
    "**Thermal Glove for Outdoor Activities** - Develop a glove that incorporates heating elements in the palm and fingers, powered by a small battery. This would provide warmth during cold outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, or fishing. The glove could also have a temperature control feature to allow users to adjust the heat according to their needs. ",
    "**Invisible Glove for Virtual Reality** - Design a glove that uses haptic feedback technology to simulate touch sensations in virtual reality environments. This could enhance VR experiences by providing users with a sense of touch, making games, simulations, and educational tools more immersive and engaging. The glove could have sensors that track hand movement and apply vibrations or pressure at specific points to mimic different textures and objects.",
    "**Reflective Glove for Safety** - Create a glove that enhances visibility in low-light conditions, particularly for workers in construction, traffic control, or any outdoor work environment. The glove could be made of reflective materials, with additional LED lights integrated into the fingers or back of the hand. This would help keep the wearer visible to vehicles and other people, reducing the risk of accidents."
