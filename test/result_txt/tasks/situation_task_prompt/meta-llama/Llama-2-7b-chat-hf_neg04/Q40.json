    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These solar-powered batteries would use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "Wave Power: Develop a device that harnesses the power of ocean waves to generate electricity. This device could be placed underwater or on the shore and would use the up-and-down motion of the waves to generate electricity.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Create a new type of battery that stores thermal energy instead of chemical energy. This battery would use a phase-change material to store thermal energy, which could then be used to power devices.",
    "Wind-Powered Generators: Develop a small, portable wind turbine that could be used to generate electricity for devices. These turbines could be used in a variety of settings, from homes to cars to campsites.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Create a new type of battery that uses organic materials to generate electricity. These bio-batteries could be made from plant-based materials and could be biodegradable, making them a more sustainable option for powering devices."
