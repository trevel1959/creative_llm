    "**Modular Backpack System**: Create a backpack with detachable compartments that can be customized based on the user’s needs. For instance, users could attach a cooler section for food, a tech pouch for electronics, or a gym compartment for workout gear. This modular approach allows for versatility and personalization, making it suitable for various activities like travel, school, or hiking.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Fit**: Develop a backpack that uses smart fabric and adjustable straps to conform to the user’s body shape and size, providing maximum comfort and support. This backpack could feature built-in sensors that detect the weight distribution and adjust the straps accordingly to reduce strain on the back and shoulders, promoting better posture and reducing fatigue.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Recyclable Components**: Introduce a line of backpacks made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles and discarded fabrics. Additionally, design the backpack so that its components can be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of its life cycle. This initiative not only reduces environmental impact but also raises awareness about sustainability among users.",
    "**Backpack with Built-in Safety Features**: Create a backpack that incorporates reflective strips for visibility during nighttime travel and a built-in alarm system that can be activated in case of emergencies. This could include a panic button that sends a distress signal to pre-selected contacts or local authorities, enhancing safety for students and commuters alike.",
    "**Interactive Backpack with Learning Tools**: Design a backpack aimed at students that includes an integrated tablet holder with educational apps and interactive features. The backpack could also have pockets for storing educational materials like flashcards, and a built-in whiteboard for jotting down notes or reminders. This backpack would serve as a mobile learning hub, encouraging creativity and engagement in education."
