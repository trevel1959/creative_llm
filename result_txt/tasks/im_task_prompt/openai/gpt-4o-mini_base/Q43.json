    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and high temperatures to sanitize the oven's interior. This could work similarly to a dishwasher's cleaning cycle, breaking down food particles and grease without the need for harsh chemicals, making maintenance easier and more environmentally friendly.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cooking Modes**: Introduce a range of cooking modes beyond baking and broiling, such as air frying, dehydrating, or sous-vide. Users could select a mode based on their cooking needs, allowing for more versatility in meal preparation and reducing the need for multiple appliances.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Assistant**: Create an integrated touchscreen display that provides step-by-step cooking instructions and videos. Users can select recipes from a built-in library or sync with their smartphones to access their favorite recipes. The oven could automatically adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the selected recipe.",
    "**Voice Activation and Control**: Implement voice recognition technology that allows users to control the oven hands-free. This feature would enable users to preheat the oven, set timers, and adjust temperatures using simple voice commands, making it more convenient when hands are busy with food preparation.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Features**: Design an oven that incorporates energy-saving technology, such as a heat recovery system that reuses hot air during cooking, or an automatic shut-off feature that powers down the oven after a set period of inactivity. This would reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills while being eco-friendly."
