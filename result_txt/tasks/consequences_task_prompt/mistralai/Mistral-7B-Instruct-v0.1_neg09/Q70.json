    "The universe would be plunged into darkness: If the speed of light was reduced by half, the universe would be plunged into darkness. Light travels at a speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. If it were reduced to half, it would only travel at 149,896 kilometers per second. This would mean that the light from distant stars and galaxies would take twice as long to reach us, and we would not be able to see them.",
    "Time dilation would occur: If the speed of light was reduced by half, time dilation would occur. This means that time would pass more slowly for objects that are moving slower than the speed of light. For example, if a spaceship was traveling at half the speed of light and a person on Earth observed a clock on the spaceship, they would see that time was passing more slowly for the person on the spaceship.",
    "Gravity would be affected: If the speed of light was reduced by half, gravity would be affected. This is because gravity is a force that is caused by the curvature of space-time. If the speed of light was reduced, the curvature of space-time would be altered, which would affect gravity.",
    "Electromagnetic radiation would be affected: If the speed of light was reduced by half, electromagnetic radiation would be affected. This is because electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light. If the speed of light was reduced, electromagnetic radiation would travel at half the speed, which would affect its properties.",
    "The speed of sound would be affected: If the speed of light was reduced by half, the speed of sound would be affected. This is because sound travels at a speed that is less than the speed of light. If the speed of light was reduced, the speed of sound would also be reduced, which would affect the way we hear things."
