    "The Telling Stone: Create a large, flat stone that changes color based on the time of day. The stone could be placed in a public space, and people could use it to tell the time by observing the color shift. For example, if the stone is blue in the morning, it means it's time for breakfast, and if it's red in the evening, it's time for dinner.",
    "The Whistling Tree: Plant a tree with branches that emit different whistle tones at specific times of the day. For instance, a high-pitched whistle could signal morning, a medium-pitched whistle could be noon, and a low-pitched whistle could indicate evening. People could learn the different whistle tones and use them to tell time.",
    "The Sun Dial: Create a sundial that uses the position of the sun to indicate time. The sundial could be placed in a public space, and people could use it to tell the time by observing the shadow of a vertical stick or object. For example, if the shadow is long, it's morning, and if it's short, it's evening.",
    "The Rhythmic River: Create a river that flows in a rhythmic pattern, with different sections of the river representing different times of the day. For instance, a fast-moving section could represent morning, a slower section could be noon, and a calm section could indicate evening. People could use the rhythm of the river to tell time.",
    "The Chime of Nature: Create a series of chimes that play different tunes at specific times of the day. For example, a chime could play a morning melody at sunrise, a noon melody at midday, and an evening melody at sunset. People could learn the different melodies and use them to tell time."
