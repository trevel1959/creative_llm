    "**Regenerative Economy Shift**: With the ability to regenerate limbs, the concept of body parts as a consumable resource would be turned on its head. The medical industry would need to adapt to a new paradigm, where the focus shifts from replacing lost limbs to preserving and regenerating existing ones. This could lead to a significant reduction in medical costs and a shift in the way we approach healthcare. Companies that currently profit from prosthetics and implants would need to innovate and find new ways to stay relevant. On the other hand, the demand for advanced regenerative technologies could create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and researchers.",
    "**Social and Cultural Implications**: Regenerating limbs would likely lead to a significant shift in societal attitudes towards body image and self-perception. People would no longer be defined by their physical appearance, and the concept of beauty and attractiveness would need to be reevaluated. This could lead to a more accepting and inclusive society, where people are valued for their inner qualities rather than their physical appearance. However, it could also lead to new forms of body dysmorphia and a focus on \"improving\" one's body through regenerative means.",
    "**Evolutionary Consequences**: If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, it would likely lead to a significant shift in the human evolutionary trajectory. The selective pressure to maintain and protect existing limbs would be reduced, and the human body would likely adapt to prioritize regeneration and repair over traditional forms of growth and development. This could lead to new forms of human evolution, where the body is optimized for regeneration and resilience rather than traditional forms of strength and agility.",
    "**Ethical and Moral Dilemmas**: Regenerating limbs would raise a host of ethical and moral questions. For example, would it be acceptable to use regenerative technologies to enhance physical abilities beyond what is considered \"natural\"? Would it be fair to prioritize regenerative treatments for certain individuals over others, based on factors such as wealth or social status? These questions would need to be addressed through a combination of scientific, philosophical, and societal discourse.",
    "**New Forms of Art and Expression**: Regenerating limbs would open up new possibilities for artistic expression and innovation. Artists and designers would need to adapt to a new reality where the human body is no longer a fixed and static entity. This could lead to new forms of performance art, where the body is used as a canvas for regeneration and transformation. It could also lead to new forms of fashion and design, where clothing and accessories are designed to accommodate"
