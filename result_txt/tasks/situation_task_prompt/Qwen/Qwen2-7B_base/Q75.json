    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: While the idea of solar-powered airplanes may be more futuristic, there are already solar-powered cars emerging on the market. Solar cells are installed on the car's roof, and the energy generated is stored in the car's battery. This power can then be used to run the vehicle's electrical systems, including the motor.",
    "Electric Buses: Electric buses have been around for a while, but with the widespread adoption of electric cars, there is now more focus on electric buses as a solution for public transportation. With a long battery range, electric buses can be recharged at charging stations, and they produce zero emissions, reducing air pollution and making them an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional buses.",
    "Electric Water Buses: Many waterfront cities already have water bus services in place. With the addition of electric motors, these water buses can be powered by electricity generated from renewable sources, such as hydropower or solar power. This is a promising solution for cities looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make their transportation systems more sustainable.",
    "Electric Scooters: Electric scooters are becoming more popular as an alternative to traditional two-wheelers. With a battery-powered motor, electric scooters can travel for extended periods before needing to be recharged. As cities introduce regulations to limit the number of scooters in use, it is likely that more people will turn to electric scooters as a convenient form of transportation.",
    "Electric Trains: Electric trains have been around for a long time, but with the advent of high-speed trains, they are becoming more popular as an eco-friendly alternative to planes and cars. These trains are designed to be energy-efficient and produce minimal emissions, making them a promising solution for long-distance travel."
