    "**Modular Design**: Create a laptop with a fully modular design, allowing users to easily swap out components like the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage. This would not only enable users to upgrade their laptops over time without needing to purchase a new device but also facilitate repairs, reducing electronic waste. The modular parts could be standardized across brands to promote compatibility.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop a laptop that includes built-in health monitoring sensors that track the user’s posture, heart rate, and stress levels while working. The laptop could provide real-time feedback and suggestions for breaks, stretches, or adjustments to improve ergonomics and overall well-being. This could be paired with an app that offers personalized wellness tips based on the user’s data.",
    "**Smart Cooling System**: Innovate a smart cooling system that uses AI to monitor the laptop's temperature and adjust the fan speed or activate heat-dissipating materials dynamically. This system could also include a silent mode that minimizes noise during low-intensity tasks and an efficient mode that maximizes cooling during high-performance tasks, ensuring optimal performance without overheating.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity Hub**: Design a laptop that serves as a connectivity hub for multiple devices. It could feature advanced wireless technologies such as ultra-wideband (UWB) to connect and manage devices like smartphones, tablets, and smart home gadgets seamlessly. Users could control their smart devices directly from the laptop, creating a centralized control center for their digital lives.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Sources**: Create a laptop made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and metals, along with an integrated solar panel on the lid to harness solar energy. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of laptop production but also provide users with a renewable energy source for charging the device in outdoor settings, promoting eco-friendliness."
