    "Rolling on the ground: If I could no longer stand up, I would move around by rolling on the ground. This would allow me to navigate through my environment while still being able to maintain my balance and control over my movements.",
    "Using my arms: I could use my arms to propel myself forward, similar to how a quadrupedal animal would move. I could push off the ground with my arms and use my body weight to glide forward.",
    "Using a mobility device: I could use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or crutches to move around. This would allow me to maintain my independence and still be able to navigate through my environment with ease.",
    "Using my legs: I could use my legs to move around, but instead of standing up, I would crawl on my hands and knees. This would allow me to maintain my balance and control over my movements while still being able to move around effectively.",
    "Using a robot: I could use a robot to move around for me. The robot could be programmed to navigate through my environment and perform tasks for me, such as picking up objects or opening doors. This would allow me to maintain my independence and still be able to move around effectively."
