With the delete button pressed, people would feel more confident and adventurous, taking risks and pursuing their passions without the burden of fear holding them back.",

    "Jealousy: Jealousy is a toxic emotion that can consume our thoughts and actions, causing us to become fixated on what others have rather than appreciating what we have.

    "Guilt: Guilt is a heavy burden that can weigh us down and prevent us from moving forward. A world without guilt would be more freeing, as people would be able to make amends and move on from past mistakes without feeling guilty about them.",
    "Regret: Regret is a painful emotion that can make us feel like we've missed out on something important. A world without regret would be more present-focused, as people would be more likely to seize the moment and make the most of their time rather than dwelling on what could have been."
