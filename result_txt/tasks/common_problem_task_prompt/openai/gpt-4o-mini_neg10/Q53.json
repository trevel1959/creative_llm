    "**Pacing Issues**: Maintaining the right pace throughout the screenplay is crucial. A story that moves too slowly may lose the audience's interest, while a story that rushes through key moments may leave viewers confused or unsatisfied. To tackle this, use a mix of tension-building scenes and quieter, character-driven moments to balance the pacing. Regularly evaluate the flow of the script by reading it aloud or seeking feedback from peers.",
    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay evolves, it’s easy to overlook plot holes or inconsistencies that can undermine the story’s credibility. This can frustrate viewers and detract from their overall experience. To prevent this, create a detailed outline before writing, keep track of character actions and motivations, and conduct thorough revisions to ensure that all plot points are logically connected.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing dialogue that feels genuine and true to each character can be a significant challenge. If the dialogue sounds forced or unnatural, it can pull the audience out of the story. To enhance authenticity, study real conversations, pay attention to speech patterns, and allow characters to have distinct voices. Conducting read-throughs can also help identify any awkward or stilted lines.",
    "**Genre Expectations**: Different genres have specific conventions and audience expectations. Straying too far from these norms can confuse viewers or result in a film that feels disjointed. To navigate this, research the genre you’re working in, analyze successful films within that genre, and ensure your screenplay adheres to or thoughtfully subverts those conventions in a way that feels cohesive.",
    "**Theme Integration**: A screenplay often carries underlying themes that give the story depth and meaning. However, if these themes are not woven seamlessly into the narrative, they can feel tacked on or superficial. To effectively integrate themes, consider how each character’s journey reflects the overarching message and use symbolism and motifs throughout the screenplay to reinforce these ideas."
