    "**Adaptive Screen Technology**: Introduce a television that can adapt its screen size based on the room's dimensions and the number of viewers. Using advanced sensors, the TV could expand or contract its display, ensuring that everyone in the room has an optimal viewing experience. This would be especially beneficial for households that host gatherings or have variable seating arrangements, allowing for a more flexible and immersive experience.",
    "**Mood-Based Content Recommendations**: Create a smart TV that uses biometric sensors (like heart rate monitors or facial recognition) to assess the viewer's mood and recommend content accordingly. For example, if the viewer appears stressed, the TV might suggest a calming nature documentary or a light-hearted comedy. This feature would personalize the viewing experience and promote mental well-being through tailored content.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a television made from sustainable materials and equipped with energy-efficient technologies. This TV could have a solar panel option to harness renewable energy and a built-in recycling program for when it reaches the end of its life cycle. Additionally, it could come with a user-friendly app that tracks energy consumption and suggests ways to reduce it, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Social Viewing Experience**: Design a television that incorporates a social media platform specifically for watching shows and movies. Users could create profiles, invite friends to watch live, and chat in real-time while viewing content. This feature would allow for shared experiences, even when friends and family are miles apart, making it feel like a communal event. Integration with popular streaming services could enhance the feature, allowing users to watch their favorite shows together.",
    "**Customizable User Interface**: Implement a fully customizable user interface (UI) that allows viewers to design their own TV home screen. Users could choose from various themes, layouts, and widgets, allowing them to prioritize their favorite apps, channels, or shows. This personalization would make navigation easier and more enjoyable, catering to individual preferences and enhancing the overall user experience."
