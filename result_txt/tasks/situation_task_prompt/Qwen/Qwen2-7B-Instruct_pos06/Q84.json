    "**Wheeled Chair Adaptation**: You could modify a regular chair into a wheeled one, much like a manual wheelchair. The seat could be replaced with a more stable base that can roll on wheels, and handles could be added for control. This idea allows you to maintain some mobility and independence. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Aquatic Movement**: If confined to a pool, you could use a modified floatation device attached to a long pole or handle. This would allow you to paddle through the water using your arms, providing a form of movement. This method could also be adapted for land use if you have access to soft surfaces. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Tethered Robot Arm**: Develop or utilize a robotic arm that's tethered to a stationary object (like a wall or ceiling) in your environment. This would allow you to reach various objects and move them closer to you without needing to physically move. It could be enhanced with sensors to detect your movements and adjust accordingly. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Gravity-Defying Harness**: Design a harness system that utilizes pulleys and counterweights to lift you vertically or horizontally. This would enable you to traverse different areas while minimizing the effort required from your body. It could be particularly useful in environments with stairs or high barriers. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Portable Elevator System**: Create a portable, modular elevator system that can be installed in your home or workplace. Each module would be small and easy to transport, allowing you to move it as needed. The system would be powered by a rechargeable battery, making it convenient for use anywhere. **Confidence Score: 0.9**"
