    "**Political and Economic Resistance**: Universal basic income is a controversial and politically divisive issue, so it might face opposition from various quarters. Businesses and industries that traditionally benefit from low-wage labor may resist the idea, fearing increased costs and decreased efficiency. Additionally, some people might view it as a form of social welfare that encourages dependency and reduces work incentives.",
    "**Due Process for Disbursement**: One potential problem is determining the qualifications and the mechanism to ensure that the funds reach the right people. A universal basic income requires identifying and verifying all eligible citizens, which can be difficult given issues of identity verification and potential fraud.",
    "**Inflation and Economic Effects**: Implementing a universal basic income could lead to inflation if too much money starts circulating in the economy without corresponding increases in goods and services. This would require careful management of the money supply and the economy to ensure price stability.",
    "**Dependency and Work Ethics**: A universal basic income might discourage people from working, as they would have a guaranteed income regardless of their employment status. This could potentially lead to reduced productivity, a decline in the workforce, and a misallocation of resources if everyone chooses to do nothing.",
    "**Fairness and Redistribution**: The perception of fairness could be an issue, especially in societies where income inequality is already high. Some citizens might feel that it is unfair for everyone to receive an income, while others may benefit more from a universal basic income than those who need it more urgently (for example, low-income individuals might spend their money more responsibly than high-income individuals)."
