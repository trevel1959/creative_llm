It would have a range of 4 octaves, with each key producing a unique, ethereal sound. The instrument would be played by striking glass tubes of varying lengths with mallets, creating a shimmering, otherworldly effect. The sound would be amplified by a system of crystal resonators, adding depth and complexity to the overall timbre.",
    "**Sonic Spheres**: The Sonic Spheres would be a set of glass orbs, each containing a unique combination of resonating frequencies. When played, the orbs would produce a series of harmonious, gong-like tones that would blend and overlap to create a rich, three-dimensional sound.",
    "**Aero Harp**: The Aero Harp would be a stringed instrument played by blowing air through a series of reeds, similar to a harmonica. The strings would be made of a lightweight, high-tension material, allowing for rapid changes in pitch and dynamics.",
    "**Resonance Wheel**: The Resonance Wheel would be a circular instrument with a series of resonating frequencies etched into its surface. When played, the wheel would produce a series of harmonious, bell-like tones that would blend and overlap to create a rich, textured sound.",
    "**Echo Box**: The Echo Box would be a percussion instrument that uses a combination of metal pipes and amplification to create a rich, reson"
