    "**Insufficient Infrastructure**: Another potential problem is that the city might not have the necessary infrastructure in place to support a city-wide recycling initiative. This could include a lack of recycling bins, collection vehicles, and processing facilities. To address this, the city could invest in the development of new infrastructure or work with private partners to provide the necessary resources.",
    "**Contamination of Recyclables**: A third potential problem is that people might not properly sort their recyclables, leading to contamination of the recycling stream. This could result in lower quality recycled materials and decreased efficiency in the recycling process. To address this, the city could implement clear labeling on recycling bins and provide educational materials that explain how to properly sort recyclables.",
    "**Lack of Enforcement**: A fourth potential problem is that there might not be sufficient enforcement of recycling regulations, leading to people not complying with the rules. This could result in low participation rates and a lack of progress in achieving the city's recycling goals. To address this, the city could work with law enforcement and community organizations to monitor compliance and enforce penalties for non-compliance.",
    "**Insufficient Funding**: A fifth potential problem is that the city might not have the necessary funding to support the recycling initiative. This could result in a lack of resources for education, infrastructure, and enforcement efforts. To address this, the city could explore various funding options, such as grants, public-private partnerships, and community fundraising efforts.",
    "**Resistance from Businesses**: A sixth potential problem is that some businesses might not be willing to participate in the recycling initiative, either because they do not see the benefits or because they are concerned about the costs. To address this, the city could work with businesses to provide incentives and support, such as tax breaks, technical assistance, and recognition for their efforts."
