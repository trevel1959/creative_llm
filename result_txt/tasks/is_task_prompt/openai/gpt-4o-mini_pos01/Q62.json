    "In a vibrant tide pool, a starfish named Stella discovered a hidden power: she could walk on land! With each wobbling step, she explored the sun-kissed shores, making friends with crabs and seagulls. One day, she noticed a beach cleanup in progress. Inspired, Stella rallied her new friends, using her unique ability to reach trash stuck in crevices. Together, they transformed the beach into a pristine paradise. As the sun set, Stella realized her true gift was not just walking on land but uniting creatures for a common cause. The ocean and shore flourished, and Stella became a local legend.",
