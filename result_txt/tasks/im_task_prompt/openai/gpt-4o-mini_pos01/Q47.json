    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning feature for the dustbin and filters. This could work by using high-pressure air jets to dislodge dirt and debris from the filters and dustbin walls, depositing it back into the main collection area. This would reduce maintenance time for users and ensure optimal suction performance without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptation**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that can automatically adjust its suction power and brush height based on the surface itâ€™s cleaning. For instance, it would detect when it's transitioning from carpet to hardwood and adjust accordingly, optimizing cleaning efficiency while protecting delicate surfaces.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Create a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable, biodegradable materials and designed for easy disassembly. This would allow for easier recycling at the end of its life cycle. Additionally, it could feature energy-efficient motors and components to reduce its overall carbon footprint.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Combine the vacuum cleaner with an air purification system that filters out allergens, dust, and pollutants while cleaning. This dual-functionality would not only ensure clean floors but also improve indoor air quality, providing users with a healthier living environment.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Introduce an augmented reality (AR) interface that users can access via a smartphone or AR glasses. This interface could provide real-time feedback on cleaning progress, areas that need more attention, and even gamify the cleaning experience by rewarding users for completing cleaning tasks efficiently."
