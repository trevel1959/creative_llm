    "The Overpopulation Problem: With immortality, people would no longer have to worry about death, which could lead to an exponential increase in population. This could result in a strain on resources such as food, water, and energy, leading to social unrest and conflicts over limited resources.",
    "The Economic Impact: Immortality could also have significant economic implications. People who are immortal would not need to work or save money for retirement, which could lead to a decline in consumer spending and investment. This could negatively impact businesses that rely on these activities.",
    "The Environment: An infinite number of people would require an infinite amount of space to live, leading to overcrowding and deforestation. This could have severe consequences for the environment, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, and ecosystem collapse.",
    "The Social Structure: With immortality, people may begin to value things differently. For example, they may place less emphasis on relationships and more on personal achievement. This could lead to changes in the way society is structured, with a greater emphasis on individualism and self-interest.",
    "The Political System: Immortality could also have a profound impact on politics. Governments would need to find new ways to ensure that people's needs are met without creating an endless cycle of dependency. They may also need to address issues related to inequality and social justice, as some individuals may become extremely wealthy and powerful while others remain poor and marginalized."
