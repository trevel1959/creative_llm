    "**Adjustable Width Hanger**:    Create a hanger with adjustable arms that can expand or contract to accommodate different sizes of clothing, from small tank tops to large winter coats. This design would prevent clothes from slipping off and ensure that the hanger is versatile for various garment types. A simple sliding mechanism could be integrated, allowing users to easily adjust the width with a quick twist or push.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated Garment Care Tags**:    Design a hanger that includes a small, removable tag that contains information about the garment's care instructions, fabric type, and suggested washing methods. This tag could be made from biodegradable materials and attached with a clip, allowing users to keep track of their clothing care without having to search for labels or remember care instructions.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hanger with Clips and Hooks**:    Develop a multi-functional hanger that combines clips and hooks into one design. The clips could be used for pants, skirts, or accessories, while the hooks could be used for scarves, belts, or bags. This would help organize the closet space more efficiently, allowing users to hang multiple items on a single hanger and save space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Plant-Based Materials**:    Create a hanger made entirely from plant-based, biodegradable materials that are both durable and sustainable. This hanger could be marketed as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic hangers, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. The design could include a natural finish, and the hanger could be infused with natural scents to keep clothes smelling fresh.",
    "**Magnetic Hanger for Easy Clothing Change**:    Introduce a hanger that uses magnetic components to hold clothing securely. The magnetic surface would allow users to quickly change out clothes without the hassle of removing them from the hanger. This design would be particularly useful for fashion shows, photography sessions, or personal styling, where rapid outfit changes are required."
