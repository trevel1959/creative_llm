    "**Thermal Insulated Lunch Bag for a Picnic:** Create a custom-made lunch bag that uses thermos technology to keep food warm or cold for hours during a picnic. The bag can be designed with multiple compartments to store different types of food and drinks, each insulated by individual thermos layers. This idea not only solves the common problem of food losing its temperature quickly but also adds an element of style and personalization to the traditional picnic experience.",
    "**Thermal Insulated Yoga Mat:** Design a yoga mat that utilizes thermos technology to maintain body heat, making it especially useful in colder environments. The mat would be equipped with small, discreet heating elements powered by rechargeable batteries. Users could adjust the heat level according to their comfort, ensuring a more comfortable and effective yoga practice even in chilly conditions.",
    "**Thermally Insulated Travel Coffee Mug for Office Workers:** Develop a coffee mug that incorporates thermos technology to keep hot beverages at optimal drinking temperature throughout the day. The mug would feature a double-walled design, vacuum-insulated to prevent heat loss, and possibly include a smart temperature sensor that alerts users when the beverage is at its best drinking temperature. It could also come with a companion app for setting preferred temperature levels.",
    "**Thermal Insulated Baby Bottle Warmer:** Design a compact device that utilizes thermos principles to warm baby bottles without the need for electricity. The warmer would consist of a double-walled container filled with a water-based solution that heats up using a chemical reaction triggered by a catalyst. The solution would then transfer heat to the bottle and its contents, allowing parents to warm milk or formula safely and efficiently on-the-go.",
    "**Thermal Insulated Outdoor Gear Storage:** Create a modular system of containers or bags that use thermos technology to protect sensitive outdoor gear from extreme temperatures. The containers could be designed to store electronics, food, or other items that require temperature control during outdoor activities like camping or hiking. Each container would have adjustable insulation levels and a digital display indicating the internal temperature, ensuring that the stored items are kept within safe temperature ranges."
