    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often have large budgets, and there’s a risk of overspending due to unforeseen circumstances, such as location changes, special effects requirements, or cast demands. To address this, a detailed budget plan should be created with contingencies for unexpected costs, and a financial manager should oversee spending throughout production.",
    "**Scheduling Conflicts**: With a large cast and crew, coordinating schedules can be a nightmare. Actors may have other commitments, and crew members might be juggling multiple projects. Implementing a flexible yet structured schedule with clear communication can help alleviate these conflicts, along with using scheduling software to track everyone’s availability.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: Blockbuster films often come with high expectations from audiences and studios alike. Failing to meet these expectations can lead to negative reviews and box office disappointment. To combat this, extensive market research should be conducted to understand audience preferences, and test screenings can be used to gauge reactions before the official release.",
    "**Technical Challenges**: With the increasing reliance on special effects, there can be significant technical challenges, including software malfunctions or equipment failures. To prepare for this, hiring a robust technical team with backup systems and a plan for troubleshooting can ensure that these challenges are addressed promptly.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: A blockbuster's success often hinges on its marketing strategy. Poor marketing can lead to a lack of audience awareness and low ticket sales. Engaging a skilled marketing team to create a multi-platform promotional strategy that includes social media, trailers, and interviews can help build excitement and anticipation."
