The light color and intensity can be adjusted according to the user's preference or the time of day. For example, in the morning, the light could be brighter and warmer, while at night, it might be softer and cooler, promoting relaxation. This not only makes the showering experience more enjoyable but also encourages a sense of well-being.",
    "**Rainfall Shower Head with Variable Pressure:** Develop a shower head that allows users to customize the water pressure according to their needs. It could have settings for various activities such as washing hair (low pressure), exfoliating (medium pressure), or simply relaxing (high pressure). This feature caters to different preferences and requirements, making showering more personalized and efficient.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Shower Head with Water Saving Technology:** Create a shower head that incorporates water-saving technology without compromising on performance.

This reduces water usage by up to 50% while maintaining a consistent flow, making it an environmentally-friendly choice for users concerned about water conservation.",
    "**Smart Shower Head with Voice Assistance:** Integrate a smart shower head with voice recognition capabilities, allowing users to control water temperature, flow rate, and other settings using simple voice commands. This feature is particularly useful for individuals with physical disabilities or those who struggle with manual controls. By simplifying the process, it enhances accessibility and convenience.",
    "**Therapeutic Shower Head with Essential Oils:** Develop a shower head that combines essential oils with warm water to create a spa-like experience. Users can select from a range of oils tailored to specific purposes, such as lavender for relaxation, peppermint for energy, or eucalyptus for respiratory relief. The oils are infused into the water, providing a gentle aromatherapy treatment during the shower. This innovation not only enhances the sensory experience but also promotes health benefits through the inhalation of essential oils."
