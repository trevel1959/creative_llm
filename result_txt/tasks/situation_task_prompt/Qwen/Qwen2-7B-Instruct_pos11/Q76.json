    "**Use Physical Signals:** If all electronic devices are down, traditional methods of communication can be employed. For example, using smoke signals or flares can be effective in conveying messages over longer distances. A person at one end could light a fire or ignite a flare to signal another person far away, who then responds with their own signal.",
    "**Create a Human Relay System:** Set up a series of people along the communication path, each person passing the message on to the next in a chain. This method requires a lot of manpower but could work if the distance isn't too great and there's enough willing participants. The message could be written down at each stop and passed along.",
    "**Develop a Morse Code System for Lights:** If visibility is good and darkness is not an issue, use lights to send Morse code messages. For instance, you could flash lights in a specific pattern to represent letters and numbers. This system would require someone skilled in Morse code to decode the message at the receiving end.",
    "**Invent a New Communication Device:** Develop a new device specifically designed for this scenario. It could involve creating a simple, mechanical device that uses a series of rotating arms or gears to encode messages into a form that can be transmitted manually, like through the movement of a lever or a series of clicks. The receiving end would need to have a corresponding device to decode the message.",
    "**Use Sound Waves:** If there's no issue with sound travel, you could devise a system where messages are encoded into specific sounds (like tones, whistles, or even animal calls) and sent over a distance. The receiving party would need to interpret these sounds back into words. This might require training in specific codes and understanding of natural sounds that can be used as symbols or words. "
