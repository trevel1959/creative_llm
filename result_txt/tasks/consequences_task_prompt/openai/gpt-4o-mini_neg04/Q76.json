    "**Zoonotic Diseases**: Bringing dinosaurs back to life could introduce ancient pathogens or zoonotic diseases that humans and modern animals have no immunity against. These diseases could spread rapidly, leading to potential public health crises. The lack of knowledge about these ancient diseases would make containment and treatment extremely challenging, posing risks not only to human health but also to livestock and wildlife.",
    "**Tourism and Economic Opportunities**: The revival of dinosaurs could lead to a boom in tourism, as people would flock to see these prehistoric creatures in their natural habitats or in specially designed reserves. This could create new economic opportunities, including jobs in conservation, research, and tourism management. However, it would also require significant investment in infrastructure and safety measures to ensure the well-being of both dinosaurs and visitors.",
    "**Ethical and Moral Dilemmas**: The resurrection of dinosaurs would raise numerous ethical questions. Would it be right to bring back species that have been extinct for millions of years? What responsibilities would we have toward these creatures, especially if they were to suffer in captivity or in the wild? The debate over the morality of de-extinction could lead to societal divisions, with strong opinions on both sides regarding animal rights and the consequences of playing 'God' with nature.",
    "**Cultural and Scientific Impact**: The existence of living dinosaurs would profoundly impact our culture and scientific understanding. It could inspire a new wave of art, literature, and media focused on these creatures, similar to the dinosaur craze of the 1990s but on a much larger scale. Additionally, scientists would have unprecedented opportunities to study dinosaur biology, behavior, and evolution, potentially unlocking secrets about our planet's history and the factors that led to their extinction.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Frameworks**: The reintroduction of dinosaurs would necessitate the development of new legal and regulatory frameworks to govern their care, habitat, and interaction with humans. Governments would need to create laws addressing issues such as habitat protection, public safety, and the ethical treatment of these animals. International agreements may also be needed to manage cross-border issues, especially if dinosaurs were to migrate or if their reintroduction affected global biodiversity."
