    "Weather Conditions: Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme heat, cold, or rain, can negatively impact the health and productivity of plants. This may result in wilting, pests, or diseases affecting the plants, ultimately reducing the yield.",
    "Soil Quality: Poor soil quality can hinder the growth of plants and reduce the overall yield. This may be due to factors such as soil pH, nutrient content, or compaction. To overcome this problem, gardeners may need to amend the soil with organic or inorganic materials, such as compost or manure.",
    "Pest and Disease Management: Pests and diseases can cause significant damage to plants, reducing their health and yield. Gardeners may need to employ various management strategies, such as using natural predators, applying organic or chemical pesticides, or using fungicides to prevent the spread of diseases.",
    "Watering Issues: Inadequate or excessive watering can lead to water stress in plants, which can negatively impact their health and productivity. Gardeners may need to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust their watering schedule accordingly to ensure plants receive the right amount of water.",
    "Weeds and Invasive Plants: Weeds and invasive plants can compete with cultivated plants for water, nutrients, and sunlight, reducing their growth and productivity. Gardeners may need to employ strategies such as mulching, physical removal, or using herbicides to control these unwanted plants."
