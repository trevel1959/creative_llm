    "Instrument-based Music: If all musical recordings were lost, people could turn to playing instruments to create and share music. This could involve learning to play traditional instruments like the piano, guitar, or violin, or experimenting with new and unconventional instruments. Music could be created and performed live, with musicians passing down their skills and knowledge through apprenticeships or community workshops.",
    "Oral Tradition: In a world without recorded music, people might turn to oral tradition to preserve and share music. This could involve passing down songs and stories through generations, with each person learning from their elders and adding their own unique spin. Community singing and storytelling events could become a central part of cultural identity and social bonding.",
    "Memory-based Music: If musical recordings were lost, people could use their memories to create new music. This could involve tapping into personal experiences, emotions, and memories to craft new songs and melodies. Musicians could use their own memories as inspiration, or work with others to create collective musical pieces that capture shared experiences and emotions.",
    "Improvisation: In a world without musical recordings, improvisation could become a primary means of creating and sharing music. Musicians could use their skills and creativity to invent new melodies and rhythms on the spot, drawing inspiration from their surroundings and the moment. Improvisation could become a central aspect of musical performance, with musicians collaborating and responding to each other in real-time.",
    "Technology-based Music: While musical recordings may be lost, technology could play a role in preserving and sharing music. Advanced audio editing software could be used to restore and remaster lost recordings, or to create new music using historical recordings as a starting point. Additionally, virtual reality and augmented reality technologies could be used to create immersive music experiences that transport listeners back in time to the era of the lost recordings."
