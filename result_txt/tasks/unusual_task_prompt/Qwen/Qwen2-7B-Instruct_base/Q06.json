    "**Tire-to-Terrain Mapping System**: Design a system where tires are embedded with advanced sensors that can map the terrain beneath them in real-time. This could be particularly useful for vehicles navigating through unknown or rugged terrains, like drones exploring disaster zones or self-driving cars navigating off-road. The tire would sense the terrain's characteristics (such as soil type, rock presence, etc.), adjust its pressure and traction accordingly to optimize performance and prevent damage. ",
    "**Tire-based Energy Harvesting Devices**: Create a set of tires that can harvest kinetic energy from their movement. These tires would contain small generators inside that convert the energy from the tire's rotation into electricity. This electricity could then be stored in an onboard battery for later use, such as powering the vehicle's lights, electronic devices, or even charging other electric devices on board. This idea can significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote sustainability.",
    "**Adaptive Tire Pressure Control for Air Travel**: Develop a tire system for aircraft that can dynamically adjust its pressure based on the altitude and temperature. At high altitudes, the air pressure is lower, which can cause the tire to deflate. Similarly, cold temperatures can lead to tire hardening and reduced flexibility. An adaptive tire system would ensure optimal pressure throughout the flight, enhancing safety and fuel efficiency by reducing friction.",
    "**Recycled Rubber Tires for Building Insulation**: Use discarded tires to create a new type of insulation material for buildings. The process involves shredding the tires into small pieces and blending them with other insulating materials like foam or cellulose. This insulation is not only environmentally friendly but also provides excellent thermal insulation, sound absorption, and fire resistance properties.",
    "**Smart Tire Technology for Pedestrian Safety**: Implement a system in tires that can detect when a pedestrian might be crossing the road. Using advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms, the tires could alert drivers or even automatically slow down or stop the vehicle if necessary, enhancing pedestrian safety. This could be especially effective in areas with high pedestrian traffic, schools, and busy urban centers."
