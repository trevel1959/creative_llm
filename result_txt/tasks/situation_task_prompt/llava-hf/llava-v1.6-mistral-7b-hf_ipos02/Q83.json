    "**Embrace Polymodal Sleep**: Polymodal sleep is a concept where an individual sleeps in multiple short periods throughout the day, rather than one long period at night. In a world without night-time, people might have to experiment with different sleep patterns, such as polyphasic sleep or biphasic sleep, to accommodate their needs.",
    "**Light Therapy and Melatonin Supplements**: Light therapy, which involves exposure to bright light during the day, can help regulate the body's internal clock. Similarly, melatonin supplements can help induce sleep when needed. In a world without night-time, people might rely on these methods to ensure they get enough sleep.",
    "**Create a Sleep-Inducing Environment**: The absence of night-time would mean that the environment would be artificially lit for the entire day. To sleep, people might need to create a sleep-inducing environment, such as a dark room with comfortable bedding, to mimic the effects of night-time.",
    "**Develop New Sleep Technologies**: With the absence of night-time, there would be a greater need for technology that can help people sleep. This could involve developing sleep-inducing devices, such as sleep headbands or sleep-inducing earphones, that can help people relax and fall asleep.",
    "**Sleep Training**: Sleep training, which involves teaching the body to fall asleep in different environments and situations, might become more prevalent in a world without night-time. People might need to learn how to fall asleep without the cues of darkness and quietness that they are used to."
