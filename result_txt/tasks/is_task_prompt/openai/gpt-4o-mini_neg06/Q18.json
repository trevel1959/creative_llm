    "Once upon a time in a lush forest, there lived a cunning fox named Felix. One day, he lost his tail in a trap set by a hunter. Embarrassed, he hid from the other animals, fearing their laughter. Determined to regain his confidence, Felix devised a plan. He invited all the forest creatures to a gathering, pretending he had discovered a new game. As they played, Felix showcased his agility and cleverness, drawing admiration instead of ridicule. The animals realized that true worth lies beyond appearances. From that day on, Felix became a beloved figure, teaching everyone to embrace their uniqueness.",
