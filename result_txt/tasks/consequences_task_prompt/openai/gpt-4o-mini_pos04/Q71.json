    "**Socioeconomic Stratification**: Access to immortality could become a privilege of the wealthy, leading to a stark divide between those who can afford the technology or treatments and those who cannot. This disparity could result in a new class of “immortals” who dominate social, political, and economic systems, while the less fortunate face increasing challenges in a world where age and experience no longer guarantee success or stability.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation**: With individuals living indefinitely, there could be a risk of cultural stagnation. New ideas and innovations might slow down as established figures hold onto power and influence for centuries. The arts, sciences, and societal progress could suffer if the same perspectives dominate discourse, making it difficult for fresh voices and revolutionary ideas to emerge.",
    "**Redefinition of Relationships**: Immortality would fundamentally change human relationships. The concept of family, friendship, and love might evolve as people live through multiple generations. Long-term commitments could be challenged by the notion that individuals might seek new experiences or connections after centuries of life, leading to complex emotional dynamics and potential loneliness for those who remain attached to their mortal loved ones.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The implications of immortality would raise numerous ethical questions. Issues surrounding consent, the value of life, and the right to die would come to the forefront. Societies would need to navigate the moral complexities of choosing who gets to live forever, how to handle those who wish to end their lives, and the potential for immortality to be used as a tool for power or control.",
    "**Shift in Purpose and Motivation**: With the fear of death removed, individuals might struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives. Traditional milestones, such as education, career, and retirement, could lose their significance. People might need to develop new frameworks for personal growth, achievement, and fulfillment, potentially leading to a societal reevaluation of what it means to live a “good” life."
