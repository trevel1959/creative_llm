    "**Biomass Energy for Vehicles**: Develop a system that utilizes biomass as an energy source. This could involve converting organic waste into biofuels like biodiesel or biogas, which can then be used to power vehicles. The process could involve small-scale bioreactors at local farms or community centers, generating fuel on-site. This not only reduces waste but also provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.",
    "**Solar-Powered Vehicles**: Innovate the design of solar panels to be more efficient and lightweight, specifically tailored for vehicle roofs. Implement a smart system that tracks the sun's movement to maximize solar absorption during daylight hours. This would require advanced materials and energy storage solutions (like lithium-ion batteries) to store excess energy for use during low sunlight periods or nighttime. ",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology, which uses hydrogen gas and oxygen to produce electricity. The byproduct is water, making it a clean and efficient way to power vehicles. Develop compact, high-pressure hydrogen tanks for storage and distribution networks similar to existing natural gas infrastructure. This solution requires advancements in hydrogen production, storage, and distribution, but it offers a promising path towards a zero-emission future.",
    "**Electricity from Ocean Currents**: Explore the use of tidal and ocean current energy generators to harness the kinetic energy of moving water. Install underwater turbines that convert the motion of ocean currents into electricity. The electricity can then be transmitted to land via underwater cables. This method could provide a continuous and reliable source of power, especially in coastal regions.",
    "**Wind-Powered Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**: Create charging stations that utilize wind turbines to generate electricity for charging electric vehicles. These stations would be particularly effective in areas with consistent wind patterns. The integration of wind turbines into charging infrastructure not only supports the transition to electric vehicles but also promotes renewable energy usage. Additionally, these stations could be designed to serve as community hubs, offering amenities like Wi-Fi, seating areas, and food options while vehicles charge."
