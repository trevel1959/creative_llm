    "Virtual Reality Note-Taking: Create a virtual reality app that allows users to take notes in a fully immersive environment. Users could wear a VR headset and use hand gestures to write on virtual whiteboards or walls, or even create 3D models and diagrams. This would be particularly useful for students, architects, and designers who need to visualize and organize complex information.",
    "Smell-O-Vision Notes: Develop a device that can release specific scents based on the content of a Post-it Note. For example, if a user writes a reminder to pick up milk, the device could release a faint scent of milk. This would help users associate the physical act of writing with the mental act of remembering, making the note-taking process more intuitive and memorable.",
    "Augmented Reality Highlighters: Create an AR app that allows users to highlight important information on Post-it Notes using their smartphone or tablet camera. The app could recognize the text or images on the Post-it Note and superimpose digital highlights or annotations, making it easier to organize and prioritize information.",
    "Customizable Post-it Note Skins: Offer a range of customizable skins for Post-it Notes, each with a unique design or pattern. Users could choose from a variety of colors, shapes, and designs, making it easier to personalize their notes and make them more visually appealing.",
    "AI-Powered Note Summarization: Develop an AI algorithm that can summarize the content of a Post-it Note based on the user's handwriting or voice commands. The algorithm could analyze the content of the note and generate a brief summary, making it easier for users to quickly review and organize their notes."
