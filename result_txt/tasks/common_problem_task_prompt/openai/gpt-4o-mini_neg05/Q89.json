    "**Brand Identity and Marketing Strategy**: Establishing a strong brand identity is essential for attracting customers. A common problem could be failing to create a cohesive and appealing brand that communicates the shop's values and vision. This includes everything from the shop's name and logo to its interior design and social media presence. If the marketing strategy is poorly executed or inconsistent, it may lead to low visibility and customer engagement.",
    "**Quality Control and Consistency**: In a competitive market, customers expect high-quality products consistently. A potential issue is the challenge of maintaining quality control across all aspects of the coffee-making process, from sourcing beans to brewing techniques. Inconsistent product quality can lead to customer dissatisfaction and harm the shop's reputation, making it difficult to build a loyal customer base.",
    "**Customer Experience and Service**: The coffee shop experience extends beyond just the beverage; it includes ambiance, customer service, and overall atmosphere. A common problem is neglecting the importance of creating a welcoming environment and providing excellent customer service. If staff are not well-trained or if the shop lacks a cozy atmosphere, it can deter customers from returning, even if the coffee is exceptional.",
    "**Location and Foot Traffic**: Selecting the right location is critical for a coffee shop's success. A potential issue is choosing a site with low foot traffic or insufficient visibility, which can lead to a lack of customers. Additionally, the cost of rent in desirable areas may be prohibitively high, creating financial strain. Thorough market research is necessary to ensure that the chosen location aligns with the target demographic and has sufficient customer flow.",
    "**Operational Costs and Pricing Strategy**: Managing operational costs while remaining competitive in pricing is a delicate balance. A common problem is underestimating expenses such as rent, utilities, staff wages, and inventory, which can lead to financial strain. Additionally, setting prices too high may drive customers away, while prices that are too low can undermine profitability. Developing a sustainable pricing strategy that reflects both quality and customer expectations is essential."
