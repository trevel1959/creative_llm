Then, you can apply a layer of acrylic primer or gesso to protect the metal and prepare it for painting. After that, use acrylic paints, spray paint, or even decoupage techniques to create a unique piece of wall art. You could paint it in vibrant colors, add textures, or even cover parts of it with paper or fabric to give it a mixed media look.",
