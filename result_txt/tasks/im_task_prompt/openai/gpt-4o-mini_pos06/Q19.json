    "**Adjustable Tinting**: Develop lenses that can automatically adjust their tint based on ambient light conditions. This would not only provide UV protection but also reduce glare and eye strain in varying environments. Using photochromic technology, the lenses could transition seamlessly from clear to tinted, enhancing comfort throughout the day.",
    "**Customizable Frame Designs**: Introduce a modular frame system where users can mix and match different frame components (arms, fronts, colors) to create a personalized look. This could be done through a user-friendly app that allows customers to visualize their designs before purchasing, making eyewear a fashion statement as well as a functional accessory.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Incorporate sensors into the glasses that can monitor eye health and provide feedback on visual habits. This could include features like tracking screen time, suggesting breaks, and measuring factors such as blink rate or eye strain. Users could receive alerts through a connected app, promoting better eye care and overall health.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Earbuds Integration**: Design glasses that feature integrated noise-canceling earbuds, allowing users to enjoy music or podcasts while wearing them. This would provide a seamless experience for multitasking, whether commuting, working, or relaxing, without the need for additional devices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Shift to sustainable materials for both frames and lenses, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. This could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a brand image focused on sustainability. Additionally, a take-back program could be introduced to recycle old glasses responsibly."
