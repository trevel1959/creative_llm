    "**Personal Hoverboards**: Develop a personal hoverboard that uses magnetic levitation technology to glide above the ground. These hoverboards would be lightweight and capable of traveling at moderate speeds, making them suitable for urban commuting. They could be charged wirelessly at designated stations, and users could navigate through bike lanes or pedestrian paths, making them a unique and futuristic alternative to bicycles.",
    "**Community-Operated Electric Cargo Trikes**: Create a fleet of electric cargo trikes that serve as a community-operated transportation system. These trikes would be available for rent and designed to carry groceries, packages, or even small groups of people. They would have a small electric motor to assist with pedaling, making them easy to maneuver. This solution would not only address personal transportation needs but also provide a sustainable option for local deliveries and errands.",
    "**Mobility Pods**: Introduce a network of autonomous mobility pods that operate on demand. Users can summon these small, driverless vehicles via an app, and they would transport individuals or small groups to their desired locations. The pods would be designed for urban environments, navigating through traffic efficiently and reducing congestion. With solar panels on their roofs, they would also contribute to sustainable energy use.",
    "**Urban Cable Car System**: Implement an urban cable car system that connects various neighborhoods and key points of interest in the city. This aerial transportation option would provide a unique perspective of the city while allowing commuters to bypass ground traffic. Each cable car could accommodate a number of passengers, and the system would be integrated with public transportation to create a seamless travel experience.",
    "**Pedestrian-Powered Rideshare**: Launch a rideshare service that utilizes human-powered vehicles like pedicabs or rickshaws. Local drivers could earn money by transporting passengers around the city using these eco-friendly vehicles. This would promote fitness and sustainability while providing a unique way to experience the city. Riders could book rides through an app, and drivers would be able to choose their own hours, creating a flexible job opportunity."
