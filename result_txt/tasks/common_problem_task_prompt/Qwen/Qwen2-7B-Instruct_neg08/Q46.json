    "**Public Acceptance and Resistance**: There might be resistance from the public who are accustomed to using the existing system. They might fear disruptions during the overhaul process or be hesitant to try out new services that might not be as efficient or convenient as what they are used to. Ensuring smooth communication and managing public expectations can be challenging.",
    "**Infrastructure Compatibility**: The new system might need to be compatible with the existing infrastructure. For example, if the city plans to introduce electric buses, there might not be enough charging stations or other facilities currently available. This would require significant investments in building new infrastructure or retrofitting existing structures.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Implementing a new public transportation system could have environmental consequences. For instance, introducing more vehicles might lead to increased pollution unless the system incorporates eco-friendly measures like electric or hybrid vehicles, which could face challenges due to limited technology availability or high costs.",
    "**Technical Challenges**: The overhaul might involve advanced technologies that could pose technical challenges. For example, implementing a comprehensive smart transportation system could require robust data management and cybersecurity measures. Ensuring these systems work efficiently without causing disruptions to service is crucial.",
    "**Workforce Training and Adaptation**: A new transportation system might require a different set of skills and knowledge for the workforce. Training existing staff to operate and maintain the new system effectively would be a significant challenge. Additionally, there might be a need for new employees with specialized skills, which could impact recruitment efforts and costs."
