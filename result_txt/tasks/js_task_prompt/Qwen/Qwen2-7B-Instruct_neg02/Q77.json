    "**Astronomical Fantasy Constellation**: This constellation would be inspired by a fantastical narrative where mythical creatures from different cultures come together in a celestial dance. The main figures would be a phoenix rising from its ashes, a dragon breathing fire, a unicorn with its golden horn, and a mermaid singing under the moonlight. These creatures would form a pattern that seems like they are engaging in a story of mythological adventure, with their movements creating a sense of motion in the sky.",
    "**Celestial Symphony Constellation**: The design would mimic the structure of a musical score, with stars representing notes and lines forming measures. Each note could represent a significant event or discovery in astronomy, such as the first telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, or the discovery of exoplanets. This constellation would serve as a tribute to the evolution of astronomy and the harmony between science and art.",
    "**Cosmic Animal Constellation**: Inspired by the diversity of life on Earth, this constellation would feature various animals from different habitats. The animals could be arranged to form a path or a circle, symbolizing the interconnectedness of all living beings on our planet. Each animal would be represented by a unique star cluster, and their movements could depict migration patterns, seasonal changes, or the life cycle of an animal species.",
    "**Historical Astronomers Constellation**: This constellation would honor famous astronomers and their contributions to the field of astronomy. Stars could represent key figures such as Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and modern-day researchers. Their constellations could be arranged in a way that highlights their impact on the development of astronomy, with some stars forming a bridge or a path connecting them, symbolizing the continuity of scientific knowledge across centuries.",
    "**Technological Advancements Constellation**: Focused on the role of technology in advancing our understanding of the universe, this constellation would feature symbols representing key technological milestones. Stars could represent telescopes, satellites, spacecraft, and other tools used in astronomical research. The design could show these elements interacting, possibly in a circular formation, suggesting how technology has enabled us to explore the cosmos more deeply and understand it better over time."
