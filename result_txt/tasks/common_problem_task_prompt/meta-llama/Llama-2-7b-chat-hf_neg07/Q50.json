    "Floating City: Create a sustainable living community on a series of interconnected floating islands in the ocean. These islands can be made from recycled materials and powered by renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. The community can include a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, as well as farms and gardens to provide a self-sufficient and sustainable living environment.",
    "Vertical Forest City: Build a massive skyscraper covered in lush greenery and trees, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem within the city. The building can be designed with a system of greenhouses, hydroponic gardens, and aeroponic towers, providing a constant supply of fresh produce and oxygen. The vertical forest can also serve as a natural air purifier, improving the city's air quality and reducing the need for traditional air conditioning systems.",
    "Biosphere Community: Create a sustainable living community within a large, enclosed biosphere, similar to a terrarium. The biosphere can be designed to mimic a natural ecosystem, with a mix of desert, forest, and ocean environments. The community can include a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, as well as farms and gardens. The enclosed environment can provide a stable and sustainable living space, protected from the outside world and its environmental challenges.",
    "Underwater Community: Build a sustainable living community beneath the ocean's surface, using advanced technology to create a self-sufficient and sustainable environment. The community can include residential units, commercial spaces, and recreational areas, all powered by renewable energy sources such as tidal and ocean currents. The underwater community can also serve as a research facility, studying the ocean's ecosystem and developing new technologies for sustainable living.",
    "Nomadic Community: Create a sustainable living community of nomadic dwellings, designed to move and adapt to different locations and environments. The dwellings can be made from recycled materials and powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The community can include a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, as well as farms and gardens, providing a self-sufficient and sustainable living"
