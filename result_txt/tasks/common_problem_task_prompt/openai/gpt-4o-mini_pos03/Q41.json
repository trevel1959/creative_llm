    "**Life Support System Complexity**: Designing a life support system that can function effectively in the harsh environment of space is a significant challenge. The system must recycle air and water, provide adequate nutrition, and maintain a stable temperature and pressure. Any malfunction could lead to catastrophic consequences for the crew. Moreover, the complexity of these systems requires extensive testing and validation, which can delay the project timeline and increase costs.",
    "**Navigation and Communication Issues**: Navigating through space presents unique challenges, such as the lack of GPS and the vast distances involved. The spaceship must be equipped with advanced navigation systems capable of calculating trajectories and adjusting for gravitational pulls from celestial bodies. Additionally, maintaining communication with Earth is vital, but signals can be delayed or lost due to distance and cosmic interference, complicating mission coordination.",
    "**Psychological Impact on Crew**: Long-duration space missions can have significant psychological effects on the crew, including isolation, stress, and interpersonal conflicts. Designing the spaceship must include considerations for mental health, such as providing recreational activities, social spaces, and privacy. Failure to address these aspects could lead to decreased morale and productivity, jeopardizing mission success.",
    "**Radiation Shielding Challenges**: Space is filled with harmful cosmic radiation that can pose serious health risks to astronauts. Designing effective radiation shielding is critical, yet it adds weight and complexity to the spaceship's structure. Engineers must explore innovative materials or designs, such as using water or specialized alloys, to provide adequate protection without compromising the ship's performance or increasing costs excessively.",
    "**Power Supply Reliability**: The spaceship will require a reliable power supply for all systems, including life support, navigation, and communication. Traditional fuel sources may not be viable for long missions, so engineers might consider solar panels, nuclear power, or advanced battery technologies. Each option presents unique challenges, such as energy storage capacity, maintenance, and potential failure modes, which must be addressed to ensure continuous operation throughout the mission."
