    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Components**: Create a camera with a modular design that allows users to swap out components like lenses, sensors, and grips. This would enable photographers to customize their cameras based on their specific needs, such as low-light photography or macro shots, and make upgrades easier without needing to purchase an entirely new camera body.",
    "**Integrated Social Sharing Interface**: Develop a built-in interface that connects directly to social media platforms, allowing users to edit and share photos instantly from the camera. This feature could include customizable filters, cropping tools, and tagging options, making it easier for users to share their work without needing to transfer files to a computer or smartphone.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Implement an AR viewfinder that overlays helpful information and creative suggestions onto the live view. For instance, it could display grid lines, suggested framing, or even simulate how different settings will affect the final image. This would enhance the shooting experience and help photographers visualize their shots before capturing them.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Solar Charging**: Use sustainable materials in the camera's construction and integrate solar panels for charging. This would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also provide a practical solution for outdoor photographers who may not always have access to traditional power sources, extending shooting time in remote locations.",
    "**Smart Remote Control with Voice Activation**: Create a companion app that allows users to control the camera remotely via smartphone or voice commands. This would be particularly useful for group shots, wildlife photography, or long exposures where the photographer needs to avoid camera shake. The app could also offer real-time previews and settings adjustments."
