    "**Ergonomic Design**: Redesign the guitar to have an ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the player's body, reducing fatigue and discomfort during long practice sessions or performances. This could involve curved necks, contoured bodies, and strategically placed cutouts to alleviate pressure points.",
    "**Augmented Reality Display**: Embed an augmented reality (AR) display into the guitar's body, allowing players to access interactive tutorials, practice exercises, and music theory lessons. This feature would provide a new level of engagement and learning opportunities for musicians.",
    "**Sound-Shaping Technology**: Incorporate advanced sound-shaping technology that enables guitarists to experiment with new sonic textures and effects. This could include features such as frequency modulation, distortion, and reverb, allowing players to push the boundaries of traditional guitar sounds.",
    "**Smart Bridge**: Develop a smart bridge that adjusts the string's vibration characteristics in real-time, allowing players to customize the tone and sustain of their guitar. This feature would provide a new level of expressiveness and control over the instrument.",
    "**Biometric Feedback**: Integrate biometric sensors into the guitar to track the player's physiological responses, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle activity. This data could be used to provide personalized feedback on the player's performance, helping them optimize their technique and reduce stress."
