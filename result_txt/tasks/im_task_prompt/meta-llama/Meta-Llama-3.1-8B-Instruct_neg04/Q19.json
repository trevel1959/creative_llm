    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses with Environmental Adaptation**: Develop AR glasses that can adapt to the user's surroundings, allowing them to seamlessly interact with their environment. The glasses would use AI-powered sensors to detect the user's location, lighting conditions, and other environmental factors. This information would be used to optimize the AR experience, ensuring that the virtual information is accurately displayed and interactive.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Health Monitoring**: Design smart contact lenses that can monitor the user's health metrics, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. The lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors and microchips that would transmit data to a companion app, providing the user with real-time health insights.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Headband with Emotional Intelligence**: Create a BCI headband that can read the user's brain activity and emotions, providing insights into their mental state. The headband would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect changes in brain activity, such as stress, excitement, or relaxation.",
    "**Personalized Hearing Aids with Real-Time Language Translation**: Develop hearing aids that can translate spoken languages in real-time, allowing users to communicate with people who speak different languages. The hearing aids would use advanced AI-powered speech recognition and machine translation algorithms to accurately translate spoken language.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Headset with Haptic Feedback and Emotional Resonance**: Design a VR headset that incorporates haptic feedback and"
