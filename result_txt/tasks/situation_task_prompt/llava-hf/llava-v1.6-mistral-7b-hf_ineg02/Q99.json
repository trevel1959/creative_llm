    "Light and Shadow: The way light interacts with objects can be a key differentiator. A shiny object like a pen or a laptop will reflect light differently than a matte object like a book or a piece of paper. Shadows cast by objects can also help in identifying them.",
    "Shape and Form: The shape and form of objects can be used to differentiate them. For example, a round pencil can be distinguished from a rectangular book or a square piece of paper.",
    "Size and Scale: The size and scale of objects can also help in differentiation. A large object like a desk can be differentiated from a small object like a pen.",
    "Sound and Vibration: If we could hear or feel the vibrations, sounds and vibrations can also help in identifying objects. For example, the sound of a pen clicking or the vibration of a phone can help in identifying these objects.",
    "Tactile Cues: Tactile cues like the feel of a pen in your hand or the texture of a book can help in identifying objects."
