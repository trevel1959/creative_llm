    "Retro-Orbiting Moons: Imagine a solar system where the orbits of the planets are reversed, with the largest planet, Jupiter, orbiting the sun at a close distance while the smaller planets, like Mercury and Venus, orbit at a much larger distance. This would create unique opportunities for planetary formation and potential for habitability.",
    "Exoplanetary Habitats: Redesign the solar system to include habitable exoplanets, each with its own unique features and environments. For instance, one exoplanet could be a terrestrial world with lush forests and oceans, while another could be a gas giant with swirling storm clouds and a habitable atmosphere.",
    "Time-Traveling Solar System: Reimagine the solar system as a cosmic clock, with each planet representing a different era in time. For example, Mercury could be the dawn of the universe, Venus could be the age of dinosaurs, Earth could be the present, Mars could be the age of humanity, and so on. This would create a fascinating and dynamic system where each planet reflects a different stage in the cosmic timeline.",
    "Musical Solar System: Transform the solar system into a celestial symphony, with each planet representing a different note or chord. For example, Mercury could be a high-pitched note, Venus could be a soothing melody, Earth could be a harmonic chord, Mars could be a driving beat, and so on. This would create a harmonious and beautiful system where the planets work together to create a celestial symphony.",
    "Solar System Mini-Golf: Redesign the solar system as a miniature golf course, with each planet serving as a challenging hole. For example, Mercury could be a par-3 hole with a narrow fairway and steep hills, Venus could be a par-5 hole with twisting wind currents and thick atmosphere, and so on. This would create a fun and challenging system where players must navigate the unique features of each planet to reach the next hole."
