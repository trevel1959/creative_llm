    "**Terraforming of the Atmosphere**: With reduced gravity, the atmospheric gases would slowly drift into space, leading to a gradual thinning of the atmosphere. This would cause a significant decrease in air pressure, resulting in extreme weather conditions, including frequent and intense storms. The reduced atmospheric pressure would also lead to the loss of oxygen, making it difficult for most living organisms to survive. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Rise of Megalopolises**: With reduced gravity, the cost of construction and transportation would decrease, leading to the rapid growth of megacities. These cities would become self-sustaining ecosystems, with advanced infrastructure and innovative technologies to mitigate the effects of reduced gravity. However, this would also lead to increased competition for resources and potential social unrest. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Evolution of New Species**: The reduced gravity would select for species that are adapted to low-gravity environments, leading to the evolution of new species with unique physical characteristics, such as larger body size, more efficient oxygen use, and modified skeletal systems. This would lead to a new era of biodiversity, with species that are better suited to the changed environment. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Increased Risk of Asteroid Impacts**: With reduced gravity, the Earth's ability to deflect asteroids would be compromised, making it more vulnerable to impacts. This would lead to a significant increase in the risk of asteroid collisions, potentially causing massive destruction and altering the planet's trajectory. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**New Forms of Energy Generation**: The reduced gravity would lead to the discovery of new forms of energy generation, such as gravitational waves or zero-point energy. This would revolutionize the way we generate energy, making it cleaner, more efficient, and potentially limitless. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
