    "As the crew members looked, they saw a large figure in the distance. It was a massive ship, with black sails and a towering mast. The sky was dark and stormy, and the waves were crashing against the bow of the ship. Everyone onboard was terrified.",
    "The pirate ship was on fire. One of it cannons had fired prematurely, causing to start spilling flames. The captain looked at his men and told them to get on with, quickly.",
    "As the sun began to set, the sky was bathed in a crimson hue. Against this backdrop, the dark shape of the pirate ship could be seen sailing through the sea. The crew of Terror knew that this would be a bloodthirsty battle to the death.",
    "With a deafening roar, the ship suddenly raised itself above the waves and began to move faster, its sails billowing in the breeze. The crew of Territory were in awe as they watched the massive ship glide through the air, its black cannons shining in the light of the setting sun."
