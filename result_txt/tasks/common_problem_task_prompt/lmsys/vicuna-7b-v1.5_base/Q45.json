    "Language Barrier: Another potential problem that may arise during the organization of an international peace summit is the language barrier. Delegates from different countries may speak different languages, which could make communication difficult. To address this issue, the organizers could provide translation services or arrange for interpreters to be present during the summit.",
    "Cultural Differences: Cultural differences could also pose a problem during the organization of an international peace summit. Delegates from different countries may have different customs, beliefs, and values, which could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. To address this issue, the organizers could arrange for cultural exchange programs or provide cultural sensitivity training to the delegates.",
    "Security Concerns: Security is a major concern during any international event, and a peace summit is no exception. There is a risk of terrorist attacks or other security threats, which could disrupt the proceedings and endanger the lives of participants. To address this issue, the organizers could work closely with local law enforcement agencies and implement strict security measures, such as metal detectors and bag checks.",
    "Financial Constraints: Organizing an international peace summit can be expensive, and some countries may not have the financial resources to participate. This could limit the number of countries that can attend the summit and reduce its effectiveness. To address this issue, the organizers could seek funding from international organizations or private donors, or they could hold the summit in a location that is more affordable.",
    "Conflict of Interests: During the organization of an international peace summit, there may be conflicts of interests between different countries. Some countries may have different priorities or agendas, which could lead to disagreements and hinder the progress of the summit. To address this issue, the organizers could involve neutral third-party mediators or facilitators to help resolve conflicts and keep the discussions on track."
