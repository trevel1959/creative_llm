    "**Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Not all participants may have access to the same VR equipment or space to play comfortably. This can create an uneven playing field where some players are at a disadvantage. To address this, the tournament could include a range of games compatible with different VR systems or offer alternative formats, such as allowing non-VR participants to join in a separate category.",
    "**Fair Play and Cheating Concerns**: The online gaming community often grapples with issues of cheating and unfair advantages. In a VR tournament, this could manifest through hacks or the use of unauthorized equipment. Organizers could implement strict rules, conduct random equipment checks, and utilize anti-cheat software to ensure a level playing field.",
    "**Player Fatigue and Health Risks**: Prolonged use of VR headsets can lead to physical discomfort, eye strain, or motion sickness. This is particularly concerning in a tournament setting where players might be engaged for several hours. To combat this, the schedule could include regular breaks and encourage players to take time away from the headset, along with providing guidelines on healthy VR usage.",
    "**Time Zone Coordination**: With participants potentially located around the globe, scheduling matches can become complicated. Different time zones can lead to confusion about match times, causing some players to miss their games. Organizers should consider a centralized time zone for all communications and possibly use scheduling tools that automatically adjust for participantsâ€™ local times.",
    "**Engagement and Spectator Experience**: Unlike traditional tournaments, virtual reality events can be less engaging for spectators who cannot experience the game themselves. To enhance viewer engagement, organizers could incorporate live commentary, interactive features, and behind-the-scenes content, allowing fans to connect with the event more deeply."
