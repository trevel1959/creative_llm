    "Unforeseen environmental conditions: The ocean floor is a vast and unpredictable environment, and there is a possibility that the team may encounter unexpected hazards, such as underwater volcanoes, strong currents, or deep trenches.",
    "Limited visibility: The depth of the ocean and the lack of natural light can make it difficult for the team to see and navigate, which could lead to accidents or errors.",
    "Communication breakdown: The communication system may fail, cutting off the team from the surface and making it difficult to coordinate and control the mission.",
    "Time constraints: The mission may have a limited amount of time to complete, which could put pressure on the team and make it difficult to accomplish all of the objectives.",
    "Lack of funding: The mission may not have enough funding to cover all of the costs associated with it, which could limit the resources available to the team and compromise the success of the mission."
