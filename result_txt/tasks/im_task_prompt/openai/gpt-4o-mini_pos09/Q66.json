    "**Modular Compartments**: Design the basket with customizable, modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the picnic needs. Users could have sections for utensils, food, drinks, and even a small area for a portable speaker or games. This flexibility would allow for personalization and efficient use of space, catering to different group sizes and food types.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charger**: Equip the picnic basket with solar panels on the lid that can charge small electronic devices like smartphones or portable speakers. This would be particularly useful for outdoor activities where access to electricity is limited. The solar charger could also power LED lights inside the basket for evening picnics, enhancing the ambiance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop the picnic basket using sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable fabrics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the basket could include a detachable compost bin for organic waste, promoting eco-friendly practices during picnics.",
    "**Multi-Function Picnic Blanket**: Create a picnic basket that comes with an attached, foldable picnic blanket that can be stored within the basket. The blanket could have waterproof backing, pockets for securing items, and be made from a material that is easy to clean. This would streamline the picnic setup process and ensure that everything is contained within one portable unit.",
    "**Smartphone App Integration**: Develop a companion app that syncs with the picnic basket via Bluetooth. The app could provide features like a checklist for packing, recipe suggestions based on the items in the basket, and even a game or activity guide to keep guests entertained. Additionally, the app could have a location tracker to prevent losing the basket in crowded areas."
