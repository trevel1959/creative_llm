    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Create a knife with an ergonomic handle that can adjust to fit the user's grip size and hand shape. This would include a mechanism that allows the handle to expand or contract and provide varying levels of resistance for different grip styles. This feature would cater to people with different hand sizes and strengths, reducing fatigue and increasing comfort during prolonged use.",
    "**Multi-Functional Blade**: Develop a knife that has interchangeable blades for different functions. For example, one blade could be for slicing, another for dicing, and a third for filleting. The knife could have a locking mechanism that allows users to easily switch blades without the need for additional tools. This would not only save space in the kitchen but also make the knife more versatile for various cooking tasks.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Mechanism**: Innovate a knife that incorporates a self-sharpening mechanism within the handle. This could be achieved through a small ceramic or diamond sharpening rod that automatically sharpens the blade every time the knife is returned to its sheath or storage block. This would ensure that the knife maintains its sharpness without the need for manual sharpening, making it more convenient for everyday use.",
    "**Safety Features with Blade Guard**: Design a knife that includes a retractable blade guard that activates when the knife is not in use. This guard would protect the blade from dulling and prevent accidental cuts when reaching into drawers or cabinets. Additionally, the knife could have a safety lock that prevents the blade from being exposed unless the user presses a specific button, making it safer for households with children.",
    "**Integrated Cutting Board with Measurement Guides**: Create a knife that comes with an integrated cutting board featuring measurement guides and food placement outlines. The cutting board could have printed measurements for various cuts (e.g., julienne, dice) and even specific shapes (e.g., slices for sandwiches). This would help users achieve precise cuts and enhance their culinary skills, making meal prep more efficient."
