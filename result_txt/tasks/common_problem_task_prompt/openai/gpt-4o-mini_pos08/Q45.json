    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and transportation for international delegates can be complex. Issues such as flight delays, visa complications, or accommodation shortages could arise. To address this, organizers should establish a dedicated logistics team responsible for creating contingency plans, ensuring timely travel arrangements, and maintaining open lines of communication with delegates.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events can attract unwanted attention, making security a top priority. Threats could range from protests to potential violence. To enhance safety, organizers could collaborate with local law enforcement and security experts to conduct thorough risk assessments and develop a comprehensive security plan that includes secure venues, access control, and emergency response protocols.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Each participating country may have its own political motives and agendas, which could lead to disagreements or tensions during discussions. To foster constructive dialogue, facilitators could employ skilled mediators to help navigate contentious topics and encourage compromise. Additionally, establishing a clear agenda with agreed-upon objectives could help keep discussions focused.",
    "**Language Barriers**: With delegates from various linguistic backgrounds, communication could be hindered, leading to misinterpretations. To overcome this, organizers should provide professional interpreters and translation services to ensure all participants can engage fully. They could also create multilingual materials and provide language training sessions for key speakers.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Hosting an international summit can lead to significant carbon footprints due to travel and resource consumption. To minimize environmental impact, organizers could promote sustainable practices, such as encouraging virtual attendance options, using eco-friendly materials, and sourcing local food for catering. They could also partner with environmental organizations to offset emissions through carbon credits."
