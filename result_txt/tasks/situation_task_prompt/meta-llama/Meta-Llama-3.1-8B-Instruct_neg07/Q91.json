    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses**: I would wear augmented reality contact lenses that can detect and analyze my surroundings, providing real-time warnings and alerts about potential hazards. These lenses would use AI-powered computer vision to identify obstacles, slippery surfaces, or other dangers, allowing me to take preventive measures before accidents occur.",
    "**Smart Fabric Suits**: I would wear a smart fabric suit that can detect changes in my body's electrical activity, allowing it to predict and prevent injuries. This suit would be embedded with sensors that can monitor my muscle activity, heart rate, and other vital signs, providing early warnings of potential injuries or health issues.",
    "**Exoskeleton Assistive Device**: I would use an exoskeleton assistive device that can provide additional support and stability, helping me navigate challenging environments safely. This device would be equipped with sensors that can detect changes in my balance, posture, and movement, allowing it to adjust its support and prevent injuries.",
    "**Personal AI Assistant**: I would have a personal AI assistant that can monitor my surroundings, track my movements, and provide real-time guidance on how to avoid potential hazards. This AI assistant would be integrated with my wearable devices, allowing it to access my vital signs, location, and other relevant data to provide personalized safety recommendations.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Implants**: I would have haptic feedback implants that can simulate physical sensations, allowing me to feel tactile feedback and warnings about potential hazards. These implants would be connected to sensors that can detect changes in my environment, providing subtle vibrations or sensations to alert me to potential dangers."
