    "**House with Modular Construction**: Modular construction involves prefabricating building components in a controlled environment and then assembling them on-site. Using this method, houses can be built quickly and efficiently without the need for natural materials. The modular components can be made from a variety of materials, including concrete, steel, and even composite materials, depending on the available resources.",
    "**3D Printed House**: 3D printing technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and it's now possible to create complex structures using a variety of materials. In a world without natural materials, a house could be 3D printed using recycled plastics or other available materials. This would allow for the rapid construction of a house with minimal waste.",
    "**House with Earth-Based Construction**: Earth-based construction involves using soil, clay, and other natural materials to build houses. In a world without natural materials, alternative materials like rammed earth or compressed earth blocks could be used. These materials are readily available and can be used to create a strong and durable house.",
    "**Insulated House with Geothermal Heating and Cooling**: In a world without natural materials, a house could be built using insulated panels made from recycled materials. Geothermal heating and cooling systems could be installed to regulate the temperature inside the house, making it comfortable and energy-efficient.",
    "**House with Solar Panels and Batteries**: In a world without natural materials, a house could be built using solar panels to generate electricity and batteries to store it. This would allow the house to be self-sufficient and energy-efficient, even without the use of traditional building materials."
