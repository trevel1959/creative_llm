    "Advanced prosthetics: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans could potentially develop advanced prosthetics that can be easily replaced or repaired when damaged. These prosthetics could also be made more durable and flexible than current prosthetic limbs, providing greater functionality for people who require them.",
    "Enhanced athletic performance: For athletes, the ability to regenerate limbs could greatly enhance their performance. They would no longer need to worry about injuries that might limit their abilities, allowing them to push themselves harder and perform at a higher level.",
    "Improved disaster response: In the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes or hurricanes, the ability to regenerate limbs could greatly improve disaster response efforts. People who have lost limbs in these events could potentially regenerate them, allowing them to resume their normal lives more quickly.",
    "Medical research: The study of how starfish regenerate limbs could lead to new medical breakthroughs. Scientists could learn more about the processes involved in regeneration and apply those findings to human medicine, leading to the development of new treatments for injuries and diseases.",
    "Ethical considerations: While the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish is certainly appealing, it raises important ethical considerations. For example, should everyone have access to this technology? How would society deal with those who choose not to use it? These are complex issues that will need to be carefully considered as this technology advances."
