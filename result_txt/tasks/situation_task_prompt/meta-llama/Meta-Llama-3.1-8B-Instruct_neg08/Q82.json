    "**The Universal Dance Language**: In a world without language, dance becomes the primary means of communication. Each culture develops its unique dance style, conveying emotions, ideas, and stories through intricate movements and gestures. People learn to interpret and respond to these dances, allowing them to convey complex information and even share knowledge. For instance, a group of dancers might use a specific sequence of steps to convey a mathematical concept, and others would learn to recognize and replicate it. This dance language would evolve over time, incorporating new styles and movements to keep pace with the world's changing needs.",

Each culture would have its unique musical traditions, but they would all share a common language of sound and rhythm. This music would be used to convey complex information, from mathematical concepts to historical events, and would play a central role in the development of human culture.",
    "**The Language of Light**: In a world without language, people turn to light and shadow as their primary means of communication.
