    "Customizable Frames: Allow users to customize their glasses frames in terms of color, material, design, and even size. This would give individuals the freedom to express their personal style and preferences, making wearing glasses a more enjoyable experience.",
    "Anti-Glare and Blue Light Protection: Develop glasses with advanced anti-glare and blue light protection coatings that reduce eye strain, fatigue, and potential damage caused by prolonged screen time. This feature would appeal to people who spend long hours working on computers or using smartphones.",
    "Adjustable Lens Power: Create glasses with a variable lens power system, enabling users to easily adjust the focus based on their distance vision needs. This would eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses for different activities and make the glasses more versatile.",
    "Wearable Health Monitoring: Incorporate sensors into glasses that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The glasses could wirelessly transmit this data to a smartphone app or wearable device, providing users with insights into their health and enabling early detection of potential issues.",
    "Noise-Cancelling Audio: Integrate noise-cancelling headphones into the glasses frame, allowing users to block out external sounds while still being able to hear important notifications or conversations. This would enhance user comfort and privacy during daily activities."
