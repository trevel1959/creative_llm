    "**Moonlight**: If the room has a window, one could take advantage of the natural light from the moon to illuminate the space. Depending on the time of the month and the size of the window, the moon's light could be a viable source of light during the night.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Applying glow-in-the-dark paint to the walls or ceiling of the room could create a soft, ambient glow that would light up the space without the need for artificial lighting. This would require careful preparation and application of the paint, but it could provide a unique and creative lighting solution.",
    "**Flashlight Lanterns**: Using a collection of flashlights and lanterns could provide a temporary lighting solution. This would involve arranging the flashlights and lanterns around the room to provide adequate illumination. The lanterns could be placed on surfaces, while the flashlights could be held by individuals to direct the light where it's needed.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Utilizing reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or metallic objects, could help to amplify and distribute light from a single source. This would require positioning the reflective surfaces strategically around the room to maximize the light reflection and coverage.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lights**: If there is access to natural light during the day, solar-powered lights could be used to charge during the day and provide a source of light at night. This would require the installation of solar panels and the use of solar-powered lights that can be used indoors."
