    "**Air Quality Monitoring System**: Integrate a real-time air quality monitoring system into the air conditioner. This system would measure pollutants, allergens, and humidity levels in the home. When poor air quality is detected, the air conditioner could automatically switch to a purification mode, using advanced filters to clean the air. Users could receive notifications on their smartphones about air quality and tips on how to improve it.",
    "**Modular Design for Easy Upgrades**: Create an air conditioner with a modular design that allows users to easily upgrade specific components (like filters, fans, or even smart sensors) without needing to replace the entire unit. This would not only extend the life of the air conditioner but also allow users to keep up with technological advancements without significant investment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerant**: Innovate an air conditioner that uses a new type of eco-friendly refrigerant that has a lower global warming potential. This would help reduce the environmental impact of air conditioning units. Additionally, the unit could have a built-in system that recycles the refrigerant, further minimizing waste and improving efficiency.",
    "**Personalized Comfort Zones**: Design an air conditioner with multiple zones that can be individually controlled. Each room could have its own temperature settings, allowing family members to customize their comfort levels. This could be achieved through a series of sensors that detect occupancy and adjust the temperature accordingly, reducing energy waste in unoccupied spaces.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Compatibility**: Enhance air conditioners to seamlessly integrate with existing smart home systems. This would allow for voice control, scheduling, and synchronization with other smart devices (like smart blinds that close during peak sunlight). Users could set routines that adjust the air conditioning based on their daily activities, such as cooling down the house before they arrive home."
