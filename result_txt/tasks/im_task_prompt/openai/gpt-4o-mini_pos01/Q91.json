    "**Interactive QR Code Tag**: Create a luggage tag that features a scannable QR code linked to a personal webpage. Travelers can customize this page with their travel itinerary, emergency contact information, and a short message. If the luggage is lost, finders can scan the code to access the information and contact the owner directly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Tags**: Design luggage tags made from biodegradable materials that break down over time, reducing plastic waste. These tags could come in various stylish designs and colors, appealing to eco-conscious travelers. Additionally, they could include plantable seeds embedded in the material, allowing users to plant the tag after their travels.",
    "**Color-Changing Luggage Tag**: Develop a tag that changes color based on temperature or UV exposure. This feature could alert travelers if their luggage is left in a hot environment (like a car trunk) for too long, potentially preventing damage to sensitive items inside. The color change could also serve as a unique identifier in crowded baggage claim areas.",
    "**Personalized Voice Message Tag**: Create a luggage tag that allows travelers to record a short voice message that can be played back by anyone who finds the bag. This feature could include instructions for returning the bag or a friendly greeting. It would add a personal touch and increase the chances of the bag being returned to its owner.",
    "**Multi-Functional Luggage Tag**: Design a tag that serves multiple purposes, such as a bottle opener, mini screwdriver, or even a whistle for emergencies. This would make the tag not only a means of identification but also a handy tool for travelers, adding value and practicality to the item."
