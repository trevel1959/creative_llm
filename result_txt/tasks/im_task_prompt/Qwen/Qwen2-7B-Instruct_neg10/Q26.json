    "Trash Can with Built-in Composting: Integrate a composting system within the trash can. This would allow users to dispose of organic waste like food scraps and turn them into nutrient-rich compost. The compost can then be used in gardening or other green initiatives.",
    "Modular Trash Can System: Create a modular trash can system that allows users to easily swap out different bins for various types of waste (e.g., recycling, hazardous materials, general waste). This would make it easier for users to manage their waste efficiently and promote recycling.",
    "Trash Can with Solar Power: Design a trash can that utilizes solar panels to charge itself. This not only reduces the need for electricity but also encourages the use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the solar power could be used to power built-in LED lights for better visibility at night.",
    "Interactive Trash Can Interface: Implement a touch screen interface on the trash can, allowing users to input information about the waste they are disposing of. This could include categories such as recyclable materials, hazardous waste, or compostable items. The data collected could help users understand their waste patterns and encourage more sustainable habits.",
    "Trash Can with Removable Dividers: Create a trash can with adjustable dividers that can be customized based on the user's needs. For example, one side could be designated for recycling, while the other side could have compartments for different types of recyclables like paper, plastic, and glass. This promotes efficient sorting and recycling."
