    "Sustainable Materials: Use eco-friendly materials in the construction of shoes, such as recycled plastic, bamboo, or organic cotton. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability.",
    "Smart Sole Technology: Incorporate pressure sensors in the soles to monitor the wearer's weight distribution and provide feedback on posture and gait. This could help in improving balance and reducing the risk of injury.",
    "Personalized Designs: Develop a platform that allows users to design their own shoes, choosing from a wide range of colors, patterns, and styles. This would cater to individual tastes and preferences."
