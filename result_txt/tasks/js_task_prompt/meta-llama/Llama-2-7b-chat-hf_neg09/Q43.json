    "Monitor and Improve Home Security: If I could see through walls, I would use this power to monitor my home's security. I could check for any suspicious activity or potential threats, such as intruders or gas leaks, without having to physically enter the room. This would provide an extra layer of safety and peace of mind, especially for those who live alone or have valuable assets in their homes.",
    "Detect Hidden Structural Issues: As a homeowner, I would use my wall-seeing ability to detect any hidden structural issues within my home. For example, I could locate cracks in the foundation or walls, which could indicate water damage or other problems. By identifying these issues early on, I could prevent them from becoming major problems and save money on costly repairs.",
    "Spy on Neighbors (Discreetly): While I wouldn't recommend using this power for nefarious purposes, I could use it to keep an eye on my nosy neighbors without their knowledge. I could see what they're up to, such as if they're hosting a party or if they're leaving for an extended period. This could help me avoid any potential conflicts or issues with them.",
    "Find Lost Items: If I could see through walls, I would use this power to find misplaced items within my home. I could locate my keys or wallet without having to search the entire house, saving me time and frustration. This could also be useful for finding items that have been hidden by pets or children.",
    "Communicate with the Dead: As a spiritual person, I would use my wall-seeing ability to communicate with loved ones who have passed on. I could see through the walls of their graves or the afterlife, allowing me to communicate with them in a way that's not possible in the physical world. This could provide comfort and closure for those who are grieving the loss of a loved one."
