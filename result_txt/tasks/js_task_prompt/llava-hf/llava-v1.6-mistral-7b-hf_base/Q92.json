    "A planetary ring system: Imagine a solar system with multiple planets, each with its own unique set of rings. These rings could be made up of ice, dust, and other debris that orbit the central star. This system could be more visually striking than our current solar system and could provide a unique environment for life to develop.",
    "A gas giant with multiple moons: A gas giant planet, similar to Jupiter or Saturn, could have multiple moons orbiting it. These moons could have their own unique atmospheres and could potentially support life. This system could provide a diverse range of environments for life to develop.",
    "A black hole solar system: A black hole could be at the center of a solar system, with planets orbiting it. This system could be more intense and dynamic than our current solar system, as the gravitational pull of the black hole would be much stronger than that of our Sun.",
    "A solar system with multiple stars: Imagine a solar system with multiple stars, each with its own planetary system. This system could be more diverse and dynamic than our current solar system, as each star would have its own unique characteristics and planets.",
    "A solar system with a rogue planet: A rogue planet could be a large planet that is not orbiting a star. This system could be more unpredictable and dangerous than our current solar system, as the rogue planet could potentially collide with other planets or stars in the system."
