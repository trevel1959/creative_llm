    "**Fire-Resistant Building Materials**: If all fire-fighting equipment disappeared, I would focus on using fire-resistant building materials to protect my home. I would replace traditional materials like wood and drywall with materials like steel, concrete, and fire-resistant gypsum board. These materials are designed to withstand high temperatures and can help contain a fire, giving me more time to escape.",
    "**Fire-Proof Window Film**: I would apply fire-proof window film to all windows and doors in my home. This film can help contain a fire by preventing it from spreading through windows and doors. It can also help keep the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Roofing**: I would install fire-resistant roofing materials like tile or metal roofing. These materials are designed to withstand high temperatures and can help prevent a fire from spreading to the roof. They can also help contain a fire by providing a barrier between the fire and the rest of the home.",
    "**Fire-Proof Doors and Frames**: I would install fire-proof doors and frames, which can help contain a fire by preventing it from spreading through doorways. These doors and frames are designed to withstand high temperatures and can help keep a fire from spreading to other areas of the home.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Landscaping**: I would create a fire-resistant landscape around my home by using fire-resistant plants and materials. This can help prevent a fire from spreading to the home by creating a barrier between the home and the surrounding area. I would also avoid using flammable materials like wood and leaves in my landscaping."
