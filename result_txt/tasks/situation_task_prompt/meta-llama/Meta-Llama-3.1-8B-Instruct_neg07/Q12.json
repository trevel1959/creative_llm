    "**Geothermal Heating**: Since fuel sources would be depleted, I'd focus on harnessing geothermal energy. This involves installing a ground-source heat pump system that leverages the Earth's natural heat. By burying pipes underground, I'd tap into the consistent temperature of the Earth, which is around 55°F (13°C) year-round. This system would provide a reliable and sustainable source of heat, even without traditional fuel sources.",
    "**Passive Solar Design**: I'd incorporate passive solar design principles into my home's architecture. This approach involves carefully orienting the building to maximize natural sunlight and heat gain during the winter months. By using thick, thermal mass materials like concrete or brick, I'd absorb and store heat during the day, releasing it at night to maintain a comfortable temperature. This design would reduce the need for external heating sources.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: To create a cozy atmosphere, I'd utilize bio-luminescent lighting. This involves using microorganisms like glowing mushrooms or bacteria to produce a soft, ethereal glow. These organisms would thrive in a controlled environment, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution. The warmth and ambiance generated by this lighting would make my home feel welcoming and inviting.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: I'd incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into my home's insulation and walls. PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By using PCMs, I'd be able to store heat energy during the day and release it at night, maintaining a consistent temperature. This would reduce the need for external heating sources and make my home more energy-efficient.",
    "**Thermal Mass Flooring**: I'd install thermal mass flooring made from materials like concrete or brick. These materials absorb and store heat during the day, releasing it at night to maintain a comfortable temperature. By incorporating thermal mass flooring, I'd be able to reduce the need for external heating sources and create a cozy, warm atmosphere in my home. The thermal mass would also help regulate the temperature, reducing the need for frequent heating adjustments. [/INST] "
