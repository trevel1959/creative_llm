    "**Limited Audience Appeal**: Another issue could be the challenge of attracting an audience. New sports often struggle to gain traction because they compete with established sports that have loyal fan bases. If the sport doesn't have a unique selling point or doesn't resonate with potential viewers, it may remain niche and fail to develop a broad following.",
    "**Accessibility and Equipment Costs**: Depending on the nature of the sport, there may be issues related to accessibility. If the sport requires specialized equipment or facilities that are costly or difficult to obtain, it could limit participation. This can create socioeconomic barriers, preventing a diverse range of participants from engaging in the sport.",
    "**Injury Risks**: New sports may not have undergone extensive safety testing or established injury prevention protocols. This can lead to a higher incidence of injuries, which could deter participants and give the sport a negative reputation. Ensuring player safety through proper training and protective gear is crucial for the sport's acceptance.",
    "**Sponsorship and Funding Challenges**: Securing sponsorships and funding can be particularly challenging for a new sport. Without a proven track record or established audience, companies may be hesitant to invest. This lack of financial support can limit promotional efforts, facilities, and resources necessary for the sport's growth.",
    "**Cultural Resistance**: In some regions, there may be cultural resistance to adopting a new sport, especially if it contrasts with traditional or popular sports. Overcoming this resistance requires strategic marketing and community engagement to demonstrate the sport's value and relevance."
