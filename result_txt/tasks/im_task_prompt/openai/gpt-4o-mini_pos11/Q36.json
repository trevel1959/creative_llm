    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**:    Develop a knife with a self-sharpening mechanism built into the handle. This could involve a small grinding wheel that automatically sharpens the blade each time the knife is sheathed or unsheathed. This feature would ensure that the knife maintains its sharpness over time, reducing the need for manual sharpening and enhancing safety by minimizing the risk of using a dull blade.",
    "**Modular Knife Design**:    Create a knife with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out blades for different tasks (e.g., chef's knife, paring knife, serrated knife). The handle could have a universal attachment system that securely holds various blade types, making it more versatile and space-efficient. This design would be ideal for home cooks with limited kitchen space or those who want a customizable cooking experience.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Adjustment**:    Design a knife with an ergonomic handle that features adjustable grip settings. Users could modify the grip size and shape to fit their hand perfectly, enhancing comfort and control during use. This could be especially beneficial for people with arthritis or limited hand strength, allowing for a more enjoyable and efficient cutting experience.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade for Food Safety**:    Introduce a knife with color-coded blades that correspond to different food types (e.g., red for meat, green for vegetables, blue for seafood). This would help prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen by reminding users to use specific knives for specific food groups. The colors could be made from food-safe materials and easily distinguishable, promoting hygiene and safety while cooking.",
    "**Built-in Food Storage Compartment**:    Create a knife with a hollow handle that can store small food items or ingredients, like herbs or spices. This would allow chefs to have quick access to essential ingredients while cooking, reducing the need to run back and forth to the pantry. The compartment could be sealed to keep contents fresh and could even have a small removable section for easy cleaning."
