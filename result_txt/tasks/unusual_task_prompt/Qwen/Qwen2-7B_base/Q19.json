    "Air Freshener: Instead of throwing out old candles, use the remaining wax to create an air freshener. Simply place the wax in a jar with a small hole in the lid and store it in a closet or drawer.",
    "Scented Hand Sanitizer: Using the same idea as the previous idea, take the scent of the candle and use it as the scent in a hand sanitizer.",
    "Suncatcher: Use a clear glass candle holder and pour the remaining wax into the design, letting it harden and creating a beautiful suncatcher.",
    "Garden Fertilizer: Add some dirt to the wax before pouring it into the candle holder. As the candle burns, the dirt will release nutrients into the soil, making for a fertilizer that you can use in your garden.",
    "Tea Light Candle: If youâ€™re running low on tealight candles, melt the remaining wax and use it to make your own tealights. Simply pour the wax into candle holders in the shape of tea lights, and use a wick to light them up."
