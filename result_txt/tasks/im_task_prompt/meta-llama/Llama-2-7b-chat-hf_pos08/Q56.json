    "Design a Bicycle Bell with a Built-In Safety Light: The traditional bicycle bell is a simple, yet effective way to alert pedestrians and other cyclists of an approaching cyclist. However, in low-light conditions, it can be difficult to see the bell, especially for pedestrians with impaired vision. To address this challenge, design a bicycle bell with a built-in safety light that illuminates when the bell is rung. This will provide a visible signal to pedestrians and other cyclists, ensuring they can see the bell and take appropriate action.",
    "Create a Smart Bicycle Bell with Motion Sensors: Incorporate motion sensors into the bicycle bell to detect when a cyclist is approaching. When the sensors detect movement, the bell rings, alerting pedestrians and other cyclists of the approaching cyclist. This feature can be especially useful in areas with heavy foot traffic or in situations where cyclists may not be able to see or hear the traditional bell.",
    "Develop a Bicycle Bell with a Personalized Ringtone: Offer a bicycle bell with a personalized ringtone feature. Cyclists can choose from a variety of pre-recorded tunes or create their own custom ringtone using a smartphone app. This adds a personal touch to the bell and can help identify the cyclist's identity.",
    "Design a Bicycle Bell with a Built-In Horn: Instead of a traditional bell, design a bicycle bell with a built-in horn. This will provide a louder and more attention-grabbing alert than a traditional bell, especially in noisy environments. The horn can be activated by a button or sensor, allowing the cyclist to choose when and how to use it.",
    "Create a Bicycle Bell with a GPS Tracker: Incorporate a GPS tracker into the bicycle bell, allowing cyclists to track their route and location in real-time. This feature can be especially useful for cyclists who travel long distances or ride in unfamiliar areas. The GPS tracker can also provide an added layer of safety by allowing cyclists to be located in case of an emergency."
