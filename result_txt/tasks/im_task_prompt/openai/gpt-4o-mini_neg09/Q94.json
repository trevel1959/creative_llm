    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Candle**: Create a candle designed for easy refilling with a sustainable approach. Instead of disposable jars, the candle could have a durable base with interchangeable wax inserts. Customers can purchase refill packs made from natural, biodegradable materials. This not only reduces waste but also allows for customizable scents and colors, encouraging users to experiment without the guilt of throwing away glass jars.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Air Purifier**: Innovate a candle that incorporates a small, silent air purifier. As the candle burns, it releases pleasant scents while also filtering out airborne pollutants. This could be achieved by embedding a small HEPA filter within the candle holder. The candle would provide a dual function: ambiance and improved air quality, making it ideal for urban dwellers.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Candle**: Design a candle that changes color based on the mood of the room, using sensors that detect sound levels, temperature, or even heart rate through a wearable device. This candle could create a dynamic atmosphere that reflects the emotions of those present, enhancing the ambiance for gatherings, relaxation, or meditation.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Candle**: Create a candle that tells a story as it burns. This could be achieved through an embedded speaker that plays audio stories, poems, or soundscapes that correspond to the candle's scent or theme. For example, a “forest” candle could play sounds of nature and tell a story about an adventure in the woods. This would engage users in a multi-sensory experience, combining scent, sight, and sound.",
    "**Candle with a Built-in Timer and Safety Features**: Design a candle with an integrated timer that automatically extinguishes the flame after a set duration. Additionally, it could feature a safety mechanism that senses if the candle has been left unattended for too long and extinguishes it. This would help alleviate concerns about fire hazards, making candles safer for use in homes with children or pets."
