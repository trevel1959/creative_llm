    "Multi-tool Scissors: Incorporating multiple tools into the scissors' design can make them more versatile. For example, adding a screwdriver, a file, or a small hook could provide additional functionality for various tasks.",
    "LED Lighted Scissors: Integrating LED lights into the scissors' handles can improve visibility when cutting in low-light conditions. This could be especially useful for tasks like cutting paper, fabric, or other materials in the evening or in darker environments.",
    "Smart Scissors: Equipping the scissors with smart features, such as a touch screen display or sensors that detect the material being cut, can enhance their functionality. For example, the scissors could automatically adjust their cutting force or provide cutting guidance for precision cuts.",
    "Electric Scissors: Replacing the manual cutting mechanism with an electric motor can increase cutting speed and precision. This could be particularly useful for tasks that require precise cuts, such as cutting electronic components or precision crafting.",
    "Modular Scissors: Designing the scissors with interchangeable blades can allow for greater versatility. For example, different blade types could be used for cutting different materials, such as paper, fabric, or plastic."
