    "**Fire-Based Cutting**: Utilizing the power of fire, individuals could create heat-based cutting methods. For example, a heated metal rod could be used to burn through softer materials like plastic or wood. This technique, known as pyrolysis, would allow for precise cuts by controlling the temperature and pressure applied to the material.",
    "**Biological Cutting Tools**: People could look to nature for solutions, using sharp animal bones or teeth as cutting implements. For instance, the bones of certain fish or birds could be fashioned into tools for cutting food or fabric. Additionally, utilizing thorny plants, like cacti, could provide a natural alternative for slicing.",
    "**String and Tension Techniques**: Instead of cutting, people could use tension-based methods to separate materials. For example, a strong, thin string could be used in a sawing motion to cut through softer materials. By wrapping the string around an object and pulling tightly, the friction and pressure could create a cutting effect.",
    "**Water Jet Cutting**: In a world without traditional cutting tools, water could be harnessed for its power. High-pressure water jets can cut through various materials. This method would involve creating a device that can generate enough pressure to create a fine stream of water capable of slicing through wood, metal, or other substances.",
    "**Laser Pointers**: In a more technologically advanced scenario, people could utilize laser technology to cut materials. By focusing a powerful laser beam on a specific point, it could melt or vaporize the material in its path. This method would require the development of portable laser devices that could be used safely and effectively."
