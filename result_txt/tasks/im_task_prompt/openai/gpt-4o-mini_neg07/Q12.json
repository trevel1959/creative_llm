    "**Integrated Solar Charger**: Design a wallet that includes a thin, flexible solar panel on the exterior. This panel would harness sunlight to charge a small built-in battery that could power devices like smartphones or smartwatches. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts or travelers who may not have access to traditional charging options.",
    "**Modular Wallet System**: Create a wallet with detachable compartments that can be customized according to the user's needs. Users could choose to add or remove sections for cash, cards, coins, or even a small notebook. This modular approach allows for personalization and organization, catering to different lifestyles and preferences.",
    "**RFID-blocking Fabric**: Upgrade the walletâ€™s material to include advanced RFID-blocking technology, which prevents unauthorized scanning of credit cards and personal information. This feature would protect users from identity theft and electronic pickpocketing, giving them peace of mind while carrying their valuables.",
    "**Built-in GPS Tracker**: Embed a small GPS tracking device within the wallet that connects to a mobile app. If the wallet is lost or stolen, the user can easily track its location via the app. This would also include a feature that allows the wallet to emit a sound or vibration when activated, helping users locate it quickly in a cluttered environment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Shift to sustainable materials for the wallet's construction, such as recycled plastics, organic cotton, or vegan leather made from pineapple leaves or apple peels. Not only would this appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, but it would also reduce the ecological footprint of wallet production."
