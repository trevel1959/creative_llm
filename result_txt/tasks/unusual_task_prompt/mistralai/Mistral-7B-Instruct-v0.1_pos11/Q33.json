    "Sponge-based Water Purification System: Develop a water purification system that uses sponges to filter out impurities and contaminants from water. The sponges can be coated with activated carbon or other materials to enhance their ability to absorb and remove pollutants. This system could be particularly useful in areas with limited access to clean water sources.",
    "Sponge-based Building Material: Create a building material that is made from sponges. The sponges could be used as a substitute for traditional building materials like concrete or brick, and could provide insulation and sound absorption properties. This material could be particularly useful in areas with high humidity or temperature fluctuations.",
    "Sponge-based Agricultural Productivity Enhancer: Develop a product that uses sponges to improve the productivity of agricultural crops. The sponges could be used to retain moisture in the soil, prevent erosion, and improve soil structure. This product could be particularly useful in areas with arid or semi-arid climates.",
    "Sponge-based Medical Device: Create a medical device that uses sponges to deliver medication or therapies to the body. The sponges could be coated with drugs or other materials that are released slowly over time, providing a controlled and sustained delivery of the medication. This device could be particularly useful for treating chronic conditions.",
    "Sponge-based Art Installation: Create an art installation that uses sponges as the main material. The sponges could be arranged in interesting patterns or shapes, and could be lit up or otherwise enhanced to create a visually striking piece. This installation could be particularly useful for public spaces or events."
