    "One creative solution to crossing a river if all bridges collapsed would be to use a combination of floating platforms and inflatable rafts. These could be arranged in a way that allows people to safely and easily cross the river.",
    "Another idea could be to use a drone to transport people or goods across the river. The drone could be equipped with a cargo basket or passenger compartment, and could fly back and forth between the two sides of the river.",
    "If the river is wide and shallow, a creative solution could be to use a system of floating rafts connected by rope or cable. People could walk across the rafts, which would provide a stable and secure pathway.",
    "In a situation where all bridges have collapsed, a creative solution could be to use a combination of boats and buoys to create a makeshift bridge. The boats could be arranged in a way that allows people to safely cross the river, while the buoys could provide additional stability and support.",
    "Another idea could be to use a combination of ice floes and rope to create a makeshift bridge. This would be most effective in colder climates where the ice floes would be more stable and secure. People could tie the rope to the ice floes and use it to create a pathway across the river."
