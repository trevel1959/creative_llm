    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The Internet is the backbone of modern commerce, enabling transactions, communication, and information exchange. Without it, global supply chains would be severely disrupted, leading to widespread economic collapse. Businesses would struggle to operate, and international trade would grind to a halt. This would result in massive job losses, bankruptcies, and a significant decline in living standards.",
    "**Social Unrest and Chaos**: The Internet has become an essential tool for communication, social organization, and information dissemination. Without it, people would struggle to connect with each other, access essential services, and stay informed about current events. This would lead to social unrest, protests, and potentially even violent conflicts as people adapt to a world without the Internet.",
    "**Loss of Critical Infrastructure**: The Internet is the foundation of modern critical infrastructure, including power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare services. Without it, these systems would be severely impaired, leading to widespread power outages, transportation disruptions, and healthcare crises. This would have devastating consequences for public health, safety, and security.",
    "**Cultural and Historical Preservation**: The Internet has become a vast repository of human knowledge, culture, and history. Without it, access to this information would be severely limited, leading to the loss of cultural heritage and historical context. This would have a profound impact on education, research, and our collective understanding of the world.",
    "**Psychological Trauma and Isolation**: The Internet has become an integral part of modern life, providing a sense of connection and community. Without it, people would experience significant psychological trauma and isolation, leading to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. This would have a profound impact on individual well-being and societal cohesion."
