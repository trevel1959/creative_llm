    "**Agriculture and Farming**: Animal-based agriculture would be significantly impacted. Larger animals would require more space and resources to feed, breed, and care for. Farmers would need to adapt their farming practices to accommodate these changes, which could lead to new farming techniques and technologies.",
    "**Ecosystem Balance**: The size of animals could disrupt the balance of ecosystems. Larger animals might compete for resources, potentially leading to a shift in the balance of predator-prey relationships. This could result in changes to food chains and the overall health of ecosystems.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increased size of animals could have a significant impact on the environment. Larger animals would require more food, water, and space, which could lead to deforestation, overfishing, and other forms of environmental degradation.",
    "**Urban Planning**: Cities would need to redesign their infrastructure to accommodate the needs of larger animals. This could include wider roads, larger parks, and new public spaces designed specifically for these animals.",
    "**Wildlife Conservation**: The increased size of animals could impact wildlife conservation efforts. Larger animals would require more resources and space to protect, which could strain conservation budgets and resources."
