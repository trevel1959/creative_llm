    "**Extreme Weather Conditions:** Mars experiences drastic temperature fluctuations between scorching heat during the day and freezing cold at night. This poses challenges in terms of designing habitats that can withstand such extreme conditions without causing significant damage to the infrastructure.",
    "**Limited Water Resources:** Water is crucial for human survival, as well as for sustaining life in general. Mars lacks liquid water on its surface, so any settlement would need to rely on ice reserves or find alternative means to produce water through processes like electrolysis.",
    "**Psychological Challenges:** Living in a confined space with limited human interaction for extended periods can lead to psychological distress. Isolation and confinement are known to affect mental health, so developing strategies for maintaining mental well-being becomes a critical issue.",
    "**Communication Delays:** Mars is approximately 20 minutes away from Earth in terms of communication due to the speed of light. This delay could create logistical and operational challenges, especially in emergency situations or when coordinating complex tasks.",
    "**Lack of Natural Resources:** Unlike Earth, Mars does not have an abundant supply of natural resources like fertile soil, abundant sunlight, or easily accessible minerals. Establishing self-sustaining colonies would require finding or creating ways to cultivate food and develop a reliable energy source."
