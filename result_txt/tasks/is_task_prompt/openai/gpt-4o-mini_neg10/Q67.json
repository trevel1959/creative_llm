    "In a vibrant jungle where colors danced and flowers sang, there lived a zebra named Zuri, unlike any other. Zuri was born with stripes of every color of the rainbow, dazzling all who laid eyes on her. While the other zebras blended into the savannah, Zuri stood out, which made her both adored and envied. One day, a drought struck the jungle, and the animals grew anxious. Zuri decided to lead them to a hidden oasis, her colorful stripes lighting the path. The animals followed her, inspired by her bravery. Together, they thrived, proving that differences can unite and lead to greatness.",
