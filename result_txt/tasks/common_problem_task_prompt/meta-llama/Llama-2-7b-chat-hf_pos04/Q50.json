    "Floating City: A sustainable living community built on a series of interconnected floating islands in the ocean. The islands would be made of recycled materials and powered by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The community would be self-sufficient, with its own food production, waste management, and water recycling systems. The unique design would provide a safe and resilient living space for its inhabitants, while also reducing the community's carbon footprint and promoting sustainable living.",
    "Vertical Farm: A sustainable living community built inside a large vertical farm, where crops are grown on multiple levels using hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics. The community would be powered by a combination of solar and wind energy, and would have its own waste management and water recycling systems. The vertical farm design would maximize space efficiency, reduce water usage, and provide a consistent and reliable food supply for the community.",
    "Eco-Village: A sustainable living community built in a rural or suburban area, surrounded by natural habitats and agricultural land. The community would be designed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding environment, with energy-efficient homes, community gardens, and renewable energy systems. The community would also have its own waste management and water recycling systems, and would promote sustainable living practices such as composting, rainwater harvesting, and energy conservation.",
    "Underwater Hotel: A sustainable living community built underwater, where the hotel is powered by renewable energy sources such as tidal, wave, or geothermal power. The hotel would have its own waste management and water recycling systems, and would provide a unique and luxurious living experience for its guests. The underwater design would also promote sustainable living practices, such as reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and promoting eco-tourism.",
    "Nomadic Community: A sustainable living community that is designed to be mobile and flexible, with homes and infrastructure that can be easily disassembled and reassembled in different locations. The community would be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, and would have its own waste management and water recycling systems. The nomadic design would allow the community to move to different locations as"
