    "**Smart Toasting**: Develop a sandwich toaster that can adjust its temperature, toasting time, and even flavor profiles based on the user's preferences and dietary needs. This could be achieved through a mobile app that allows users to input their desired settings and connect to the toaster via Bluetooth. The toaster could also include sensors to detect the type of bread and filling used, automatically adjusting the toasting settings for optimal results.",
    "**Toasty Transformations**: Create a sandwich toaster that can transform into a variety of different appliances, such as a panini press, a waffle iron, or even a grill. This could be achieved through a modular design, where interchangeable plates and attachments can be easily swapped out to change the toaster's function. This would make the toaster a more versatile and space-saving addition to any kitchen.",
    "**Automated Assembly**: Design a sandwich toaster that can automatically assemble sandwiches for the user. This could involve a robotic arm that places slices of bread, meats, cheeses, and condiments into the toaster, which would then toast the sandwich to perfection. This would be especially useful for people with mobility or dexterity issues, or for those who want to quickly make a sandwich without having to assemble it themselves.",
    "**Flavor Fusion**: Develop a sandwich toaster that can infuse flavors into the bread while toasting. This could be achieved through a system of flavor cartridges that release aromatic oils or essences into the toaster, which would then be absorbed into the bread as it toasts. This would allow users to create unique and complex flavor profiles for their sandwiches.",
    "**Smart Filling**: Create a sandwich toaster that can detect the type of filling used and adjust the toasting settings accordingly. For example, if a user is making a sandwich with a delicate filling like egg salad, the toaster would adjust its temperature and toasting time to prevent the filling from getting too hot or burnt. This would ensure that the filling is cooked to perfection and the sandwich is evenly toasted."
