    "Electric vehicle networks: A network of electric vehicle charging stations could be established throughout the town or city, allowing people to travel longer distances using electric vehicles. This would help reduce traffic congestion and air pollution while providing an alternative to road-based transportation.",
    "Public transportation improvements: The town or city could invest in public transportation, such as buses, trams, and trains, to provide efficient and reliable options for residents and visitors. This would encourage people to use public transport instead of private vehicles, reducing the need for roads.",
    "Bicycle-sharing systems: Implementing a bicycle-sharing system would encourage residents and visitors to use bicycles for short distances, reducing the need for roads. The bicycles could be distributed throughout the town or city, allowing people to rent and return them after use.",
    "Water-based transportation: The town or city could invest in water-based transportation systems, such as canals, water taxis, and ferries. This would provide an alternative to road-based transportation, especially in areas where roads are not feasible or practical.",
    "Vertical transportation: The town or city could invest in vertical transportation systems, such as escalators, moving walkways, and conveyor belts, to provide efficient and fast transportation between different levels of buildings.
