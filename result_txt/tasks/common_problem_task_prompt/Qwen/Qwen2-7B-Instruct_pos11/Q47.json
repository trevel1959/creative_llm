    "**DIY Modular Computer System**: Create a modular computer system where each component (like the motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage) can be easily upgraded or replaced. This system would consist of individual blocks that connect to a central hub via standard connectors. Each block could be designed with a specific function, allowing users to customize their system based on their needs. For example, one block could be dedicated to high-performance gaming, while another might focus on video editing. The blocks would be powered and connected using a standard power supply and USB or SATA connectors, respectively.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Compostable Computer**: Develop a computer case made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or corn starch. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of the device but also allow for the case to be composted once it reaches the end of its life cycle. Additionally, incorporate sustainable practices in the manufacturing process, such as using renewable energy sources and minimizing waste. The computer's components could be designed for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of their life, promoting circular economy principles.",
    "**AI-Driven Customized Computer**: Design a computer system that uses artificial intelligence to optimize its performance based on the user's preferences and tasks. The AI could learn from the user's habits and adapt the settings automatically, such as adjusting screen brightness, optimizing power usage, or prioritizing certain applications. This would result in a more personalized computing experience, enhancing efficiency and user satisfaction.",
    "**Touch-Sensitive Modular Interface**: Create a modular computer interface that utilizes touch-sensitive technology. Users could interact with the computer by touching or swiping across different modules, which could include input devices like keyboards, touchpads, or even entire monitors. This approach would offer a more intuitive and flexible user experience, especially for those who prefer non-traditional interaction methods. The touch-sensitive modules could also be designed to be easily rearranged and customized according to the user's workspace setup.",
    "**Innovative Cooling Solutions**: Design a computer cooling system that incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as liquid cooling or phase change materials. These advanced cooling solutions would enable better heat dissipation, leading to improved performance and longer lifespan for the computer components. For instance, a liquid cooling system could use coolant to carry away heat from the CPU and other hot components, maintaining optimal temperatures even under heavy loads. Additionally, explore the use of nanotechnology or other innovative materials to enhance heat transfer efficiency within the cooling system."
