    "Woolly Mammoth - Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Carbon Sequestration: Mammoths were massive herbivores, and their digestive systems would have efficiently converted plant material into nutrient-rich dung. This dung could act as a natural fertilizer, enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration.",
    "Climate Change Mitigation: Mammoths were well adapted to cold climates and could help regulate local temperatures by providing insulation and shading. This could have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem, potentially mitigating some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
    "Conservation of Biodiversity: By reintroducing a keystone species like the Woolly Mammoth, we could promote the recovery of other extinct or endangered species that relied on them for survival. This could lead to a ripple effect, preserving the delicate balance of ecosystems and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "Scientific Discovery: Reviving the Woolly Mammoth would provide an unparalleled opportunity for scientific research. By studying their behavior, physiology, and genetics, we could gain insights into the evolution of mammalian species and the impact of climate change on ecosystems."
