    "**Soundproofing Layer**: Enhance the door's ability to block noise by adding a soundproofing layer. This could be a combination of acoustic foam and dense materials like mass-loaded vinyl. This improvement would be particularly beneficial for homes in noisy urban areas or for home offices where concentration is essential.",
    "**Integrated Planter**: Design a door that incorporates an integrated planter on its frame. This could be a vertical garden that allows residents to grow herbs, flowers, or succulents. The planter would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the door but also improve air quality and provide a natural element to the entrance.",
    "**Magnetic Seal for Weatherproofing**: Introduce a magnetic sealing system around the door frame to improve insulation and weatherproofing. This would help to prevent drafts and water leaks, enhancing energy efficiency. The magnets would create a tighter seal when the door is closed, making it more effective than traditional weatherstripping.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Doorbell**: Develop a doorbell that incorporates augmented reality features. When someone rings the doorbell, users could see a live feed of the person at the door through their smartphone, complete with information about the visitor (like their name and purpose) displayed in AR. This would enhance security and provide a modern twist to traditional doorbells.",
    "**Multi-Functional Door with Storage**: Design a door that doubles as a storage solution. For instance, the door could have built-in compartments or shelves that allow residents to store items like shoes, umbrellas, or bags. This would be particularly useful in small apartments where space is limited, combining functionality with style."
