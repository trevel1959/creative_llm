    "\"Hyperloop\": A high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel passengers through a vacuum-sealed tube at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. This would revolutionize long-distance travel, making it faster and more efficient than ever before.",
    "\"SkyCar\": A flying car that uses electric propulsion and advanced aerodynamics to soar through the skies. It would be equipped with safety features such as automatic landing and collision avoidance systems, making it a safe and reliable mode of transportation.",
    "\"Maglev Train\": A high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to hover above the tracks, eliminating friction and allowing for faster speeds. It would be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, making it an eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "\"Hoverboard\": A personal transportation device that uses magnetic levitation technology to allow riders to glide through the air. It would be small and lightweight, making it easy to carry around, and would be equipped with safety features such as automatic landing and collision avoidance systems.",
    "\"Fusion Car\": A car that uses nuclear fusion technology to generate its own power, eliminating the need for gasoline or other fossil fuels. It would be a clean and sustainable mode of transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping to combat climate change."
