    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a shoe with a special nanotechnology-infused fabric that repels dirt and stains. The surface could be treated with hydrophobic and oleophobic coatings, making it easier to wipe clean and resistant to scuff marks. This would not only enhance the shoe's longevity but also save time on maintenance, appealing to busy individuals who want to keep their shoes looking fresh.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a pair of shoes with interchangeable components, such as soles, uppers, and insoles. Users could easily swap out parts to change the shoe’s style or function—switching from a casual look to a more formal one or adjusting the sole for different terrains. This modularity would promote sustainability by allowing consumers to replace only worn-out parts instead of buying a whole new pair.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Tracker**: Embed a small fitness tracker within the shoe that monitors steps, distance, and calories burned. The tracker could sync with a smartphone app to provide insights into the wearer’s activity levels, posture, and foot health. Additionally, it could offer personalized tips to improve walking or running form, encouraging a healthier lifestyle.",
    "**Mood-Reflective Color Change**: Use thermochromic or photochromic materials that change color based on the wearer’s body temperature or exposure to sunlight. This feature would allow shoes to reflect the mood or style of the wearer dynamically. For instance, the shoes could shift from a cool blue when relaxed to a vibrant red during an energetic outing, making them a fun fashion statement.",
    "**Built-in Massage System**: Design shoes with a built-in massage feature in the insoles that activates with each step. Utilizing small, discreet motors or air bladders, the shoes could provide a gentle foot massage, promoting relaxation and circulation throughout the day. This would appeal to those who spend long hours on their feet or suffer from foot fatigue."
