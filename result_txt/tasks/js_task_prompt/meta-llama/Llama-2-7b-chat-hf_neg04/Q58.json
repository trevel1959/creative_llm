    "Awe: Awe is the feeling of wonder and amazement that arises when we encounter something beautiful, majestic, or beyond our understanding. Deleting awe would remove the capacity for humans to appreciate the beauty of nature, art, or even the complexity of the universe. Without awe, humans would miss out on the opportunity to marvel at the grandeur of a sunset, the intricate patterns of a butterfly's wings, or the sheer scale of a mountain range.",
    "Empathy: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Deleting empathy would lead to a society where individuals are less compassionate and caring towards others, resulting in a lack of social cohesion and increased conflict. Without empathy, people would be less likely to help others in need or understand the perspectives of those different from themselves.",
    "Creativity: Creativity is the ability to generate new and original ideas. Deleting creativity would stifle innovation and progress, as humans would no longer be able to come up with new solutions to problems or express themselves in unique and meaningful ways. Without creativity, humans would be limited to repetitive and mundane tasks, with no opportunity for artistic expression or intellectual exploration.",
    "Curiosity: Curiosity is the desire to learn and discover new things. Deleting curiosity would lead to a society where individuals are less interested in exploring the world around them, resulting in a lack of scientific progress and cultural advancement. Without curiosity, humans would stop asking questions, stop seeking answers, and stop pushing the boundaries of what is possible.",
    "Humor: Humor is the ability to find joy and amusement in everyday situations. Deleting humor would make life much more serious and dull, as people would no longer be able to find levity in the mundane or irony in the absurd. Without humor, humans would struggle to cope with the challenges of life, and would miss out on the opportunity to connect with others through shared laughter and joy."
