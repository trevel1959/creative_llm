    "Sun-harvesting Drones: Develop a fleet of drones that can fly above the clouds and collect sunlight using solar panels or mirrors. These drones could be equipped with AI-powered navigation systems to ensure efficient collection and delivery of sunlight to areas of need.",
    "Cloud-piercing Towers: Design skyscrapers or towers with specialized windows that can reflect sunlight through the clouds, providing a concentrated beam of light for indoor use. These towers could be strategically placed in urban areas to provide consistent sunlight to nearby buildings.",
    "Sun-absorbing Materials: Develop materials that can absorb and store sunlight during periods of cloudy weather. These materials could be used to create large-scale structures that can release the stored sunlight when needed, providing a reliable source of light even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-shifting Technology: Create a system that can manipulate the position and altitude of clouds to allow more sunlight to reach the ground. This could involve using weather balloons or aircraft to seed clouds with substances that promote cloud formation or dissipation.",
    "Solar-powered Windows: Develop windows that can harness sunlight even when the sky is cloudy. This could be achieved through the use of specialized glass or plastic materials that can convert indirect sunlight into electricity, providing a reliable source of power for buildings."
