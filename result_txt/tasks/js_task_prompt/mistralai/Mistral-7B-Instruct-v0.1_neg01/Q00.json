    "Explore the skies: I would take my time to soak in the view of the world from above. I would fly over different cities, mountains, and oceans to see how they look from a bird's eye view.",
    "Visit new places: I would fly to new places that I have always wanted to visit but could never afford to go to. I would explore the beauty of the world and take in the sights and sounds of different cultures.",
    "Help people: I would use my newfound ability to fly to help people in need. I would fly to disaster areas to deliver supplies and aid to those affected by natural disasters.",
    "Go on adventures: I would go on wild adventures in the sky. I would fly through the clouds, do loop-the-loops, and perform stunts to get my adrenaline pumping.",
    "Start a new career: I would use my new ability to fly to start a new career as a pilot or an airplane instructor. I would teach others how to fly and share my love for the skies."
