    "Eco-Friendly Spaceship Design: A spaceship that is powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, or nuclear fusion. The design would prioritize minimizing its carbon footprint and reducing waste during its operations. This would make it more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to traditional spaceships that rely on fossil fuels.",
    "Modular Spaceship Design: A spaceship that can be easily assembled and disassembled into smaller modules for transportation and storage. This would make it more versatile and adaptable to different mission requirements. For example, some modules could be used for exploration while others could be used for transportation or manufacturing.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-Controlled Spaceship: A spaceship that is entirely controlled by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The AI would be able to navigate the ship through complex space environments, monitor its systems, and make decisions based on real-time data. This would reduce the need for human intervention and improve the safety and efficiency of the spacecraft.",
    "Bioregenerative Life Support System Spaceship: A spaceship that uses a bioregenerative life support system to sustain human life in space. The system would use plants to produce oxygen and food, which would reduce the need for resupply missions from Earth. This would make long-duration space travel more feasible and cost-effective.",
    "Space Tourism Spaceship: A spaceship that is designed specifically for commercial space tourism. The design would prioritize comfort and luxury for passengers, with amenities such as sleeping quarters, entertainment systems, and dining areas. The spaceship would also have the capability to transport small groups of passengers at a time, making it accessible to a wider range of people than traditional rocket launches."
