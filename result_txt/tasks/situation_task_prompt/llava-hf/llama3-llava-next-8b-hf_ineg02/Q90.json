    "**Condensation Collection**: Utilize condensation in the air by installing a condensation collection system. This system would capture the moisture from the air as it cools and condenses, then store it for later use.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Generation**: Invest in an atmospheric water generation system, which uses the air to produce water through a process of cooling and condensation. This technology can be used to generate clean drinking water from the air, even if there is no rain.",
    "**Groundwater Wells**: Drill a groundwater well to access underground water sources. While not a rainwater collection method, it would still provide a reliable source of water even in the absence of rain.",
    "**Greywater Systems**: Implement a greywater system that collects and reuses water from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This water can be reused for flushing toilets, cleaning, and other non-potable uses.",
    "**Water Recycling**: Develop a water recycling system that can treat and reuse wastewater from sinks, toilets, and other sources. This would be a way to conserve water by reusing it rather than letting it go down the drain."
