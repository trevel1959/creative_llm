For example, the user could see a virtual cat that follows them around the room or a virtual city that changes based on their mood.",
    "**Pillowcase with Built-in White Noise Machine**: Design a pillowcase with a built-in white noise machine that helps the user fall asleep and stay asleep.

The pillowcase can be programmed to play different types of white noise, such as rain, ocean waves, or fan sounds, to help the user relax and fall asleep. For instance, the pillowcase could play a gentle stream sound to help the user fall asleep, and then switch to a more intense thunderstorm sound to help them stay asleep.",
