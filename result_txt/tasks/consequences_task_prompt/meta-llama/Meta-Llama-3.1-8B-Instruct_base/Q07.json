    "**Loss of Access to Information**: The internet has democratized access to information, making it possible for people to access knowledge, education, and resources from anywhere in the world. Without the internet, people would be cut off from this wealth of information, leading to a decline in education, innovation, and progress. Scientific research, medical breakthroughs, and technological advancements would grind to a halt.",

    "**Social Unrest and Civil Unrest**: The internet has become an essential tool for social movements, activism, and community organizing.
