    "Bartering: In the absence of currency, people would have to resort to bartering to trade goods and services. This means exchanging goods or services directly without any medium of exchange like money. For example, a farmer could trade his fresh produce with a baker in exchange for freshly baked bread.",
    "Gift Economy: Another way people could trade goods and services without currency is through a gift economy. In this system, people give and receive gifts as a way of exchanging value. For example, a person could offer to fix a neighbor's car in exchange for a gift of fresh vegetables from their garden.",
    "Local Exchange Trading System (LETS): A LETS is a system that allows people to trade goods and services within a local community without using money. Members of the community can offer their skills and services, and in return, they can receive goods and services from other members.",
    "Cryptocurrency: While not technically currency, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be used as a medium of exchange in the absence of traditional currency. People could use cryptocurrencies to purchase goods and services, and in turn, use those goods and services to barter with others.",
    "Time Banking: Time banking is a system that allows people to trade their time and skills with others. In this system, people can offer their time and skills to others in exchange for goods and services.
