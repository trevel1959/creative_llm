    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design:** The steering wheel can be creatively adapted to transform traditional manual wheelchairs into more maneuverable and user-friendly devices. This could include integrating advanced control systems that allow for precise directional adjustments, or perhaps even incorporating a joystick or touchpad on the steering wheel for enhanced control. Additionally, incorporating features like power-assist, shock absorption, and ergonomic design could greatly improve the user experience.",
    "**Vehicle-Based Fitness Center:** The concept of a vehicle equipped with a steering wheel could be used as a portable fitness center. This could involve installing a series of exercise equipment, such as resistance bands, yoga mats, or even a mini-trampoline, around the vehicle's interior. The steering wheel could serve as a handle for exercises like rowing or arm circles, making it a versatile tool for physical fitness routines while on-the-go.",
    "**Emergency Response Vehicle Innovation:** The steering wheel in emergency vehicles can be reimagined to enhance safety and efficiency. This could include integrating touch-screen interfaces directly onto the steering wheel for quick access to critical information like GPS navigation, real-time traffic updates, or emergency contact numbers. Additionally, incorporating voice-activated commands and haptic feedback could improve the driver's ability to respond to emergencies without taking their hands off the wheel.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Driving Assistance System:** A futuristic idea would be to use the steering wheel as a central hub for an AR driving assistance system. This could display vital information like speed, road conditions, and potential hazards in the driver's line of sight without the need to glance away from the road. The steering wheel could be equipped with sensors and projectors that overlay this data onto the windshield, ensuring that drivers stay informed and safe without distractions.",
    "**Smart Home Control Center:** The steering wheel could also be transformed into a central control hub for smart home systems. By integrating wireless connectivity and voice recognition technology, the steering wheel could allow users to control various smart devices within their homes, such as lights, thermostats, and security systems. This integration would provide a convenient way for individuals to manage their home environment, enhancing comfort and convenience during their commutes or when returning home."
