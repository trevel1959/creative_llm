    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handle**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different grip styles. This would accommodate various users, including those with arthritis or limited hand strength. The handle could feature a soft, textured grip to enhance comfort during use, reducing strain on the wrist and hand.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature using UV-C light technology within the watering can. After use, the user can activate the self-cleaning mode, which would sterilize the interior of the can, eliminating bacteria and algae buildup. This would ensure that plants are watered with clean water, promoting better plant health.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Design a watering can that has a compartment for liquid fertilizers or plant nutrients. The user can mix water with the fertilizer directly in the can, and a built-in valve could control the flow, allowing for precise dosing. This feature would make it easier to fertilize plants while watering, ensuring that they receive the nutrients they need without additional effort.",
    "**Multi-Functional Spout**: Create a watering can with a spout that can be adjusted to change the flow rate and pattern of water. It could have multiple settings, such as a gentle mist for delicate seedlings, a steady stream for larger plants, and a concentrated jet for reaching deep into soil. This versatility would allow users to cater to the specific watering needs of different plants.",
    "**Collapsible and Portable Design**: Develop a collapsible watering can made from lightweight, durable materials that can be easily stored or transported. This design would be perfect for gardeners with limited space or those who travel frequently. When not in use, the can could fold down to a fraction of its size, making it easy to store in a garden shed or take along on camping trips."
