    "**Smart Bike Lane**: Design a bike lane with integrated technology that detects and responds to the rider's behavior. The lane could be equipped with sensors that track the rider's speed, distance traveled, and other metrics. This data could be used to provide real-time feedback to the rider, such as displaying their speed on a screen or adjusting the lane's surface to provide a more comfortable ride. The lane could also be designed to adjust its width and layout based on the number of riders using it, optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.",
    "**Bicycle-Sharing System with AI-Powered Matching**: Develop a bicycle-sharing system that uses artificial intelligence to match riders with available bikes based on their location, destination, and preferred bike type. The system could use machine learning algorithms to analyze rider behavior and preferences, predicting which bikes are most likely to be used and allocating them accordingly. This would reduce wait times and increase the overall efficiency of the system.",
    "**Augmented Reality Bike Helmets**: Design a bike helmet with integrated augmented reality (AR) technology that provides riders with real-time information and entertainment. The helmet could display turn-by-turn directions, show the rider's speed and distance traveled, and even offer virtual \"power-ups\" to enhance the riding experience. The AR display could also be used to project virtual objects, such as virtual road signs or obstacles, to help riders navigate complex routes.",
    "**Self-Balancing Bike with AI-Assisted Stabilization**: Develop a self-balancing bike that uses artificial intelligence to adjust its balance and stability in real-time. The bike could be equipped with sensors that track the rider's movements and adjust the bike's center of gravity accordingly, ensuring a smooth and stable ride. The AI system could also detect potential hazards, such as potholes or uneven terrain, and make adjustments to the bike's balance to prevent accidents.",
    "**Bike-Sharing System with Integrated Electric Assist**: Design a bike-sharing system that includes electric assist, allowing riders to easily and efficiently navigate long distances. The bikes could be equipped with electric motors that provide an extra boost of power, making it easier for riders to climb hills or ride long distances. The system could also be integrated with public transportation, allowing riders to easily transfer between bikes and buses or trains."
