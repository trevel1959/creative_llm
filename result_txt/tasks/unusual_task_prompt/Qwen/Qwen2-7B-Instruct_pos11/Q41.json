    "**Pencil Sharpener Pen**: Create a hybrid device that combines the function of a pencil sharpener with that of a pen. The user can sharpen their pencil at any point by simply pressing down on the pen's mechanism, without having to leave their desk or workspace. This would be particularly useful for students, office workers, or artists who frequently need to use pencils.",
    "**Rechargeable Pencil Sharpener**: Develop a rechargeable pencil sharpener that can be plugged into a power outlet or USB port. This design eliminates the need for disposable batteries and reduces waste. Additionally, it can have an LED light indicator to show the battery status, making it easy for users to know when it needs charging. ",
    "**Adjustable Pencil Sharpener**: Design a pencil sharpener that can adjust its blade angle based on the type of pencil being used (e.g., graphite, colored, or mechanical pencils). This would provide a more precise sharpening experience, preserving the quality of different types of pencils.",
    "**Pencil Sharpener with Storage**: Integrate a small drawer or compartment into the pencil sharpener where users can store additional pencils or erasers. This compact storage solution would be particularly helpful in classrooms or offices where space is limited.",
    "**Smart Pencil Sharpener**: Create a smart pencil sharpener that connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The app could provide users with information about how many times they've sharpened a particular pencil, the life expectancy of a pencil, or even suggest alternative pencils based on usage patterns. This feature would be especially appealing to educators, artists, or anyone who needs to manage their supplies efficiently."
