    "Explore new terrain: Without mountains, there would be no need for hiking or climbing, but that doesn't mean there wouldn't be any opportunities for outdoor exploration. People could hike through canyons, explore caves, and even try rock climbing on artificial structures.",
    "Create new sports: With mountains gone, people could create new sports based on different terrains. For example, they could design a water-based sport like surfing on lakes and rivers, or an air-based sport like skydiving from high buildings.",
    "Build artificial mountains: If people miss the challenge of climbing mountains, they could build their own artificial versions. These could be towering structures made of materials like concrete or steel, complete with elevators and other features to make them feel like real mountains.",
    "Use technology to simulate mountain experiences: People could use virtual reality technology to experience the thrill of climbing mountains without actually having to leave their homes. They could climb simulated peaks, navigate treacherous trails, and even see stunning views from the top.",
    "Embrace a minimalist lifestyle: With mountains gone, people might find it easier to simplify their lives and appreciate the simpler things in life. They could focus on enjoying nature in other ways, such as spending time by the beach, taking long walks in the park, or simply appreciating the beauty of the sunset."
