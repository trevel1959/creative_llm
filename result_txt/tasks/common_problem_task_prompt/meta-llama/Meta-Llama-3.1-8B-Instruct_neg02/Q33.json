    "**Eco-Friendly Shelter Construction**: Utilize natural materials found on the island to build a sustainable shelter. Collect palm fronds, leaves, and branches to create a sturdy yet eco-friendly structure. Incorporate a water collection system, such as a solar still or a DIY rainwater harvesting system, to provide a reliable source of drinking water. The shelter will also serve as a hub for a makeshift laboratory, where you can experiment with island resources to create innovative tools and solutions.",
    "**Island Agriculture and Food Security**: Implement a permaculture system to cultivate a diverse range of edible plants, including fruits, vegetables, and grains. Use the island's unique ecosystem to your advantage by selecting crops that thrive in the local climate and soil conditions. Establish a rotational farming schedule to maintain soil fertility and prevent crop depletion. This will ensure a steady food supply and provide a sense of accomplishment and connection to the natural world.",
    "**Communication and Signaling**: Develop a creative system for signaling for help or communicating with potential rescuers. Use the island's unique features, such as a prominent landmark or a distinctive sound, to create a recognizable signal. Construct a makeshift mirror or a signaling device using natural materials to reflect sunlight or create a visible signal fire. This will increase your chances of being spotted and potentially speed up the rescue process.",
    "**Island Exploration and Cartography**: Embark on a thorough exploration of the island to create a detailed map of its geography, vegetation, and potential resources. Use natural materials, such as leaves or twigs, to create a durable and waterproof map. Identify potential hazards, such as steep cliffs or venomous creatures, and mark them on the map to ensure a safe and efficient exploration of the island.",
    "**Psychological Well-being and Morale**: Establish a routine that promotes mental well-being and maintains a positive outlook. Create a makeshift journal or diary to record your thoughts, experiences, and achievements. Develop a daily routine that includes physical activity, such as swimming or running, and mental stimulation, such as reading or problem-solving. This will help you stay focused, motivated, and resilient in the face of isolation and uncertainty. [/INST] "
