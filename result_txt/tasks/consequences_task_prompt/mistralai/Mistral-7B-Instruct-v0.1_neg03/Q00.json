    "Social breakdown: If humans suddenly lost the ability to sleep, it would have a profound impact on society. People would be unable to rest, which would lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and depression. This could lead to a breakdown in social structures, as people become more prone to conflict and less able to work together effectively.",
    "Health problems: Sleep is essential for physical health, and without it, people would be more susceptible to illness and disease. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to a variety of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.",
    "Increased productivity: While the lack of sleep would have negative effects on mental health, it could potentially lead to increased productivity. Without the need for sleep, people could work around the clock without getting tired. However, this could also lead to burnout and decreased overall well-being.",
    "Changes in behavior: Sleep deprivation can lead to changes in behavior, including increased aggression and increased risk-taking. These changes could have unpredictable consequences, and it's difficult to say how society would adapt to them.",
    "Environmental impact: Without sleep, people would be less able to function effectively, which could have a significant impact on the environment. For example, if people were unable to work effectively, it could lead to a decrease in productivity and a decrease in the amount of waste produced. However, this could also lead to a decrease in the quality of life for those who are affected."
