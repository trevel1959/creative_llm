    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket that utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light or ozone technology to sanitize clothes while they're being stored. This would not only keep the laundry fresh but also prevent odors from developing before the clothes are washed.",
    "**Color-Coded Laundry Baskets**: Introduce a set of laundry baskets that come in different colors, each corresponding to a specific type of fabric or color sensitivity. For example, white clothing might go in a basket labeled \"Delicate Whites,\" ensuring that similar items are washed together, maintaining their quality and color integrity.",
    "**Adjustable Laundry Baskets**: Design a laundry basket with adjustable dividers that can be customized based on the size of the laundry load or the types of clothes being sorted. This would allow for more efficient organization and potentially reduce the need for multiple baskets.",
    "**Wearable Laundry Basket**: Create a portable, wearable laundry basket that clips onto clothing, backpacks, or even attaches to a bike. This would enable users to collect laundry throughout the day without having to carry large, cumbersome baskets, making it ideal for people who work away from home or travel frequently.",
    "**Biodegradable Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or recycled paper, reducing environmental impact. The basket could also have a water-resistant coating to protect its contents during rain or accidental spills."
