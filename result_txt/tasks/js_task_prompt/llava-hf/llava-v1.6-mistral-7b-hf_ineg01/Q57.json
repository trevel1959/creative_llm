    "**Community-Based Governance**: This model would be based on local communities that are geographically and socially defined. Each community would have a governing body that makes decisions based on the needs and values of its members. This would allow for more localized and responsive governance, as decisions would be made by people who are directly affected by them.",
    "**Citizen Assembly System**: This system would involve randomly selected citizens forming a small, temporary assembly to make decisions on critical issues. These assemblies would be empowered to propose and vote on legislation, with the goal of representing the diverse interests of the population. The assembly members would receive a stipend to ensure that they can devote their full attention to the task without financial concerns.",
    "**Participatory Budgeting**: This system would give citizens a direct role in deciding how public funds are allocated. Budget proposals would be submitted by citizens, and a representative panel would review and prioritize them based on community needs. This would ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the priorities of the people.",
    "**Citizen-Initiated Referendums**: This model would allow citizens to initiate referendums on any issue they feel strongly about. If a referendum receives a certain number of signatures, it would be put to a public vote. This would empower citizens to directly influence policy and legislation.",
    "**Citizen Ombudsman System**: In this system, citizens would have the ability to directly report issues and concerns to a designated ombudsman. The ombudsman would be responsible for investigating and resolving these issues, ensuring that the government is accountable to its citizens."
