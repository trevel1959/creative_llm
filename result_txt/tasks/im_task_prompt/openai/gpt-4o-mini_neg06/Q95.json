    "**Foldable and Stackable Design**: Create a laundry basket that can be easily folded flat when not in use, allowing for more efficient storage. The design could incorporate stackable features, enabling multiple baskets to be neatly stacked on top of each other, saving space in small homes or apartments. This would be particularly useful for families with varying laundry loads throughout the week.",
    "**Integrated Odor Neutralizer**: To combat the musty smell that can accumulate in laundry baskets, this version would include a built-in odor-neutralizing system. Utilizing activated charcoal or essential oil diffusers, the basket would continuously release pleasant scents while absorbing odors, keeping clothes smelling fresh even before they are washed.",
    "**Color-Coded Sections**: This laundry basket could be divided into multiple compartments, each designated for different types of laundry (e.g., whites, colors, delicates, and linens). The compartments would be color-coded for easy identification, helping users quickly sort their laundry without having to rummage through the entire basket.",
    "**Portable Laundry Assistant**: Imagine a laundry basket that doubles as a portable laundry assistant. It could come equipped with a detachable, battery-powered vacuum that can pick up lint, hair, and small debris from clothes before washing. Additionally, it could feature a built-in fabric shaver to remove pills and fuzz, ensuring clothes look their best before going into the wash.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Scale**: This innovative laundry basket would include a digital scale that weighs the laundry before washing. It could sync with a mobile app to recommend the optimal washing settings based on the weight and fabric type, preventing overloading the washing machine and ensuring clothes are cleaned efficiently."
