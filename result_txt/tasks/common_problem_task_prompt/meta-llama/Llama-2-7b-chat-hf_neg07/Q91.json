    "Community-Led Rainwater Harvesting: Create a community-led initiative that promotes rainwater harvesting in developing countries. This can involve training local communities on the construction of simple and affordable rainwater harvesting systems, and providing them with the necessary materials and tools. The harvested rainwater can be used for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation, and sanitation, improving the overall quality of life for the community.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Filtration Systems: Develop and deploy solar-powered water filtration systems that can be used in developing countries to provide clean drinking water. These systems can be designed to use the sun's energy to power a filtration process that removes impurities and contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption. This can be particularly effective in areas where access to electricity is limited.",
    "Floating Water Treatment Islands: Create floating islands that can be placed in water bodies in developing countries to provide clean drinking water. These islands can be designed with built-in water treatment systems that use natural materials such as coconut shells, bamboo, and sand to remove impurities from the water. The clean water can then be collected and distributed to nearby communities.",
    "Water-Saving Toilets: Develop and promote water-saving toilets in developing countries that use minimal water for flushing. These toilets can be designed to use a combination of composting and urine-diverting technologies to reduce water usage by up to 90%. This can help reduce the strain on water resources in developing countries where access to clean water is already limited.",
    "Mobile Water Purification Units: Develop mobile water purification units that can be deployed in remote areas of developing countries where access to clean water is limited. These units can be designed to use solar power and advanced filtration technologies to purify water on the go, providing clean drinking water to communities in need. The units can also be equipped with sensors that monitor water quality and provide real-time data on water purification processes."
