    "**Adaptive Gear System**: Develop a bicycle with an adaptive gear system that automatically adjusts based on the terrain and rider’s effort. Using sensors to detect incline, decline, and the rider's pedaling strength, the bike could shift gears seamlessly without the need for manual adjustments. This would provide an optimal riding experience, making it easier to climb hills or accelerate on flat surfaces.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular bicycle that allows riders to easily swap out components based on their needs. For instance, a commuter could replace standard tires with puncture-resistant ones, while an off-road cyclist might want to switch to wider, knobby tires. This design could extend to other components like handlebars, seats, and even the frame, allowing for customization without needing to purchase a whole new bike.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Equip bicycles with solar panels integrated into the frame or accessories, such as a front or rear rack. These solar panels could charge a battery that powers lights, GPS devices, or even a small electric assist motor. This feature would promote eco-friendliness and ensure that riders have a sustainable source of power for their devices during long rides.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Enhancements**: Redesign the bicycle frame and components to be more ergonomic, reducing strain on the rider's body. This could include adjustable handlebar heights and angles, as well as a seat that conforms to the rider's body shape. Additionally, the bike could feature shock-absorbing materials in the frame to smooth out bumps and vibrations, providing a more comfortable ride over various terrains.",
    "**Smart Lock System**: Implement a smart locking mechanism that connects to the rider’s smartphone. This lock could use Bluetooth technology to automatically unlock when the rider approaches, eliminating the need for keys. It could also send alerts if the bike is moved without authorization and allow the owner to track its location via GPS, significantly reducing the risk of theft."
