    "Use the power of technology: Develop a portable, solar-powered watering system that can be carried around to water plants. This system could use a specialized membrane to filter and purify water, making it safe for the plants.",
    "Create a rainwater collection system: Build a network of rainwater collection tanks strategically placed around the garden. These tanks could be designed to capture and store rainwater during heavy rainfall, providing a reliable source of water for the plants.",
    "Utilize the wind: Install a wind-powered water pump system that can draw water from a nearby source, such as a river or lake, and bring it back to the garden. This system could be powered by a wind turbine or a small windmill, providing a sustainable and renewable source of water.",
    "Grow drought-resistant plants: Introduce a variety of drought-resistant plants into the garden, which can thrive in low-water conditions. These plants could include succulents, cacti, and other hardy species that can survive with minimal watering.",
    "Create a hydroponic system: Develop a hydroponic system that uses nutrient-rich water to feed the plants, rather than relying on traditional soil-based methods. This system could be powered by a small solar panel or wind turbine, providing a sustainable and efficient way to water the plants."
