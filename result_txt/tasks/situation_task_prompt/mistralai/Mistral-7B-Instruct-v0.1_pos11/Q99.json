    "Shape: By focusing on the shape of objects, we can differentiate between them even if they are the same color. For example, a circle and a square would still be distinguishable.",
    "Texture: Different objects have different textures, so we can differentiate between them by feeling them. For example, a smooth stone and a rough rock would still be distinguishable.",
    "Size: By measuring the size of objects, we can differentiate between them. For example, a small ball and a large ball would still be distinguishable.",
    "Sound: Different objects make different sounds, so we can differentiate between them by listening to them. For example, a hollow object and a solid object would still be distinguishable.",
    "Smell: Different objects have different smells, so we can differentiate between them by smelling them. For example, a fresh apple and a rotten apple would still be distinguishable."
