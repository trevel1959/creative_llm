    "Staff Training: A zoo requires a diverse range of staff, from animal keepers to veterinarians to groundskeepers. Ensuring all staff are trained and knowledgeable about their roles is crucial. Lack of proper training can result in accidents, misunderstandings, and a decline in the overall guest experience.",
    "Safety and Security: Providing a safe environment for both visitors and staff is essential. Problems could arise from inadequate security measures, such as potential breaches or attacks by animals, leading to guest injuries or fatalities. Strict protocols, security personnel, and visitor education should be in place to minimize these risks.",
    "Animal Enrichment: Keeping the animals in a stimulating environment to prevent boredom and associated behaviors is important for their welfare. A lack of proper enrichment activities can lead to stress, aggression, and other behavioral issues. Enrichment should be an ongoing process that is carefully planned and executed.",
    "Financial Challenges: Running a zoo comes with many financial responsibilities, including employee wages, maintenance, and animal care. If the zoo is struggling to manage its budget, it may find itself unable to properly care for the animals, provide adequate exhibits, or maintain safety measures.",
    "Education and Conservation Initiatives: Some zoos play a vital role in educating the public about wildlife and supporting conservation efforts. Problems could arise from not having a clear strategy in place for these initiatives, leading to a lack of impact and public support."
