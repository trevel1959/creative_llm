    "**Smart Light Beams**: Develop a flashlight with adjustable beam patterns and colors. The user can choose from various beam patterns, such as a narrow spotlight, a wide floodlight, or even a customizable pattern with a mix of colors and intensities. This feature can be achieved through a combination of LED lights and advanced optics.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation**: Create a flashlight with an integrated AR display that provides users with real-time navigation information. The AR display can project a virtual map, highlight nearby landmarks, or even provide turn-by-turn directions. This feature can be achieved through a partnership with a mapping service or a navigation app.",
    "**Biometric Health Monitoring**: Design a flashlight with built-in biometric sensors that track the user's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. This feature can be achieved through the integration of wearable technology and health monitoring software.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Develop a flashlight that doubles as an environmental monitoring device. The flashlight can detect and measure pollutants, such as particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, and provide users with real-time feedback on air quality. This feature can be achieved through the integration of air quality sensors and data analysis software.",
    "**Holographic Display**: Create a flashlight that projects a holographic display, allowing users to view 3D images and videos in mid-air. This feature can be achieved through the use of holographic technology and advanced optics."
