    "Use sunlight and shadows: With no maps or compasses, observing the angle of the sun and the direction of the shadows can give clues about the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West). This can be especially helpful for determining whether to head towards the mountains or the sea.",
    "Use stars: In areas with clear skies, the constellations and the North Star can be used to orient oneself. By memorizing the patterns of stars or using smartphone apps that display starlight maps based on the user's location, one can navigate by recognizing the constellations and their relative positions.",
    "Use smartphone GPS: Although it might seem like a reliance on technology, smartphone GPS signals (even without mobile data) can still be accessed in many areas. This allows users to find their coordinates and follow routes if they're not fully unfamiliar with the area.",
    "Use local residents: In unfamiliar parts of the world, asking local residents for directions and guidance can be an effective way to navigate. They can provide accurate and up-to-date information about the area, including roads, points of interest, and potential hazards.",
    "Communication technologies: Satellite communication devices or VHF radios can share location and navigational information. Although not as accurate or detailed as maps, they can still provide vital information and potential emergency support if needed."
