    "Host the wedding in an eco-friendly venue: Look for wedding venues that have already implemented sustainable practices such as using renewable energy, recycling, andx composting. If you can't find one, consider renting a space that allows you to bring in your own sustainable elements.",
    "Choose eco-friendly wedding decor: Opt for decor made from recycled materials or natural materials such as wood, stone, and plants. You can also consider using biodegradable or compostable decor such as flower petals, leaves, and bamboo.",
    "Use sustainable transportation: Encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation to get to the wedding. If they need to travel by car, provide them with information on how to offset their carbon emissions by supporting a green energy provider or planting trees.",
    "Serve organic and locally sourced food: Choose a caterer that uses locally sourced and organic ingredients. You can also consider having a DIY food bar where guests can make their own salads or sandwiches using fresh, locally sourced ingredients.",
    "Use recycled paper and digital invitations: Instead of sending paper invitations, consider sending digital invitations through email or social media. If you do need to send paper invitations, use recycled paper and print on both sides to reduce waste."
