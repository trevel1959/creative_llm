    "The Celestial Kite: The new constellation, named \"Celestial Kite,\" would be a majestic and ethereal grouping of stars, shaped like a soaring kite in the night sky. The kite's tail would be represented by a long, curved line of stars stretching from the constellation's base to its peak, while the body of the kite would be formed by a cluster of bright, white stars. The kite's wings would be depicted by two smaller clusters of stars, one on either side of the body, giving the impression of a bird in flight. The constellation would be visible in the northern hemisphere during the spring and summer months.",
    "The Cosmic Wave: Inspired by the rhythmic patterns of ocean waves, this constellation would be named \"Cosmic Wave.\" It would feature a series of undulating lines of stars that resemble the waves of the ocean, with the tallest wave forming the crest of the constellation. The wave's shape would be dynamic, shifting and changing as the viewer observes it, giving the impression of a living, breathing entity. The constellation would be visible in the southern hemisphere during the winter and fall months.",
    "The Galactic Flame: This constellation would be a fiery, celestial wonder, representing the intense heat and light of a star. The constellation would be shaped like a flame, with a bright, central star at its core and a series of flickering, smaller stars along the sides, giving the impression of a burning flame. The Galactic Flame would be visible in the northern hemisphere during the autumn and spring months.",
    "The Stardust Nebula: This constellation would be a swirling, ethereal mass of stars, reminiscent of the stardust that fills the cosmos. The constellation would be shaped like a whirlpool, with a central cluster of stars surrounded by a series of concentric, starry rings. The outer rings would be fainter than the central cluster, giving the impression of a nebula in motion. The Stardust Nebula would be visible in the southern hemisphere during the summer and winter months.",
