    "**Braille-Enhanced Smart Glasses**: Design smart glasses that not only display Braille but also incorporate advanced computer vision algorithms to interpret visual data. The glasses would be equipped with a camera that captures the environment, translating images into Braille text in real-time. This feature can help the visually impaired navigate their surroundings more easily, identify objects, and read signs or digital displays.",
    "**Tactile Feedback Text-to-Speech (TFTS) System**: Create a wearable device that integrates tactile feedback with traditional text-to-speech technology. Users can input text or voice commands, and the system converts this information into spoken words and subtle vibrations on various parts of the body. Different patterns of vibration could correspond to different letters or sounds, allowing users to feel and \"read\" text through touch.",
    "**Interactive Braille Tactile Maps**: Develop large-scale, interactive tactile maps that use raised Braille and other tactile elements to represent geographical information. These maps could be used in public spaces like airports, train stations, and museums. They could also be customized with user preferences, such as highlighting important locations or routes.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Accessibility Training Platform**: Build a VR application that immerses users in various environments they might encounter daily, such as supermarkets, airports, or public transportation. The platform would include audio and tactile feedback, guiding users through tasks like reading signs, navigating, and using ATMs or vending machines. It would be particularly useful for blind individuals to learn and practice new skills in a controlled, risk-free setting.",
    "**Voice-Activated Personalized Audio Descriptions**: Create a system where users can listen to audio descriptions of scenes, events, or places through a smartphone app or smart speaker. The system uses AI to understand context and provide detailed descriptions tailored to the user's interests and learning style. For example, it could describe art exhibits, movies, or historical sites, helping the visually impaired gain insights into visual content without relying solely on textual descriptions."
