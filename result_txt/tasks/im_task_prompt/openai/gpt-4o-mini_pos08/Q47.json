    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning feature for its filters and brushes. This could involve a built-in system that uses a combination of heat and vibration to dislodge dirt and debris from the brushes and filters after each use, ensuring maximum suction power and reducing maintenance needs for the user.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Introduce a feature that allows the vacuum cleaner to switch to an eco-friendly mode. This mode would reduce power consumption by using less energy while still providing effective cleaning. Additionally, the vacuum could utilize biodegradable dust bags or filters made from sustainable materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Combine the vacuum cleaner with an air purification system. As the vacuum cleans the floors, it would also filter the air in the room, capturing allergens, dust, and pollutants. This dual-functionality would provide a cleaner environment, making it especially appealing for households with pets or allergies.",
    "**Personalized Cleaning Profiles**: Allow users to create personalized cleaning profiles that adjust the vacuum's settings based on specific needs. For example, a pet owner could set a profile that increases suction power for pet hair, while a user with hardwood floors could adjust the brush settings to avoid scratching. These profiles could be saved and easily switched based on the cleaning task at hand.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) interface that provides real-time feedback on cleaning performance. Users could wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to visualize areas that need more attention, see where dirt has been collected, or even receive tips on maintaining cleanliness in specific areas of their home."
