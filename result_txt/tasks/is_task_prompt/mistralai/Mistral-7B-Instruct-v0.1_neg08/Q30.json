    "The dragon was not afraid of fire, but rather of being the only one who could not breathe it.",
    "The dragon's fear of fire was not due to its power, but rather to its lack of control over it.",
    "The dragon's fear of fire was not a fear of being consumed, but rather of being left alone.",
    "The dragon's fear of fire was not a fear of being burned, but rather of being left in the dark.",
    "The dragon's fear of fire was not a fear of being destroyed, but rather of being left alone in the world."
