    "Beach Volleyball: Instead of sand, we can play beach volleyball on a court made of a different surface, such as grass or synthetic turf. This would allow for a different kind of gameplay and would still provide a fun and active way to enjoy the beach.",
    "Beach Picnic: Without sand, we could set up a picnic on the beach with blankets, cushions, and other seating options. We could enjoy a meal, read books, or simply relax and enjoy the sun and ocean views.",
    "Beach Yoga: We could practice yoga on the beach, using mats or other surfaces to create a comfortable and relaxing environment. The sound of the waves and the fresh air would provide a peaceful atmosphere for yoga.",
    "Beach Board Games: We could set up a board game area on the beach, using tables and chairs to create a comfortable and fun space to play games with friends and family.",
    "Beach Scavenger Hunt: We could organize a scavenger hunt on the beach, with clues and challenges that lead us to explore different areas of the beach and learn more about its history and features."
