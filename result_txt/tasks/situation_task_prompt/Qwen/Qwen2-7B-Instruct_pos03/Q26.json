    "**Star Navigation:** In the absence of maps and modern navigation systems, using celestial navigation could be a viable method to find one's way. One could learn the constellations visible in their area, and use the North Star (Polaris) as a reference point. The angle between Polaris and the horizon can be used to determine latitude. To find direction, one would need to know the time of day and use the position of the sun or stars to gauge north, south, east, and west.",
    "**Natural Landmarks:** Nature provides countless natural landmarks that can guide you back to familiar locations. Trees, mountains, rivers, coastlines, and other geographical features serve as reference points. Over time, one can memorize these landmarks and their relative positions to create an internal map. This method would require careful observation and a keen memory, but it is feasible for short distances and within well-known environments.",
    "**Historical Routes:** Learning about historical routes and paths used by people in the past can be another method. Ancient trade routes, migration paths, and traditional ways of traveling can provide a framework for navigation. By understanding the history of a region, one might be able to deduce the general direction and major waypoints along such routes. This requires research and understanding of local history.",
    "**Mental Maps:** Developing a mental map involves visualizing your surroundings in your mind, including streets, buildings, and landmarks. With practice, this skill can become quite accurate, allowing one to navigate even unfamiliar areas without physical maps. It requires spatial intelligence and visualization skills, which can be improved through regular training.",
    "**Simple Tools and Devices:** While modern technology is missing, there are simple tools and devices that could still assist in navigation. For example, a compass can be used to determine direction, especially if paired with a sundial for more precise timekeeping. A map made from paper or carved into wood can also serve as a guide, though its accuracy would depend on how well it was created and updated. These methods combine traditional knowledge and simple tools to overcome the absence of digital navigation systems."
