    "**Eco-Friendly Coat Hanger Manufacturing Process:** Create a coat hanger manufacturing process that emphasizes sustainability. This could involve using recycled materials for the hangers, implementing energy-efficient machinery, and reducing waste through recycling processes. Additionally, the design could be modular or adjustable, allowing users to reuse the hanger for various clothing items over time.",
    "**Interactive Art Installation:** Transform a series of coat hangers into an interactive art installation. Each hanger can represent a different emotion or story, with the user hanging their own personal item (like a scarf or hat) on it. The installation could be displayed in public spaces, encouraging community participation and dialogue around emotional expression.",
    "**Personalized Coat Hanger Customization Service:** Offer a service where customers can customize their coat hangers according to their preferences. This could include options like color, material, and even adding a personalized message or logo. The custom coat hangers could then be delivered directly to the customer's home or office, providing a unique and thoughtful gift option.",
    "**Vertical Garden Hanger System:** Design a coat hanger system that doubles as a vertical garden. The hangers can be attached to a wall-mounted frame filled with soil and small plants. This innovative design not only saves space but also brings greenery indoors, improving air quality and adding a touch of nature to any room.",
    "**Portable Coat Hanger for Travelers:** Develop a compact, lightweight, and collapsible coat hanger specifically designed for travelers. The hanger would have a small footprint when folded and could easily attach to hotel or Airbnb hooks. It could also come with additional features like a shoe holder or a small pocket for storing small items, making it a versatile travel accessory."
