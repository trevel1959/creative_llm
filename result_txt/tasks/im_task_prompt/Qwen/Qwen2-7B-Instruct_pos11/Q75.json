    "**Innovative Sandwich Creation Station**: Create a sandwich toaster that comes with multiple interchangeable plates or molds to create various shapes and designs for sandwiches. For instance, you could have heart-shaped molds for Valentine's Day, star-shaped ones for children, or intricate patterns for special occasions. The machine would be designed to hold these different plates, allowing users to choose which design they want for their sandwich.",
    "**Smart Toasting Functionality**: Integrate smart technology into the sandwich toaster. It could connect to your smartphone via an app where you can customize your sandwich recipes, select cooking times and temperatures, and even receive notifications when your sandwich is ready. This would allow for more precision in cooking and personalization of meals.",
    "**Healthier Sandwich Option**: Develop a sandwich toaster that uses healthier cooking methods like air frying or steaming instead of just toasting. This could include a built-in fan to circulate hot air for air frying or a water reservoir for steaming. This would cater to health-conscious consumers who want to enjoy sandwiches without compromising on taste but wanting to make healthier choices.",
    "**Multi-functional Sandwich Maker**: Design a sandwich toaster that can also perform other kitchen tasks, such as toasting bread, making grilled cheese, heating up leftovers, or even lightly browning slices of potatoes or zucchini. By adding a few additional settings and features, this appliance can replace several others in the kitchen, providing greater convenience and space-saving benefits.",
    "**Sustainable Sandwich Solution**: Create an eco-friendly sandwich toaster that is made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. It could also feature energy-efficient components to reduce power consumption. Additionally, the toaster could come with reusable silicone bags or wraps to store the cooked sandwiches, promoting sustainability by reducing waste and single-use plastics."
