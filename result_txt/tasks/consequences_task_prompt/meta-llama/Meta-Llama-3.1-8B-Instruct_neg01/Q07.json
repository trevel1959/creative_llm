    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The Internet plays a crucial role in modern commerce, enabling fast and secure transactions across the globe. Without it, international trade would come to a grinding halt, leading to widespread economic devastation. Supply chains would be disrupted, businesses would struggle to operate, and unemployment rates would skyrocket. The loss of e-commerce platforms would also result in the closure of many small businesses, further exacerbating the economic crisis.",
    "**Disruption of Critical Infrastructure**: The Internet is a backbone for many critical infrastructure systems, including power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare services. Without it, these systems would be severely impaired, leading to power outages, transportation disruptions, and a breakdown in healthcare services. This would have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with disabilities.",
    "**Loss of Access to Information**: The Internet has democratized access to information, allowing people to access knowledge, news, and educational resources from anywhere in the world. Without it, people would be cut off from this wealth of information, leading to a decline in education, innovation, and critical thinking. This would have a particularly devastating impact on developing countries, where access to information is already limited.",
    "**Social Unrest and Civil Unrest**: The Internet has enabled people to connect with each other and mobilize around social causes. Without it, social movements and activism would be severely hindered, leading to increased social unrest and civil unrest. This could lead to a breakdown in social order, with potential consequences including violence, protests, and even civil war.",
    "**Loss of Personal Identity and Connection**: The Internet has enabled people to connect with others across the globe, forming online communities and friendships. Without it, people would be isolated from their online networks, leading to a loss of personal identity and connection. This could have a profound impact on mental health, with potential consequences including depression, anxiety, and loneliness.
