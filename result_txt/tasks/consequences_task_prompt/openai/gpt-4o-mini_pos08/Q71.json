    "**Resource Allocation Crisis**: Immortality would place unprecedented pressure on Earth's resources. With an ever-increasing population that does not die, essential resources such as food, water, and energy could become scarce. This would necessitate new systems for resource management, including innovative agricultural practices, sustainable living, and perhaps even colonization of other planets. Societies might need to implement strict population control measures or create a system of resource rationing, leading to ethical dilemmas and potential conflict.",
    "**Shift in Values and Priorities**: The perception of life and death shapes human values. If immortality were achieved, values around family, relationships, and personal achievements could change significantly. People might prioritize experiences over material possessions, leading to a rise in travel, adventure, and exploration. Conversely, some might become complacent, viewing life as a never-ending cycle without urgency, which could diminish motivation and ambition.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Living indefinitely could have profound psychological effects on individuals. While some might find joy in endless opportunities, others could struggle with ennui, existential crises, or the weight of their accumulated experiences. Mental health support systems would need to adapt to address issues related to long-term living, such as chronic depression, anxiety, or the fear of losing loved ones who choose not to pursue immortality.",
    "**Cultural and Ethical Dilemmas**: The implications of immortality would raise significant ethical questions. Who gets access to immortality? Would it be a privilege for the wealthy, or would it be available to everyone? This could lead to a new form of social stratification based on life expectancy. Additionally, cultural narratives around life, death, and legacy would be challenged, potentially leading to a clash between those who embrace immortality and those who believe in the natural cycle of life.",
    "**Impact on Innovation and Progress**: With individuals living indefinitely, the pace of innovation could accelerate. People would have more time to dedicate to research and development, leading to breakthroughs in technology, science, and the arts. However, this could also result in stagnation, as established figures may resist new ideas from younger generations, leading to a potential generational divide in thought and creativity."
