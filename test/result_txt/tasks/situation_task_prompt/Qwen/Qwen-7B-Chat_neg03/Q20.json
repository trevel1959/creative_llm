    "Travel by boat: If planes were not available, people could travel to another continent by boat. This would involve taking a long journey on a ship that would transport passengers across vast oceans. The experience would be different from traveling by plane, as passengers would have to spend several days or weeks on the water. However, it would also offer an opportunity to see new sights and cultures along the way.",
    "Travel by train: Another option for traveling to another continent without planes would be to take a train. Trains are already in use for long-distance travel within many countries, and some even cross international borders. With the right infrastructure in place, trains could potentially be used to transport people across continents. The journey would likely take longer than flying, but it would also provide a unique and immersive travel experience.",
    "Travel by camel: For those who prefer a more traditional mode of transportation, camels could be used to travel to another continent. Camels are well-suited to desert environments and can carry heavy loads over long distances. They are also known for their endurance and resilience, making them ideal for long journeys. However, this method of travel would require specialized equipment and training, and it may not be suitable for everyone.",
    "Travel by bicycle: For a more environmentally friendly option, people could travel to another continent by bicycle. Bicycles are already widely used for short-distance travel within cities, and they could potentially be used for longer trips as well. However, this method of travel would require careful planning and preparation, as it would be challenging to transport bicycles over long distances.",
    "Travel by foot: For the most adventurous travelers, walking could be used to travel to another continent. Walking is a low-cost and sustainable form of transportation that allows people to connect with nature and experience new cultures firsthand. It would also be a great way to improve physical fitness and mental health. However, walking across large distances would be physically demanding and would require a lot of preparation and planning."
