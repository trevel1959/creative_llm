    "**Wildlife Conflicts**: Increased human activity in national parks can lead to conflicts with wildlife, such as bears or coyotes, which may become habituated to human presence and food sources. This can result in dangerous encounters and potential harm to both visitors and animals. Implementing strict food storage regulations, providing educational materials about wildlife safety, and conducting regular patrols can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints that can hinder maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. Insufficient funding can lead to deteriorating facilities, lack of ranger presence, and inadequate protection for endangered species. Establishing partnerships with local businesses, launching fundraising campaigns, and promoting volunteer programs can help supplement resources and maintain park infrastructure.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: National parks are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, altered ecosystems, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. These changes can threaten biodiversity and disrupt recreational activities. Park management can address this by developing adaptive management strategies, such as habitat restoration projects, climate resilience planning, and collaborating with scientists to monitor ecological changes.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems, outcompeting native flora and fauna and altering habitats. This can lead to decreased biodiversity and changes in ecosystem functions. To combat this, park managers can implement monitoring programs to identify invasive species early, develop control measures, and educate visitors about the importance of preventing the spread of invasive plants and animals.",
    "**Infrastructure Deterioration**: Aging infrastructure, such as trails, bridges, and visitor centers, can pose safety risks and diminish the visitor experience. Insufficient maintenance can lead to accidents and injuries. To address this, park management can conduct regular assessments of infrastructure, prioritize repairs based on safety and visitor impact, and seek grants or partnerships for funding renovation projects."
