    "Use a boat: If all bridges have collapsed, one of the most practical ways to cross a river would be to use a boat. You could either build your own boat using materials available in the area or use an existing one. If you don't have access to a boat, you could try to find a canoe or kayak that you could use to paddle across the river.",
    "Use a rope bridge: If you have access to some strong ropes and a secure point on the other side of the river, you could create a makeshift rope bridge to cross the river. This would require some technical skills and a lot of patience, but it could be a viable option.",
    "Use a raft: If you have access to some wooden planks or other materials, you could build a raft to cross the river. This would require some technical skills and a lot of patience, but it could be a viable option.",
    "Use a zip line: If you have access to a tall tree or other structure on the other side of the river, you could create a zip line to cross the river. This would require some technical skills and a lot of patience, but it could be a viable option.",
    "Use a floating platform: If you have access to some strong materials and a secure point on the other side of the river, you could build a floating platform to cross the river. This would require some technical skills and a lot of patience, but it could be a viable option."
