    "**Financing and Cost Barriers**: While solar panels can reduce energy costs in the long run, the upfront costs can be prohibitive for many homeowners. Even with incentives and rebates, the initial investment may be too high for low-income families. This could create disparities where only wealthier residents can afford to install solar panels, exacerbating social inequalities and leaving lower-income neighborhoods behind in the green energy transition.",
    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: The installation of solar panels may face various regulatory challenges, including zoning laws, building codes, and homeowners' association (HOA) restrictions. Navigating these regulations can be time-consuming and may lead to delays or denials of installation permits. Additionally, differing regulations across neighborhoods could create confusion and frustration among residents.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Issues**: Once installed, solar panels require regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Homeowners may not have the knowledge or resources to maintain the systems properly, leading to reduced efficiency over time. Furthermore, if a panel is damaged (due to weather, accidents, etc.), the cost and logistics of repairs could deter homeowners from proceeding with installation.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Manufacturing**: While solar panels are often seen as environmentally friendly, the manufacturing process involves significant resource extraction and energy consumption. The production of solar panels can result in pollution and waste, raising concerns about the overall sustainability of widespread solar adoption. Communities may face backlash if the environmental costs of production are not adequately addressed.",
    "**Grid Integration Challenges**: Integrating a large number of solar panels into the existing electrical grid poses technical challenges. Increased solar energy generation can lead to grid instability, particularly if energy storage solutions are not implemented effectively. Utility companies may struggle to manage the fluctuating energy supply, leading to potential outages or increased energy costs for consumers."
