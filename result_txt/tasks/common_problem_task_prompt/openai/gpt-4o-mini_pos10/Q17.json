    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new facilities and the increase in tourism can lead to significant environmental degradation. Issues such as pollution, habitat destruction, and increased carbon footprints may arise. To mitigate these effects, host cities can implement strict environmental regulations, promote green building practices, and invest in sustainable technologies. They could also offset carbon emissions through tree planting initiatives and encourage the use of public transport during the games.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Large international events like the Olympics can attract security threats, including terrorism and civil unrest. Ensuring the safety of athletes, officials, and spectators is paramount. Host cities must develop comprehensive security plans that involve collaboration with local law enforcement and international agencies. This could include advanced surveillance systems, crowd control measures, and thorough background checks for staff and volunteers.",
    "**Economic Disparity**: While hosting the Olympics can boost local economies, it can also exacerbate economic disparities. Wealthy areas may benefit more from tourism, while less affluent neighborhoods may not see any significant economic gains. To address this, the organizing committee can create programs that ensure a fair distribution of resources, such as investing in local businesses, providing job training for residents, and ensuring that facilities are accessible to all community members.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusion**: Hosting an international event requires an understanding of diverse cultures and the potential for cultural insensitivity. Misunderstandings or disrespect towards local customs can lead to backlash from both locals and international visitors. To promote inclusivity, the organizing committee can engage local communities in the planning process, celebrate local traditions during the event, and provide cultural training for staff and volunteers.",
    "**Post-Olympics Legacy**: After the Olympics, many host cities struggle with what to do with the venues and infrastructure built for the games. There is often a risk of facilities becoming \"white elephants,\" underutilized and costly to maintain. To prevent this, cities can develop long-term plans for the use of Olympic venues, such as converting sports facilities into community centers, schools, or affordable housing. This approach not only preserves the investment but also benefits the local population."
