    "**Life Support Systems**: Ensuring the spaceship can support human life for extended periods is crucial. Problems may arise in creating efficient systems for air filtration, water recycling, and food storage. Any failure in these systems could lead to life-threatening situations. Additionally, designers must consider psychological factors, such as crew isolation and confinement, which could affect mental health during long missions.",
    "**Propulsion Technology**: Selecting the right propulsion system is essential for the spaceship's efficiency and capability. Traditional rocket engines may not be sufficient for long-duration space travel. Emerging technologies like ion drives or nuclear thermal propulsion could be considered, but they come with their own set of challenges, such as complexity, safety concerns, and the need for extensive testing.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: In the vastness of space, navigation becomes complex, especially when traveling to distant planets or asteroids. Issues may arise in developing reliable navigation systems that can function without constant input from Earth. Communication delays could hinder mission control's ability to assist astronauts in real-time, necessitating autonomous systems that can operate independently.",
    "**Cost Management and Funding**: Designing a spaceship is an expensive endeavor, and securing adequate funding can be a significant hurdle. Budget overruns, unexpected technical challenges, and changes in project scope can lead to financial strain. Finding investors or government support while maintaining transparency and accountability is a critical issue that could affect the project's viability.",
    "**Safety Protocols and Emergency Preparedness**: Space travel involves inherent risks, and developing robust safety protocols is essential. Potential problems include designing effective emergency escape systems, ensuring redundancy in critical systems, and training the crew for various emergency scenarios. Any oversight in these areas could lead to catastrophic failures during the mission."
