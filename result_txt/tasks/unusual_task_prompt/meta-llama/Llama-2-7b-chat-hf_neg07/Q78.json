    "A wine glass with a built-in wine aerator: This wine glass would have a small mechanism inside that would slowly and evenly aerate the wine as you drink, allowing you to enjoy the full flavor and aroma of the wine without having to pour it into a separate aerator.",
    "A wine glass with a temperature control system: This wine glass would have a built-in heating or cooling element that would allow you to adjust the temperature of the wine to your liking. This would be particularly useful for red wines that benefit from being served at a certain temperature.",
    "A wine glass with a built-in UV light: This wine glass would have a small UV light built into the stem that would enhance the flavors and aromas of the wine by breaking down the molecular structure of the wine. This would allow you to experience the wine in a completely new way and bring out its full potential.",
    "A wine glass with a built-in wine preservation system: This wine glass would have a built-in cooling system that would keep the wine at the perfect serving temperature, even after the glass has been sitting out for a while. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy wine but don't want to waste it by serving it at the wrong temperature.",
    "A wine glass with a built-in wine tasting tool: This wine glass would have a small tool built into the stem that would allow you to taste the wine more effectively. For example, the tool could have different shapes and sizes that would help you identify the different flavors and aromas of the wine, or it could have a built-in magnifying glass to help you see the wine more clearly. This would make it easier and more enjoyable to taste and appreciate different types of wine."
