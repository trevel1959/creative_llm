    "**Gardening Helper**: Tennis balls can be repurposed into a gardening tool. By cutting off the head of a tennis racket, attaching a long handle, and inserting a tennis ball into the open end, you can create a lightweight, aerodynamic tool for moving soil, mixing compost, or aerating soil. The ball's shape allows for easy digging and loosening of soil without damaging plant roots.",
    "**DIY Massage Tool**: Tennis balls can provide a simple, affordable, and portable solution for self-massage. By placing the tennis ball under various body parts (such as the back, neck, or legs), individuals can apply pressure and perform myofascial release, which helps in relieving muscle tension and improving flexibility. It's especially useful for areas that are hard to reach or access with traditional massage tools.",
    "**Crafting Material**: Tennis balls can be utilized as a creative medium for crafting. Artists can paint, decorate, or cover tennis balls with materials like fabric, glitter, or even recycled items to create unique decorative items. These can be used as part of home decor, such as on wreaths, as part of a mobile, or as a fun addition to DIY projects.",
    "**Educational Toy**: Tennis balls can serve as an educational toy for children learning about physics, balance, and stability. By filling a clear plastic container with water and balancing a tennis ball on top, children can experiment with different ways to move the container without spilling the water or causing the ball to fall. This activity encourages problem-solving and understanding of concepts like force, friction, and center of gravity.",
    "**Camping Gear**: Tennis balls can be adapted for camping purposes, particularly for creating a comfortable sleeping surface. By stuffing tennis balls into a large, durable fabric bag and then using this bag as a pillow or cushion, campers can enjoy a softer, more comfortable sleep. The tennis balls distribute weight evenly, providing support while also being less prone to punctures than foam or air-filled alternatives."
