    "Use a handwritten letter: In the event that all electronic communication ceases, the most traditional and reliable method of communication would be to send a handwritten letter. This would require researching the address of the person you want to contact, obtaining stamps, and sending the letter through the mail. While this method may be slow, it is still a viable option to communicate with someone in another country. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Use a satellite phone: If you have access to a satellite phone, you can use it to make a phone call or send a text message to someone in another country. However, this method may be expensive and limited to areas with satellite phone coverage. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Use a physical map: In the absence of electronic communication, you can use a physical map to determine the best route to travel to the person's location. This may require researching the country's geography, transportation options, and any potential barriers such as mountains or rivers. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use a carrier pigeon: While this method may seem far-fetched, it is actually possible to send messages through carrier pigeons.
