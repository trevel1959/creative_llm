    "1 (a) For someone who has a hard time looking at the computer screen for a long time, mouse with 4K resolution and extra-large display would be a good choice. It would provide a comfortable viewing experience while being able to accurately target small or distant objects with precision and no flicker in the display.",
    "2 (b) For a gamer, gaming mouse with precision aiming and a DPI accuracy can give a great competitive advantage while playing games. It's also ergonomic with an ambidextrous design making it suitable for both left and right handed users. The high-resolution DPI accuracy and low latency helps them to move quickly through complex tasks and take out enemies before they take out their guns!",
    "What kind of material would you like your computer mouse to be made from?",
    "1 (a) If I was to choose a material for my mouse it would be titanium because the strength to density ratio is very high and it doesn't corrode over time like steel and aluminum do. This makes titanium strong, lightweight, and durable; all of which would be desirable qualities in a computer mouse. Additionally, titanium doesn't generate heat very well which means your fingers won't get hot when holding the mouse for hours on end.",
    "2 (b) If I was to choose another material, I would choose diamond because it's incredibly hard and lightweight because of its low density. It also won't melt or corrode so there's less chance of heat related problems like melting plastic on an old mouse over time. With its hardness it will last a long time too without getting scratched or dented as easily as some other materials such as glass or metal"
