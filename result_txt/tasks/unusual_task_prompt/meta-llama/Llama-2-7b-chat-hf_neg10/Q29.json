    "Snooze-a-Palooza: Turn your alarm clock into a fun, interactive game by adding a snooze button that triggers a surprise sound or animation each time you hit it. You could also include a \"snooze challenge\" where you have to complete a mini task or puzzle before the snooze function will work again.",
    "Time Traveler's Alarm: Create an alarm clock that simulates a time travel experience. When the alarm goes off, the clock could display a different time and location each day, such as a different city or country, to help you wake up feeling like you're traveling the world.",
    "Artistic Alarm: Turn your alarm clock into a creative canvas by adding a touch-sensitive display that allows you to draw or paint on the clock face. You could also include a feature that allows you to set an alarm with a personalized image or message.",
    "Music Maker Alarm: Create an alarm clock that allows you to compose and record your own music. When the alarm goes off, the clock could play your custom composition, or you could even share it with friends and family.",
    "Smart Alarm: Develop an alarm clock that learns your sleep patterns and adjusts the time and volume of the alarm accordingly. For example, if you consistently wake up at the same time on weekends, the clock could automatically adjust the alarm to a more gentle volume to help you wake up feeling refreshed and relaxed."
