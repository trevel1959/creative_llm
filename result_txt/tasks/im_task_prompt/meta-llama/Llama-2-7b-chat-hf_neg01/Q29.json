    "Smart Lawn Mower: Develop a lawn mower that can detect and adjust its cutting height based on the type of grass it's mowing. This feature would not only make mowing more efficient but also help prevent over- or under-cutting, leading to a healthier lawn.",
    "Automated Lawn Mower: Create a self-driving lawn mower that can navigate around obstacles and adjust its cutting pattern based on the shape of the lawn. This would save time and effort for homeowners, especially those with large or complex lawns.",
    "Multi-Tool Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower with multiple attachments, such as a tiller, edger, and aerator, allowing homeowners to complete multiple tasks with just one machine. This would reduce the need for multiple tools and make lawn care more efficient.",
    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Develop a lawn mower that runs on solar energy, eliminating the need for gasoline or electricity. This would not only reduce environmental impact but also save homeowners money on fuel costs.",
    "Virtual Reality Lawn Mower: Create a virtual reality (VR) experience that simulates the process of mowing a lawn. Users could put on a VR headset and practice mowing a virtual lawn, receiving instant feedback on their technique and accuracy. This could be especially helpful for those who are new to lawn mowing or have difficulty with the physical demands of the task."
