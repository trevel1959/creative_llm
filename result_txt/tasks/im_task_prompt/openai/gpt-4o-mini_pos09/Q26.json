    "**Odor-Neutralizing System**: Enhance the trash can with an integrated odor-neutralizing system. This could include a charcoal filter or an essential oil dispenser that automatically releases pleasant scents when the lid is closed. This feature would be particularly beneficial for kitchens or areas where food waste is prevalent, keeping the environment fresh and inviting.",
    "**Composting Compartment**: Design a trash can with a built-in composting compartment. This could include a separate section for organic waste, equipped with ventilation and moisture control to facilitate composting. Users could easily separate their compostable waste, and the design could include a removable bin for easy transfer to a garden or compost pile.",
    "**Interactive Recycling Guide**: Create a trash can with an interactive screen or app integration that provides users with information on how to properly dispose of different types of waste. This could include a QR code scanner for users to scan items, which would then give them information on whether the item is recyclable, compostable, or should go in the general waste. This would help promote better recycling habits.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Develop a trash can that serves multiple purposes, such as a recycling station, compost bin, and general waste container, all in one. Each compartment could have a distinct design and color to help users easily identify where to dispose of each type of waste. The can could also include a foldable design for easy storage when not in use.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Innovate a trash can that has a self-cleaning mechanism. Using UV-C light technology, the trash can could sanitize its interior after each use, reducing the risk of bacteria and odors. This feature would be particularly useful in high-traffic areas or homes with pets, ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment."
