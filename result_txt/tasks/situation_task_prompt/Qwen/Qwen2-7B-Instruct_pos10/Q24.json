    "**Development of a New Sensory Enhancement Device:** In this scenario, a new type of technology is developed that enhances other senses for those who rely on their vision. For instance, wearable devices could use advanced audio processing to describe scenes and objects around them, effectively converting visual information into sound cues. This device might also include haptic feedback, allowing users to feel textures and shapes through vibrations.",
    "**Incorporation of Braille and Tactile Reading:** Since traditional reading is not an option, the creation of tactile books or digital platforms using braille would be necessary. This could involve embossing text onto surfaces or creating high-resolution 3D printed versions of written content. Additionally, interactive tactile maps and diagrams can help people navigate spaces and understand complex information.",
    "**Enhanced Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants:** The absence of glasses might lead to a greater reliance on hearing aids and cochlear implants. These technologies can significantly improve hearing abilities, potentially making up for the loss of visual information. They could be integrated with AI systems that analyze environmental sounds and provide contextual information to the user.",
    "**Immersive Virtual Reality Environments:** With no glasses or contacts, individuals could utilize VR technology to experience life-like simulations. VR environments could be designed to cater to various needs, from learning and education to entertainment and leisure activities. Users could explore virtual worlds, attend virtual events, and interact with others without relying on physical vision.",
    "**Adaptation of Traditional Navigation Techniques:** Historically, many cultures have relied on oral traditions, landmarks, and other non-visual methods for navigation. People could learn these techniques and adapt them to modern contexts. For example, they could develop apps that use voice commands and spoken directions based on GPS data, helping them navigate unfamiliar environments safely and efficiently."
