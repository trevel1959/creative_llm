    "One idea would be to use alternative sources of energy such as solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal energy to generate electricity for essential appliances and lighting.",
    "Another idea would be to rely on natural light and ventilation, and to use manual labor to perform tasks that typically require electricity, such as cooking and cleaning.",
    "A third idea would be to find ways to conserve energy, such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation oring instead of driving.",
    "A fourth idea would be to focus on developing new technologies and innovations that are more sustainable and less reliant on electricity, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy sources.",
    "A fifth idea would be to create a community-based system where people share resources and work together to find solutions, such as using communal solar panels or wind turbines, and sharing tools and equipment."
