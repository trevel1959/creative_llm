    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Sleeves**: Create a sweater with detachable sleeves that can be swapped out for different styles or materials. For instance, a wearer could choose between long sleeves, short sleeves, or even a cape-like design, allowing for customization based on occasion, temperature, or personal style.",
    "**Built-in Charging Pockets**: Incorporate hidden pockets with solar panels or kinetic energy chargers that can power small devices like smartphones or earbuds. This would make the sweater not only a fashion statement but also a practical accessory for tech-savvy individuals on the go.",
    "**Mood-Reflective Color Changing Yarn**: Utilize color-changing yarn that reacts to the wearer’s body temperature or even emotional state, changing colors based on warmth or skin contact. This would create a unique, personalized look and could serve as a fun way to express mood without saying a word.",
    "**Integrated Wearable Technology**: Design a sweater that includes built-in health monitoring sensors that track heart rate, body temperature, and even stress levels. The data could be synced with a mobile app to provide insights into the wearer’s health and wellness, encouraging a proactive approach to self-care.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a fabric that uses nanotechnology to create a self-cleaning effect, repelling dirt and stains while also being biodegradable. This would not only reduce the need for frequent washing (saving water and energy) but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers."
