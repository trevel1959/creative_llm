    "Underwater Cities: Another option for dealing with rising ocean levels is to build underwater cities. This would involve constructing cities that are designed to be self-sufficient and capable of supporting human life underwater. These cities could be built using advanced technologies and materials, and would need to be equipped with all the necessary infrastructure, such as power generation, waste management, and communication systems.",
    "Coastal Retreat: A third option for dealing with rising ocean levels is to retreat from the coastline and establish new settlements further inland. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and planning, but could provide a more sustainable long-term solution to the problem of rising sea levels.",
    "Sea Wall Construction: A fourth option is to construct sea walls to protect coastal communities from the effects of rising tides and storm surges. These walls could be built using a variety of materials, such as concrete or metal, and would need to be regularly maintained and updated to ensure their effectiveness.",
    "Delta Island Creation: Another option is to create new islands in coastal deltas, which could be used to support human settlements. This would require significant investment in engineering and construction, but could provide a stable, elevated environment protected from the effects of rising sea levels.",
    "Oceanic Platforms: A sixth option is to create oceanic platforms that could be used to support human settlements. These platforms could be constructed using a variety of materials, such as concrete or metal, and would need to be anchored to the ocean floor. They could be used to support a variety of activities, such as fishing, tourism, or even research."
