    "**Augmented Reality Windshield**: Implement an augmented reality (AR) windshield that displays real-time information such as navigation, speed, and vehicle diagnostics directly onto the glass. This could include overlays for road signs, lane markings, and hazard warnings, making it easier for drivers to stay informed without taking their eyes off the road. The AR system could also highlight points of interest, like restaurants or gas stations, as the car approaches them.",
    "**Personalized Cabin Environment**: Create a cabin environment that adjusts to individual passengers' preferences. Using biometric sensors, the car could analyze the mood and comfort levels of each passenger and adjust the temperature, lighting, and even the scent in the cabin. For example, if a passenger appears stressed, the car could dim the lights, play calming music, and release a soothing lavender scent.",
    "**Interactive AI Co-Driver**: Develop an advanced AI co-driver that not only assists with navigation and vehicle control but also engages in conversation with passengers. This AI could learn the interests of the passengers and suggest music, podcasts, or even trivia games to make the journey more enjoyable. It could also provide real-time updates on traffic conditions and suggest alternative routes while keeping the conversation flowing.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Smart Tires**: Design smart tires that can adapt to various road conditions and optimize fuel efficiency. These tires would be equipped with sensors that monitor tire pressure, tread wear, and temperature, providing real-time feedback to the driver. Additionally, they could change their tread pattern based on weather conditions (e.g., becoming more grippy in rain) and could even have a self-repairing feature for minor punctures.",
    "**Modular Interior Design**: Create a modular interior design that allows for customizable seating and storage arrangements. Passengers could rearrange seats or add modules like a mini-fridge, a workspace, or additional storage as needed. This would be particularly useful for families or individuals who use their cars for various purposes, such as commuting, road trips, or outdoor adventures."
