    "**Power Supply Issues**: Choosing an appropriate power source for the robot can be problematic. If the robot relies on batteries, issues such as battery life, charging time, and the weight of the batteries could hinder its performance. Alternatively, if the robot is designed to be tethered to a power source, mobility could be compromised. A creative solution could involve developing a hybrid power system that utilizes both solar panels and rechargeable batteries to enhance autonomy.",
    "**Software Integration**: The integration of software for the robot's operation may present significant challenges. Ensuring that the robot's hardware and software communicate effectively is crucial. Bugs or compatibility issues could lead to malfunctions. To address this, a modular software design approach could be adopted, allowing different components to be tested and updated independently, thus minimizing the risk of widespread failures.",
    "**User Interface and Experience**: Designing an intuitive user interface for controlling the robot can be problematic. If the controls are too complicated, users may struggle to operate the robot effectively, leading to frustration and potential accidents. A possible solution is to implement a gesture-based control system that uses motion sensors, allowing users to interact with the robot in a natural and engaging way.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Ensuring the safety of both the robot and its surroundings is a significant concern. Robots can pose risks to humans and animals if they malfunction or operate unexpectedly. Implementing multiple layers of safety protocols, such as emergency stop buttons, obstacle detection systems, and regular maintenance checks, could mitigate these risks and enhance overall safety.",
    "**Environmental Adaptability**: The robot may face difficulties adapting to various environments. For instance, a robot designed for indoor use may struggle with outdoor conditions like rain or uneven terrain. To tackle this issue, creating a versatile robot with adjustable features or interchangeable parts could allow it to adapt to different environments effectively."
