    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Settings**:    Design ski poles with an adjustable length mechanism that remembers the preferred settings of the user. Using a simple button press, skiers could switch between their favorite lengths for different terrains (e.g., steep slopes vs. flat areas). This feature could be particularly useful for skiers who share poles or for those who transition between different styles of skiing.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Heat Functionality**:    Create ski poles with an ergonomic grip that includes a heating element. This would keep the hands warm on cold days, enhancing comfort and grip. The heating feature could be adjustable and powered by rechargeable batteries, ensuring that skiers can enjoy their time on the slopes without worrying about cold fingers.",
    "**Built-in Avalanche Safety Tools**:    Incorporate essential avalanche safety tools into the ski poles, such as a small beacon or a collapsible shovel that can be deployed in emergencies. This would make the poles not only a tool for skiing but also a vital safety device for backcountry skiing, providing peace of mind to adventurers.",
    "**Multi-Functional Ski Poles with Accessories**:    Design ski poles that can transform into other useful tools when not in use. For example, the poles could have detachable ends that can be used as a small ice pick, a tent stake, or a fishing rod holder. This versatility would appeal to outdoor enthusiasts who appreciate multifunctional gear.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**:    Add reflective materials and LED lights to ski poles for enhanced visibility during low-light conditions or night skiing. This would improve safety by making skiers more visible to others on the slopes. The lights could be activated with a simple switch or set to turn on automatically when it gets dark."
