    "Poaching and wildlife trafficking: Poaching and wildlife trafficking are significant problems in managing a national park. These activities not only threaten the survival of endangered species but also destabilize the ecosystem and negatively impact the livelihoods of local communities that depend on the park's natural resources.",
    "Climate change: Climate change is a major challenge in managing a national park. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can lead to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, and wildfires, which can damage the park's infrastructure and put lives at risk.",
    "Human-wildlife conflict: Human-wildlife conflict is a significant issue in managing a national park. As human populations expand and encroach on the park's borders, they come into conflict with the park's wildlife, leading to crop raiding, property damage, and loss of human and animal lives.",
    "Lack of funding: Funding is a major challenge in managing a national park. Insufficient funding can lead to inadequate maintenance, inadequate staff, and inadequate resources to effectively protect the park and its wildlife.",
    "Illegal activities: Illegal activities such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal waste dumping are significant problems in managing a national park. These activities not only harm the park's ecosystem but also undermine the rule of law and public trust in the park's management."
