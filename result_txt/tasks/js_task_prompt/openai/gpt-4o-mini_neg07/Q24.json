    "**Smart Mobility Hubs**: Transportation would be reimagined through the establishment of smart mobility hubs that seamlessly integrate various modes of transport. These hubs would offer electric bike-sharing, autonomous shuttles, and access to public transit, all powered by renewable energy. Real-time data would inform citizens about the best routes and transportation options, reducing congestion and pollution while promoting a culture of walking and cycling.",
    "**Community-Driven Design**: The city would prioritize community involvement in urban planning through participatory design workshops. Residents would have the opportunity to co-create public spaces, parks, and amenities that reflect their needs and cultural identities. Digital platforms would facilitate ongoing dialogue between citizens and city planners, ensuring that development is inclusive and responsive to community feedback.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Systems**: A circular economy would be at the heart of the cityâ€™s infrastructure, with advanced waste-to-energy systems converting organic waste into clean energy. Biogas plants would process food waste, while recycling facilities would be integrated with composting and upcycling centers. This would not only reduce landfill use but also provide renewable energy for city operations, making the city self-sufficient in energy.",
    "**Biophilic Urban Design**: To enhance the well-being of residents, the city would incorporate biophilic design principles, which connect people to nature. Buildings would feature natural light, water elements, and organic materials. Parks and green corridors would be woven throughout the urban fabric, creating an ecosystem that promotes mental health, reduces stress, and encourages outdoor activities. Community gardens and nature trails would foster a sense of belonging and encourage social interactions.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Zones**: The city would have designated cultural exchange zones that celebrate diversity and promote cross-cultural interactions. These areas would host art installations, performance spaces, and food markets showcasing cuisines from around the world. Regular cultural festivals would encourage residents to share their traditions, fostering inclusivity and understanding among different communities."
