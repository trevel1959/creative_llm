    "**Food Sourcing**: Finding enough food to sustain oneself is crucial for survival. The island may have limited edible resources, and one must identify local fruits, nuts, or edible plants. Fishing or trapping small animals could also be necessary. Setting up a foraging plan and learning about local flora and fauna can help avoid poisonous plants and ensure a balanced diet.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can be dangerous, so building a shelter is essential. One could use fallen branches, leaves, and palm fronds to create a temporary structure that provides protection from rain and wind. The location of the shelter should be chosen carefully to avoid flooding, and it should be situated away from potential hazards like falling branches or wildlife.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: Being rescued is often the ultimate goal when stranded. Creating signals for rescue, such as large SOS signs made from rocks or logs on the beach, can attract the attention of passing ships or planes. Additionally, creating smoke signals using a fire can help increase visibility. Itâ€™s important to consider the best times for signaling, such as during peak travel hours for boats or planes.",
    "**First Aid and Health**: Injuries can occur while navigating the island, and without proper medical supplies, even minor injuries can become serious. Gathering natural remedies from local plants, such as using aloe vera for burns or honey for wounds, can be beneficial. Additionally, one should prioritize hygiene to prevent infections, such as cleaning wounds with fresh water and using leaves as bandages.",
    "**Mental Well-being**: Isolation can take a toll on mental health. To combat feelings of loneliness or despair, one could establish a daily routine that includes physical activity, exploring the island, and practicing mindfulness or meditation. Keeping a journal to document experiences and thoughts can also help maintain a sense of purpose and clarity."
