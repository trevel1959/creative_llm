    "Floating Islands: Another option could be to create floating islands in the ocean. These islands would be built using modular structures, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to changing conditions. They would be equipped with the necessary resources and infrastructure to support a thriving community, including food production, water supply, and waste management systems. Floating islands could offer a unique and sustainable living solution, allowing people to live in harmony with the ocean.",
    "Underwater Cities: Another possibility is to build underwater cities. These cities would be constructed below the water surface, using a combination of concrete and steel structures. They would be designed to withstand the pressure of the water and provide a comfortable living environment. Underwater cities could offer a unique perspective on the world above and provide a sustainable living solution for those who want to escape the rising ocean levels.",
    "Mobile Homes: In a world where ocean levels are rising, mobile homes could become a popular solution for those who want to keep moving. These homes would be designed to be easily transportable and could be built on a series of wheels or floats. They would be equipped with the necessary resources and infrastructure to support a comfortable living environment, allowing people to move from one location to another as the waters rise.",
    "Mountainous Retreat: Another option could be to build a new city in the mountains. This city would be constructed on a series of hills or mountains, providing a safe and secure living environment. The infrastructure would be designed to take advantage of the natural resources and provide a sustainable living solution. This mountainous retreat could become a popular destination for those who want to escape the rising ocean levels.",
    "Seasteads: Seasteads are floating platforms that could be used as a living solution in a world where ocean levels are rising. These platforms would be built using modular structures and could be equipped with the necessary resources and infrastructure to support a thriving community. Seasteads could offer a unique and sustainable living solution, allowing people to live in harmony with the ocean."
