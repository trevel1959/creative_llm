    "**Rainwater Harvesting**: Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. This can be done by installing rooftop rainwater harvesting systems, which collect rainwater from rooftops and store it in underground tanks or cisterns. The water can then be filtered and treated to make it safe for drinking.",
    "**Greywater Recycling**: Greywater is the wastewater that results from activities like showering, washing dishes, and laundry. Greywater can be recycled and treated to remove contaminants and bacteria, making it safe for drinking. This can be achieved using a greywater treatment system that uses natural processes like sand filtration or constructed wetlands.",
    "**Borehole Drilling**: Borehole drilling is the process of drilling a hole into the ground to access underground water sources. The water can then be pumped to the surface and treated to make it safe for drinking. This method can be expensive and requires specialized equipment, but it can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water in areas where surface water sources are polluted.",
    "**Underground Aquifers**: Underground aquifers are natural reservoirs of water that can be accessed by drilling into the ground. The water in these aquifers is often cleaner and safer to drink than surface water sources. Aquifers can be accessed using a drilling rig and a pump to bring the water to the surface.",
    "**Water Purification with Solar Still**: A solar still is a device that uses solar energy to evaporate water and condense the vapor into clean drinking water. This can be an effective method for obtaining clean drinking water in arid environments or areas with limited access to other water sources."
