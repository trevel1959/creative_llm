    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity, which would then be stored in the battery for later use. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices, even if traditional batteries are no longer functioning.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that uses organic matter, such as plants or microorganisms, to generate electricity. For example, a device could be designed to harness the energy produced by photosynthesis in plants, or to use microorganisms to break down organic matter and release electrons. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power, as well as a new way of repurposing waste organic matter.",
    "Thermal Energy Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the heat generated by the Earth's core. This heat could be used to generate electricity through a process called thermoelectricity, which converts heat into electricity. This would provide a reliable source of power, even in areas where traditional batteries are no longer functioning.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that uses magnetic levitation to store energy. This would involve using magnetic fields to levitate tiny objects, such as iron filings, in a vacuum. As the magnetic fields are applied and released, the objects would move back and forth, generating electricity. This would provide a highly efficient and sustainable source of power, as well as a new way of harnessing the energy of magnetic fields.",
    "Graphene Batteries: Create a new type of battery that uses graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material, to store electricity. Graphene batteries would be able to store more energy than traditional batteries, as well as charge faster and last longer. They would also be more durable and flexible, making them ideal for use in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles."
