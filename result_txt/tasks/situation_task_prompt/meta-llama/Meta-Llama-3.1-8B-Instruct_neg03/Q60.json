    "**Time-Based Economy**: In a world without currency, time becomes the new currency. People trade their time and skills in exchange for other people's time and skills. This system encourages collaboration, mutual support, and a sense of community. For example, a farmer might trade a day's worth of fresh produce for a day of childcare from a neighbor. This system promotes reciprocity and social cohesion.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: In this system, resources are shared and managed collectively. People contribute to the community's resources, such as food, water, shelter, and education, based on their skills and abilities. This system prioritizes the well-being of the community and the environment over individual gain. For instance, a group of skilled craftsmen might contribute to building sustainable housing for everyone in the community.",
    "**Skill-Based Economy**: In this system, people trade their unique skills and expertise for other people's skills and expertise. This encourages innovation, creativity, and specialization. For example, a talented musician might trade music lessons for language lessons with a fluent speaker. This system promotes personal growth and skill development.",
    "**Needs-Based Economy**: In this system, people trade goods and services based on their individual and collective needs. This system prioritizes the well-being and happiness of all community members. For instance, a person with a medical condition might trade their skills in a different area for access to medical care. This system promotes empathy and understanding.",
    "**Experience-Based Economy**: In this system, people trade experiences, such as learning a new skill, attending a cultural event, or participating in a community project. This system encourages personal growth, cultural exchange, and community engagement. For example, a person might trade a week's worth of cooking lessons for a week's worth of hiking lessons with a experienced guide. This system promotes exploration and discovery."
