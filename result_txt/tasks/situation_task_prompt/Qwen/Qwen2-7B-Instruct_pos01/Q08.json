    "**Water Filtration Pods**: Develop portable filtration pods that can be dropped into contaminated water sources. These pods use advanced filtration technologies to remove contaminants, leaving behind clean water. The pods are biodegradable and can be easily disposed of after use. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Nano-bubble Water Purification Systems**: Implement systems that use nano-bubbles to purify water. Nano-bubbles increase the surface area of the water, allowing for more efficient contact with purification agents. This process can remove toxins and bacteria from water without needing to boil it or add chemicals. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Solar-Powered Desalination Units**: Create mobile units powered by solar energy that can convert saltwater into drinkable water through a process called reverse osmosis. These units can be deployed in coastal areas where water is abundant but not suitable for drinking due to salinity. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Plant-Based Water Purifiers**: Utilize plants like lotus leaves, which naturally repel water contaminants, to purify water. By growing these plants in water bodies, the water can be filtered naturally through the plants, removing pollutants as they pass through. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Microbial Fuel Cells**: Develop microbial fuel cells that harness the power of microorganisms to break down pollutants in water. These cells can generate electricity while cleaning water, making them self-sustaining and environmentally friendly. Confidence Score: 0.7"
