    "Adaptive eyewear: People with poor vision could adapt to a world without glasses or contact lenses by using specialized eyewear designed for different activities. For example, there could be \"running glasses\" with a built-in camera for navigation, \"reading glasses\" with a magnifying lens for books and screens, and \"night vision glasses\" with a thermal imaging lens for navigating in the dark.",
    "Bionic eye technology: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, there could be a renewed interest in bionic eye technology. People with poor vision could opt for implants that enhance their natural vision, such as retinal implants that convert light into electrical signals or brain-computer interfaces that can bypass damaged retinas.",
    "Virtual reality vision aids: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could use virtual reality (VR) technology to enhance their vision. VR headsets could be designed to simulate a range of vision conditions, from perfect to impaired, allowing people to adjust their vision to suit their needs.",
    "Telemedicine and remote consultations: With the sudden loss of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely more heavily on telemedicine and remote consultations to manage their eye care. Specialized apps and platforms could allow eye doctors to remotely assess and diagnose eye conditions, and provide virtual prescriptions for glasses or contact lenses.",
    "Community-based support networks: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could come together to form support networks and share strategies for coping with their condition. This could include peer-to-peer mentoring, support groups, and online forums where people can connect and offer advice on how to adapt to life without glasses or contact lenses."
