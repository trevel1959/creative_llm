    "**Creating a DIY Air Purifier**: Coffee filters can be used to make an effective air purifier for your home or office. You'll need a frame (like a picture frame), coffee filters cut into small pieces, and a vacuum cleaner. The idea is to use the filter as a medium that captures dust and pollutants in the air as they pass through. Secure the coffee filters onto the frame and place it near a window or door to allow air circulation.",
    "**Coffee Filter Planters**: Use coffee filters as a decorative and functional container for growing plants. Cut a coffee filter into a circle slightly larger than the pot's diameter, then soak it in water. Wrap it around the pot, securing it with rubber bands, and let it dry. This creates a moisture-wicking layer that helps plants retain water without overwatering. ",
    "**DIY Artistic Decor**: Cut coffee filters into various shapes and sizes, then dye them using food coloring or fabric dye. Once dry, these colored coffee filters can be used to create beautiful wall art by gluing them onto canvas or paper in interesting patterns or designs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toilet Paper**: While not practical for everyday use, coffee filters can be combined with other materials to create a rougher version of toilet paper. Soak coffee filters in water until they become pliable, then lay them flat on top of each other, cut them into strips, and roll them into toilet paper rolls. It's not as soft as conventional toilet paper but can serve as a sustainable alternative.",
    "**DIY Coffee Filter Mask**: In times of high pollution or allergens, coffee filters can be used to create a simple mask. Cut a coffee filter to fit your face, then sew it onto a piece of fabric or a bandana. Add elastic bands or ties to secure it around your head. While not medical-grade, this homemade mask can provide some level of filtration and protection against particulate matter."
