Users could easily switch between noise-canceling and audio playback modes, making these ear plugs ideal for both relaxation and active use.",
    "**Fashionable Ear Plugs**: Develop a line of ear plugs that are not only functional but also stylish. These could come in various colors, patterns, and designs, allowing users to express their personal style.
