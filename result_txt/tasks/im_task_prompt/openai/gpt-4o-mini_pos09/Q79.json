    "**Adjustable Size Hanger**:    Create a hanger that can be adjusted in width and height to accommodate different types of clothing, from small tank tops to oversized jackets. This could be achieved through a telescoping design that allows users to slide the arms in and out. This feature would prevent clothes from slipping off and would eliminate the need for multiple hanger sizes, making storage more efficient.",
    "**Multi-functional Hanger with Accessories**:    Design a hanger that comes with detachable accessories, such as clips for pants or skirts, a built-in tie or belt holder, and hooks for scarves or jewelry. This all-in-one hanger would help organize an entire outfit in one place, reducing clutter and making it easier to find matching accessories.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Plantable Materials**:    Create a clothes hanger made from biodegradable materials that can be planted after its use. This hanger could be infused with seeds (like herbs or flowers), so once itâ€™s no longer needed, users can plant it in their garden. This would not only reduce plastic waste but also encourage users to engage in gardening and sustainable practices.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated LED Lighting**:    Develop a hanger that features built-in LED lights to illuminate clothes when in a closet. This would be particularly useful in dark closets or wardrobes, helping users easily find and choose outfits. The lights could be motion-activated or controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to customize brightness levels and colors to suit their preferences.",
    "**Hanger with a Folding Mechanism**:    Innovate a hanger that can fold flat when not in use, making it easy to store in a drawer or travel bag. This could be especially beneficial for frequent travelers who want to pack light but still need a reliable way to hang clothes. The folding mechanism could be designed to be durable yet simple, ensuring it can support various clothing types without compromising strength."
