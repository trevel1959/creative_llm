    "Invest in a smart suit that incorporates protective armor, such as a reinforced jacket and pants made of lightweight, impact-resistant materials. The suit could also have built-in sensors to detect and respond to potential threats.",
    "Wear a suit made of a super-soft, cushioned material that provides protection against impact without restricting movement. This could be achieved through the use of a specialized fabric or foam padding.",
    "Develop a suit with built-in force fields or energy shields to protect against physical injury. This could be achieved through the use of advanced technology or wearable devices that emit protective energy.",
    "Use a suit that incorporates advanced artificial intelligence and sensors to detect and predict potential threats. The suit could then automatically respond to protect the wearer from injury.",
    "Wear a suit with retractable, extendable limbs made of a lightweight, durable material that can be controlled using a remote or built-in sensors. This would allow the wearer to adapt to different situations and protect themselves from injury."
