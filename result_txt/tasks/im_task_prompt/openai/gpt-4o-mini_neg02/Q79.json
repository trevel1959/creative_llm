    "**Modular Hanger System**: Create a modular clothes hanger system that allows users to customize the hanger according to their needs. The base hanger can be adjusted with interchangeable clips, hooks, and extensions for different types of clothing, such as pants, dresses, or accessories. This would reduce clutter and make organizing a closet more efficient, as users can adapt their hangers based on the season or specific clothing items.",
    "**Self-Adjusting Hanger**: Develop a self-adjusting clothes hanger that automatically changes its shape based on the type of clothing being hung. For example, when a heavier coat is placed on the hanger, it would widen to provide extra support, and when a delicate blouse is hung, it would slim down to prevent stretching. This would help maintain the integrity of clothing shapes and reduce the risk of damage.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Built-in Odor Neutralizer**: Design a clothes hanger made from sustainable materials that incorporates a built-in odor neutralizing feature. This could be achieved through the use of natural charcoal or other eco-friendly materials that absorb odors. Not only would this keep clothes smelling fresh while stored, but it would also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated UV-C Light**: Create a clothes hanger that includes a small UV-C light strip designed to eliminate bacteria and odors from clothing. When clothes are hung, the user can activate the UV-C light to sanitize the garments. This feature would be particularly useful for items that are worn frequently but not washed after every use, such as jackets or workout gear.",
    "**Hanger with Digital Closet Inventory**: Innovate a clothes hanger that has an embedded RFID chip or QR code that links to a digital inventory system. Users can scan the hanger with their smartphone to track what clothing items they own, their condition, and when they were last worn. This feature would help in wardrobe management, allowing users to plan outfits and minimize clothing waste."
