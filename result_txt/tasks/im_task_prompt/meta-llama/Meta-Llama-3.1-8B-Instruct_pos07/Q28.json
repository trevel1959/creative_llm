    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Navigation and Safety Features**: Design a bicycle helmet with an integrated GPS navigation system, which provides turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. The helmet also includes a built-in safety feature that detects potential collisions and alerts the rider through a vibrating alarm and a flashing light on the helmet's visor. Additionally, the helmet could include a small camera that records the ride and provides a 360-degree view of the surroundings, allowing riders to review their journey and identify potential hazards.",
    "**Modular Helmet System**: Develop a modular bicycle helmet system that allows riders to customize and upgrade their helmet as needed. The system would consist of interchangeable modules, such as a crash-absorbing liner, a ventilation system, and a communication device, which can be easily swapped out or added to the helmet. This modular design would enable riders to tailor their helmet to their specific needs and preferences, ensuring a comfortable and safe ride.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Helmet Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a bicycle helmet made from recycled and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastic, plant-based composites, or even mushroom-based materials. The helmet would not only reduce waste but also provide a unique aesthetic appeal. The eco-friendly design could also incorporate a built-in air-purifying system, which would help remove pollutants and allergens from the air, creating a healthier riding experience.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Fitness and Health Tracking**: Develop a bicycle helmet with integrated fitness and health tracking features, such as heart rate monitoring, calorie burn tracking, and pace tracking. The helmet could also include a built-in stress sensor that detects changes in the rider's physiological responses and provides personalized recommendations for relaxation and stress relief. This feature would enable riders to monitor their physical and mental well-being in real-time, promoting a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.",
    "**Augmented Reality Helmet for Enhanced Riding Experience**: Design a bicycle helmet with an integrated augmented reality (AR) display, which overlays digital information and visuals onto the real world. The AR display could provide riders with real-time traffic updates, navigation directions, and even virtual road signs and markings. The helmet could also include a feature that detects and highlights potential hazards, such as potholes or debris, allowing riders to navigate more safely and efficiently. Additionally, the AR display could be used to create a more immersive and engaging riding experience, with features like virtual scenery and interactive games. </s>[INST] "
