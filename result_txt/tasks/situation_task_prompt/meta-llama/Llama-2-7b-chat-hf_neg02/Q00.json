    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, are a type of train that uses magnetic fields to lift and propel the train without touching the track. They are already in use in some countries, such as Japan and China, and could be a viable option for long-distance travel in the absence of cars.",
    "Bicycle highways: In many cities, bike lanes are already in place, and with a sudden lack of cars, these lanes could be repurposed for travel between cities. Cycle routes could be established, connecting major cities and allowing people to travel long distances by bike.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell buses: Hydrogen fuel cell buses are a type of bus that runs on hydrogen fuel cells, which produce electricity to power the bus. They emit only water vapor and heat as exhaust, making them a cleaner alternative to traditional buses. With a lack of cars, these buses could be used for long-distance travel.",
    "Hot air balloons: Hot air balloons are a unique and romantic way to travel, and with a lack of cars, they could become a popular option for long-distance travel. They are already used for recreational purposes, but with some modifications, they could be used for transportation as well.",
    "Underwater trains: In some parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia, there are already underwater tunnels and trains that connect cities. With a lack of cars, these underwater trains could become a more viable option for long-distance travel. The trains could be powered by electricity or even by hydrogen fuel cells, making them a clean and efficient mode of transportation."
