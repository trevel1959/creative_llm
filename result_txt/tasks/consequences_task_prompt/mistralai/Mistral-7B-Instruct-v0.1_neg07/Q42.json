    "Gravity could be, upwards, and upwards, if gravity was an optional force. This would allow for the creation of artificial gravity fields that could be used to create new forms of energy, such as a fusion reactor that uses gravity to generate power.",
    "If gravity was an optional force, it would be possible to create new forms of art and architecture, such as buildings that are suspended in mid-air, or sculptures that defy gravity. This would allow for greater creativity and innovation in these fields, as well as a new appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the universe."
