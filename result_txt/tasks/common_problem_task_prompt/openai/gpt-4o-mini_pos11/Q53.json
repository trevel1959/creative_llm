    "**Pacing Issues**: The screenplay may suffer from pacing problems, where certain scenes feel rushed while others drag on. This can lead to viewer disengagement. To address this, the writer could utilize a detailed outline to map out the emotional beats of the story, ensuring that each scene flows naturally into the next and maintains a balanced rhythm throughout the screenplay.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing dialogue that feels genuine and not forced can be challenging.

    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: A screenplay may inadvertently include plot holes or inconsistencies that confuse the audience. This can undermine the story's credibility. To prevent this, the writer could engage in rigorous brainstorming sessions with trusted peers to identify potential flaws in the plot and conduct multiple revisions to ensure logical coherence throughout the screenplay.",
    "**Genre Confusion**: If the screenplay doesn’t clearly establish its genre, it can lead to audience confusion regarding tone and expectations. To clarify the genre, the writer could create a mood board that visually represents the themes, styles, and tones they wish to convey, ensuring that all elements of the screenplay align with the chosen genre.",
    "**Marketability Concerns**: The screenplay may struggle to find a target audience if it doesn’t consider market trends or viewer preferences. This could limit its commercial success. To address this, the writer could conduct market research to identify popular themes, character types, and story structures within the current film landscape, allowing them to tailor their screenplay to better fit audience interests while maintaining originality."
