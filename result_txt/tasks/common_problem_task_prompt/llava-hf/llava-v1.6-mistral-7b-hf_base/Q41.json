    "Communication Issues: Effective communication between the spacecraft and ground control is critical, especially in outer space with the potential for signal loss or interference. Developing reliable and robust communication systems is essential to ensure that the spacecraft can stay in contact with earth and receive necessary updates and instructions.",
    "Life Support Issues: Maintaining a suitable living environment for the crews on board the spacecraft is another significant challenge. The spacecraft's design must provide a self-sustaining environment with sufficient air, water, and resources for the crew to thrive, including waste management and recycling systems.",
    "Navigation Issues: Accurate navigation and positioning are essential for the spacecraft's safe and efficient exploration and operation. The spacecraft's navigation system must account for unforeseen variables and changing conditions in space, such as planetary gravitational fields, asteroid collisions, and solar flares.",
    "Weather Exposure Issues: Prolonged exposure to space can put the spacecraft and its crew at risk. The spacecraft must be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, such as extreme temperatures, intense radiation, and micro-meteoroids. The design must account for these risks and incorporate appropriate safeguards to protect the crew and spacecraft.",
    "Maintenance and Repair Issues: In the event of a malfunction or damage, maintenance and repair of the spacecraft are essential for continued operations. The spacecraft's design should incorporate self-diagnostics and repair systems, and emergency procedures to minimize potential downtime."
