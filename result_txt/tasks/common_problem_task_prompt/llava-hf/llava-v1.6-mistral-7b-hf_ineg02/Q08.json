    "**Teacher Training**: The new curriculum may require teachers to have new skills and knowledge. If there is not an adequate training program in place, teachers may feel unprepared and struggle to teach the new material effectively, which could lead to a decline in student learning.",
    "**Mismatched Learning Styles**: Students have diverse learning styles and needs. If the new curriculum does not take into account the various learning styles and does not provide differentiated instruction, some students may struggle to grasp the material.",
    "**Cultural or Language Barriers**: If the curriculum is not fully accessible to all students, those with cultural or language barriers may struggle to understand and participate in the new curriculum.",
    "**Standardized Testing**: The new curriculum may align with the school's standardized testing goals, which could put pressure on teachers to prepare students for the tests, rather than focusing on a more comprehensive learning experience.",
    "**Parent Involvement**: It is important for parents to be involved in their child's education. If the new curriculum does not provide clear and effective communication channels between parents and teachers, information about the new curriculum may not reach all parents in a timely way, leading to confusion and potential disengagement."
