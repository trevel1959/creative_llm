    "**Innovative Lighting Integration:** Design a bicycle helmet that integrates LED lights directly into the helmet's structure or visor. These lights can be programmed to flash in different patterns or colors for enhanced visibility during night rides. The helmet could also feature a motion sensor that turns on the lights when the rider starts moving, saving battery power.",
    "**Personalized Climate Control:** Develop a bicycle helmet equipped with a small, integrated air conditioning system. This would consist of mini fans and cooling elements that can maintain a comfortable temperature inside the helmet, even during hot summer rides. The helmet might include a mobile app where riders can adjust settings according to their preferences or current weather conditions.",
    "**Emergency Communication Hub:** Create a helmet with built-in Bluetooth technology, allowing cyclists to connect their smartphones wirelessly. The helmet could double as a speakerphone, enabling cyclists to receive calls and listen to music or podcasts hands-free. It could also include an emergency button that, when pressed, automatically sends a distress signal to pre-programmed contacts.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System:** Introduce a helmet that features sensors for monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs. This could help cyclists maintain optimal health while riding by providing real-time data. The helmet might sync with fitness apps on a smartphone, offering insights into workout performance and progress over time.",
    "**Smart Navigation Capabilities:** Develop a helmet with GPS technology and augmented reality (AR) features. The helmet could display turn-by-turn directions, traffic updates, and potential hazards on its visor or a head-up display (HUD). This would enhance safety by reducing the need for cyclists to frequently look down at a phone or traditional GPS device, which can be distracting and dangerous."
