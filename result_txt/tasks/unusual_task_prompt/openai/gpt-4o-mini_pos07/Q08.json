    "**Dusting Glove**: Transform an old sock into a handy dusting glove. Slip your hand into the sock and use it to wipe down surfaces, shelves, or even blinds. The fabric will attract dust and dirt, making it a great eco-friendly alternative to disposable dusters. Plus, you can use both hands if you have two socks!",
    "**Pet Toy**: Create a simple and engaging toy for your pet by filling a sock with crumpled paper or a few catnip leaves for cats, or by tying a knot in a sock for dogs. The sock can be thrown, tugged, or chewed, providing entertainment for your furry friend. You can also add a squeaker or bells inside for added excitement.",
    "**Plant Watering Aid**: If you have potted plants, you can use a sock to create a simple watering system. Fill a sock with soil and insert it into the pot with the sock's opening above the soil level. When you water the plant, the sock will absorb the moisture and slowly release it into the soil, helping to keep it consistently hydrated.",
    "**Portable Snack Holder**: When you're on the go, use a clean sock to hold your snacks. Just fill the sock with your favorite nuts, granola, or dried fruit, and tie a knot at the top. This makes for a lightweight, portable, and reusable snack bag that can easily fit in your backpack or purse.",
    "**Heat Pack**: Fill a sock with uncooked rice or dried beans, tie it off, and microwave it for about 30 seconds to create a simple heat pack. This can be used to soothe sore muscles or keep you warm on chilly nights. You can also add a few drops of essential oil to the filling for a relaxing aroma."
