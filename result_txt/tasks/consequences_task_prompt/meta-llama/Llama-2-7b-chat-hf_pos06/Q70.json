    "Time Dilation: If the speed of light were reduced by half, time dilation would occur. This means that time would appear to pass more slowly for objects moving at slower than light speed. This effect would be more pronounced for objects moving at speeds closer to the reduced speed of light.",
    "Reduced Gravitational Force: With a slower speed of light, the gravitational force between objects would be reduced. This means that planets and stars would have less gravitational pull, resulting in a different planetary system and galaxy structure.",
    "Altered Electromagnetic Spectrum: A slower speed of light would shift the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in changes to the visible light we see. This could lead to new forms of light and radiation, and potentially new forms of life.",
    "Changes in Space-Time Continuum: A reduced speed of light would cause distortions in the space-time continuum, potentially leading to unpredictable effects such as wormholes or alternate dimensions.",
    "Unpredictable Cosmic Phenomena: A slower speed of light would create a ripple effect throughout the universe, leading to unpredictable cosmic phenomena such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and cosmic rays."
