    "**Interactive Bedside Companion**: Design a bed with an interactive bedside companion that serves as a digital assistant.

The companion could be voice-activated and customizable, allowing users to set preferences for how they want to interact with it.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Design**: Create a bed that mimics the elements of nature to promote relaxation and a sense of calm.
