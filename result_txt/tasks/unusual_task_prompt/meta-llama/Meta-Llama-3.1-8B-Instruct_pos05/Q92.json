    "**Smart Luggage Tag**: Design a high-tech luggage tag that not only displays your name and contact information but also includes a GPS tracker, a battery-powered power bank, and a small LED light. The tag could be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing you to track your luggage in real-time and receive notifications if it's moved or misplaced. The power bank could charge your phone or other devices on the go, while the LED light provides a convenient way to locate your luggage in a crowded airport or train station.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Built-in Travel Adapter**: Create a luggage tag that doubles as a travel adapter, allowing you to charge your devices on the go. The adapter could be a compact, multi-port USB charger that can be easily attached to your luggage tag. This would eliminate the need for separate travel adapters and make it easier to stay connected while traveling.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Augmented Reality Features**: Design a luggage tag that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology. Using a smartphone app, travelers could scan their luggage tag to access additional information such as travel itineraries, flight status, and nearby attractions. The AR feature could also include a virtual \"passport\" that allows travelers to easily share their itinerary with friends and family.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Integrated Lock**: Develop a luggage tag that includes a built-in lock, providing an extra layer of security for your luggage. The lock could be a combination lock or a digital lock that requires a password or biometric authentication. This would prevent unauthorized access to your luggage and give you peace of mind while traveling.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Personalized Design**: Offer a luggage tag with a customizable design, allowing travelers to personalize their tag with their name, initials, or a favorite quote. The tag could be made from a variety of materials, such as leather, metal, or recycled plastic, and could include additional features such as a built-in flashlight or a bottle opener. This would make the luggage tag a unique and functional accessory that reflects the traveler's personality. [/INST] Assistant: I'm glad you liked the ideas!
