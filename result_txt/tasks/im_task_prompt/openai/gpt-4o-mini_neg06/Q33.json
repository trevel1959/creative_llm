    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning function where users can simply add water and a drop of dish soap, and the blender will run a cleaning cycle. This could include a specialized setting that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge stubborn residues, making post-use cleanup a breeze.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a blender with interchangeable parts, allowing users to swap out blades, containers, and even motors depending on their needs. For instance, a smaller container for single servings, a larger one for family-sized batches, or specialized blades for different textures (e.g., smoothie vs. nut butter).",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Design a blender with advanced noise-dampening materials and technology that significantly reduces the sound produced during operation. This could involve a soundproof casing or a special motor design, making it more pleasant to use in shared living spaces without disturbing others.",
    "**Nutrient Preservation Mode**: Introduce a blending mode that optimizes the speed and duration to preserve the maximum amount of nutrients in fruits and vegetables. This mode would utilize smart sensors to detect the ingredients and adjust the blending parameters accordingly, ensuring that users get the most health benefits from their smoothies and soups.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Equip the blender with an LED display that provides real-time feedback during blending. This could include visual cues like color changes or animations to indicate the texture of the blend, as well as alerts when the blend is ready or when to add additional ingredients, making the blending process more engaging."
