    "**Innovative Sound Design:** Create a bicycle bell that produces a range of sounds from different materials. The bell can have a wooden, metal, or even bamboo base with various sound-producing mechanisms attached. For instance, a small drum or gong can be mounted on the base to produce a wide range of tones. The user can switch out these components based on their preference, creating a personalized sound experience.",
    "**Sustainability Integration:** Design a bicycle bell that is powered by kinetic energy. The bell would have a small wheel or a pendulum attached to it, which would generate electricity when the bike is in motion. This electricity would then power a small speaker inside the bell, allowing the rider to play custom audio messages or songs instead of traditional ring tones.",
    "**Interactive Communication Tool:** Develop a smart bicycle bell that can integrate with a smartphone app. The bell would send notifications to the rider's phone when triggered, allowing them to hear messages or receive alerts (e.g., from navigation apps). Additionally, the app could allow other users to send custom messages directly to the bell via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.",
    "**Personalized Design Kit:** Offer a DIY bicycle bell kit that allows users to customize the look and function of their bell. The kit could include interchangeable components like different colored bases, unique designs, and even customizable sound options. This would enable users to express their personal style while adding functionality to their bikes.",
    "**Emergency Alert System:** Integrate a bicycle bell with an emergency alert system that connects to a user's smartphone. In case of an accident or urgent situation, the bell can automatically trigger an alert to the rider's contacts or emergency services. This feature would enhance safety and provide quick assistance in critical moments."
