    "DIY Floss: If flossing becomes too expensive or difficult to find, you can make your own using dental tape or string. Cut a piece of dental tape or string to about 18 inches long and wet it slightly with water. Gently slide it between your teeth and pull it back towards your gums. Repeat this process on both sides of each tooth.",
    "Natural Teeth Whitening: Instead of using harsh chemicals to whiten your teeth, try using natural remedies like activated charcoal, hydrogen peroxide, or lemon juice. These natural alternatives are less abrasive than commercial whitening products and can help brighten your smile over time.",
    "DIY Dental Cleaning: You can also clean your teeth at home using simple household items like baking soda and apple cider vinegar. Make a paste by mixing baking soda and water until it forms a paste. Brush your teeth as usual, then rinse your mouth thoroughly with warm water. Finally, mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water and swish it around your mouth for a minute before spitting it out. This will help remove any remaining plaque and freshen your breath."
