    "**Modular Design with Adjustable Zones**: Create a refrigerator with modular compartments that can be adjusted based on the userâ€™s needs. For instance, a section could transform from a freezer to a refrigerator with the flip of a switch, or shelves could be repositioned to accommodate larger items. This flexibility would allow families to customize their fridge space based on seasonal needs or special occasions.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion System**: Enhance the refrigerator with an integrated water filtration system that not only purifies tap water but also allows users to infuse it with fruits or herbs. A dedicated compartment could house fresh ingredients, and the fridge could dispense flavored water, encouraging healthier hydration choices while reducing plastic waste from bottled beverages.",
    "**Solar-Powered Cooling Technology**: Develop a refrigerator that incorporates solar panels for energy efficiency. During the day, the refrigerator could harness solar energy to reduce its reliance on electricity from the grid. This feature would be especially beneficial in regions with abundant sunlight, lowering energy costs and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Display Features**: Introduce customizable LED mood lighting inside the refrigerator that changes color based on temperature settings or the type of food stored. Additionally, an interactive touchscreen display could provide recipes, nutritional information, and meal prep tips, turning the fridge into a culinary hub that encourages healthy eating and cooking.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring System**: Equip the refrigerator with sensors that can monitor the freshness and nutritional value of stored food. By analyzing the contents, the fridge could provide feedback on the healthiness of the diet, suggest healthier alternatives, or alert users when they are consuming too much of certain ingredients, like sugars or fats."
