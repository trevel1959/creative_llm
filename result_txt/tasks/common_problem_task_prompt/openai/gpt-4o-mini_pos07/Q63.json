    "**Time Zone Challenges**: Coordinating events across multiple time zones can lead to difficulties in scheduling live events, webinars, or donor engagement activities. This may result in low participation rates or missed opportunities for interaction. To mitigate this issue, the campaign could utilize a staggered event schedule, offering multiple sessions at different times to accommodate global audiences. Additionally, recorded sessions can be made available for those who cannot attend live.",
    "**Technology Accessibility**: Not all potential donors may have access to the latest technology or stable internet connections, which can limit participation in virtual events or online donation platforms. To address this, the campaign could offer alternative donation methods, such as SMS donations or local fundraising events that do not rely on internet access. Providing clear instructions and support for those unfamiliar with online platforms can also enhance accessibility.",
    "**Transparency and Trust Issues**: Donors are increasingly concerned about where their money goes and how it will be used. If the campaign lacks transparency regarding fund allocation, it may lead to skepticism and reduced contributions. To build trust, the campaign should provide detailed information on how funds will be used for cancer research, share success stories, and offer regular updates on progress. Engaging with trusted third-party organizations for oversight can also enhance credibility.",
    "**Competition for Attention**: With numerous global campaigns vying for attention, standing out can be a challenge. To overcome this, the campaign could leverage innovative marketing strategies, such as storytelling through personal cancer survivor narratives, interactive social media challenges, or partnerships with influencers who have a personal connection to cancer. Creating a unique theme or message that resonates emotionally with potential donors can help capture their interest.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Different countries have varying laws and regulations regarding fundraising activities, which can complicate the campaign's execution. Failing to comply with these regulations can lead to legal issues or penalties. To navigate this challenge, the campaign should engage legal experts familiar with international fundraising laws and ensure that all aspects of the campaign adhere to local regulations, including tax implications for donors."
