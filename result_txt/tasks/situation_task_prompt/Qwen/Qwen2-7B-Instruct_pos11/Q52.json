    "**DIY Solar Oven Meal**: Given the absence of conventional cooking equipment, a DIY solar oven can be an ingenious solution to prepare meals. You can use a large aluminum foil box, line it with black cardboard or paint the inside to absorb more heat, and cover it with another layer of aluminum foil to reflect sunlight inwards. Fill the box with your meal ingredients like rice, vegetables, and proteins (cut into small pieces for quicker cooking), add water, and let the sun do its work. The trapped heat will cook your meal evenly.",
    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: If you have access to a fire pit or a campfire, you can cook meals by using indirect heat. Dig a shallow pit, place stones in it, and build a small fire on top of the stones. Place your food items (like potatoes, corn on the cob, or meat) on top of the stones or in a makeshift grill made from sticks. The heat from the fire will cook your food slowly and evenly.",
    "**Hot Rock Cooking**: Similar to the previous idea, this method involves heating a large rock in a fire until it's hot enough to cook food. This requires finding a suitable stone, heating it thoroughly, and then transferring it to a container with food. Cover the container to retain heat, and the rock will continue to cook the food even after being removed from direct heat.",
    "**Portable Camping Stove**: Invest in a compact, portable camping stove which doesn't require electricity or gas. These stoves often run on butane, propane, or alcohol and can be used to boil water, heat up canned goods, or cook from scratch using pots and pans.",
    "**Underwater Cooking**: If you're near a body of water, you could use a simple method to cook food under the water. Create a sealed container (like a plastic bag filled with food and water) and place it underwater in a stream or river where the natural currents help circulate heat and cook your meal. This method works best for delicate foods like fish or eggs. "
