    "Universal Speed Limit: A law that would set a maximum speed at which all objects can travel, preventing the universe from becoming too chaotic or unstable.",
    "Universal Laws of Thermodynamics: These laws would govern the conservation of energy, mass, and information, ensuring that energy is neither created nor destroyed, and that information is always conserved.",
    "Universal Laws of Electromagnetism: These laws would describe the interactions between electrically charged particles, governing phenomena such as electricity, magnetism, and light.",
    "Universal Laws of Quantum Mechanics: These laws would govern the behavior of particles at the quantum level, including their wave-particle duality and the principles of superposition and entanglement.",
    "Universal Laws of General Relativity: These laws would describe the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy, affecting the motion of objects and the flow of time."
