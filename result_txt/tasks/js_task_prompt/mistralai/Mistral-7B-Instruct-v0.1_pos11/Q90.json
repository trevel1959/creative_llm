    "Add an additional layer of skin: One of the biggest challenges of the human body is regulating body temperature. To solve this, I would add an extra layer of skin that would act as a barrier between the body and the environment, helping to regulate temperature and prevent overheating.",
    "Increase the size of the brain: While the human brain is incredibly powerful, it could be made even more so by increasing its size. This would allow for greater processing power and improved cognitive abilities.",
    "Improve joint mobility: The human body has many joints that can become stiff and immobile over time. To address this, I would design the joints to be more flexible and resilient, allowing for greater range of motion and reducing the risk of injury.",
    "Enhance vision: The human eye is a remarkable organ, but it could be improved even further. I would design the eye to have a larger pupil, allowing for more light to enter and improving visual acuity.",
    "Increase lifespan: The human body has a limited lifespan, and there is much that can be done to extend it. I would design the body to be more resilient to disease and aging, allowing for a longer and healthier life."
