    "A personal airship: This idea involves designing a small, personal airship that can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but is also capable of sustained flight for long distances. The airship would be powered by a combination of solar panels and batteries, making it an environmentally friendly option for transportation. It would be designed to carry one or two passengers and could be used for both leisurely flights over scenic areas and practical transportation in urban environments.",
    "A magnetic levitation train: This idea involves creating a train system that uses powerful magnets to levitate above the tracks, eliminating friction and allowing for high speeds without the need for traditional wheels. The trains would be designed to run on dedicated tracks, similar to the London Underground's \"tube\" system, and could be used for both short-distance commuting and longer-distance travel between cities.",
    "A water-powered hovercraft: This idea involves designing a hovercraft that uses a water turbine to generate electricity, which powers a propeller that lifts the craft off the water surface. The hovercraft would be designed to be lightweight and agile, making it well-suited for navigating through shallow waters and rough terrain. It could be used for both military and civilian purposes, such as search and rescue operations or transporting goods and people across bodies of water.",
    "A vertical farm: This idea involves designing a skyscraper-like structure that is filled with layers of crops growing upwards, providing fresh produce year-round to urban residents. The building would be equipped with artificial lighting, temperature control systems, and hydroponic growing beds, allowing for efficient use of space and resources. The vertical farm could be located in densely populated areas, reducing the need for long-distance transportation of food and helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.",
    "A solar-powered flying car: This idea involves designing a small, electric vehicle that can fly using wings and propellers, much like a drone. The car would be designed to be lightweight and aerodynamic, making it easy to maneuver and fold up when not in use. It could be used for short trips around town, avoiding traffic congestion and reducing carbon emissions from traditional cars. With advances in battery technology, the flying car could eventually become a practical alternative to traditional ground transportation."
