    "**Dynamic Sleep Masks**: Develop a high-tech sleep mask that can project soothing visuals onto the inside of the mask. These visuals could include serene landscapes, gentle waves, or even abstract patterns that slowly change over time. The mask would also have built-in sound capabilities to provide a personalized audio experience, with options for nature sounds, white noise, or guided meditations. This would help create a mental separation from the constant daylight, allowing users to engage in a visual and auditory escape to promote sleep.",
    "**Solar-Powered Sleep Shades**: Design window shades that automatically adjust based on the time of day and the individual's sleep schedule. These shades would be solar-powered and equipped with sensors to detect the brightness of the outside world. During designated sleep hours, the shades would close completely to block out any light, creating a night-like environment. Additionally, they could gradually open during waking hours to simulate a natural sunrise, helping to regulate the body's internal clock even without the presence of night.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Soundscapes**: Launch an app that creates personalized soundscapes tailored to each individual's preferences. Users could select their favorite sounds—like ocean waves, forest rustling, or soft piano music—and the app would blend these sounds into a unique audio experience. It could also incorporate biofeedback technology, adjusting the sound levels and types based on the user’s heart rate or stress levels, helping to promote relaxation and sleep regardless of the constant daylight.",
    "**Sleep-Inducing Textiles**: Develop a line of sleepwear and bedding made from innovative textiles that help regulate body temperature and block out light. These fabrics could be embedded with micro-encapsulated lavender or other calming agents that release as the wearer moves. Additionally, the bedding could include fiber optics that simulate a gentle starry sky, providing a visual cue that it’s time to rest. This combination of sensory experiences would create a more conducive sleep environment even in perpetual daylight.",
    "**Meditative Movement Classes**: Create a series of guided classes that combine gentle movement, breathwork, and meditation to prepare the body for sleep. These classes would take place in serene environments with controlled lighting that mimics twilight. The practice would focus on calming the mind and body, teaching participants how to wind down despite the absence of night. The classes could be offered in-person or virtually, providing a community space for people to connect and share their experiences with sleep in a sunlit world."
