    "**Alternative Energy Revolution:** The depletion of oil would trigger a global shift towards renewable energy sources. This could involve a rapid increase in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy production. Governments might invest heavily in these sectors to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, leading to significant advancements in technology. This transition could also spur economic growth by creating new industries and jobs.",
    "**Transportation Transformation:** With oil being the primary fuel for vehicles worldwide, its scarcity would force a paradigm shift in transportation. Electric vehicles (EVs) could become mainstream as battery technology improves and charging infrastructure expands. Urban planning might prioritize public transport, cycling, and pedestrian pathways to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, there could be a surge in autonomous driving technologies as they require less maintenance and can potentially run on alternative fuels.",
    "**Economic Disruption and Social Inequality:** The global economy, which is heavily dependent on oil, would face significant disruptions. Developing countries that are reliant on oil exports might suffer economically, leading to social unrest and political instability. Conversely, countries investing in renewable energy could gain a competitive edge, attracting international investment and fostering economic growth. This scenario could exacerbate global inequalities between rich and poor nations.",
    "**Food Security Challenges:** Agriculture relies heavily on machinery powered by oil, such as tractors and irrigation systems. Without a steady supply of oil, farming practices would need to adapt significantly. This could include more manual labor, smaller-scale farming, and a shift towards crops that require less water and fewer synthetic fertilizers. This transition might lead to increased food prices and reduced yields, impacting global food security, especially in regions where food imports are substantial.",
    "**Geopolitical Shifts:** Oil has historically played a pivotal role in global politics, with many conflicts driven by competition for resources. If the world runs out of oil, this dynamic could change. Nations might seek new alliances based on shared interests in renewable energy or other strategic resources. This could lead to the formation of new global partnerships and alliances that prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship over traditional geopolitical rivalries. It might also result in a more collaborative approach to addressing climate change and resource management globally."
