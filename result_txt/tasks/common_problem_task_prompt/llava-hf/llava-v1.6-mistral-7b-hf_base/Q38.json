    "Time constraints: Another challenge is meeting the production schedule. Filming a blockbuster often involves complex shots, special effects, and multiple locations. The director may have to juggle many components at once, and delays can have a domino effect on the entire schedule, potentially leading to a rushed final product.",
    "Casting issues: Getting the right actors for a blockbuster movie can be difficult. The director needs to find actors who are a good fit for their roles but also have the right chemistry with their co-stars. Miscasting or poor chemistry could lead to lackluster performances or tension on set, which can affect the overall production.",
    "Special effects: Blockbuster movies are often known for their eye-popping special effects. The director needs to work closely with the visual effects team to ensure the special effects are seamless, convincing, and of high quality. Misjudgment of how much time or money is needed to achieve the desired effects can lead to unsatisfactory results or additional last-minute changes.",
    "Weather and external conditions: Outdoor scenes can be affected by weather conditions, such as rain or strong winds, which can cause delays or require additional resources to mitigate the effects. The director may need to reshoot scenes or rely on extensive post-production to cover up any issues.",
    "Dealing with egos: Blockbuster movies often feature big name actors who may have high demands or egos. The director needs to manage these egos and keep the production running smoothly. Conflicts between actors or a clash of creative visions can lead to a less cohesive final product or a tense shooting environment."
