    "The solar system would have a new star at its center, a star that is much brighter and more massive than the Sun. This would provide more energy and light to the planets, making them habitable and supporting life.",
    "The planets would be arranged in a different order, with the inner planets closer to the star and the outer planets farther away. This would allow for a more stable and predictable solar system.",
    "The asteroid belt would be replaced with a giant ring system around the star, made up of ice and rock particles. This would create a beautiful anding ring system that would be visible from Earth.",
