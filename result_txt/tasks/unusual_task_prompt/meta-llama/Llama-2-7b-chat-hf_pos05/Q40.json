    "A Cookie Jar with a Twist: Create a cookie jar that looks like a miniature version of a famous landmark, such as the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum. The jar would be made of ceramic or glass and would have a removable lid. When the lid is lifted, a surprise treat is revealed, such as a custom-made cookie with a design that matches the landmark.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Story: Create a cookie jar that tells a story. Each jar would be designed to look like a character from a children's book, such as a dragon or a fairy. When the lid is lifted, a small booklet or comic strip is revealed, telling the story of the character and their adventures.",
    "Interactive Cookie Jar: Create a cookie jar that allows kids to play and interact with it. The jar would have a built-in game or puzzle that kids can solve to reveal the cookies inside. For example, the jar could have a series of concentric circles that kids must arrange in the correct order to reveal the cookies.",
    "Customizable Cookie Jar: Create a cookie jar that allows kids to customize their own treats. The jar would have a built-in chute or slide that kids can use to add their own mix-ins, such as sprinkles or chocolate chips, to their cookies. This would allow kids to create their own unique flavor combinations.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Purpose: Create a cookie jar that serves a purpose beyond just storing cookies. For example, the jar could have a built-in timer that helps kids learn about time management. The jar could also have a built-in scale that helps kids learn about measurements and fractions. This would make the cookie jar a fun and educational toy for kids."
