    "Smart Soap Dispenser with AI Technology: Create a soap dispenser that utilizes artificial intelligence to detect when a user's hands are nearby and automatically dispense the appropriate amount of soap. This can be achieved through the use of sensors and machine learning algorithms. The dispenser could also have the ability to recognize and adapt to different hand sizes and shapes, ensuring a comfortable and hygienic experience for all users.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Built-in Sanitizer: Design a soap dispenser that incorporates a built-in sanitizer, such as alcohol or antibacterial gel, to provide an additional layer of hygiene. This can be especially useful in high-traffic areas, such as public restrooms, where the risk of germ transmission is higher. The dispenser could be designed to dispense both soap and sanitizer with a simple motion, making it easy and convenient to use.",
    "Motion-Sensing Soap Dispenser: Create a soap dispenser that uses motion sensors to detect when a user is approaching and automatically dispense the appropriate amount of soap. This can be a fun and innovative way to add some excitement to hand washing, while also ensuring that users are getting enough soap to clean their hands effectively. The dispenser could also be designed with different motion sensitivity settings to accommodate different user preferences.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Customizable Soap: Design a soap dispenser that allows users to customize the type of soap they want to use. This could be achieved through the use of interchangeable soap cartridges, each containing a different type of soap. Users could choose from a variety of scents, textures, and formulations, ensuring that they always have the perfect soap for their needs. This could also help reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of soap consumption.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Integrated Dispensing System: Create a soap dispenser that is integrated with a larger dispensing system, such as a commercial kitchen or hospital cleaning system. This could allow for more efficient and organized hand washing, as well as reduce the risk of cross-contamination. The dispenser could be designed to automatically dispense soap and water, or to integrate with existing hand sanitizer dispensers. This could be especially useful"
