    "**Community-based Universal Basic Income (CUBI):** Instead of implementing a single, nationwide UBI, this idea proposes creating smaller, community-based initiatives. Each local area would determine its own UBI amount, allowing for tailored benefits that suit their specific needs. This approach encourages local innovation and engagement while still providing a financial safety net for all residents.",
    "**Time-Based Universal Basic Income (TUBI):** TUBI is a unique implementation where the UBI amount is not a fixed monetary value but rather a set number of hours or tasks that an individual can choose to complete for community projects or personal development. This concept promotes active participation in society, education, and skill-building, while still providing necessary financial support.",
    "**Skill-Linked Universal Basic Income (SLUBI):** In this model, UBI is distributed based on an individual's skills or the demand for those skills within the economy. This encourages skill development and adaptability, as recipients must continuously update their skills to maximize their UBI allocation. It also helps address skill shortages and promotes economic growth by incentivizing learning and career advancement.",
    "**Progressive Universal Basic Income (PUBI):** PUBI adjusts the UBI amount based on an individual's income level, ensuring that higher-income individuals receive less UBI than those with lower incomes. This progressive distribution aims to reduce wealth inequality while still providing essential financial support to all citizens.",
    "**Universal Basic Income with Education and Health Benefits (UBI-EHB):** This comprehensive UBI model includes additional benefits such as free education and healthcare services. By bundling UBI with essential services, it creates a holistic approach to financial security, promoting health and well-being while ensuring financial stability. This model could be particularly beneficial for marginalized communities who may struggle to access these services due to cost barriers."
