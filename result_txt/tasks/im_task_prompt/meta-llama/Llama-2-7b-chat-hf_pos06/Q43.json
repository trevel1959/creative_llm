    "Smart Oven: Create an oven that can detect the type of food being cooked and adjust its temperature and cooking time accordingly. This oven would use sensors and machine learning algorithms to recognize different types of food and optimize cooking conditions for each dish.",
    "Oven with built-in Meal Planning: Develop an oven that can suggest recipes and meal plans based on the user's dietary preferences, ingredients available, and cooking skills. The oven would use a combination of AI and nutritionist-approved algorithms to generate personalized meal plans and recipes.",
    "Multi-functional Oven: Design an oven that can perform multiple functions beyond cooking, such as a built-in microwave, air fryer, and slow cooker. This oven would be ideal for busy households that want to save space and time by consolidating their kitchen appliances.",
    "Oven with Automatic Cooking Time and Temperature Adjustment: Create an oven that can automatically adjust its cooking time and temperature based on the type of food being cooked. This oven would use sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect the thickness and density of the food and adjust cooking conditions accordingly.",
    "Oven with Integrated Food Safety Monitoring System: Develop an oven that can monitor food temperature and humidity levels during cooking to ensure food safety. The oven would use sensors and AI algorithms to detect any deviations from safe cooking conditions and alert the user if necessary."
