    "**Budget Overruns**: The financial implications of hosting the Olympics can be significant, and many host cities have experienced budget overruns. Unexpected costs can arise from construction delays, security enhancements, and the need for last-minute changes to facilities. This can lead to public backlash and strain on local government budgets. A transparent financial plan with contingency funds and strict oversight can help manage these risks.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and infrastructure can lead to significant environmental degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and disruption of local ecosystems. Additionally, the carbon footprint from increased travel and energy consumption can be substantial. To address this, the host city should prioritize sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials, promoting public transport, and ensuring that venues are designed for long-term use after the games.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Large-scale events like the Olympics can attract security threats, including terrorism and protests. Ensuring the safety of athletes, officials, and spectators is paramount but can be challenging. Over-policing can also lead to civil unrest. A balanced approach that includes collaboration with local law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and community engagement can help mitigate these risks while ensuring public safety.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusivity**: The Olympics should celebrate diversity, but there can be challenges in ensuring that all cultures and communities feel represented and included. Issues may arise regarding the portrayal of local customs, the treatment of indigenous populations, and the accessibility of events for people with disabilities. Engaging local communities in the planning process and ensuring representation on organizing committees can foster inclusivity and respect for cultural differences.",
    "**Athlete Welfare and Mental Health**: The pressure of competition and the spotlight of the Olympics can take a toll on athletes' mental health. Issues such as burnout, anxiety, and the struggle for work-life balance can arise. Providing mental health resources, creating a supportive environment, and promoting open discussions about mental health can help athletes cope with the pressures of the games."
