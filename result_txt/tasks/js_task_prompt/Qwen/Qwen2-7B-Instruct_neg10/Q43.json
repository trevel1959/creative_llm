    "**Enhanced Security Oversight**: If you could see through walls, you could use this power to monitor security systems without needing direct access to them. For instance, in your role as a building manager or security officer, you could check for any potential vulnerabilities that are not visible from the outside, such as hidden cameras, weak points in firewalls, or unauthorized entry points.",
    "**Unseen Educational Insights**: Imagine using your power to see through walls during lectures or classes to provide real-time feedback on the learning environment. This could help educators understand the actual engagement levels of students, the effectiveness of teaching methods, or even identify any distractions in the classroom that might be hindering learning.",
    "**Historical Exploration**: By being able to see through walls, you could uncover hidden historical artifacts or secrets. Imagine exploring ancient buildings, ruins, or tombs where parts of the structure have been built over or hidden. This ability could lead to significant discoveries in archaeology, architecture, and history.",
    "**Medical Applications**: In healthcare settings, seeing through walls could revolutionize patient care. For example, doctors could use this power to monitor patients' conditions without disturbing their privacy, check for signs of distress or complications, or even perform remote surgeries with unprecedented precision by observing internal organs in real-time.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Utilizing your power for environmental conservation, you could monitor ecosystems undisturbed by human presence. This could help in identifying endangered species, tracking illegal wildlife trade routes, or monitoring the health of forests, oceans, and other natural habitats. This information would be invaluable for environmental scientists, policymakers, and conservationists in making informed decisions about conservation efforts."
