    "**Interactive Doorway Art Installation**: This idea involves transforming a public or private doorway into an interactive art installation. The artwork could be digital, using sensors to detect movement or touch, and respond accordingly. For example, when someone walks under a light projection, the light changes color or pattern in response to their presence. Alternatively, the door itself could become a canvas for kinetic sculptures that move in response to wind or footsteps.",
    "**Doorway Escape Room**: Create an escape room experience within a doorway, requiring participants to solve puzzles and riddles to unlock the door. This can be designed as a pop-up event, suitable for various locations like office lobbies, apartment complexes, or even inside schools during breaks. The puzzles could involve codes hidden on nearby walls, objects placed just out of reach, or riddles that need to be solved by observing the environment.",
    "**Sound-Activated Doorway Music**: Design a system where the sound produced through a doorway can trigger a music performance or composition. For instance, when someone whispers a specific word near the door, a set of speakers concealed in the wall play a pre-recorded song or piece of music. This could be part of a larger sound art exhibit, where the music changes based on different stimuli from passersby.",
    "**Adaptive Doorway Lighting**: Install smart lighting systems within doorways that adjust based on ambient conditions and the behavior of people passing through. For example, if someone enters a building at night, the door could automatically turn on a softer, welcoming light. It could also include features like \"goodnight\" lights that dim gradually over time when the door is left open, or \"motion-sensitive\" lights that brighten when someone approaches.",
    "**Scent-Triggered Doorway Fragrance**: Utilize scent diffusers or sprays that are activated by motion sensors in doorways. When someone enters or leaves a space, the sensor triggers the release of a specific fragrance designed to evoke certain emotions or moods. This could be used in therapeutic settings, such as a relaxation area in a clinic, where the scent might promote calmness, or in a retail environment to enhance the shopping experience."
