    "**Art Installation**: Create an interactive art installation where people can contribute to building a sculpture or a structure using only non-sand materials like glass beads, marbles, or plastic pieces. This could turn into a community art project, fostering creativity and collaboration among visitors.",
    "**Virtual Beach Experience**: Develop a virtual reality (VR) experience of a beach environment. Users can explore the beach, swim in the ocean, and even build sandcastles using virtual tools. This could be accessible through VR headsets, offering a unique and immersive experience for those who cannot physically visit a beach.",
    "**Beach Soundscapes**: Set up an audio station where visitors can create their own beach soundscapes. They can choose from various sound effects like waves crashing, seagulls calling, and the rustling of palm leaves. Incorporate these sounds into a relaxing mix that can be played in the background while visitors enjoy other beach activities.",
    "**Tactile Art**: Offer tactile art stations where visitors can use non-sand materials to create art. Provide tools like textured paints, embossing powders, and other sensory-friendly materials. This encourages sensory exploration and allows everyone, including those with disabilities, to engage with the beach creatively.",
    "**Environmental Education**: Organize educational workshops about the importance of sand conservation and the impact of its disappearance on ecosystems. Include interactive activities like building model beaches with alternative materials to understand the physical properties of sand. This promotes awareness and encourages sustainable practices in real-world scenarios."
