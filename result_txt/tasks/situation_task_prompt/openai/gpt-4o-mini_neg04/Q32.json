These workshops could be led by health enthusiasts or local herbalists, creating a community-centered approach to maintaining dental health without professional assistance.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush Technology**: Develop a smart toothbrush that not only tracks brushing habits but also provides real-time feedback on technique and pressure.

    "**Virtual Dental Health Coaches**: Launch a platform that connects users with virtual dental health coaches who can provide personalized advice based on individual dental histories and current oral health.

    "**Plant-Based Dental Remedies**: Create a line of plant-based dental care products, such as herbal toothpaste and mouth rinses, utilizing ingredients like aloe vera, peppermint, and tea tree oil known for their oral health benefits. Each product could come with a guide explaining the benefits of each ingredient and how they work to maintain healthy teeth and gums, promoting a holistic approach to dental care.",
    "**Gamified Oral Hygiene Apps**: Design a mobile app that gamifies oral hygiene routines. Users can set goals for brushing and flossing, earn points for consistent care, and compete with friends for the best oral hygiene practices.
