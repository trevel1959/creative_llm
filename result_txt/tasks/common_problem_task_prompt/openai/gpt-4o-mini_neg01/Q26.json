    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Mount Everest can change rapidly and unpredictably. Sudden storms, high winds, and extreme cold can pose serious threats to climbers. To address this, teams should closely monitor weather forecasts and have contingency plans in place, including retreat strategies and safe zones for shelter.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: In recent years, the number of climbers attempting to summit Everest has increased significantly, leading to dangerous bottlenecks, particularly near the summit. This congestion can lead to exhaustion and increased exposure to harsh conditions. To combat this issue, climbers should coordinate their ascent times and communicate effectively with other teams to minimize congestion.",
    "**Physical Fitness and Preparation**: Climbing Everest requires peak physical condition, and inadequate preparation can lead to severe fatigue or injury. Many climbers underestimate the physical demands of the ascent. To prevent this, climbers should engage in a rigorous training regimen, including strength, endurance, and technical climbing skills, well before their expedition.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Climbing Everest demands specialized gear, including high-altitude tents, oxygen systems, and climbing equipment. Equipment failure can lead to dangerous situations, especially in extreme conditions. Climbers should conduct thorough checks of their gear before the expedition and carry backup equipment whenever possible.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increasing number of climbers on Everest has raised concerns about environmental degradation, including waste management issues and damage to the fragile ecosystem. To address this, climbers and expedition companies should adhere to Leave No Trace principles, ensure proper waste disposal, and participate in clean-up efforts to minimize their environmental footprint."
