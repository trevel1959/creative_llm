    "1. The new energy source would be called \"\" (pronounced \"\"). It would be a type of kinetic energy that is generated by the movement of water droplets in the air.",
    "2. The concept is based on the principle of condensation-evaporation cycle. When water drople are heated, they evaporate into water vapor, which then moves through the air and cools down. As it cools down, the water vapor condenses back into droplets, which then evaporate again. This cycle creates a continuous flow of energy that can be harnessed.",
    "3. The energy generated by iju can be used to power homes, factories, and vehicles. It can also be used to generate electricity.",
    "4. The main advantage of iju is that it is renewable and clean. It does not produce any harmful emissions or byproducts, making it an ideal energy source for a sustainable future."
