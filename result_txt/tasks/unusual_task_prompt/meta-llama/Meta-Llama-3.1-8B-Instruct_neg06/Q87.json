The platform, called \"Flopbook,\" would allow users to anonymously share their stories of failure, providing a safe space for people to open up about their setbacks. This could help normalize failure and encourage users to learn from their mistakes. Each user's story would be displayed on a \"failure wall,\" where others could offer support and advice.
