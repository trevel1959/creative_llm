    "**Adaptive Tool Evolution**: Humans would develop innovative, makeshift tools to overcome the loss of scissors and knives. For instance, they might use rocks, shells, or even plant fibers to create crude but effective cutting instruments. Over time, these makeshift tools would give rise to new technologies, such as: \t*   **Razor-sharp obsidian**: By heating and shaping obsidian, people could create sharp, durable blades that could be used for cutting.",
    "**Nature-based Solutions**: People would learn to harness the power of nature to cut and shape materials. For example: \t*   **Rock hammering**: By using rocks to hammer and shape materials, humans could create tools and objects without the need for scissors or knives.",
    "**Biomechanical Integration**: Humans would develop new ways to integrate their bodies with machines to enhance their cutting abilities. For instance: \t*   **Mechanical limbs**: By developing prosthetic limbs with built-in cutting tools, people could perform tasks that require precision and dexterity.",
    "**Alternative Materials**: Humans would discover new materials that could be easily cut or shaped without the need for scissors or knives. For example: \t*   **Super-soft metals**: By developing metals that are extremely soft and pliable, people could cut and shape them using simple tools or even their bare hands.",
    "**Neuroplastic Adaptation**: Humans would adapt their brains to develop new cognitive abilities that allow them to perceive and interact with the world in new ways. For instance: \t*   **Enhanced spatial awareness**: By developing a greater sense of spatial awareness, people could visualize and manipulate objects in their minds, allowing them to cut and shape materials without physical tools."
