    "1. Designing Skates with Adjustable Wheels: Create roller skates with interchangeable wheels that can be adjusted according to the terrain, weather, or personal preference. This would enable skaters to adapt to different conditions and enjoy a smoother ride.",
    "2. Incorporating Artificial Intelligence: Integrate AI technology into the skates to provide real-time feedback on the skater's technique, balance, and speed. This would help skaters improve their skills and reduce the risk of injuries.",
    "3. Innovative Brake System: Develop a brake system that is more responsive and easier to use. This could be achieved by adding sensors that detect the skater's movements and automatically apply the brakes when needed.",
    "4. Lightweight and Durable Materials: Replace traditional materials with lightweight and durable ones, such as carbon fiber or titanium, to reduce the overall weight of the skates and improve their durability.",
    "5. Ergonomic Design: Design roller skates with ergonomic features such as cushioning, arch support, and a comfortable footbed to reduce fatigue and improve overall skating experience."
