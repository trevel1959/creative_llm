    "**Life Support Systems**: The spaceship must be equipped with a robust life support system that can sustain a crew member's life for extended periods, which might involve traveling in an environment with different temperatures, atmospheres, and radiation levels. Comprehending the requirements of crew life support, including air circulation, temperature control, and water supply, is crucial for a successful space mission.",
    "**Navigation**: Navigating a spaceship across various solar systems and galaxies brings its own set of challenges. Engineers need to create a sophisticated navigation system that can map out the safest paths through space, avoiding known hazards and providing real-time guidance to the pilot. This also includes a system for communication with ground control in case of emergencies.",
    "**Energy Generation**: Space missions require significant amounts of energy to propel the ship, power life support systems, and manage scientific experiments. Engineers must devise a method to generate and store this energy, whether it be using nuclear power, solar energy, or a combination of both. This involves calculations for the mass and cost of the energy source, as well as the infrastructure to harness and use it.",
    "**Landing and Takeoff on Different Planets**: Each planet or moon in the solar system has specific gravity, atmospheric conditions, and landing zones. Designing a landing and takeoff system that can adapt to these varied conditions is complex, requiring the creation of specialized modules and equipment that can deploy and retract depending on the mission.",
    "**Life Safety and Emergency Procedures**: Emergencies can happen even on the best-designed spaceship. Having well-planned life safety and emergency procedures in place is essential. The design of the spaceship must include adequate escape pods, life vests, and oxygen systems to ensure crew members' safety in case of accidents or equipment failure."
