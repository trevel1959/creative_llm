    "Improved Economic Growth: Erasing world debt would eliminate the burden of debt servicing, allowing governments to redirect funds towards investments that promote economic growth. This could lead to increased productivity, job creation, and higher living standards.",
    "Redistribution of Wealth: With debt erased, the wealth generated by economic activity would be more evenly distributed, as the current debt-based economic system often perpetuates income inequality. This could lead to a more equitable society, where everyone has access to basic necessities and opportunities for advancement.",
    "Reduced Inflation: Without the burden of debt servicing, inflation would likely decrease as governments could print more money without worrying about debt repayment. This could lead to lower prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for consumers.",
    "Increased Investment: With the uncertainty surrounding debt removal, investors may be more hesitant to invest in risky ventures. However, as the initial shock wears off, investors may become more confident in the new economic landscape, leading to increased investment in industries such as infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy.",
    "New Financial Instruments: The erasure of world debt could lead to the development of new financial instruments and systems that prioritize sustainability and equity. For example, a universal basic income or a resource-based economy could be implemented to ensure everyone's basic needs are met and to reduce inequality."
