    "Bio-based Building Blocks: Create a new generation of building blocks made from biological materials like mycelium, a fungus-based composite. These blocks would be compostable, lightweight, and have insulating properties. Mycelium can be grown in a controlled environment, molded into desired shapes, and cured to create strong, durable blocks. These blocks could be used to construct walls, floors, and roofs, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials.",
    "Cellular Concrete: Develop a new type of concrete that uses air-filled cells instead of voids. These cells would provide insulation, reducing the need for additional insulation materials. The cells could be created by injecting air into a specialized mixture of cement, sand, and water. The resulting concrete would be lightweight, energy-efficient, and have improved thermal performance.",
    "Shape-Memory Alloys: Use shape-memory alloys (SMAs) to create building components that can change shape in response to temperature changes. SMAs are metals that can remember their original shape and return to it when heated. By incorporating SMAs into building components, such as beams, columns, and panels, these components could adjust their shape to optimize energy efficiency, reduce material usage, and improve structural performance.",
    "Air-Breathing Walls: Design walls that can breathe, allowing them to regulate temperature and humidity levels in a building. These walls would use a specialized membrane that allows air to pass through, creating a natural ventilation system. The membrane would be made from a combination of materials, such as polymers, silicones, and nanomaterials, that allow for airflow while preventing water vapor and moisture from passing through. This would create a more comfortable and energy-efficient indoor environment.",
    "Grown-in-Place Structures: Develop a method for growing building structures directly from the ground. This could involve using mycelium, bacteria, or other microorganisms to create the structural elements of a building. The microorganisms would break down organic matter and use it to create a strong, lightweight structure. This approach would eliminate the need for cutting down trees or mining materials, reducing the environmental impact of building construction. The structures could be grown"
