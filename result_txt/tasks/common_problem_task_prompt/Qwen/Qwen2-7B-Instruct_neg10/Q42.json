    "Resource Allocation: Managing resources efficiently can be a significant challenge in a large-scale experiment. This includes securing funding, obtaining necessary materials, and allocating personnel. Mismanagement of resources could lead to project delays, budget overruns, or inadequate staffing, potentially compromising the experiment's success.",
    "Data Management: Collecting, storing, and analyzing vast amounts of data generated by a large-scale experiment can be overwhelming. Poor data management practices might result in lost data, incorrect analysis, or difficulty in replicating results. Implementing robust data management systems, including backup strategies and data validation procedures, is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the research findings.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Large-scale experiments often involve human subjects or the manipulation of living organisms. Researchers must adhere to ethical guidelines to protect the rights and welfare of participants. This may include obtaining informed consent, minimizing harm, and addressing any potential conflicts of interest. Failure to address ethical concerns could lead to legal repercussions, loss of public trust, or reputational damage.",
    "Collaboration Challenges: Large-scale experiments typically involve multiple institutions, disciplines, and stakeholders. Coordinating efforts across diverse teams and managing communication gaps can be difficult. Establishing clear roles, expectations, and regular progress updates can help overcome these challenges and foster a collaborative environment that promotes efficiency and innovation.",
    "Technical Limitations: Large-scale experiments often push the boundaries of existing technology and require specialized equipment or software. Identifying and acquiring the necessary tools can be time-consuming and costly. Ensuring compatibility and scalability of technical infrastructure is crucial to avoid setbacks and maintain operational continuity throughout the experiment."
