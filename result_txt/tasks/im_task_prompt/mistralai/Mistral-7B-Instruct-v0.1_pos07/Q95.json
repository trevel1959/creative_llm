    "Create a smart laundry basket that sorts and separates clothes based on color, fabric, and size. The basket would use sensors and machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize items, making it easier for users to sort their laundry without having to manually sort through each item.",
    "Develop a laundry basket with built-in storage compartments for items that require special care, such as delicate clothing, shoes, and accessories. The compartments would be designed to protect these items from damage and ensure they are washed and dried properly.",
    "Create a laundry basket that doubles as a charging station for mobile devices. Users could plug their phones, tablets, and other devices into the basket while their clothes are being washed and dried, keeping their devices charged and ready to go.",
    "Develop a laundry basket with a built-in drying rack. The basket would have a removable drying rack that could be used to hang clothes that need to be air-dried, saving space and making the drying process more efficient.",
    "Create a laundry basket that uses eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technology. The basket would be made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic, and would use solar panels or other renewable energy sources to power its features, reducing its environmental impact."
