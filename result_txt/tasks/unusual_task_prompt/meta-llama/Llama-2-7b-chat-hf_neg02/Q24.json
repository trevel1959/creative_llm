    "Toothbrush with Built-in Toothpaste Dispenser: Create a toothbrush with a built-in toothpaste dispenser that automatically releases the right amount of toothpaste onto the brush head as you brush. This would eliminate the need for manual toothpaste application, making the process more convenient and hygienic. The dispenser could be located on the handle of the toothbrush, and the toothpaste could be stored in a small compartment within the handle.",
    "Smart Toothbrush with Personalized Brushing Patterns: Design a toothbrush that uses AI technology to analyze your brushing patterns and provide personalized recommendations for improving your oral hygiene. The toothbrush could have sensors that track the pressure, speed, and direction of your brushing, and provide feedback on areas where you may be brushing too hard or not hard enough. It could also suggest different brushing patterns based on your individual needs, such as more gentle brushing for sensitive teeth or more vigorous brushing for plaque removal.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer: Create a toothbrush with a built-in UV sanitizer that kills bacteria and germs on the brush head and handle. This would help prevent the spread of illness-causing bacteria, making the toothbrush a more hygienic and safe tool for oral care. The UV sanitizer could be located on the handle of the toothbrush, and could be activated with a simple button press or by using a timer.",
    "Interactive Toothbrush with Games and Rewards: Design a toothbrush that offers interactive games and rewards to make brushing teeth more fun and engaging for kids. The toothbrush could have a built-in screen that displays games, such as a brushing race against a cartoon character, or a treasure hunt for hidden brushing symbols. As kids brush their teeth, they could collect points or rewards for completing their brushing routine, such as unlocking new games or earning virtual prizes.",
