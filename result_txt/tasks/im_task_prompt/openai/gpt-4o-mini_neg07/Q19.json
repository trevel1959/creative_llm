    "**Adaptive Tint Technology**: Create glasses that automatically adjust their tint based on sunlight exposure. Utilizing photochromic materials combined with sensors, these glasses would darken in bright light and return to a clear state indoors. This would provide optimal eye protection and comfort without the need for separate sunglasses, making them ideal for outdoor enthusiasts and those who frequently transition between different lighting environments.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Introduce a self-cleaning nanotechnology coating that repels dust, smudges, and water. This would significantly reduce the need for constant cleaning, keeping lenses clear and maintaining optimal vision. The coating could be activated by a simple wipe or exposure to UV light, ensuring that users enjoy pristine lenses with minimal effort.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames**: Design glasses with a modular frame system that allows users to easily swap out colors, styles, and materials based on their mood or outfit. This would encourage personal expression and make it easy for wearers to match their glasses with different occasions without needing to purchase multiple pairs.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Incorporate health monitoring sensors into the frames to track vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and even stress levels. The data could sync with a mobile app to provide users with insights about their health and wellness, reminding them to take breaks or engage in relaxation techniques, making glasses a dual-purpose accessory.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Audio Integration**: Embed discreet bone conduction speakers into the arms of the glasses, allowing users to listen to music or take calls without blocking their ears. This would provide an immersive audio experience while still allowing the wearer to be aware of their surroundings, making it perfect for urban environments or while exercising."
