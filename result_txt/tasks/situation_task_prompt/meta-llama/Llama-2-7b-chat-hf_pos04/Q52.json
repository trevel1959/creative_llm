    "Use Natural Materials: In a world without cooking equipment, meals could be prepared using natural materials found in the environment. For example, rocks and sticks could be used to create a makeshift grill for cooking meat and vegetables. Roots and leaves could be used as utensils for mixing and stirring.",
    "Utilize the Sun and Fire: Harnessing the power of the sun and fire could be used to cook meals. Food could be placed directly on a rock or log and cooked using the sun's heat. Alternatively, a makeshift solar oven could be created using a cardboard box, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap to trap and concentrate sunlight.",
    "Create a DIY Microwave: A makeshift microwave could be created using a sealed container, such as a plastic bucket, and a source of heat, such as a fire or the sun. The container could be placed inside the heat source and rotated to cook food evenly.",
    "Use Animal Power: In a world without cooking equipment, animals could be used to help prepare meals. For example, a horse or donkey could be used to grind grains into flour using a makeshift millstone. A cow or goat could be used to provide milk, cheese, and butter.",
    "Create a DIY Smoker: A smoker could be created using a large metal drum, some mesh, and a source of heat. Wood could be placed inside the drum and smoke could be used to cook food, such as meats and vegetables. The mesh could be used to allow air to circulate and cook the food evenly."
