    "Smart Poles: Integrate technology into the ski poles to provide real-time feedback and assistance to the skier. This can include sensors that detect the user's balance and provide vibration feedback when they are off-center, or an accelerometer that measures the user's speed and suggests optimal technique for turns and stops.",
    "LED Lighting: Add LED lights to the top of the ski poles to improve visibility in low-light conditions. The lights can be powered by a rechargeable battery and have adjustable brightness and color settings.",
    "Adjustable Length: Add an adjustable length feature to the ski poles to allow for better customization and flexibility. This can be achieved through a telescoping mechanism that allows the user to extend or retract the pole to their desired length.",
    "Weight Distribution: Improve the weight distribution of the ski poles by incorporating lightweight materials and reducing the weight of the handle and grip. This can be achieved by using composite materials and designing the grip to be more streamlined.",
    "Integrated Navigation: Incorporate a GPS and compass into the ski poles to provide real-time navigation assistance. The GPS can track the user's location and provide directions, while the compass can show the direction of the user's destination."
