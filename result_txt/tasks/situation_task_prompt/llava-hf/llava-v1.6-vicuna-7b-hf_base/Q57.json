    "Underwater Cities: Another option is to create underwater cities, where people can live and work in a self-sustainable environment beneath the ocean's surface. These cities could be designed with advanced technology to withstand the challenges of underwater living.",
    "Raised Coastal Cities: Raising existing coastal cities on stilts or pilings could provide a solution for living in areas prone to flooding. This would allow residents to continue living in their homes while protecting them from rising water levels.",
    "Land Reclamation: Creating new land through land reclamation techniques, such as dredging and filling, could provide additional living space in areas affected by rising ocean levels. This would involve constructing barriers to hold back the water and then filling the area with sand or other materials.",
    "Oceanic Platforms: Building oceanic platforms, such as artificial islands or reefs, could provide a stable living environment in areas with rapidly rising ocean levels. These platforms could be designed to withstand the forces of nature and provide a safe haven for residents.",
    "Submersible Homes: Living in submersible homes could be another option for those living in areas with rising ocean levels. These homes would be designed to withstand the challenges of underwater living and provide a comfortable living environment."
