    "Solar-Powered Charging Station: By integrating solar panels onto the bicycle frame or using a portable solar panel attached to the back rack, the bicycle can serve as a charging station for electronic devices. Commuters can charge their smartphones, tablets, or laptops during their daily rides, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on electrical outlets.",
    "Food Delivery Drone Carrier: In urban areas, a bicycle can be equipped with a drone carrier that attaches to its front or rear rack. This setup enables efficient and eco-friendly food delivery services by having drones pick up and drop off orders from the bicycle. This combination reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions associated with traditional delivery vehicles.",
    "Recycling Collection Hub: A bicycle can be customized with containers for various types of recyclables (e.g., plastic, paper, glass) and used as a collection hub for local communities. People can drop off their recyclables at designated locations and then collect them when passing by on their daily commute. This encourages recycling and helps promote environmental awareness.",
    "Urban Farming Vehicle: Bicycles can be fitted with raised planters or attached to a trailer for carrying soil, seeds, and plants. This setup turns bicycles into mobile gardening tools, allowing people to cultivate small gardens or grow vegetables in tight urban spaces. Commuters can also use this setup to transport harvested produce, promoting local food systems and sustainable living.",
    "Sound System Bike: By mounting speakers and a battery-powered audio system onto the bicycle frame or rear rack, the bicycle can transform into a portable sound system. This setup enables cyclists to share music, podcasts, or audiobooks with the community while riding through parks, streets, or festivals. It promotes social connections and shared experiences."
