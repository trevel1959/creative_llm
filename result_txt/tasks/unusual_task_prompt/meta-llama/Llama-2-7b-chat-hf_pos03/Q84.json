    "Smart Trash Can: Create a smart trash can that can identify and sort recyclables from non-recyclables using AI-powered image recognition technology. The can would have a built-in camera and sensors to detect the type of waste placed inside, and then sort it automatically. This would make recycling easier and more efficient, and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.",
    "Trash Can with Air Purification: Design a trash can that not only collects trash but also purifies the air around it. The can would be equipped with a built-in air purification system that captures and removes pollutants and allergens from the air. This would create a cleaner and healthier environment, especially in areas with high levels of air pollution.",
    "Trash Can with Built-in Composter: Create a trash can that includes a built-in composter, allowing users to turn their food waste into nutrient-rich soil. The composter would use microorganisms to break down food waste, and the resulting compost could be used in gardens or indoor plants. This would reduce the amount of food waste that ends up in landfills and create a sustainable source of nutrient-rich soil.",
    "Trash Can with Built-in Water Filter: Design a trash can that includes a built-in water filter, allowing users to purify water from any source. The filter would use activated carbon or other materials to remove impurities and contaminants from water, making it safe to drink. This would be especially useful in areas with limited access to clean drinking water.",
    "Trash Can with Augmented Reality Display: Create a trash can that includes an augmented reality display, allowing users to see information about the waste they are disposing of. The display could show the type of waste, its potential impact on the environment, and ways to reduce or recycle it. This would encourage users to make more sustainable choices and reduce their environmental footprint."
