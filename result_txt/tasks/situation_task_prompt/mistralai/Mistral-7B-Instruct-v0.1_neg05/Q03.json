    "I would stay with family or friends: If my house disappeared, I would likely stay with family or friends until I can find a permanent place to live. This would be a great opportunity to reconnect with loved ones and spend some quality time with them.",
    "I would rent a temporary place: If I don't have any family or friends to stay with, I would consider renting a temporary place like an Airbnb or a vacation rental. This would give me the time and space to figure out my next steps and find a permanent place to live.",
    "I would stay in a hotel: If I don't have any family or friends to stay with and I don't want to rent a temporary place, I would consider staying in a hotel. This would give me a comfortable and secure place to stay while I figure out my next steps.",
    "I would stay with a charitable organization: If I am in a situation where I don't have any family or friends to stay with and I can't afford to rent a place, I would consider reaching out to a charitable organization for help. Many organizations offer temporary housing or emergency assistance to those in need.",
    "I would stay in a public space: If I am in a situation where I don't have any family or friends to stay with and I can't afford to rent a place or stay in a hotel, I would consider staying in a public space like a park or a public building. This would be a temporary solution, but it would give me a place to sleep and rest while I figure out my next steps."
