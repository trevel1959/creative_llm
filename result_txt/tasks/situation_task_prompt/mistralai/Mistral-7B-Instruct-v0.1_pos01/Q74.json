    "Use natural ingredients: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could use fruits, vegetables, and other natural products to cleanse our skin, moisturize it, and remove makeup. For example, we could use apple cider vinegar to cleanse our skin, honey to moisturize it, and turmeric to remove makeup.",
    "Use DIY beauty products: Another option would be to create our own DIY beauty products. We could use essential oils, herbs, and other natural ingredients to make our own cleansers, moisturizers, and other grooming products. This would allow us to customize our products to our specific needs and preferences.",
    "Get a professional grooming: We could also consider getting a professional grooming from a salon or spa. This would allow us to maintain our personal grooming habits without relying on cosmetic products. We could get a facial, haircut, manicure, and other grooming services to maintain our appearance.",
    "Use natural remedies: We could also use natural remedies to maintain our personal grooming habits. For example, we could use tea tree oil to treat acne, aloe vera to soothe sunburns, and coconut oil to moisturize our skin.",
    "Embrace our natural beauty: Finally, we could embrace our natural beauty and stop using cosmetic products altogether. We could focus on eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly to maintain our appearance. We could also learn to love our natural features and stop trying to cover them up with makeup."
