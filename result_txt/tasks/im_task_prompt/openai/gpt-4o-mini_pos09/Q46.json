    "**Integrated Measuring Tool**: Incorporate a measuring tape along the blade of the scissors, allowing users to measure as they cut. This could be a retractable tape that slides out from the handle and locks in place, enabling precise measurements without needing an additional tool. The tape could be marked in both metric and imperial units for versatility.",
    "**Multi-Functional Blades**: Design scissors with interchangeable blades that can be swapped out for different cutting tasks. For example, one blade could be serrated for cutting fabric, another could be straight for paper, and a third could have a decorative edge for crafting. This would eliminate the need for multiple pairs of scissors, saving space and improving efficiency.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Sensor Technology**: Develop a pair of smart scissors that feature built-in sensors to detect the material being cut and adjust the blade tension accordingly. This technology could help prevent damage to delicate materials or ensure a clean cut on thicker materials. Additionally, these scissors could connect to a smartphone app that tracks usage, provides cutting tips, and even suggests projects based on the materials at hand.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Create scissors with a self-sharpening mechanism that utilizes a small grinding wheel or sharpening surface integrated into the handle. As the scissors are used, the blades would automatically sharpen themselves, ensuring optimal cutting performance without the need for manual sharpening. This feature would be especially useful for crafters and professionals who rely on precision cutting.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade System**: Introduce a color-coded blade system where each blade color corresponds to a specific material or purpose (e.g., red for fabric, blue for paper, green for plastic). This visual cue would help users quickly identify the right scissors for their task, reducing the chances of cross-contamination or damage to materials, especially in crafting or sewing environments."
