    "**Zoning and Permitting Issues**: Local zoning laws may restrict the installation of solar panels, particularly in historic districts or areas with strict aesthetic guidelines. Navigating the permitting process can be time-consuming and may result in disputes with homeowners or local government, potentially leading to project delays or modifications to the installation plans.",
    "**Financial Barriers for Homeowners**: While the installation of solar panels can lead to long-term savings, the upfront costs may be prohibitive for some homeowners. Even with incentives or financing options, there could be resistance from lower-income families who may not see immediate benefits, leading to disparities in solar adoption across the city.",
    "**Grid Capacity and Infrastructure Strain**: A sudden influx of solar energy production could overwhelm the existing electrical grid, especially during peak sunlight hours. Upgrades to the grid infrastructure may be necessary to handle the increased load and to facilitate the integration of solar energy, leading to additional costs and planning requirements.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of this, leading to decreased performance over time. Additionally, establishing a reliable network of service providers for repairs and maintenance could be a logistical challenge, particularly in a city with diverse needs and varying levels of service availability.",
    "**Public Perception and Community Buy-in**: Not all residents may be enthusiastic about solar panels due to aesthetic concerns, misconceptions about their effectiveness, or a lack of understanding of their benefits. Gaining community buy-in through education and outreach programs will be crucial to ensure widespread acceptance and participation in the initiative."
