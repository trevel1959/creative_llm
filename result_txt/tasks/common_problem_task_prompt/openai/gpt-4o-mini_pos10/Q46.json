    "**Public Resistance and Stakeholder Engagement**: Changing a public transportation system can lead to resistance from various stakeholders, including residents, businesses, and local government officials. Many people may be attached to the current system or skeptical of the proposed changes. Effective communication and engagement strategies are essential to address concerns, gather feedback, and foster community support for the overhaul.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: The existing infrastructure may not support the proposed changes, requiring significant upgrades or complete redesigns. This can include road repairs, station renovations, and the installation of new technology. The need for construction can lead to disruptions in traffic and inconvenience for residents, creating further resistance to the project.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While overhauling public transportation is often aimed at reducing environmental impact, the construction and operation phases can still have negative effects. Issues such as noise pollution, habitat disruption, and increased carbon emissions during construction need to be carefully managed. Ensuring that the overhaul is genuinely sustainable will require thorough environmental assessments and mitigation strategies.",
    "**Technology Integration**: Incorporating new technologies, such as real-time tracking systems, mobile ticketing, and electric vehicles, can enhance the public transportation experience. However, integrating these technologies poses challenges, including compatibility with existing systems, training staff, and ensuring cybersecurity. Failure to effectively implement technology can lead to operational inefficiencies and decreased public trust.",
    "**Equity and Accessibility Concerns**: A public transportation overhaul must consider the needs of all community members, particularly marginalized groups who may rely heavily on public transit. Ensuring that the new system is accessible to individuals with disabilities, as well as affordable for low-income residents, is crucial. Failing to address these equity concerns can lead to increased social disparities and public criticism."
