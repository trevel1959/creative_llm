    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other impurities from seawater to make it drinkable. This could be a viable option for obtaining clean drinking water if all freshwater sources were polluted. Desalination plants can be installed in coastal areas to provide clean drinking water to the local population.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater is another option for obtaining clean drinking water. This can be done through the use of rain barrels, cisterns, or other storage systems. The collected water can be filtered and purified to make it safe for consumption.",
    "Greywater recycling: Greywater is the wastewater that comes from activities like showering, washing dishes, and laundry. This water can be collected and treated to make it safe for drinking. Greywater recycling systems can be installed in homes and businesses to provide an additional source of clean water.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a method of sustainable agriculture that combines hydroponics (growing plants without soil) and aquaculture (raising fish in controlled environments). In an aquaponics system, fish waste provides nutrients for plant growth, and the plants filter and purify the water for the fish. This can be a viable option for obtaining clean drinking water in areas with polluted water sources.",
    "Water purification tablets: Water purification tablets are a simple and effective way to make contaminated water safe for drinking. These tablets contain chemicals that kill bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. They can be added to water sources to make them safe for consumption. This option may not be suitable for large-scale use, but it can be effective in emergency situations."
