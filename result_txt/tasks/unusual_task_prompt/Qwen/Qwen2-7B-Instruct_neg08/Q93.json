    "**Jealousy Jar**: Create a physical or digital \"Jealousy Jar\" where you write down instances of jealousy you experience. Every time you feel jealous, jot it down. The purpose is not to dwell on these feelings but to acknowledge them. After a week, reflect on why these feelings arose. This can help you understand your insecurities and potentially find healthier ways to react to others' accomplishments.",
    "**Gratitude Vase**: Fill a vase with small notes detailing things you're grateful for about yourself. Whenever you notice jealousy creeping in, take a note from the vase and remind yourself of your own achievements and qualities. This practice reinforces positive self-image and can diminish feelings of envy over time.",
    "**Celebrate Others' Success**: Create a personalized gift or card for someone who has achieved something significant. Include a message that acknowledges their hard work and wishes them continued success. This not only helps in shifting your focus from what others have achieved to supporting them, but also promotes a sense of community and shared growth.",
    "**Set Personal Milestones**: Instead of comparing yourself to others, set personal goals and milestones. These could be learning a new skill, improving health, or achieving academic or professional success. When you focus on your own journey, you'll likely experience less jealousy and more satisfaction.",
    "**Mindfulness and Meditation**: Dedicate some time each day to mindfulness or meditation practices. This can help manage negative emotions like jealousy by fostering a state of calm and self-awareness. When you feel jealous, try to observe these feelings without judgment, then return to your breath and bring your focus back to the present moment. Over time, this can reduce the intensity of such feelings and improve your overall emotional well-being."
