    "Create a mobile app that uses augmented reality to help users find their lost car keys. The app would use the phone's camera to scan the surrounding area for any objects that match the description of the missing key. Once the user identifies the key, they can request a delivery or pick-up service to retrieve it.",
    "Design a custom key fob that doubles as a portable charger. Users could charge their phone while on-the-go using the built-in USB port. Additionally, the fob could be programmed to remotely lock or unlock the user's vehicle from a distance.",
    "Develop a smart lock system that automatically unlocks the user's car when they approach. The system would use Bluetooth technology to detect the user's smartphone and unlock the doors without the need for a physical key.",
    "Create a line of eco-friendly car keys made from recycled materials. These keys would not only be durable but also reduce waste and promote sustainability.",
    "Introduce a subscription-based service that provides users with a replacement car key in case they lose one. The service would include free delivery and installation, as well as a warranty to cover any unexpected issues that may arise."
