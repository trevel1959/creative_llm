    "**Modular Packing System**:    Introduce a suitcase with a modular packing system that includes removable compartments or cubes that can be customized based on the type of trip. For example, one compartment could be dedicated to clothing, another for toiletries, and a third for electronics. This allows travelers to easily switch out compartments depending on their needs and makes packing and unpacking more efficient.",
    "**Built-in Solar Charger**:    Equip the suitcase with a built-in solar panel that can charge electronic devices on the go. The suitcase could have USB ports on the outside, allowing travelers to charge their phones, tablets, or other gadgets while waiting at the airport or on public transport. This eco-friendly feature would be particularly useful for travelers who are often on the move and rely on their devices.",
    "**Personalized Security Features**:    Enhance suitcase security with biometric locks that use fingerprint recognition for access. This feature would eliminate the need for keys or combinations, making it easier for travelers to secure their belongings. Additionally, the suitcase could have a built-in GPS tracker that connects to a mobile app, allowing users to locate their suitcase in case it gets lost or misplaced.",
    "**Self-Weighting Mechanism**:    Incorporate a self-weighting mechanism that automatically weighs the suitcase as it is being packed. A digital display on the suitcase handle could show the weight in real-time, helping travelers avoid overweight baggage fees. The suitcase could also provide suggestions on how to redistribute items if the weight exceeds airline limits.",
    "**Expandable Design**:    Create a suitcase with an expandable design that allows it to grow in size as needed. By incorporating zippers or expandable sections, travelers could increase the capacity of the suitcase for return trips when they might have souvenirs or additional items. This feature would make the suitcase versatile for both short and long trips without the need for multiple bags."
