    "**The Envy Garden**: Create a whimsical garden where jealousy is personified as a mischievous sprite. The garden would have a twisted, overgrown design, with vines crawling up the walls and flowers that seem to be competing for attention. Visitors would walk through the garden, encountering manifestations of jealousy, such as a weeping willow tree representing the emotional turmoil of feeling envious. As they navigate the garden, they'd discover hidden paths and secret areas, symbolizing the complexity of emotions and the multiple facets of jealousy.",
    "**The Reflection Pool**: Design a serene, tranquil pool where visitors can reflect on their emotions. The pool's surface would be adorned with floating candles, representing the flickering nature of jealousy.

The time machine would be designed to resemble a Victorian-era carriage, with intricate clockwork mechanisms and a steam-powered engine.
