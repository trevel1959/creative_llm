    "Smart Bottle Openers: Traditional bottle openers can be bulky and awkward to use, leading to frustration and spills. To improve the picnic basket experience, you could design a smart bottle opener that uses AI-powered sensors to detect the type of bottle and automatically adjust the opening pressure. This would ensure that the cap comes off easily and safely, without any mess.",
    "Customizable Compartments: Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to packing a picnic basket. To cater to these preferences, you could create a modular picnic basket with interchangeable compartments. This would allow users to customize the basket to their liking, whether they prefer more space for food or more room for drinks.",
    "Portable Power Bank: Picnics can often involve long hours of outdoor fun, which means that phones and other devices can quickly run out of battery. To address this, you could design a picnic basket with a built-in portable power bank. This would ensure that devices stay charged throughout the day, allowing for endless fun and no interruptions.",
    "Food-Grade Storage Bags: Traditional plastic bags used in picnic baskets are not food-grade, which means they can't be used to store perishable items like sandwiches or fruit. To solve this problem, you could create a line of food-grade storage bags made from sustainable materials like cotton or beeswax. These bags would be safe to use for both food and drinks, and would add an extra layer of convenience to the picnic basket experience.",
    "Collapsible Utensils: Traditional utensils can be bulky and take up valuable space in a picnic basket. To solve this problem, you could design a line of collapsible utensils that can be easily stored when not in use. These utensils could be made from lightweight materials like stainless steel or silicone, and could be collapsed into small compartments in the picnic basket for easy storage."
