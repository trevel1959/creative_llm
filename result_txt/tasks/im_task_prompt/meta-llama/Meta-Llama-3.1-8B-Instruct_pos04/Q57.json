    "A wearable computer mouse that is integrated into a wristband. This wristband would have a touch-sensitive surface and would allow users to navigate through digital interfaces using gestures. For example, a user could draw a circle with their finger to scroll through a webpage or use a specific gesture to click on a button. The wristband could also track the user's movements and provide haptic feedback to enhance the user experience.",
    "A computer mouse that doubles as a 3D printer. This mouse would have a small 3D printing head that would allow users to print small objects directly onto a surface. For example, a user could design a small object using computer-aided design (CAD) software and then print it directly onto a piece of paper or a physical surface using the mouse. This would revolutionize the way we design and create objects, making it easier and more accessible for people to bring their ideas to life.",
    "A computer mouse that uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to allow users to control their computer with their thoughts. This mouse would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to read the user's brain activity and translate it into computer commands. For example, a user could think about clicking on a button and the mouse would detect the corresponding brain activity and perform the action. This would enable people with disabilities to interact with computers in a more intuitive and accessible way.",
    "A computer mouse that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to project virtual buttons and interfaces onto a surface. This mouse would use a camera and projector to superimpose virtual objects onto the real world, allowing users to interact with them using the mouse. For example, a user could point the mouse at a physical surface and see virtual buttons or menus appear, allowing them to control their computer with ease.",
    "A computer mouse that can be controlled using a smartphone app. This mouse would use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to connect to the user's smartphone, allowing them to control their computer using the app. For example, a user could use the app to draw a circle on the screen to scroll through a webpage or use a specific gesture to click on a button. This would provide a more flexible and portable way to interact with computers, allowing users to control their computer from anywhere in the room. "
