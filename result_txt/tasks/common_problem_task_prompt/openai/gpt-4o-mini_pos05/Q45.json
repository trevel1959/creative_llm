    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and venue arrangements for international delegates can be complex. Issues such as visa delays, flight cancellations, or inadequate facilities may disrupt the summit. Establishing a dedicated logistics team that specializes in international events can streamline these processes and create contingency plans for unexpected situations.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events attract attention, and the potential for protests, threats, or even acts of violence can pose significant risks. Collaborating with local law enforcement and international security agencies to develop a comprehensive security strategy will help ensure the safety of all attendees.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Participants may have conflicting political interests or objectives, which can complicate discussions and negotiations. To address this, creating a neutral framework for dialogue that encourages collaboration and compromise can help participants focus on shared goals rather than divisive issues.",
    "**Communication Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication among delegates. Providing real-time translation services and multilingual materials can help ensure that all voices are heard and understood, promoting more productive discussions.",
    "**Sustainability Concerns**: Organizing a large-scale event can have significant environmental impacts, from waste generation to carbon emissions. Implementing sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials, promoting virtual participation, and offsetting carbon footprints, can minimize the summit's ecological footprint."
