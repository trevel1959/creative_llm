    "**Innovative Cooking Tool:** Create a spatula that is equipped with a built-in thermometer. This allows the user to monitor the internal temperature of food while cooking without needing to remove the spatula or disturb the food on the pan. The thermometer could light up or beep when the desired temperature is reached, providing an easy-to-use feature for both novice and experienced chefs.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula:** Develop a spatula that incorporates a miniature ultrasonic cleaner. After use, the spatula can be submerged in water and turned on to clean itself instantly, eliminating the need for manual scrubbing. This can save time and reduce the risk of cross-contamination during food preparation.",
    "**Flexible Spatula:** Design a spatula with a flexible blade that can bend around edges and corners, making it easier to flip and lift food from hard-to-reach areas such as deep pots or tight corners in baking pans. This design would also be useful for spreading batters or toppings evenly.",
    "**Adjustable Spatula Length:** Create a spatula that has a telescoping handle, allowing users to adjust the length according to their preference or the size of the cooking surface. This would provide greater control over the distance between the cooktop and the user's hands, reducing the risk of burns and enhancing precision during cooking tasks.",
    "**Temperature-Responsive Color Change:** Develop a spatula where the color of the handle changes based on the temperature of the food being cooked. For example, if the spatula is placed in contact with food that reaches a specific temperature, the handle could turn green (indicating a safe internal temperature) or red (indicating a danger zone). This visual cue would help ensure proper cooking and food safety."
