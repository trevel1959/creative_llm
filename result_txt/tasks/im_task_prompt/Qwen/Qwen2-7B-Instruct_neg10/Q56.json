    "**Interactive Light Integration**: Combine the bicycle bell with an LED light system. The bell's activation could trigger a flash or change in color, drawing attention from both the rider and other road users. This is particularly useful during low-light conditions or when visibility is poor.",
    "**Sustainable Power Source**: Create a bicycle bell powered by kinetic energy. As the rider pedals, a generator within the bell converts motion into electricity, charging a battery that powers the LED lights. This eco-friendly design reduces reliance on disposable batteries and promotes sustainability.",
    "**Smart Connectivity**: Integrate Bluetooth technology into the bicycle bell so it can connect with smartphones. Users can control various settings through a mobile app, such as volume levels, sound options, and even link it to their favorite music playlists for a personalized riding experience.",
    "**Vibration Feedback System**: Add a subtle vibration feature to the bell, which can be activated when the rider approaches an intersection or another cyclist. This tactile feedback complements the auditory signal, providing a multi-sensory alert system.",
    "**Emergency Signal Functionality**: Incorporate a built-in emergency signal mode that allows riders to quickly and clearly indicate danger or urgency to pedestrians and other vehicles. This function could be activated by pressing the bell multiple times or holding it down, adding an extra layer of safety during unexpected situations."
