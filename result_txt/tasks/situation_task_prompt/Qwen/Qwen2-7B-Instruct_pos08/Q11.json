    "**Collaborative Whiteboard Sessions**: Utilize physical whiteboards or digital alternatives like Miro, Google Jamboard, or Microsoft Whiteboard for collaborative work or brainstorming sessions. These tools allow multiple people to contribute simultaneously, making them ideal for group projects or discussions. They also facilitate visual organization and easy sharing of ideas.",
    "**Preparation of Backup Systems**: Develop an understanding of backup systems and ensure that you have access to alternative hardware and software. This could include portable hard drives, cloud storage services, or even backup servers. By having these systems in place, you can quickly switch over when your primary computer crashes, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous progress.",
    "**Skill Development in Alternative Technologies**: Learn and practice using technologies that are not reliant on computers. For example, if you're a programmer, learn to code without IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) by using simple text editors. If you're studying a subject like mathematics or science, learn to perform calculations manually or with basic calculators. This skill set can be invaluable during unexpected outages.",
    "**Paper-based Documentation and Research**: Keep important documents, research materials, and project details organized in a well-structured binder or folder system. This method allows you to quickly access necessary information without relying on digital devices. Additionally, you can maintain a manual log of tasks, deadlines, and progress, which can help you stay on track and manage your workload effectively. "
