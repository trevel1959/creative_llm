    "Floating Islands Eco-Park: Create a park where floating islands made of recycled materials like plastic and wood are used to provide a habitat for various species of plants and animals. This unique concept would help to reduce plastic waste and promote biodiversity.",
    "Underwater Park: Establish an underwater park in a coral reef or a coastal area, where visitors can explore the marine life through submersible vehicles or scuba diving. This would not only provide a unique experience for tourists but also help to protect the fragile ecosystem of the ocean.",
    "Vertical Forest Park: Build a towering forest within a city, with multiple layers of trees, plants, and wildlife. This park would provide a natural oasis in the midst of urbanization and help to purify the air and reduce noise pollution.",
    "Bio-Dome Park: Create a large, enclosed park that simulates different ecosystems from around the world, such as deserts, rainforests, and tundras. Visitors could explore these ecosystems through interactive exhibits and learn about the unique species that inhabit each one.",
    "Solar-Powered Wildlife Sanctuary: Establish a wildlife sanctuary that is powered entirely by solar energy. This would not only reduce the park's carbon footprint but also provide a safe haven for endangered species. The park could feature a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and wetlands, and offer educational programs and guided tours."
