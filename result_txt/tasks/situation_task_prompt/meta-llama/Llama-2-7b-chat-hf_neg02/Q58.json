    "Insect Hotels: Design and construct multi-story insect hotels that provide a safe and comfortable habitat for insects. These hotels could be made from sustainable materials like bamboo, straws, or recycled cardboard. The hotels could be placed in urban areas, providing a natural solution to pest control.",
    "Bug-based Food Systems: Develop a food system that utilizes insects as a sustainable source of protein. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are high in protein and require less land, water, and feed than traditional livestock. This system could help reduce the environmental impact of food production while providing a new source of protein for humans.",
    "Insect-powered Transportation: Create a new form of transportation that utilizes insects as a source of energy. For example, a bicycle with a built-in insect collection system could harness the energy generated by pedaling to power an electric motor. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation while also helping to reduce the number of insects in urban areas.",
    "Insect-based Building Materials: Develop new building materials that incorporate insects as a key component. For example, a special type of concrete could be created that incorporates crushed insect shells, providing additional strength and durability. This would reduce the need for traditional building materials and provide a sustainable alternative.",
    "Insect-based Disaster Response: Develop a system that utilizes insects to help respond to natural disasters. For example, insects could be used to detect and monitor radiation levels in areas affected by nuclear accidents. Insects are highly sensitive to changes in their environment, making them an ideal tool for detecting contamination. This system could help provide early warning and response to disasters, reducing the risk of harm to humans and the environment."
