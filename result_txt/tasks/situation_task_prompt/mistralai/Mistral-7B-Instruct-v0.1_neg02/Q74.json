    "Use natural ingredients: If all cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could include using fruits and vegetables to exfoliate our skin, using honey as a moisturizer, and using essential oils for fragrance.",
    "DIY beauty treatments: We could experiment with making our own beauty treatments at home. This could include making our own facial masks, using baking soda and lemon to whiten our teeth, and using apple cider vinegar to balance our skin's pH.",
    "Outdoor activities: We could incorporate outdoor activities into our grooming routine. This could include taking a dip in a natural body of water to cleanse our skin, using rocks or sticks to massage our scalp, and using natural oils to moisturize our hair.",
    "Community resources: We could look to our community for resources to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could include sharing tips and recipes for natural beauty treatments, trading ingredients and supplies, and pooling our resources to purchase essential items.",
    "Mindfulness and self-care: We could focus on mindfulness and self-care to maintain our personal grooming habits. This could include meditating to reduce stress and anxiety, practicing yoga to improve flexibility and posture, and taking time for self-reflection and relaxation."
