    "Create a network of shade-providing structures using recycled materials: Idea: If all trees disappeared, we could create a network of shade-providing structures using recycled materials such as old shipping containers, pallets, and metal sheets. These structures could be designed to be lightweight, portable, and easy to install. They could be placed in public spaces such as parks, streets, and outdoor cafes to provide shade on hot days.",
    "Develop a shade-producing app: Idea: We could develop an app that uses augmented reality to create virtual shade on hot days. The app would use the camera on a smartphone to scan the surroundings and create a virtual shade, which could be adjusted in size and shape. Users could then place this virtual shade over themselves to provide a cool and comfortable shade on hot days.",
    "Use reflective materials to create a \"mirror\" effect: Idea: We could use reflective materials such as mirrors or reflective paint to create a \"mirror\" effect on buildings and other surfaces. This would create a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from the surface, reducing the amount of heat that is absorbed. This could be particularly effective in urban areas where buildings and concrete surfaces absorb a lot of heat.",
    "Use natural ventilation to create a cooling effect: Idea: We could use natural ventilation techniques such as opening windows and doors, using fans, and creating cross-ventilation to create a cooling effect on hot days. This would involve creating shaded areas with natural ventilation, such as courtyards or rooftop gardens, where people could go to escape the heat.",
    "Use genetic engineering to create shade-producing plants: Idea: We could use genetic engineering to create shade-producing plants that are specifically designed to provide shade on hot days. These plants could be genetically modified to have larger leaves or to produce more shade-producing chemicals. These plants could be planted in public spaces such as parks and outdoor cafes to provide shade on hot days."
