    "**Innovative Educational Virtual Reality Experience**: Create an educational virtual reality experience that allows students to explore historical events or scientific phenomena in a fully immersive environment. This could include interactive exhibits, virtual field trips, and simulations that engage multiple senses. For example, students could virtually travel back in time to ancient Rome, experiencing daily life, participating in historical events, and interacting with characters from that era. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9), as it leverages current technology trends, enhances learning through engagement, and has the potential for wide application across various subjects.",
    "**Smart Home Security with AI-Enhanced Cameras**: Develop a smart home security system that uses AI-enhanced cameras to not only detect intruders but also understand the context of the situation. The cameras would be able to differentiate between pets, family members, and strangers, and alert the homeowner accordingly. Additionally, the system could learn over time to recognize specific behaviors or patterns, such as a pet entering the house during certain hours, reducing false alarms. The confidence score for this idea is moderate (0.7) due to the complexity of AI implementation and the need for significant user data to train these systems effectively.",
    "**Interactive Public Art Installations**: Create interactive public art installations that incorporate elements like touchscreens, sensors, or augmented reality to engage community members. These installations could change based on the viewer's input or environmental conditions, fostering a sense of community involvement and shared ownership of the artwork. For instance, a mural that changes its colors and patterns based on the weather or the emotions detected from nearby people. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.8) because it combines creativity with social engagement and can potentially have a positive impact on urban spaces and community well-being.",
    "**Personalized Nutrition Coaching App**: Develop an app that provides personalized nutrition coaching based on users' DNA analysis, health goals, and dietary preferences. The app would analyze genetic markers related to metabolism, nutrient absorption, and health risks, then provide tailored meal plans and recommendations. It could also track progress and adjust recommendations based on user feedback. The confidence score for this idea is medium (0.6) considering the ethical concerns around genetic data and the need for partnerships with reputable genetic testing companies to ensure accuracy and privacy.",
    "**Wearable Technology for Stress Management**: Design a wearable device that helps individuals manage stress through biofeedback techniques. The device could monitor heart rate variability, skin conductance, and other physiological indicators to detect stress levels and offer guided breathing exercises"
