    "**Infrared Sleep Masks:** In a world without night-time, our bodies might not naturally produce the sleep-inducing melatonin during the day. We could develop special infrared sleep masks that block out the blue light from artificial light sources, helping regulate our circadian rhythm and inducing sleep. These masks could have sensors that detect when the body starts to feel tired and automatically adjust their intensity to facilitate sleep.",
    "**Daytime Nap Pods:** Given that we wouldn't experience the traditional night-time, we could design pods that create an environment conducive to sleep during the day. These pods would be equipped with adjustable lighting, sound, and temperature controls to mimic a natural sleep environment. Users could customize their settings based on personal preferences and sleep requirements.",
    "**Smart Bed Sheets:** We could engineer bed sheets that incorporate technology to regulate body temperature, adjust lighting, and even play soothing sounds or emit gentle vibrations to promote sleep. The sheets would learn from the user's habits and preferences over time, optimizing the sleep experience.",
    "**Daytime Sunlight Mimicry:** Using advanced light technology, we could create artificial sunlight that closely replicates the effects of natural daylight. This would help maintain the natural circadian rhythm by providing the necessary light exposure during the day, making it easier to transition into sleep mode at night.",
    "**Sleep Induction Apps and Virtual Reality:** Develop apps and VR experiences that guide users through relaxation techniques, visualization exercises, and guided meditations to induce sleep. These apps could also include personalized soundscapes and ambient environments designed to facilitate sleep in a light-filled world."
