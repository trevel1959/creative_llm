    "Glowing Plant Lamps: You could use glowing plants to light up a room at night. These plants would have a special ability to absorb sunlight during the day and emit a soft, gentle glow at night. This would provide a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "Fireflies in a Jar: Collect fireflies and place them in a jar with a special enclosure that allows them to fly around. The fireflies would emit a soft, flickering light that could illuminate a small room. This would provide a unique and magical lighting solution.",
    "Solar-Powered Stained Glass Windows: Use stained glass windows that are designed to harness the power of the sun during the day. These windows would convert sunlight into electricity, which could be used to power small LED lights or other lighting fixtures at night.",
    "Light-Emitting Mushrooms: Genetically engineer mushrooms to produce a soft, diffuse light. These mushrooms could be grown in a controlled environment and placed throughout a room to provide a soft, ambient light. This would be a sustainable and eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "Crystal Orbs: Create crystal orbs that are filled with a special light-emitting liquid. These orbs could be hung from the ceiling or placed on tables and would provide a soft, diffuse light that would fill a room. The liquid inside the orbs could be designed to change color or pattern, providing a dynamic lighting effect."
