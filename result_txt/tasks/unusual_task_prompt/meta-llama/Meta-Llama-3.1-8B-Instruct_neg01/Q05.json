    "**Eco-Warrior Capsule**: Design a line of eco-friendly, biodegradable caps for plastic bottles that can be planted into the ground to grow wildflowers or herbs. The caps would be made from a special type of paper or plant-based material that can be easily composted. As the cap decomposes, it would release seeds that can grow into beautiful flowers or herbs, symbolizing the transformation of waste into something beautiful.",
    "**Bottle-to-Table**: Create a line of smart, connected plastic bottles that can track and monitor the user's hydration levels, providing personalized recommendations for optimal water intake. The bottle would be equipped with a built-in sensor that can detect the user's activity level, climate, and other factors to provide tailored suggestions for staying hydrated. The bottle could also be integrated with a mobile app that allows users to track their progress and compete with friends.",
    "**Waste-to-Wealth**: Develop a system where plastic bottles are collected and sorted, then processed into a new material that can be used to create affordable, high-quality products such as furniture, clothing, or even building materials. This initiative would not only reduce waste but also provide an economic opportunity for local communities to create value from discarded materials.",
    "**Bottle-Art**: Launch a global art project where people are encouraged to decorate and transform plastic bottles into unique works of art. The bottles would be collected and displayed in public spaces, galleries, or online platforms, raising awareness about the issue of plastic waste and promoting creativity and community engagement.",
    "**Hydro-Hub**: Design an interactive, immersive experience that brings people together to learn about the importance of water conservation and the impact of plastic waste on our planet. The Hydro-Hub would feature an interactive exhibit, a water-themed playground, and a community garden where visitors can learn about sustainable practices and participate in workshops and activities that promote water conservation and eco-friendly habits."
