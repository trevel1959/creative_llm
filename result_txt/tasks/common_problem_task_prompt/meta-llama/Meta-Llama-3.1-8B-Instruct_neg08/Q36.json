    "**Solar Panel Maintenance Mayhem**: Without a well-planned maintenance schedule, solar panels may not be properly cleaned or maintained, reducing their efficiency and lifespan. This could lead to a situation where homeowners are left with underperforming panels, causing frustration and financial losses.",
    "**Grid Tie Incompatibility**: If the solar panels are not properly tied into the city's grid, it may lead to electrical shocks, equipment damage, or even fires. This could result in costly repairs, downtime, and potential safety hazards.",
    "**Neighborhood Disruptions**: The installation of solar panels on every home in the city may lead to a visual disruption of the neighborhood aesthetic, causing tension among residents who value their property's appearance.",
    "**Inequitable Distribution of Benefits**: The installation of solar panels may not be evenly distributed among residents, with some homes receiving more sunlight and therefore generating more energy. This could lead to an uneven distribution of benefits, causing resentment among those who do not receive the same level of energy production.",
    "**Financial Burden on Low-Income Residents**: The upfront cost of installing solar panels may be prohibitively expensive for low-income residents, making it difficult for them to participate in the program and potentially exacerbating existing economic disparities."
