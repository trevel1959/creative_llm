    "One frosty morning, a little girl named Lily built a snowman in her backyard, giving him a scarf and a carrot nose. That night, as the moonlight glimmered on the snow, a magical breeze swirled around him, and to her astonishment, he came to life! \"Thank you for bringing me to life,\" he chuckled, his coal eyes sparkling. They spent the night dancing under the stars, laughing as they made snow angels. But as dawn approached, the snowman knew he had to return to his snowy form. With a heavy heart, he whispered, \"I'll always be with you in winter's magic.\" ",
