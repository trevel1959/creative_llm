    "**Water Collection System:** You could create a system that collects rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces during periods of rainfall. This collected water can then be stored in large barrels or tanks for use when there is no rain. You could also install a filtration system to ensure the water is clean enough for plant watering.",
    "**Aquaponics:** This is an innovative farming technique that combines hydroponics (growing plants in water) with aquaculture (raising fish). The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, which in turn purify the water for the fish. This closed-loop system allows you to grow plants without needing rainwater.",
    "**Solar-Powered Sprinkler Systems:** Install solar-powered sprinklers that are connected to a water source such as a well or a pond. These systems can be programmed to water plants at specific times throughout the day, ensuring that they receive the right amount of water without relying on rain.",
    "**Waterless Hydroponic Grow Tents:** Hydroponic grow tents use a nutrient-rich solution instead of soil to grow plants. Since this method doesn't require soil moisture, it can function even if rain stops. These tents can be set up indoors, allowing you to control the environment and ensure your plants get consistent water supply.",
    "**Rain Water Reuse:** Collect water from non-potable sources like washing machine or dishwasher runoff, or condensation from air conditioning units. These sources provide water that can be reused for plant watering after proper treatment and filtration. Additionally, you could use graywater systems to collect water from sinks, showers, and bathtubs for irrigation purposes. "
