    "Woolly Mammoth - I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth because of their unique characteristics and the potential benefits they could provide to modern society. They were herbivores, which means they would not compete with humans for food resources, and their large size and strength could be used for transportation and heavy labor. Additionally, their thick fur coats could provide valuable resources for clothing and insulation.",
    "Quagga - I would choose to bring back the Quagga, a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century. The Quagga had a distinctive stripe pattern that was limited to the front half of their body, and they were known for their gentle nature. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and social dynamics, and potentially develop new methods for conservation efforts.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - I would choose to bring back the Passenger Pigeon, which was once the most abundant bird species in North America. They were hunted to extinction in the early 20th century, and their loss has had significant impacts on ecosystems. By bringing them back, we could study their behavior and population dynamics, and learn more about the impacts of overhunting and habitat destruction.",
    "Moa - I would choose to bring back the Moa, a group of large, flightless birds that were native to New Zealand. They went extinct in the 15th century due to overhunting by humans and introduced predators. The Moa were important cultural and spiritual symbols for the indigenous people of New Zealand, and their return could help to restore balance and harmony to the ecosystem.",
    "Dire Wolf - I would choose to bring back the Dire Wolf, a large, predatory canid that lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch. They were similar to modern wolves but were larger in size and had more robust jaws and teeth. By bringing them back, we could learn more about their behavior and ecological role, and potentially develop new insights into the evolution of predator-prey dynamics."
