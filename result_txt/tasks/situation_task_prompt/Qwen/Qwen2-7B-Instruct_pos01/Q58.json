    "**Insect-Friendly Gardens**: Create a network of insect-friendly gardens around the remaining human settlements. These gardens would provide a habitat for natural predators of pests such as ladybugs, lacewings, and spiders. The gardens would also offer a source of food for these beneficial insects, encouraging them to thrive and control pest populations. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Biological Pest Control**: Develop genetically modified organisms that feed on specific pest species without harming humans or other non-target organisms. For example, creating a strain of bacteria that specifically targets a particular pest species could significantly reduce infestations. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Urban Forests**: Implement large-scale urban forestation projects in cities. Trees and shrubs can attract a variety of birds and other wildlife that feed on pests. Additionally, certain plants are known to repel pests or provide a natural barrier against infestations. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Insect-Derived Chemicals**: Research and produce synthetic versions of natural chemicals produced by insects that have a deterrent effect on pests. These chemicals could be used in sprays or traps to manage pest populations effectively. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Educational Programs**: Launch comprehensive public education campaigns about the importance of maintaining biodiversity and how it naturally controls pest populations. Encourage practices such as composting, reducing waste, and using less harmful pesticides. Confidence Score: 0.9"
