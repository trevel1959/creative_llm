    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster films often have large budgets, but unforeseen expenses can quickly lead to budget overruns. Issues such as special effects taking longer than expected or location fees increasing can threaten the financial viability of the project. To combat this, a detailed budget plan should be established with contingencies for unexpected costs, along with regular budget reviews throughout the production process.",
    "**Creative Differences**: The director may have a specific vision for the film, but producers, writers, or studio executives may have differing opinions on the direction of the project. This can lead to tension and delays in production. To address this, the director should prioritize open dialogue and collaboration, creating an environment where everyone feels heard and valued while maintaining the core vision of the film.",
    "**Weather and Location Challenges**: If filming is scheduled in locations with unpredictable weather or difficult terrains, it can cause delays and safety concerns. For instance, a scene set in a tropical paradise could be ruined by unexpected rain. To prepare for this, the production team should have backup plans for indoor shooting locations or alternative scheduling, and they should always prioritize the safety of the cast and crew.",
    "**Logistical Issues**: Coordinating the logistics of a large film production can be incredibly complex. Issues may arise with transporting equipment, managing schedules for multiple actors, or ensuring that set designs are completed on time. To alleviate these challenges, a dedicated logistics team should be established, utilizing project management software to keep track of timelines, resources, and personnel.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: With blockbuster movies often being highly anticipated, there can be immense pressure to meet audience expectations. If the film fails to resonate with viewers, it can lead to poor box office performance and negative reviews. To navigate this, the director should engage in market research to understand audience preferences and consider incorporating elements that have historically performed well, while still maintaining a unique and authentic storyline."
