    "Herbal Tea and Honey: One of the most effective and accessible treatments for a common cold is herbal tea. Herbs such as ginger, peppermint, and echinacea have natural anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties that can help relieve symptoms such as cough, congestion, and fever. Adding honey to the tea can provide additional soothing properties and help to thin out mucus.",
    "Saltwater Gargle: Gargling with saltwater can help to reduce swelling in the throat and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. This can be done by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water and gargling for 30 seconds before spitting it out.",
    "Steam Inhalation: Inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam humidifier can help to loosen mucus and reduce congestion in the nose and sinuses. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to the water can provide additional decongestant properties.",
    "Warm Compresses: Applying a warm compress to the forehead, nose, and cheeks can help to reduce sinus pressure and promote drainage. This can be done by soaking a washcloth in warm water, wringing it out, and applying it to the affected areas for 5-10 minutes at a time.",
    "Essential Oil Inhalation: Certain essential oils such as eucalyptus, peppermint, and lavender have natural decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help to relieve symptoms of a common cold. Inhaling these oils through steam inhalation or using a diffuser can provide quick and effective relief."
