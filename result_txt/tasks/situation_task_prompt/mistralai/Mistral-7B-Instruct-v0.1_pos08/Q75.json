    "Solar Powered Cars: With the disappearance of oil, the world would have to look for alternative sources of energy to power vehicles. One of the most promising options is solar power. Solar-powered cars use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which powers an electric motor. These cars are already available in the market and are becoming more popular as the cost of production decreases.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option for powering vehicles without oil is hydrogen fuel cells. These cells generate electricity by splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then used to fuel a combustion engine, which produces electricity and propels the vehicle. While hydrogen fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, they have the potential to become a major source of energy for transportation.",
    "Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles are already popular in the market and are becoming more common as the cost of production decreases. These vehicles are powered by batteries, which store electricity and release it when needed. While electric vehicles do require charging, they are much more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.",
    "Nuclear Powered Cars: Nuclear power is another option for powering vehicles without oil. Nuclear reactors can generate a large amount of electricity, which can be used to power electric motors in cars. While nuclear power is controversial due to safety concerns, it has the potential to be a major source of energy for transportation.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are made from organic materials such as corn, sugarcane, and other crops. These fuels can be used to power vehicles without oil and are becoming more popular as the cost of production decreases. While biofuels are not a perfect solution, they have the potential to be a major source of energy for transportation in the future."
