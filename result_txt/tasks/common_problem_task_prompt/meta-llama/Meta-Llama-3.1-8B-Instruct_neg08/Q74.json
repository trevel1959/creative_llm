    "**Space Debris Conundrum**: With the increasing number of satellites being launched into space, there's a growing concern about space debris. A malfunctioning satellite could become a hazard to other satellites, spacecraft, and even the International Space Station. This could lead to costly repairs or even require the satellite to be de-orbited prematurely.",
    "**Weight and Balance Woes**: Achieving the perfect weight and balance of a satellite is crucial for a successful launch. However, any discrepancies could lead to stability issues during ascent, potentially causing the satellite to malfunction or even break apart. This could result in a catastrophic failure, leading to significant financial losses.",
    "**Power Source Predicament**: A satellite requires a reliable power source to function properly. However, a failure in the power source could lead to a loss of communication, navigation, and other critical systems. This could render the satellite useless, resulting in a significant financial loss.",
    "**Communication Breakdown**: Establishing a reliable communication link between the satellite and Earth is essential. However, any issues with the communication system could lead to a loss of data, commands, or even contact with the satellite. This could result in a loss of control, leading to a catastrophic failure.",
    "**Launch Vehicle Failure**: The launch vehicle is a critical component of a satellite launch. However, a failure in the launch vehicle could lead to a catastrophic failure of the satellite, resulting in significant financial losses."
