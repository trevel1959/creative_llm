    "**Innovative Wine Glass Cooling System**: Design a wine glass that includes an integrated cooling system within its base. The cooling system could be a small, battery-powered fan or a gel-filled compartment that keeps the glass at the perfect serving temperature. This would allow users to enjoy their wine at an optimal temperature without having to chill it for hours in the refrigerator or use ice buckets.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wine Glass**: Create a wine glass made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled glass, or biodegradable plastics. These glasses can be designed to be dishwasher safe, durable, and stylish, providing an eco-conscious alternative to traditional wine glasses. Additionally, you could include a program where customers can return used glasses for recycling or repurposing, creating a closed-loop system.",
    "**Wine Glass Personalization Service**: Offer a service where customers can customize their wine glasses with personalized engravings or designs. This could include names, initials, favorite quotes, or even intricate patterns. The glasses could be produced using advanced laser engraving techniques, ensuring high-quality personalization that is both aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting.",
    "**Interactive Wine Glass Experience**: Develop a wine glass that incorporates technology, such as augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). For example, the glass could have a built-in QR code or NFC chip that, when scanned, reveals information about the wine, its history, or offers tasting tips. This interactive experience would enhance the overall wine-drinking experience by providing educational content and engaging visuals.",
    "**Portable Wine Glass Stand**: Design a compact, portable stand that can hold a wine glass while allowing users to easily carry it around. This could be particularly useful for outdoor events, picnics, or travel. The stand could be made from lightweight materials like aluminum or carbon fiber, ensuring durability without adding excessive weight. It might also feature a built-in bottle opener or a small container for storing corkscrews and other wine accessories."
