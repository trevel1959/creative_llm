    "**Inflatable Wheelchair**: Design an inflatable wheelchair that can be inflated and deflated as needed. This would allow the user to sit inside and control movement by using air pressure to navigate different terrains or surfaces. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8, as it combines existing technology (wheelchairs) with a creative twist to accommodate the needs of those who cannot stand.",
    "**Gravity-Compensating Suit**: Develop a suit that uses advanced materials and mechanisms to counteract gravity's effects on the body. This suit would help individuals move around by compensating for their weight and providing support, much like how a spacesuit assists astronauts in zero-gravity environments. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7, as it pushes the boundaries of wearable technology but builds upon existing concepts in engineering and material science.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation System**: Create a system where users wear glasses or headsets that overlay digital navigation cues onto the real world. These cues would guide the user through their environment, indicating safe paths and helping them avoid obstacles. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9, considering the rapid advancements in AR technology and its potential applications in accessibility.",
    "**Water-Based Mobility Device**: Design a device that moves on water, like a hovercraft, which could be used in environments with uneven ground or stairs. This would involve creating a self-propelled platform that floats above the surface, providing a smooth and stable ride. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6, as it requires significant innovation in material science and propulsion systems but offers a unique solution.",
    "**Tactile Sensory Mapping**: Implement a system that creates a tactile map of the environment, allowing users to \"feel\" their surroundings through specialized gloves or shoes. This would involve integrating sensors that detect textures, shapes, and distances, then translating that information into vibrations or other sensory inputs. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7, as it leverages existing technology (sensors and haptic feedback) in a novel way to enhance human interaction with the physical world."
