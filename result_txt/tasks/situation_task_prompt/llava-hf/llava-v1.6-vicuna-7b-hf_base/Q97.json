    "Incorporate natural elements: Combine precious metals with natural elements like wood, bone, or shells to create ornaments that are both valuable and eco-friendly. For example, you could create a necklace using a combination of gold and wooden beads, with a bone pendant or a seashell accent.",
    "Design functional jewelry: Instead of creating purely decorative ornaments, design functional jewelry that serves a purpose. For example, a ring that doubles as a compass, a bracelet that tells time, or a necklace that can be used to start a fire.",
    "Collaborate with artists: Collaborate with local artists to create ornaments that showcase their talents while also adding value. For example, you could work with a painter to create a series of paintings that are then turned into limited-edition prints, or collaborate with a musician to create a series of music-themed ornaments.",
    "Create custom designs: Offer custom design services where clients can create their own unique and personalized ornaments. This can be done through a combination of 3D modeling and printing, laser cutting, or other cutting-edge technologies.",
    "Use 3D printing: Utilize 3D printing technology to create intricate and complex designs that would be difficult or impossible to create by hand. This can include ornaments with moving parts, intricate patterns, or other unique features that make them valuable and desirable."
