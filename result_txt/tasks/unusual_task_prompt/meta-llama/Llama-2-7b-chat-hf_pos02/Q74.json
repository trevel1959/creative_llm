    "Virtual Reality Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that utilizes virtual reality technology to simulate the driving experience. The wheel would be equipped with sensors that track the driver's hand movements, allowing them to steer the vehicle in a virtual environment. This could be useful for drivers who are unable to operate a physical vehicle, such as those with disabilities or those who are learning to drive.",
    "Customizable Steering Wheel Covers: Design a line of steering wheel covers that can be customized with different patterns, colors, and textures. These covers could be made from a variety of materials, such as leather, suede, or neoprene, and could be easily swapped out to match different outfits or moods. This would provide a unique and personalized driving experience for drivers who want to express their individuality on the road.",
    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Music Controls: Create a steering wheel that incorporates music controls, allowing drivers to control their music playback without having to take their hands off the wheel. This could include buttons or touchpad controls for play, pause, skip, and volume, as well as the ability to connect to a smartphone or other music device via Bluetooth. This would be a convenient and safe way for drivers to enjoy their music while on the road.",
    "Smart Steering Wheel: Develop a steering wheel that incorporates advanced technology, such as a built-in GPS, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice recognition. This wheel would provide drivers with real-time traffic updates, turn-by-turn directions, and the ability to make hands-free phone calls. It could also be integrated with other smart devices in the vehicle, such as the infotainment system or smart mirrors, to create a seamless and connected driving experience.",
    "Adjustable Steering Wheel Height: Design a steering wheel that can be adjusted to accommodate drivers of different heights and preferences. This could include a simple knob or lever that allows the driver to raise or lower the steering wheel to their desired height, providing a more comfortable and ergonomic driving experience. This would be particularly useful for drivers who experience discomfort or fatigue from holding the steering wheel at a fixed height for extended periods of time."
