    "**Innovative Ironing Board Design**: Create an ironing board that adjusts to various heights and angles. This can be especially useful for people who have different heights or for ironing garments that require specific positioning (e.g., sleeves). The design could include a motorized system for height adjustments, or a telescopic arm that allows for flexible angles.",
    "**Smart Ironing System**: Develop a smart iron that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The app could provide step-by-step ironing instructions tailored to specific fabrics, notify when it's time to replace parts, and even offer virtual tutorials on how to iron different items correctly. It could also monitor usage patterns and suggest energy-saving tips.",
    "**Ironing Robot**: Design an automated ironing machine that uses AI to recognize and iron clothes without human intervention. It could analyze fabric type, garment style, and even user preferences to optimize the ironing process. The robot would need sensors to detect wrinkles and adjust its movements accordingly.",
    "**Portable Ironing Kit**: Create a compact, lightweight set of tools designed for ironing small items such as socks, underwear, or accessories. The kit might include a mini iron, steam generator, and specialized attachments for various items. This could be particularly useful for travelers or those with limited space.",
    "**Sustainable Ironing Solution**: Develop an eco-friendly ironing solution that uses less water and energy while still effectively removing wrinkles. This could involve the use of advanced materials in the iron's heating element that require less heat to produce steam or vapor, thus reducing energy consumption. Additionally, the iron could come with a refillable water container to minimize plastic waste. "
