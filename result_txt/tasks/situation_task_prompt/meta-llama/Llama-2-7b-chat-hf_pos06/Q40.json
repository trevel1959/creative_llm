    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy, which can then be stored and used to power devices. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bio-Batteries: Create a battery that uses living organisms, such as bacteria or algae, to generate electricity. These microorganisms would be genetically engineered to produce electricity as a byproduct of their natural metabolic processes. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a battery that uses phase-change materials to store thermal energy. These materials would absorb and release heat energy, which can be converted into electrical energy using a thermoelectric converter. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Wave Energy Harvesting: Design a battery that harnesses the energy of ocean waves to generate electricity. This battery would use a specialized membrane to capture the energy of the waves and convert it into electrical energy. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Create a battery that uses compressed air to generate electricity. These batteries would use a novel combination of materials to convert the mechanical energy of compressed air into electrical energy. Confidence Score: 0.9"
