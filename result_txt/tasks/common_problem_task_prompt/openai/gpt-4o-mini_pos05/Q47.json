    "**Thermal Management Problems**: Overheating can be a significant issue if the cooling system is not properly set up. If the CPU or GPU doesn't have adequate cooling, it could lead to thermal throttling, where the components slow down to prevent overheating, or worse, permanent damage. Builders need to ensure that they have a proper cooling solution in place, such as sufficient case fans or a quality CPU cooler.",
    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Another potential problem is underestimating the power requirements of the build. If the power supply unit (PSU) is not powerful enough to support all the components, it could lead to system instability or failure to boot. It's crucial to calculate the total wattage needed and select a PSU that provides a little extra headroom for future upgrades.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: During the assembly process, static electricity can damage sensitive components. Without proper precautions, such as using an anti-static wrist strap or working on a non-static surface, a builder could inadvertently fry components like the motherboard or RAM. This emphasizes the importance of grounding oneself and handling components with care.",
    "**Cable Management Chaos**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered interior, which can obstruct airflow and make future upgrades or troubleshooting more difficult. If cables are not organized properly, it can also create a mess that is visually unappealing. Builders should plan their cable routing ahead of time and use cable ties or sleeves to keep everything neat.",
    "**Software Installation and Driver Issues**: Once the hardware is assembled, the next step is to install the operating system and drivers. Problems can arise if the builder is unfamiliar with the installation process or if there are driver compatibility issues. This could lead to hardware not functioning correctly or the system crashing. Itâ€™s essential to have a plan for driver installation and to ensure that all necessary software is available."
