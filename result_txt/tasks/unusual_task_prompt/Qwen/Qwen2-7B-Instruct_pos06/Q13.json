    "**Educational Toy for Children**:    Idea: Develop an interactive educational toy, specifically a rubber duck that doubles as a learning aid. The duck could be programmed with various functions like asking questions related to math, science, or language skills, and responding to children's answers. For instance, when a child asks a question, the duck could ask them to solve a simple math problem or recite a poem before answering. This not only makes learning fun but also encourages active participation and critical thinking.",
    "**Portable Emergency Device**:    Idea: Design a compact, waterproof rubber duck that can double as an emergency beacon. It could be equipped with a GPS tracker, a distress signal button, and a small flashlight. In case of an emergency, the user can activate the distress signal, which would trigger a notification on their phone or other connected devices. This idea could be particularly useful in aquatic environments or outdoor adventures where safety is a concern.",
    "**Personalized Pet Toy**:    Idea: Create a customizable rubber duck that can be personalized with the owner's pet's name or image. The duck could be filled with treats or small toys for pets, making it a unique and engaging playmate. Additionally, the design could incorporate interactive elements like buttons or sensors that respond to pet actions, enhancing the bonding experience between the pet and its owner.",
    "**Hygiene Reminder for Bathrooms**:    Idea: Introduce a rubber duck that reminds users to wash their hands after using the restroom. The duck could have a sensor that detects when someone enters the bathroom and play a message encouraging hand washing. This not only promotes hygiene but also adds a playful element to an often mundane task.",
    "**Smart Home Controller**:    Idea: Develop a smart rubber duck that can control home appliances via voice commands. The duck could be equipped with AI technology, allowing it to perform tasks like turning off lights, adjusting room temperature, or playing music. This innovative gadget would offer a quirky yet functional way for people to interact with their smart home systems."
