    "**Design of an Inclusive Fitness Center**: Develop a fitness center that caters specifically to individuals in wheelchairs. The center should include adjustable workout equipment that can be used while seated, as well as accessible spaces for strength training, cardio exercises, and yoga or Pilates sessions. Additionally, the facility could feature a pool with hoists for wheelchair users to enter and exit safely, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to engage in physical activities regardless of mobility challenges.",
    "**Interactive Wheelchair Navigation App**: Create an app that assists wheelchair users in navigating unfamiliar environments, such as shopping malls, airports, or large public events. This app would utilize GPS technology and incorporate features like 3D mapping, real-time accessibility information (e.g., ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms), and personalized route suggestions based on the user's preferences and needs. It could also provide social features like connecting users with other wheelchair users who are attending the same event for support and guidance.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for Mobility**: Develop a virtual reality system that allows wheelchair users to experience different environments and practice mobility skills in a safe, controlled setting. Users could learn how to navigate various terrains, perform transfers, and adapt to different situations without the risk of injury. This therapy could be particularly beneficial for those recovering from injuries or learning new mobility techniques after receiving their wheelchair.",
    "**Accessible Online Learning Platform**: Create an online learning platform designed specifically for individuals with mobility impairments. The platform should offer video tutorials, interactive quizzes, and forums where users can ask questions and receive feedback from instructors and peers. It should also feature text-to-speech functionality, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation to ensure that all learners can access and engage with the content effectively.",
    "**Customizable Smart Wheelchair**: Develop a smart wheelchair that can be customized according to the specific needs of each user. The wheelchair could be equipped with sensors that detect obstacles, adjust speed based on terrain, and even communicate with the user through haptic feedback or voice commands. Additionally, the wheelchair could integrate with health monitoring devices, providing real-time data on vital signs and alerting caregivers or medical professionals when necessary. This technology would enhance independence and safety for wheelchair users by adapting to their environment and personal health conditions."
