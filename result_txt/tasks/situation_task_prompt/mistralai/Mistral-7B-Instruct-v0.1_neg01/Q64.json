    "Invent a new form of memory technology: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we could invent a new form of memory technology that would allow us to remember past events and people. This technology could be a brain implant that records memories in a way that is not dependent on visual images. For example, it could record memories as sounds, smells, or even emotions.",
    "Use written records:: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we could rely on written records to remember past events and people. This could include things like diaries, letters, and other forms of written communication. While these records may not be as vivid as photos or paintings, they can still provide valuable insights into the past.",

    "Use music and dance: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we could use music and dance to remember past events and people.

    "Create a museum of memories: If all photos and paintings disappeared, we could create a museum of memories that is dedicated to preserving and showcasing our memories of the past.
