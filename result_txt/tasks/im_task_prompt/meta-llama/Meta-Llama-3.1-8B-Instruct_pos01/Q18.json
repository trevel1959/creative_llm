    "**Eco-Friendly Hyperloop Car**: Design a sleek, aerodynamic car that can travel at speeds of up to 700 mph while minimizing its carbon footprint. The car would use advanced magnetic levitation technology to reduce friction and energy consumption. It would also be powered by a combination of solar panels and advanced battery technology, making it an eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "**Modular Car for the Future**: Create a car that can adapt to different environments and purposes. The modular design would allow users to swap out different components, such as a cargo bed, a camper van conversion, or even a sports car package. This would make the car more versatile and extend its lifespan.",
    "**Autonomous Hyperloop-Powered Taxi**: Develop a self-driving taxi that can travel through vacuum-sealed tubes at incredible speeds, reducing travel time and increasing efficiency. The taxi would be equipped with advanced AI and sensors to navigate through the tube network, ensuring a safe and smooth ride.",
    "**Space-Age Car with Inflatable Structure**: Design a car with an inflatable structure that can expand and contract to accommodate different driving conditions. The car would be made of lightweight, high-strength materials and would be powered by a hybrid electric propulsion system. This would make it ideal for off-road adventures or extreme weather conditions.",
    "**Personal Flying Car with Vertical Takeoff**: Create a flying car that can take off and land vertically, eliminating the need for runways. The car would be equipped with advanced rotors and AI-powered navigation, making it a safe and efficient mode of transportation for short distances."
