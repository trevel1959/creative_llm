    "**Smart Hanger**: A clothes hanger with built-in sensors and AI technology that can detect the type of garment, its size, and the amount of wear it has. It can then provide recommendations for the best way to hang, fold, or store the item to prevent wrinkles, creases, and damage. The hanger can also track the user's clothing inventory, suggesting what to wear based on the weather, occasion, and personal style.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Ironing**: A clothes hanger with a mini ironing board and a small iron that can be used to quickly smooth out wrinkles on garments as they hang. The ironing surface would be heated by a thermoelectric element, and the iron would be powered by a rechargeable battery. This feature would save time and effort in the morning routine, making it easier to get dressed and look polished.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated Laundry Sorting**: A clothes hanger with separate compartments for different types of laundry, such as lights, darks, and delicates. The hanger would have sensors that detect the type of fabric and the level of soiling, automatically sorting the garments into the correct compartment. This feature would make laundry day more efficient and reduce the risk of colors bleeding or fabrics getting damaged.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Steamer**: A clothes hanger with a built-in steamer that can be used to remove wrinkles and odors from garments. The steamer would be powered by a thermoelectric element and would have multiple steam settings for different types of fabrics. This feature would be especially useful for delicate or woolen items that can't be ironed.",
    "**Hanger with Personalized Storage**: A clothes hanger with adjustable arms and compartments that can be customized to fit individual garments. The hanger would have a built-in scanner that can read the garment's barcode or RFID tag, and then adjust the arms and compartments to fit the item perfectly. This feature would save space in the closet and make it easier to find and access specific garments."
