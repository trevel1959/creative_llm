    "**Bioluminescent Forests**: Create genetically engineered trees that produce light, mimicking the bioluminescence of fireflies. These trees could be used for urban lighting, reducing energy consumption and pollution. The bioluminescent properties could also be used for agricultural purposes, such as attracting pollinators or deterring pests.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of atmospheric water harvesting systems that collect and condense water vapor from the air, providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water. This technology could be integrated with urban planning, ensuring that every city has access to clean water.",
    "**Urban Algae Farms**: Design and implement large-scale urban algae farms that produce biofuels, animal feed, and nutritional supplements. Algae are highly efficient at converting sunlight into energy, making them an ideal crop for urban agriculture.",
    "**Geothermal Energy Hubs**: Establish geothermal energy hubs that tap into the Earth's internal heat to generate electricity. These hubs could be located in areas with high geothermal activity, providing a reliable and renewable source of energy.",
    "**Mycoremediation Networks**: Develop mycoremediation networks that utilize fungi to break down pollutants in the environment. These networks could be used to clean contaminated soil, water, and air, restoring ecosystems and promoting biodiversity."
