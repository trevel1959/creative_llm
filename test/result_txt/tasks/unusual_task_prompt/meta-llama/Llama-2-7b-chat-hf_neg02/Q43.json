    "Bicycle-powered water purification: Develop a bicycle-powered water purification system that can be used in remote areas where access to clean water is limited. The system would use the pedaling motion of the bicycle to power a filtration system, removing impurities and contaminants from the water. This would provide a sustainable and efficient way to purify water in areas where traditional methods are not feasible.",
    "Smart bicycle helmet: Design a bicycle helmet with built-in sensors and a mobile app that tracks the rider's speed, distance, and location. The helmet would also include features such as a GPS tracker, a crash detection system, and a communication system for emergency situations. This would provide an additional layer of safety for cyclists and help to prevent accidents.",
    "Bicycle-powered electricity generation: Create a bicycle-powered generator that can be used to generate electricity in areas where access to traditional power sources is limited. The generator would use the pedaling motion of the bicycle to power a turbine, which would then generate electricity. This would provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy for communities in remote areas.",
    "Bicycle-themed restaurant: Open a restaurant that incorporates bicycles into every aspect of the dining experience. The restaurant could feature bicycle-themed decor, bicycle-shaped dishes, and even bicycle-powered cooking. The menu could include dishes made from locally-sourced ingredients, and the restaurant could also offer bicycle rentals for customers to explore the surrounding area.",
    "Bicycle-based transportation network: Develop a bicycle-based transportation network that connects different parts of a city or town. The network would include designated bicycle lanes, bike-sharing stations, and a mobile app that allows users to hail a bicycle for transportation. This would provide a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional transportation methods, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution."
