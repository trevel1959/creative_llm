    "**Water Supply and Sanitation**: Many households rely on electric pumps for their water supply. Without electricity, access to clean water may be compromised, leading to sanitation issues. Solutions might involve setting up a rainwater collection system, using gravity-fed water systems, or digging a well if feasible.",
    "**Communication Barriers**: Lack of electricity means limited access to communication tools like phones and the internet. This can hinder contact with emergency services or loved ones. A potential solution could be establishing a community message board or using ham radios for communication.",
    "**Heating and Cooling**: Temperature regulation becomes difficult without electric heating or air conditioning. In cold climates, individuals can use wood stoves, thermal mass in buildings, or even create earth-sheltered homes to maintain comfortable temperatures. In hot climates, strategies could include natural ventilation, reflective roofing, and shade structures.",
    "**Lighting Solutions**: Nighttime activities become challenging without electric lighting. Alternative lighting solutions could include solar-powered lights, candles, or bioluminescent plants. Additionally, creating a community lantern-making workshop could foster social interaction while providing necessary light sources.",
    "**Transportation Challenges**: Electric vehicles would become unusable, and public transport systems may falter without power. Encouraging the use of bicycles, creating carpool systems, or establishing community transport networks with horse-drawn carriages could mitigate transportation issues."
