    "Tissue Box with a Twist: Create a tissue box with a unique design that incorporates a hidden compartment or surprise element. For example, a tissue box with a sliding panel that reveals a small container of hand sanitizer or a compartment that holds a small gift, such as a packet of tissues with a matching design.",
    "Smart Tissue Box: Develop a tissue box that can detect when a user is crying and automatically dispenses a tissue. This could be achieved through the use of sensors that detect moisture levels in the air or through the use of facial recognition technology.",
    "Tissue Box with a Built-In Fan: Create a tissue box with a built-in fan that blows air onto the user's face when they are crying. This could provide a soothing sensation and help to dry the user's eyes more quickly.",
    "Tissue Box with aromatherapy: Incorporate essential oils into the tissue box to provide a calming scent when the user is crying. This could be done through the use of small pads or disks that contain the essential oils, which are released as the tissues are used.",
    "Tissue Box with a Healing Property: Develop a tissue box that contains a small amount of a healing agent, such as aloe vera or tea tree oil, that can be applied to the user's eyes to help soothe and heal them.
