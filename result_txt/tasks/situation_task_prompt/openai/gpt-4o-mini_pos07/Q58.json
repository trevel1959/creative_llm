    "**Microbial Pest Control**: Harness the power of beneficial microbes to manage insect populations. This could involve creating microbial sprays that target specific pest species while being harmless to plants and humans. For instance, genetically engineered bacteria could be developed to produce natural insect repellents or toxins that specifically affect pest species, thus reducing their numbers without the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "**Insect Traps with AI Monitoring**: Design smart insect traps equipped with artificial intelligence that can identify, capture, and analyze pest populations. These traps would use pheromones or light to attract pests and then capture them. The AI component would monitor the types and numbers of insects caught, allowing for targeted pest management strategies based on real-time data.",
    "**Urban Insect Sanctuaries**: Create urban insect sanctuaries that serve as safe havens for beneficial insects. These sanctuaries would be designed to attract and support pollinators and other beneficial insects while deterring pests. By fostering a healthy insect population, we can promote natural pest control methods and restore ecological balance within urban environments.",
    "**Edible Insect Farming**: In a world without animals, consider establishing edible insect farms that can provide a sustainable food source while also controlling pest populations. By farming insects that feed on common pests, we can create a natural balance. These farms could focus on species like soldier flies or crickets, which can thrive on organic waste, thus reducing pests while providing a nutritious food source for humans.",
    "**Augmented Reality Pest Management Apps**: Develop an augmented reality app that allows users to identify pests and receive tailored advice on managing them. By simply pointing their smartphone at an insect, users could get information about its species, behavior, and natural predators. The app could also suggest eco-friendly control methods and track pest populations over time, empowering individuals to take informed actions."
