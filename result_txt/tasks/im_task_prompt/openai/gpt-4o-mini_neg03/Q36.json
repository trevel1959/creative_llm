    "**Ergonomic Grip with Temperature Control**: A knife designed with an ergonomic grip that can sense the temperature of the handle. If the handle gets too hot (from cooking) or too cold (from refrigeration), the knife would use a heating or cooling element to adjust the temperature, ensuring comfort during use. This would help prevent burns or discomfort during prolonged cutting tasks.",
    "**Multi-Functional Blade**: A knife that can transform its blade for different tasks. By utilizing a sliding mechanism, the blade could switch between a chef's knife, a paring knife, and a serrated knife, all within the same handle. This versatility would make it a great space-saver in kitchens, particularly for those with limited storage.",
    "**Smart Knife with Built-in Scale**: This knife would come equipped with a digital scale in the handle, allowing users to weigh ingredients directly as they chop. The scale could display weight on a small screen or connect to a smartphone app for tracking. This feature would be particularly useful for bakers or anyone who needs precise measurements while preparing food.",
    "**Color-Changing Safety Indicator**: A knife with a blade that changes color based on the type of food being cut or its freshness. For example, the blade could turn green when cutting vegetables and red when cutting raw meat, indicating that the knife should be cleaned to prevent cross-contamination. This visual cue would enhance food safety in the kitchen.",
    "**Magnetic Knife Holder with Built-in Knife**: A knife that can magnetically attach to a wall-mounted holder, which also includes a built-in knife sharpener and a cutting board. This holder would keep the knife accessible while providing a space-saving solution. The cutting board could have a designated area for collecting scraps, making cleanup easier."
