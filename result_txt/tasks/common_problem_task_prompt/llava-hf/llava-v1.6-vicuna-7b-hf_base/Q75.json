    "Balancing conservation and recreation: National parks are often home to a variety of wildlife, and it can be difficult for park managers to balance the need to protect these animals with the need to provide recreational opportunities for visitors. This can lead to conflicts, such as the creation of rules that limit what visitors can do within the park or restrictions on certain types of activities.",
    "Protecting endangered species: Many national parks are home to endangered species, and managers must ensure that these animals are protected and have access to suitable habitats. However, this can be challenging due to the threats posed by human activities, such as poaching or habitat destruction.",
    "Funding and management: One of the biggest challenges faced by national park managers is securing adequate funding and resources to maintain the park and conserve the natural resources within it. Funding can be scarce, and managers must often work with limited budgets.",
    "Overcrowding: As more people visit national parks, the risk of overcrowding increases. This can lead to potential damage to the natural environment, as well as negative experiences for visitors. Managers must find ways to manage visitor numbers and ensure that the park remains a pleasant experience for all.",
    "Wildfires: Wildfires can be a significant threat to national parks, particularly in areas with high levels of vegetation. Managers must work to prevent and manage these fires, which can be difficult due to the many factors that can contribute to their occurrence, such as drought conditions and high winds."
