    "**Hydration Reminder Bottle**: Design a water bottle that integrates a digital display or LED lights to remind you when it's time to drink water. For example, the LED could flash every hour, or the digital screen could show the number of hours since your last drink. You could also include a sensor that tracks how much water you've consumed and set reminders based on your personal hydration needs.",
    "**Customizable Water Bottle Labels**: Create a water bottle with an adhesive sticker or label that allows you to personalize it daily with motivational quotes, reminders, or even your schedule for the day. This not only encourages you to drink more water but also makes your water bottle unique and engaging.",
    "**Smart Water Bottle with Temperature Control**: Design a water bottle that comes with a built-in heating or cooling system controlled via a smartphone app. The app could suggest the optimal temperature for drinking water based on the time of day, weather conditions, or personal preference, ensuring you stay hydrated in any situation.",
    "**Biodegradable Water Bottle**: Develop a water bottle made from sustainable materials like plant-based plastics, which can break down much faster than traditional plastic bottles. This idea promotes environmental responsibility and reduces waste. It could be paired with a refill station initiative at schools, offices, or public places to encourage reuse.",
    "**Interactive Infuser Water Bottle**: Create a water bottle with compartments where you can add fruits, herbs, or other flavorings to infuse water with different tastes. The bottle could have a built-in timer or app feature to suggest flavor combinations and track how long flavors should steep for maximum taste and health benefits."
