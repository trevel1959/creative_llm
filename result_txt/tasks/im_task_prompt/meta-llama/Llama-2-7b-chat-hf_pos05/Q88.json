    "Heated Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with built-in heating elements, such as carbon fiber or thermoelectric materials, to keep skiers' hands warm during cold weather skiing. This feature would provide comfort and relief to skiers' hands, allowing them to focus on their technique and enjoy their skiing experience more.",
    "Adjustable Ski Poles: Design ski poles with adjustable grips and lengths, allowing skiers to customize their poles to their preferred height and grip size. This feature would provide a better fit and more comfortable skiing experience for skiers of different heights and grip styles.",

Skiers could use their poles to change songs, adjust lighting levels, or even summon a lift attendant for assistance. This feature would add a fun and interactive element to skiing, making it more enjoyable and engaging for skiers of all ages and skill levels."
