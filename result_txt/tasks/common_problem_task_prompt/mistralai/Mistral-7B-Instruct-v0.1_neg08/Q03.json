    "Collaborate with a team: To avoid feeling jealous, you could work on the project with a team of developers, designers, and project managers. This way, you can share ideas, divide responsibilities, and learn from each other's strengths. You can also celebrate each other's successes and work together to overcome challenges.",
    "Focus on your strengths: Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own strengths and what you can bring to the project. Think about your skills, experience, and unique perspective. This can help you feel more confident and motivated, and less likely to feel jealous.",
    "Take breaks: When you're feeling overwhelmed or jealous, it's important to take breaks and step away from the project. Go for a walk, meditate, or do something else that helps you relax and clear your mind. This can help you come back to the project with a fresh perspective and renewed energy.",
    "Learn from others: Instead of feeling jealous, try to learn from others who have finished their tasks successfully. Ask them for advice, feedback, and insights. This can help you improve your own skills and knowledge, and feel more confident in your abilities.",
    "Practice self-compassion: Finally, practice self-compassion and kindness towards yourself. Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and that it's okay to make mistakes or struggle with challenges. Focus on your progress, and celebrate your small victories along the way."
