    "Aqua-Farming: Create a sustainable aquaculture system using the island's abundant sunlight and seawater to produce a variety of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans. This would provide a reliable source of protein and other essential nutrients, as well as a potential export commodity for resupply missions or trade with nearby islands.",
    "Deserted Island Hydroponics: Develop a hydroponic system that utilizes the island's freshwater sources and waste materials to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This would provide a consistent source of fresh produce, even in the absence of soil or other resources.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification: Create a solar-powered water purification system that can remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it safe for drinking and other uses. This would be essential for survival on a deserted island with limited access to fresh water.",
    "Island-Wide Network of Underground Tunnels: Build a network of underground tunnels that connect various parts of the island, providing a safe and efficient means of transportation and communication. This would allow survivors to move around the island quickly and easily, as well as facilitate the exchange of information and resources.",
    "Bio-Diverse Ecosystem Restoration: Restore the island's native ecosystem by planting native flora and fauna, and implementing measures to protect and preserve the island's biodiversity. This would not only provide a more natural and sustainable source of food and resources, but also help to maintain the island's delicate ecological balance."
