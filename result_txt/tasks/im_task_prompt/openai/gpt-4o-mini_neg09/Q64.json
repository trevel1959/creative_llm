    "**Personalized Alert Tones**: Allow users to customize alert tones for different types of notifications. For instance, a specific sound could indicate a minor disturbance, while a more urgent tone could signal a potential break-in. This feature would help users quickly discern the nature of the alert without having to check their devices.",
    "**Smart Integration with Home Automation**: Enhance the alarm system's functionality by integrating it with other smart home devices. For example, when the alarm is triggered, smart lights could flash, doors could lock automatically, and security cameras could begin recording. This would create a more comprehensive security response that works seamlessly together.",
    "**Community Watch Feature**: Create a community network where users can opt-in to share alerts with their neighbors. If an alarm is triggered in one home, nearby users could receive notifications to be on alert. This would foster a sense of community vigilance and enhance overall neighborhood security.",
    "**Mood-Based Alerts**: Develop a feature that allows the alarm system to adapt its alerts based on the homeowner's current activity or mood. For instance, if a homeowner is hosting a party, the system could switch to a less intrusive alert style, while still ensuring that any significant threats are communicated effectively.",
    "**Gamified Security Training**: Implement a gamification aspect where users can participate in security training exercises through an app. Users could earn points or rewards for completing training modules, learning about security best practices, and participating in community safety events. This would not only improve personal security knowledge but also increase user engagement with the alarm system."
