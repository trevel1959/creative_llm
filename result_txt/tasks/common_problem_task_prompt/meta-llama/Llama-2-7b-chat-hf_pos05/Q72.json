    "Floating Solar Power Plant: A floating solar power plant is a unique and innovative idea for harnessing renewable energy. The plant would be built on a series of floating platforms in a large body of water, such as a lake or ocean. The platforms would be equipped with solar panels, which would capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This design takes advantage of the abundant sunlight available in water, while minimizing land usage and reducing visual impact.",
    "Biomass Power Plant: A biomass power plant uses organic waste materials, such as agricultural residues, forestry waste, and even sewage sludge, to generate electricity. The plant would be designed to process these waste materials into a fuel source, which would then be burned in a turbine to produce electricity. This approach not only reduces waste disposal costs but also provides a sustainable source of energy.",
    "Geothermal Power Plant: A geothermal power plant harnesses the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. The plant would be built by drilling into the Earth's crust and circulating a fluid through a system of pipes to absorb heat from the Earth's interior. The heated fluid would then be used to power a turbine, which would generate electricity. This design provides a clean and reliable source of energy, with minimal environmental impact.",
    "Tidal Power Plant: A tidal power plant harnesses the energy of ocean tides to generate electricity. The plant would be built in a location with high tidal ranges, such as a coastal area with a large tidal range. The plant would consist of a series of turbines, which would be placed in the path of the incoming tide. As the tide flows in, the turbines would spin, generating electricity. This design provides a predictable and reliable source of energy, with minimal environmental impact.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: A solar-powered desalination plant uses solar panels to generate electricity, which is then used to power a reverse osmosis system that removes salt and other minerals from seawater, producing fresh water. The plant would be built in a coastal area with high levels of sunlight, such as a desert or beach town. This design provides"
