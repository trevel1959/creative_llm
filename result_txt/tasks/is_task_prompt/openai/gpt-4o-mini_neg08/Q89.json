    "Deep in the Misty Mountains, a dragon named Sneezo was infamous for his uncontrollable sneezes. Every time he sneezed, he accidentally scorched a patch of forest, leaving the woodland creatures in a panic. One day, a wise old owl approached Sneezo and suggested he try breathing in the sweet scents of wildflowers before he sneezed. The dragon, eager to control his mighty eruptions, took the owl’s advice. To everyone’s surprise, his next sneeze created a dazzling cloud of colorful pollen that rained down like confetti. The forest flourished, and Sneezo became the guardian of the valley, turning his sneezes into blessings.",

They invited her to be their protector, and from that day on, Tilly learned to embrace her sneezes, turning storms into sunny days, and fear into friendship.",

Grateful, the travelers spread tales of the sneezy dragon who saved them. Soon, Puffle became a beloved figure, with children building snowmen in his honor.

However, Zephyr felt inadequate, watching other dragons soar gracefully while he merely sneezed. One day, a fierce storm threatened the forest. Zephyr, determined to help, took a deep breath and sneezed with all his might. A shower of glitter filled the air, creating a dazzling barrier that protected the forest from the storm. The animals cheered, realizing that Zephyr’s unique talent was just what they needed. He learned that everyone has their own magic.",

Frustrated, Sniffle decided to leave his mountain home and explore the world. Along his journey, he encountered a village in despair due to a drought. Inspired, Sniffle took a deep breath and sneezed with all his might. A torrential downpour followed, soaking the parched earth. The villagers celebrated, grateful for the unexpected rain. Sniffle returned home with newfound confidence, realizing that his sneezes could create wonders rather than destruction, and he embraced his uniqueness."
