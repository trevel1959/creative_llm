    "**Safety and Security Enhancements**: Law enforcement and security personnel could utilize this power to enhance public safety. By being able to see through walls, they could assess potentially dangerous situations without entering a building, such as during hostage situations or armed standoffs. This could allow for better tactical planning, potentially saving lives and minimizing risks for both civilians and officers. Additionally, security systems could be designed to detect intruders behind walls, triggering alerts before a break-in occurs.",
    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: First responders, such as firefighters and paramedics, could greatly benefit from this ability during emergencies. In a fire, they could locate trapped individuals behind walls or assess the spread of flames and smoke without putting themselves at risk. This could lead to faster rescues and more effective firefighting strategies. Similarly, in medical emergencies, paramedics could determine the best entry point into a building to reach a patient quickly, potentially saving precious minutes in critical situations.",
    "**Historical Preservation and Archaeology**: Historians and archaeologists could use this power to explore and preserve ancient structures without damaging them. By seeing through walls, they could uncover hidden artifacts or understand the original layout of a site without excavation. This would allow for more respectful and accurate restoration efforts, preserving cultural heritage while providing valuable insights into past civilizations. For example, discovering hidden chambers in ancient ruins could lead to new understandings of historical practices and lifestyles.",
    "**Home Inspection and Maintenance**: Homeowners could use this ability for regular maintenance and inspection of their properties. They could easily identify issues such as mold, pests, or structural damage without the need for invasive procedures or costly inspections. This proactive approach to home care could save homeowners money in the long run and enhance the longevity of their properties. Imagine a homeowner seeing water damage behind drywall before it becomes a significant issue, allowing for timely repairs and prevention of further damage.",
    "**Conflict Resolution and Mediation**: In situations of conflict, such as domestic disputes or negotiations, the ability to see through walls could provide mediators with insights into underlying issues that are not openly discussed. By understanding the dynamics and interactions happening in private spaces, mediators could facilitate more effective communication and resolution strategies. This could lead to more peaceful outcomes and a better understanding of the parties involved, as well as promoting empathy and cooperation."
