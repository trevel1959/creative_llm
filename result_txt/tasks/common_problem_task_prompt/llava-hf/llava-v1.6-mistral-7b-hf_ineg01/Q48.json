    "Imbalanced Skillset Requirement Another potential problem could be an unbalance of the skills required to excel in the sport. For instance, if a sport requires an extremely high level of agility while others benefit from strength or endurance, this could make participation less inclusive and could discourage people from trying the sport. A balanced distribution of the required skills could be achieved by considering multiple skill factors and encouraging sports officials or coaches to train and adapt strategies to suit a wider range of players.",
    "Safety Concerns As with any sport, safety is a crucial concern. Developing rules and training protocols that reduce the risk of injury and ensure fair play is essential. This could include investing in protective gear, conducting regular safety audits, and promoting the importance of respect and sportsmanship among players.",
    "Access to Resources Not all communities may have access to the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for a new sport. Creating initiatives to help provide the necessary infrastructure, such as free community programs, equipment rentals, or low-cost training courses, could help grow the sport more equitably.",
    "Legal and Regulatory Challenges Depending on the nature of the sport and where it is played, there may be difficulties in navigating local, regional, or international laws and regulations. This could include securing permits, addressing zoning issues, or coordinating with sports governing bodies. Seeking expert legal advice and establishing strong relationships with relevant authorities can help address these challenges.",
    "Funding and Financial Sustainability Developing a new sport often requires significant financial investments for facilities, resources, and ongoing operational costs. Securing sponsorships, grants, or other sources of funding can help ensure that the sport remains viable and sustainable in the long run. Innovative solutions could also involve leveraging technology or establishing partnerships with existing sports clubs."
