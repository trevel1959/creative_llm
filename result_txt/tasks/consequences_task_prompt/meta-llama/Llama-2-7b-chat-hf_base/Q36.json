    "Increased mobility and flexibility: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans would have enhanced mobility and flexibility, allowing for more efficient movement and greater dexterity. People could easily adapt to different environments and situations, and perform tasks that would be challenging or impossible with a single limb.",
    "Enhanced survival skills: Regenerating limbs would allow humans to survive in harsh environments where injuries or amputations might be more common. For example, soldiers or explorers could regrow lost limbs in the field, allowing them to continue their mission without disrupting their team or slowing down their progress.",
    "New forms of art and entertainment: The ability to regenerate limbs would open up new possibilities for art and entertainment. Artists could create sculptures or performances that incorporate regenerating limbs, while entertainers could use their newfound abilities to create illusions or stunts that would be impossible without them.",
    "Ethical considerations: The ability to regenerate limbs would raise important ethical questions about the value and dignity of human life. For example, would people with regenerating limbs be seen as \"superior\" to those without? Would there be concerns about the equitable distribution of this technology? How would society handle the moral implications of a world where limbs could be regenerated?",
    "Impact on medical science: The ability to regenerate limbs would be a game-changer for medical science, potentially leading to breakthroughs in the understanding and treatment of limb injuries and diseases. Researchers could study the regenerative processes of starfish to develop new treatments for limb loss, and develop new materials or technologies to support the regeneration process. This could lead to improved outcomes for millions of people around the world."
