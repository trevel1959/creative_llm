    "**Solar Oven**: Utilize the sun's energy to cook a meal. Build a makeshift solar oven using a cardboard box, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap. Place food in a heat-resistant container and position it in the center of the oven. As the sun heats the surface, it will cook the food through a process called radiant heating. This method is ideal for cooking simple meals like soups, stews, or roasted vegetables.",
    "**Stone Cooking**: Employ the ancient technique of cooking with heated stones. Gather flat stones and heat them over an open flame or by placing them in the sun. Once hot, place the stones in a pit or a hole and cover them with a layer of leaves or a piece of bark. Add food to the pit, and the heat from the stones will cook it. This method is suitable for cooking tougher cuts of meat or root vegetables.",
    "**Moss and Rock Steaming**: Harness the natural moisture in moss to create a makeshift steamer. Collect a container filled with water and add a layer of moss on top. Place food in a heat-resistant basket or container and suspend it above the water using a stick or a rock. As the water evaporates, it will create steam that cooks the food. This method is perfect for cooking delicate fish or vegetables.",
    "**Terra Cotta Pot Cooking**: Utilize terra cotta pots to create a makeshift oven. Dig a hole and place a terra cotta pot in it. Add a layer of dry leaves or small twigs at the bottom of the pot, followed by a layer of food. Cover the pot with a smaller terra cotta pot or a rock, and create a makeshift chimney using a stick and some leaves. As the leaves burn, they will heat the air, which will then cook the food. This method is suitable for cooking tougher cuts of meat or root vegetables.",
    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: Employ the traditional technique of cooking over an open flame. Gather dry wood and kindle a fire in a pit or a hole. Once the fire is burning steadily, place a metal grate or a rock over the flames. Add food to the grate or rock, and cook it using the direct heat from the fire. This method is ideal for cooking meat, fish, or vegetables that require high heat."
