    "**Innovative Self-Winding Dog Leash**: Develop a dog leash that features a built-in mechanism to wind up the leash automatically as it is being walked. The leash would be equipped with a micro motor, a sensor to detect the user's movement, and a compact storage compartment for the excess leash. This would eliminate the need for manual winding and provide convenience for owners who often find themselves carrying extra leash material.",
    "**Smart GPS Tracking Leash**: Integrate a GPS tracking system into the dog leash, which allows the owner to monitor their pet's location in real-time using a smartphone app. This feature can also send alerts if the dog strays beyond a set perimeter or if the leash is accidentally detached from the dog. The leash would be waterproof and designed to withstand the elements, ensuring reliable performance even during outdoor activities.",
    "**Adjustable and Expandable Leash System**: Create a leash that starts as a short, secure option for close control and expands to longer lengths as needed. The leash could have a telescoping mechanism, similar to those found in telescopic walking sticks. This would allow owners to quickly adjust the leash length without having to carry multiple leashes of varying lengths.",
    "**Leash with Built-in Water Bottle Holder**: Design a leash with a small, detachable water bottle holder that clips onto the handle. This feature would ensure that both the dog and the owner stay hydrated during walks, particularly in hot weather. The water bottle would be easy to access and refill, providing convenience for owners who may forget to bring additional water bottles.",
    "**Leash with Reflective Strips and LED Lights**: Incorporate highly visible reflective strips and LED lights into the leash. These features would enhance visibility during evening walks, making it easier for drivers to see pedestrians and dogs. The leash could have a button or toggle to turn the lights on and off, offering safety benefits without compromising style or functionality."
