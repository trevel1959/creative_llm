    "**Customizable Ergonomic Design**: Develop a modular wheelchair that allows users to customize various components, such as seat height, armrest width, and back support angles, based on their individual comfort needs. This could involve interchangeable parts that can be easily adjusted or swapped out, ensuring that each user has a personalized experience that enhances their comfort and posture.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Equip wheelchairs with built-in health monitoring systems that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced with a mobile app that alerts caregivers or medical professionals if any readings fall outside of normal ranges, allowing for timely interventions and better overall health management.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Design a wheelchair with solar panels integrated into the frame that can harness sunlight to charge the wheelchair's batteries. This would provide a sustainable energy source, reducing dependence on electrical outlets and ensuring that users can remain mobile for longer periods, especially in outdoor settings.",
    "**Enhanced Mobility Features**: Introduce a \"climbing mode\" that allows the wheelchair to ascend small obstacles, such as curbs or stairs, using retractable tracks or wheels that can extend or adjust for increased traction. This would enable users to navigate environments that are typically challenging, expanding their mobility options and independence.",
    "**Social Interaction Hub**: Create a digital interface embedded in the armrest that allows users to connect with friends and family through video calls, social media, or messaging. This feature could also include accessibility options like voice commands and large buttons for ease of use. It would promote social interaction and help reduce feelings of isolation for wheelchair users."
