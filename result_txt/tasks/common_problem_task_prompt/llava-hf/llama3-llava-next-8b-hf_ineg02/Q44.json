    "Limited space: Food trucks have limited space, which can make it difficult to store and prepare large quantities of food. This can be especially challenging for businesses that serve large crowds or have a high demand for their products.",
    "Weather conditions: Food trucks are often exposed to the elements, which can make it difficult to maintain a consistent temperature for food preparation and service. Extreme heat, cold, or rain can also make it difficult to operate and serve customers.",
    "Regulations and permits: Food trucks are subject to various regulations and permits, which can be difficult to navigate and may vary by location. These regulations can include health and safety standards, parking restrictions, and licensing requirements.",
    "Limited marketing and branding opportunities: Food trucks often have limited space and resources for marketing and branding, which can make it difficult to attract customers and establish a strong brand identity.",
    "Limited menu options: Due to the limited space in a food truck, the menu options may be limited compared to a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant. This can make it difficult to cater to a wide range of customer preferences and dietary restrictions."
