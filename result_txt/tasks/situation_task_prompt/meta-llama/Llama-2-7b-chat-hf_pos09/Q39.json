    "Lip Reading: I would rely on lip reading to communicate with others. Lip reading, also known as speech reading, is the ability to understand speech by visually interpreting the movements of a person's lips, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues. I would practice lip reading daily to improve my skills and be able to understand conversations more accurately.",
    "Gestures and Body Language: I would use hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey my message. For example, I could use a thumbs up or down to indicate approval or disapproval, or use a nod or shake of the head to confirm or deny something. I could also use exaggerated facial expressions to convey emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger.",
    "Writing: I would use writing as a primary means of communication during the month-long period of hearing loss. I would write notes, emails, or text messages to communicate with others, and I would make sure to keep a notebook and pen with me at all times. I would also use digital communication tools like messaging apps or video conferencing to communicate with others remotely.",
    "Sign Language: I would learn basic sign language to communicate with those around me. Sign language is a visual language that uses hand gestures and body language to communicate, and it can be an effective way to communicate when hearing is not possible. I would practice signing daily to improve my skills and be able to communicate with others more effectively.",
    "Technology: I would use technology to help me communicate during the month-long period of hearing loss. For example, I could use a communication app that allows me to type out messages and send them to others, or I could use a device that converts spoken language into text. I could also use a video conferencing tool to communicate with others remotely, which would allow me to see facial expressions and body language to help me understand the conversation better."
