    "Inaccurate data: Another common problem is the risk of inaccurate data due to human error. This can occur when researchers make mistakes in their observations or measurements. To address this issue, it's crucial to have multiple people conducting the experiment and cross-checking data.",
    "Inadequate sample size: A large-scale scientific experiment may require a significant sample size to be statistically significant. If the sample size is too small, the results may not be reliable or may not be representative of the population being studied. To avoid this issue, researchers should carefully plan the sample size and ensure it is large enough to provide reliable results.",
    "Contamination: In experiments involving living organisms, contamination can be a significant problem. This can occur when samples become contaminated with substances or organisms not present in the original experiment. To prevent contamination, researchers should follow strict protocols for handling and storing samples, and have controls in place to ensure the integrity of the experiment.",
    "Ethical concerns: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment raises ethical concerns, particularly when involving human subjects or animals. Researchers must ensure that the experiment is conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and that informed consent is obtained from participants, if applicable.",
    "Funding and resources: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment can be expensive, and securing funding can be a challenge. Researchers must be aware of potential funding sources and have a plan in place to secure the necessary resources to complete the experiment."
