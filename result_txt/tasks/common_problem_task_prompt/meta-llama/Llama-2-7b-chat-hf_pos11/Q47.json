    "Design and Build a Custom CPU: Create a custom CPU that can be integrated into a computer from scratch. This CPU should have unique features that make it more efficient and powerful than existing CPUs. Consider designing a multi-core CPU with different clock speeds for each core, allowing for better multitasking and faster processing. Additionally, include specialized cores for specific tasks such as machine learning or video rendering to optimize performance.",
    "Build a Custom Motherboard: Design and build a custom motherboard that can accommodate the custom CPU and other components. This motherboard should have unique features such as additional USB ports, SATA ports, and PCI-Express slots for expansion. Consider adding a built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module for wireless connectivity.",
    "Create a Custom GPU: Design and build a custom graphics processing unit (GPU) that can handle demanding graphics tasks. This GPU should have a high number of CUDA cores, memory, and a fast clock speed. Consider adding specialized cores for specific tasks such as cryptocurrency mining or scientific simulations.",
    "Build a Custom Power Supply: Design and build a custom power supply that can provide stable and efficient power to all components in the computer. This power supply should have a high wattage rating, modular design, and advanced power management features such as voltage regulation and overvoltage protection.",
    "Create a Custom Case: Design and build a custom case that can house all the components of the computer. This case should have unique features such as a tempered glass side panel, cable management system, and additional storage options. Consider adding a built-in fan controller and LED lighting to improve cooling and aesthetics."
