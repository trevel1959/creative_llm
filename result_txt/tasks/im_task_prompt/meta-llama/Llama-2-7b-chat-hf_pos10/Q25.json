    "A smart stapler that uses AI to optimize stapling: This innovative stapler could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the documents being stapled and optimize the stapling process for maximum efficiency. For example, it could learn the most common stapling patterns and adjust its stapling force accordingly, or even detect and remove any unnecessary staples.",
    "A stapler with a built-in paper cutter: This stapler could have a built-in paper cutter that automatically cuts the paper to the desired size before stapling, saving time and effort. The cutter could be adjustable, allowing users to customize the size of the cut paper.",
    "A wireless stapler with a Bluetooth connection: This stapler could be connected to a user's device via Bluetooth, allowing for wireless stapling and eliminating the need for cords. Users could also use a mobile app to control the stapler, such as stapling multiple pages at once or setting the stapling force.",
    "A 3D-printed stapler: This stapler could be created using 3D printing technology, allowing for a customizable and lightweight design. Users could choose from a variety of colors and designs, making the stapler a unique and personalized office supply.",
    "A stapler with a built-in staple remover: This stapler could have a built-in staple remover that allows users to easily remove staples without damaging the paper. The remover could be a small, spinning wheel that rotates around the staple, gently removing it from the paper. This feature would be especially useful for users who frequently need to remove staples from large quantities of paper."
