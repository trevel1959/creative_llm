    "**Homelessness Hubs**: Establish a network of community-led hubs across the city, providing a range of services and resources under one roof. Each hub would be tailored to the specific needs of its local community, offering everything from job training and education to healthcare and social support. These hubs would serve as a one-stop-shop for individuals experiencing homelessness, helping them access the services they need to get back on their feet.",
    "**Tiny Home Villages**: Develop a series of tiny home villages, each comprising a cluster of micro-homes that provide a safe and secure place for individuals to live. These villages would be designed with sustainability and community in mind, featuring shared community spaces, gardens, and amenities like laundry facilities and showers. By providing a stable and supportive environment, these villages would help individuals overcome the challenges of homelessness and transition into permanent housing.",
    "**Employment-Focused Navigation Centers**: Create a network of navigation centers that focus on employment and job placement, providing individuals experiencing homelessness with the tools and support they need to secure stable employment. These centers would offer a range of services, including job training, resume building, and interview preparation, as well as connections to local employers and job opportunities. By addressing the root cause of homelessness – lack of stable income – these centers would help individuals get back on their feet and into permanent housing.",
    "**Homelessness Prevention Programs**: Implement a range of homelessness prevention programs that target individuals at risk of becoming homeless. These programs would provide emergency financial assistance, rental assistance, and other forms of support to help individuals stay in their homes. By addressing the root causes of homelessness and providing targeted support, these programs would help prevent individuals from falling into homelessness in the first place.",
    "**Community-Led Affordable Housing Initiatives**: Launch community-led initiatives to develop and maintain affordable housing stock, ensuring that housing is available to those who need it most. These initiatives would involve community members, local organizations, and government agencies working together to identify areas of need, develop affordable housing solutions, and provide ongoing support and maintenance. By putting community at the forefront of housing development, these initiatives would help ensure that housing is accessible, affordable, and sustainable for all.
