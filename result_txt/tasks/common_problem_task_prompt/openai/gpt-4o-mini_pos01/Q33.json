    "**Food Sources**: Finding enough food can be a major challenge. Depending on the island's ecosystem, options may include foraging for edible plants, fishing, or hunting small animals. However, misidentifying edible versus poisonous plants can pose serious health risks. It's essential to learn about local flora and fauna, possibly by creating a guide from memory or using any available resources, to ensure safe foraging.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or sunburn. Building a shelter is crucial for protection. Utilizing natural resources such as fallen branches, palm fronds, and leaves, one could construct a makeshift hut. Additionally, positioning the shelter away from wind and rain, while ensuring it has proper ventilation, is important for comfort and safety.",
    "**Navigation and Rescue**: If the goal is to be rescued, understanding the geography of the island is vital. Without proper navigation tools, one might get lost or disoriented. Creating a large SOS sign on the beach using rocks or logs can signal passing ships or planes. Additionally, marking trails with stones or sticks can help in exploring the island without losing oneâ€™s way.",
    "**Health Risks and Injuries**: Injuries from falls, cuts, or insect bites can lead to infections if not treated properly. It's essential to have a plan for first aid, such as cleaning wounds with seawater and using natural antiseptics like honey or aloe vera, if available. Additionally, keeping a lookout for dangerous wildlife or plants is important to avoid further health risks.",
    "**Mental Well-being**: Isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, or despair. To combat this, one could establish a daily routine, engage in physical activities, or even create a journal to document experiences and thoughts. Finding ways to keep the mind engaged, such as crafting tools or exploring the island, can help maintain a positive mental state."
