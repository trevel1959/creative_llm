    "**Tennis Ball Garden Markers**: Tennis balls can be repurposed as unique and colorful garden markers. First, drill small holes into the tennis balls using a power drill or a dremel tool. Then, fill these holes with different colored acrylic paint to create a vibrant color-coded system for your garden beds. You can use these markers to identify different types of plants or the location of specific plantings. This idea not only adds a fun element to gardening but also helps in maintaining an organized garden.",
    "**Tennis Ball Birdhouses**: Tennis balls can be creatively transformed into birdhouses. Drill a small hole near the top of the tennis ball, large enough for birds to enter. Secure a small piece of wood or plastic to the tennis ball to act as a perch. Attach a string or wire to the base of the tennis ball for hanging. Place this homemade birdhouse in a tree or a garden area where you want to attract birds. This eco-friendly option provides shelter for local wildlife and adds a touch of natural beauty to your outdoor space.",
    "**Tennis Ball Outdoor Art**: Create an interactive art installation by arranging tennis balls in various patterns on a large canvas or wall.

The result is a dynamic, colorful outdoor art piece that invites interaction and conversation.",
    "**Tennis Ball Solar Lanterns**: Transform old tennis balls into solar-powered lanterns. Cut the tennis balls in half, then hollow out the center to create a lantern shape.

They're easy to make, eco-friendly, and provide a pleasant ambient glow.",
