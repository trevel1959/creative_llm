    "**Technical Debt Accumulation**: In the rush to launch a product, teams might prioritize speed over quality, leading to poor code practices and the accumulation of technical debt. This can result in a product that is difficult to maintain or scale in the future. To mitigate this risk, establish coding standards and regular code reviews, and allocate time for refactoring in the development cycle.",
    "**Scope Creep**: As the project progresses, stakeholders may request additional features or changes that were not part of the original plan, leading to scope creep. This can derail timelines and budgets. Implementing a strict change management process and ensuring clear communication about the impact of changes can help manage expectations and keep the project on track.",
    "**Inadequate Market Research**: Launching a product without thorough market research can result in a solution that does not meet the actual needs of the target audience. This can lead to poor adoption rates. To avoid this, conduct comprehensive market analysis, competitor assessments, and surveys to validate the product concept before development begins.",
    "**Integration Challenges**: New software products often need to integrate with existing systems or third-party services. Failing to plan for these integrations can lead to functionality issues or data inconsistencies. A detailed integration plan, including potential APIs and data mapping, should be created early in the design process to ensure compatibility.",
    "**Lack of Scalability**: Designing a product without considering future growth can lead to performance issues as user demand increases. This can result in crashes or slow response times, damaging user trust. To prevent this, architects should design the software with scalability in mind, employing cloud services or microservices architecture that allows for easy scaling as needed."
