    "Virtual reality experience: Create a virtual reality experience where users can put on a VR headset and interact with a virtual rubber hand. Users can stretch, bend, and manipulate the virtual rubber hand, and even use it to perform tasks such as picking up objects. This would help users understand the concept of ownership and agency over a virtual object.",
    "Interactive art installation: Design an interactive art installation where users can walk into a room and see a life-sized rubber hand suspended from the ceiling. As users move around the room, they will see the rubber hand mimic their movements, creating a disorienting and surreal experience. Users can also interact with the rubber hand by using sensors to control its movements, creating a more immersive and engaging experience.",
    "Gamified mindfulness app: Develop a mobile app that uses the rubber hand illusion to help users cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness. Users can use the app to manipulate a virtual rubber hand, and as they do, they will begin to feel a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual object. This can help users develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-control, as they learn to connect their actions to their sense of ownership.",
    "Virtual reality therapy: Create a virtual reality experience that uses the rubber hand illusion to help individuals overcome phantom limb pain. Users can put on a VR headset and interact with a virtual rubber hand that is attached to a virtual body. As users manipulate the virtual rubber hand, they will begin to feel a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual object, which can help them dissociate from the pain in their real limb.",
    "Social media platform: Develop a social media platform that uses the rubber hand illusion to help users connect with others and build relationships. Users can create a virtual avatar that represents them, and as they interact with other users, they will begin to feel a sense of ownership and agency over their avatar. This can help users build stronger connections with others, as they learn to identify with their virtual representation and understand its needs and desires."
