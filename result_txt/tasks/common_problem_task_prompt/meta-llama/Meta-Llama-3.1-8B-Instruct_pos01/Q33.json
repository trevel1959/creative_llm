    "**Island of Reflections**: I'd build a reflective surface using polished metal or glass to create a mirror-like effect on the beach. This would allow me to observe the island from a unique perspective, studying the tides, ocean currents, and weather patterns. By analyzing these reflections, I could better understand the island's ecosystem and potentially discover hidden resources. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Eco-Engineering**: I'd design and build a sustainable ecosystem on the island, using natural materials to create a self-sufficient environment. This could include a rainwater harvesting system, a composting toilet, and a solar-powered generator. By creating a thriving ecosystem, I could increase my chances of survival and potentially even attract beneficial wildlife. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Signal Fire Sculpture**: I'd create a large, intricate sculpture using natural materials like driftwood and palm fronds, which would also serve as a signal fire. By building a visually striking structure, I could attract the attention of potential rescuers while also providing a source of warmth and light. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Underwater Exploration**: I'd build a submersible vessel using a waterproof container and a scuba tank, allowing me to explore the surrounding waters and potentially discover hidden resources like fish, seaweed, or other marine life. By understanding the ocean's ecosystem, I could increase my chances of finding food and other essential supplies. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Artistic Expression**: I'd use the island as a canvas, creating large-scale art pieces using natural materials like sand, rocks, and shells. By expressing my creativity, I could distract myself from the isolation and potentially attract the attention of potential rescuers. Additionally, the art pieces could serve as a form of communication, conveying my presence and intentions to any passing aircraft or ships. Confidence: 0.6"
