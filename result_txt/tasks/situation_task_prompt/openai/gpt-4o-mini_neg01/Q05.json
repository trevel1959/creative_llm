    "**Reflective Structures**: Construct reflective structures around the city, such as large mirrors or reflective panels, that capture and redirect any available sunlight into urban areas. These structures could be strategically placed on rooftops, hills, or in parks to maximize the amount of light they collect. This approach would help brighten public spaces and homes while creating an artistic and visually striking environment.",
    "**Bioluminescent Gardens**: Develop gardens filled with bioluminescent plants and fungi that naturally emit light. Through genetic engineering or selective breeding, plants could be modified to glow in various colors and intensities, creating a magical atmosphere. These gardens could be placed in public parks and residential areas, providing a soft, enchanting light source during the day and night.",
    "**Light-Emitting Wearables**: Design and distribute wearable technology that incorporates light-emitting diodes (LEDs) into clothing and accessories. These wearables could be activated by movement or sound, providing personal illumination throughout the day. Fashionable and functional, these items would not only keep individuals visible but also serve as a form of self-expression in a sunless world.",
    "**Urban Light Art Installations**: Collaborate with local artists to create large-scale light installations in public spaces. These installations could use a combination of LED lights, fiber optics, and kinetic elements to create dynamic, interactive art pieces that provide illumination while also serving as cultural landmarks. These installations would attract visitors and boost morale, turning the absence of sunlight into an opportunity for creativity.",
    "**Portable Light Pods**: Develop portable, inflatable light pods that can be easily transported and deployed in various locations. These pods would be equipped with solar panels and LED lighting, providing instant illumination wherever they are set up. They could be used in parks, community events, or even by individuals in their backyards, offering a flexible solution to light needs in a sunless environment."
