    "**Temperature-Sensitive Color Change Spatula**: Create a spatula made from heat-sensitive materials that change color when it comes into contact with different temperatures. This would allow cooks to easily identify when food is ready to flip or when the pan is too hot, reducing the risk of burning food or damaging cookware.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with a Grip**: Redesign the spatula with an ergonomic handle that conforms to the natural grip of the hand. This could include a rubberized grip for comfort and stability, as well as a curved shape that provides better leverage for flipping heavier items. This would reduce strain on the wrist and improve overall cooking efficiency.",
    "**Spatula with Integrated Timer**: Incorporate a digital timer into the spatula handle that can be set for specific cooking times. This feature would be particularly useful for recipes that require precise timing. The timer could have a visual and audible alert to signal when it's time to flip or remove food from the heat, helping to prevent overcooking.",
    "**Flexible Silicone Spatula with Built-in Scraper**: Develop a spatula made from flexible silicone that allows for better maneuverability and scraping of bowls and pans. The spatula could have a built-in scraper edge that can easily reach into corners, ensuring that no batter or food goes to waste. This design would be especially useful for baking and cooking tasks that require thorough mixing.",
    "**Magnetic Spatula Holder**: Create a spatula that comes with a magnetic holder that can be attached to the side of a refrigerator or any metal surface. This would provide a convenient storage solution that keeps the spatula within easy reach while cooking and helps to reduce clutter on countertops. The holder could also feature additional compartments for other utensils."
