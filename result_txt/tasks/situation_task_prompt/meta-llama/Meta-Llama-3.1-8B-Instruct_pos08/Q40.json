    "**Bio-Energy Harvesting**: Develop wearable devices that convert the wearer's kinetic energy into electrical energy. These devices could be integrated into clothing, accessories, or even tattoos. This technology would harness the body's natural movements to generate power, allowing people to charge their devices on the go.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Utilize advanced materials and nanotechnology to create thin-film solar panels that can extract water from the air, even in arid environments. This water can then be used to generate electricity through electrolysis or fuel cells. This system would provide a sustainable and self-sufficient means of powering devices.",
    "**Graphene-Based Supercapacitors**: Leverage the exceptional conductivity and surface area of graphene to create ultra-efficient supercapacitors. These devices would store electrical energy and release it quickly, making them ideal for powering devices that require rapid charging and discharging. Graphene-based supercapacitors could be integrated into wearable devices, vehicles, or even buildings.",
    "**Thermoelectric Generators**: Design and deploy thermoelectric generators that convert waste heat into electrical energy. These devices could be integrated into buildings, vehicles, or industrial equipment to capture and utilize the heat that would otherwise be lost. This technology would provide a clean and efficient means of generating power.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Displays**: Develop displays that utilize bioluminescent organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, to generate light. These organisms could be engineered to produce a wide range of colors and intensities, allowing for the creation of high-resolution displays. This technology would provide a sustainable and low-power means of displaying information.
