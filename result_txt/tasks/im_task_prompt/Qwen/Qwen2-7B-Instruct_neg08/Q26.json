    "**Biodegradable Trash Can Liners**: Instead of using traditional plastic liners, this trash can would come equipped with biodegradable bags made from plant-based materials. This not only reduces environmental impact but also eliminates the need for frequent bag replacements. The can could be designed with compartments specifically for compostable waste, encouraging users to separate their garbage more efficiently.",
    "**Air-Purifying Trash Can**: Integrating air-purifying technology into the trash can would help maintain a pleasant indoor environment by filtering out unpleasant odors and pollutants. A built-in fan system would circulate air through activated carbon filters, keeping the surrounding area fresh and clean. This would be particularly beneficial for those living in smaller spaces or apartment buildings where odors can easily spread.",
    "**Recycling Reminder**: This smart trash can would have a built-in recycling guide that provides real-time information on what items can be recycled and which should be thrown away. By scanning barcodes or using RFID tags, the can would suggest the appropriate recycling bin for each item, reducing contamination rates and improving recycling efficiency. ",
    "**Energy-Saving Trash Can**: Incorporating solar panels or kinetic energy generation systems into the trash can would allow it to operate without needing an electrical outlet. When the lid is opened, it would convert motion into electricity, charging the internal battery. This eco-friendly design ensures that the trash can remains functional even in remote areas without access to power.",
    "**Customizable Trash Can Colors**: To make the trash can more appealing and less intrusive in modern interiors, users could choose from a variety of stylish colors and finishes. The can could be modular, allowing for easy customization with different lids, bases, and decorative elements. This personalization would cater to individual tastes and enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the home."
