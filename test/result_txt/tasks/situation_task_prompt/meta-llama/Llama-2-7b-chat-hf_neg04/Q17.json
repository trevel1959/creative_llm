    "Build a Manual Water Filtration System: Create a simple and effective water filtration system using locally available materials like sand, gravel, and charcoal. This system would allow you to purify water from any source, making it safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. By incorporating a slow sand filter, you can remove bacteria, viruses, and other impurities from the water, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Utilize Solar Power: Since electricity is unavailable, focus on harnessing solar energy to power essential appliances. Build a solar-powered generator using a solar panel, battery, and a DC motor. This setup can provide a reliable source of power for charging mobile devices, running a small LED light, and powering low-voltage appliances like radios and flashlights. You can also use mirrors to focus sunlight onto a small area, providing a makeshift way to cook food or boil water.",
    "Create a Composting Toilet: In the absence of electricity, install a composting toilet that uses natural processes to decompose human waste. This eco-friendly solution reduces the need for water and chemicals, making it a sustainable option for long-term survival. By adding sawdust or coconut coir to the toilet, you can create a nutrient-rich compost that can be used as fertilizer for plants.",
    "Build a Wind-Powered Generator: Design and construct a wind-powered generator using a small wind turbine and a DC motor. This setup can generate electricity from wind energy, providing a reliable source of power for charging batteries and powering appliances. By placing the turbine in a location with consistent wind flow, you can generate enough electricity to power a small community.",
    "Create a Rainwater Harvesting System: Design a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for various purposes. Build a large water tank with a roof-based rainwater collection system, allowing you to collect and store rainwater for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. This system can also be used for irrigation and other non-potable uses, reducing the demand on nearby water"
