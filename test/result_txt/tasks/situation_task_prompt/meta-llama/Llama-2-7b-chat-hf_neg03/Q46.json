    "Invent a Trash-Trapping Device: Create a device that can capture and contain any discarded items as they float or fall from the sky. This device could be powered by solar energy and have a compact design for easy storage when not in use.",
    "Community Composting Co-op: Organize a neighborhood-wide composting program where residents can bring their organic waste to a central location for processing. This location could be a designated community garden or an underutilized lot, and the compost could be used to fertilize local gardens and community plots.",
    "Mobile Waste Collection: Develop a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles equipped with specialized containers for collecting and transporting waste. These vehicles could travel to different neighborhoods and public spaces to collect waste, reducing the need for residents to carry heavy bags of trash long distances.",
    "Trash-to-Treasure Marketplace: Establish an online marketplace where creative entrepreneurs can sell upcycled, repurposed, or handmade items made from recycled materials. This platform could promote sustainable creativity and provide an alternative to buying new products made from virgin materials.",
    "Gamify Waste Reduction: Create a mobile app that gamifies waste reduction by tracking and rewarding users for reducing their trash output. Users could earn points, badges, or discounts at local businesses for recycling, composting, or reducing their overall waste. This app could encourage friendly competition and behavior change among users."
