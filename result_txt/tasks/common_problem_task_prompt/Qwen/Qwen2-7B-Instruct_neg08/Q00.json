    "**Budget Overspending**: Another issue might be overspending on decorations, food, and gifts. The parent might feel the pressure to have the most elaborate setup and lavish treats due to seeing others' parties. However, it's crucial to set a budget beforehand and stick to it to avoid financial stress. Budget-friendly alternatives like homemade decorations and bulk buying can help control costs without compromising on quality.",
    "**Unexpected Allergies**: Ensuring the safety of all attendees, especially children with known allergies, can be a significant challenge. The parent might not be aware of all allergies present among the guests, leading to potential health risks. To mitigate this, the parent should gather a list of all guests' dietary restrictions, contact parents in advance to confirm any allergies, and provide clear labeling for food items.",
    "**Weather Concerns**: Planning an outdoor party in unpredictable weather conditions can be stressful. Rain, heat, or unexpected storms can disrupt the event. The parent might struggle with deciding whether to proceed with the outdoor setup or opt for an indoor alternative. Having a backup plan, such as renting a pavilion or having an indoor venue ready, can alleviate this concern.",
    "**Limited Space**: If the chosen venue has limited space, managing the number of guests and ensuring there is enough room for activities can be challenging. The parent might feel overwhelmed trying to accommodate everyone while maintaining a comfortable environment. To address this, they could consider smaller venues, prioritize guest list to include only close family and friends, or plan activities that require minimal space.",
    "**Lack of Entertainment**: Keeping young guests engaged and entertained throughout the party can be tough. The parent might struggle to find suitable activities that cater to various interests and age levels. Offering a variety of games, crafts, and age-appropriate entertainment options can keep children occupied and ensure a fun-filled experience."
