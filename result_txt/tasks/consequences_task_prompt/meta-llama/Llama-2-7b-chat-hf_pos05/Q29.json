    "Information Overload: With the ability to remember everything read, individuals would be bombarded with an immense amount of information, making it challenging to process and retain any meaningful knowledge. The sheer volume of data would be overwhelming, leading to information overload and difficulty in filtering out irrelevant details.",
    "Lack of Focus: The constant retention of information would hinder the ability to focus on a single task or idea for an extended period. The brain would struggle to prioritize and process information, leading to scattered attention and decreased productivity.",
    "Emotional Burden: Memories of traumatic events or painful experiences could become unbearable, causing emotional distress and psychological harm. The constant recall of unpleasant memories would make it challenging to maintain mental well-being and lead a fulfilling life.",
    "Ethical Concerns: With the ability to recall every detail, individuals might become more susceptible to manipulation or coercion. Governments, corporations, or other powerful entities could exploit this ability to influence people's decisions, leading to ethical dilemmas and potential abuses of power.",
    "Societal Changes: A world where all humans could remember everything would fundamentally alter social dynamics. The reliance on written records and technology would decrease, as people would have direct access to all information. This could lead to a shift in the way knowledge is shared, stored, and disseminated, potentially creating new forms of communication and collaboration."
