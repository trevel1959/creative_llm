    "Sunlight Harvesting: Install large windows and skylights on the ceiling to allow natural sunlight to enter the room during the day. Use light-colored walls and reflective surfaces to maximize the amount of sunlight that can be harvested. At night, open windows and doors to allow the sunlight to enter the room and illuminate it.",
    "Glowing Plant Installations: Introduce glowing plants into the room, such as glowing mushrooms, glowing flowers, or even glowing trees. These plants would provide a soft, ambient light that would illuminate the room without the need for any additional lighting fixtures.",
    "Holographic Projection: Use holographic technology to project 3D images or patterns onto the walls and ceiling of the room. These projections could create a mesmerizing display of light and color, providing ample illumination for the room.",
    "Light-Emitting Paint: Develop a special type of paint that emits light when exposed to air. Paint the walls and ceiling of the room with this light-emitting paint, and the room would be illuminated without the need for any additional lighting fixtures.",
    "Shadow Puppets: Use silhouettes or shadow puppets to create a unique and creative form of lighting. By manipulating the position of the puppets, it would be possible to create different shapes and patterns of light that could illuminate the room."
