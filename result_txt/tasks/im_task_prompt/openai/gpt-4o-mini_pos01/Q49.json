    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a toothbrush made from biodegradable materials, including a replaceable head system that uses compostable plastics or bamboo. This would reduce plastic waste significantly and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The handle could be designed to be stylish yet functional, encouraging users to switch to a more sustainable option.",
    "**Customizable Brushing Modes**: Introduce a toothbrush with customizable modes that cater to different dental needs, such as sensitive gums, whitening, or plaque removal. Users could adjust the speed and vibration settings through an app, allowing for a tailored experience. Additionally, the brush could have an LED indicator that changes color based on the selected mode.",
    "**Built-in Water Flosser**: Combine the electric toothbrush with a mini water flosser. The toothbrush could have a detachable water reservoir that, when activated, sprays a fine mist of water or mouthwash to help dislodge food particles while brushing. This dual functionality would promote better oral hygiene by encouraging flossing alongside brushing.",
    "**Interactive Kidsâ€™ Version**: Create an electric toothbrush specifically designed for children that incorporates gamification elements. The toothbrush could connect to an app that rewards kids for brushing properly with points or badges. Characters or stories could be unlocked as they reach brushing milestones, making oral hygiene fun and engaging for young users.",
    "**UV Sanitizing Charging Base**: Design a charging base that includes a UV sanitizing feature. After each use, the toothbrush could be placed in the base, which would not only charge it but also use UV light to kill bacteria and germs on the brush head. This added layer of hygiene would reassure users about the cleanliness of their toothbrushes."
