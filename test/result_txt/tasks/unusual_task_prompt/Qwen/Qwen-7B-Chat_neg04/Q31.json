    "Create a calculator app that uses augmented reality to display mathematical equations in real-time. The user can point their smartphone camera at an equation on a piece of paper or whiteboard, and the app will automatically recognize it and display the result on the screen. This could be especially useful for students who are struggling with math concepts or for professionals who need to perform calculations quickly and easily.",
    "Develop a calculator app that uses voice recognition technology to allow users to enter equations without having to type them out. The user can simply speak into their device, and the app will interpret their words and calculate the result. This feature could be particularly useful for people with disabilities or for anyone who needs to use their hands while performing calculations.",
    "Create a calculator app that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of complex mathematical operations based on historical data. The app could analyze patterns and trends in previous calculations to make accurate predictions about future results. This feature could be useful for financial analysts, scientists, or anyone else who needs to perform complex calculations on a regular basis.",
    "Design a calculator app that uses gamification techniques to make learning math more engaging and fun. The app could include mini-games, quizzes, and other interactive elements that challenge users to solve mathematical problems and earn rewards. This feature could be particularly effective for children who are learning math in school or for adults who want to improve their math skills.",
    "Develop a calculator app that uses artificial intelligence to suggest personalized study plans for users based on their performance and learning style. The app could track users' progress over time and provide customized recommendations for improving their math skills. This feature could be useful for students who are struggling with specific topics or for anyone who wants to learn math at their own pace."
