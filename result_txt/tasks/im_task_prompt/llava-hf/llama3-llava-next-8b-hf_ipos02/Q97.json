    "Reflective Dog Leash: Enhance visibility by adding reflective materials to the leash. This can be especially useful for dogs that enjoy walking or playing outdoors during low-light conditions, such as early mornings or evenings. Reflective materials can increase the leash's visibility to drivers, cyclists, and other pedestrians, reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "Dog Leash with Integrated Training: Design a leash that includes training tools, such as a built-in clicker or whistle, to help pet owners train their dogs more effectively. The leash can be equipped with a small compartment for the clicker and a hole for the whistle, allowing the owner to control their dog's behavior while walking.",
    "Adjustable Dog Leash: Create a leash that can be easily adjusted to accommodate dogs of different sizes. The leash can feature an adjustable buckle or clip mechanism, allowing pet owners to customize the leash's length to fit their dog's size and temperament.",
    "Dog Leash with Attachable Accessories: Develop a leash that can be customized with attachable accessories, such as a water bottle holder or a small storage compartment for dog treats. This can help pet owners carry essential items while walking their dog and keep their hands free.",
    "Dog Leash with Safety Features: Incorporate safety features into the leash, such as a breakaway clip or a built-in shock absorber. The breakaway clip can release the leash if the dog gets caught on something, preventing injuries or entanglement. The shock absorber can help reduce the strain on the dog's neck and jaw when the leash is pulled."
