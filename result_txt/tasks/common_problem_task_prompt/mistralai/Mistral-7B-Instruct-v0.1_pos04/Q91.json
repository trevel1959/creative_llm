    "Water purification stations: One solution could be to set up water purification stations in different locations throughout the country. These stations would use a combination of filtration and chemical treatment to remove contaminants from the water, providing clean drinking water to local communities.",
    "Water conservation education: Another approach could be to educate the local population on the importance of water conservation and how to save water. This could involve working with schools and community groups to develop educational programs, as well as providing training to farmers on sustainable irrigation practices.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is a process of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. This could be an effective solution in areas where rainfall is frequent and could provide a reliable source of clean water for local communities.",
    "Microfinance for water infrastructure: Microfinance institutions could be used to provide funding for the construction of water infrastructure projects such as wells, pipelines, and water treatment plants. This could help to provide clean water to communities that currently lack access to it.",
    "Community-based water management: Community-based water management involves empowering local communities to take ownership of their water resources and manage them sustainably.
