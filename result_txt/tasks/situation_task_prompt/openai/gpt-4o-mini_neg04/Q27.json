    "**Natural Ventilation Design**:    - **Explanation**: Implement a design that maximizes natural airflow. This can be achieved by strategically placing windows, vents, and doors to create cross-ventilation. For example, opening windows on opposite sides of a room can create a breeze that cools the space. Additionally, installing ceiling fans can help circulate air without using electrical power, as they can be powered by small solar panels.",
    "**Green Roofs and Vertical Gardens**:    - **Explanation**: Create a green roof or vertical garden to insulate the building and regulate temperature. Plants provide shade, reduce heat absorption, and can cool the air through transpiration. A green roof can lower indoor temperatures in summer while providing insulation in winter. Additionally, incorporating plants inside can improve air quality and enhance comfort.",
    "**Reflective and Insulative Window Treatments**:    - **Explanation**: Use reflective window films or insulated curtains to manage solar heat gain. Reflective films can be applied to windows to deflect sunlight, while insulated curtains can be drawn during the hottest parts of the day to keep heat out. In winter, these curtains can be opened during the day to let sunlight in and closed at night to trap warmth.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling Systems**:    - **Explanation**: Create a DIY evaporative cooling system using water and fans. This can be as simple as placing a shallow pan of water in front of a fan. As the fan blows air over the water, it will evaporate, cooling the air that circulates in the room. Alternatively, hanging wet sheets in front of open windows can create a similar cooling effect as the breeze passes through.",
    "**Earth Sheltering**:    - **Explanation**: For those with the ability to modify their living space, consider earth-sheltering techniques. This involves partially burying a home or adding earth mounds around the structure to take advantage of the earthâ€™s natural insulation properties. The constant temperature of the ground can help keep the indoor environment cooler in summer and warmer in winter."
