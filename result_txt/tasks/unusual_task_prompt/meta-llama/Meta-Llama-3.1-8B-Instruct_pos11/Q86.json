    "**Gloves that Change Color**: Develop a line of rubber gloves that change color in response to different temperatures, allowing wearers to easily identify hot or cold surfaces. The gloves could be designed for use in various industries, such as construction, manufacturing, or healthcare, where workers are often exposed to extreme temperatures.",
    "**Smart Gloves with Integrated Tools**: Design a pair of rubber gloves with built-in tools, such as a built-in flashlight, compass, or multi-tool, to make work easier and more efficient. These gloves could be marketed towards outdoor enthusiasts, search and rescue teams, or workers in remote areas.",
    "**Gloves with Built-in Sensors**: Create rubber gloves with integrated sensors that can detect various environmental factors, such as air quality, humidity, or UV radiation. This could be particularly useful for workers in industries where exposure to these factors is a concern, such as construction or agriculture.",
    "**Gloves with Integrated Communication**: Develop rubber gloves with built-in communication systems, allowing wearers to stay in touch with colleagues or emergency services in situations where voice communication is not possible. This could be useful for workers in remote areas or those in industries where communication is critical, such as search and rescue.",
    "**Gloves with Integrated Tactile Feedback**: Design rubber gloves with built-in tactile feedback systems, providing wearers with real-time information about their surroundings, such as the texture of objects or the presence of obstacles. This could be particularly useful for workers in industries where dexterity and tactile awareness are crucial, such as surgery or manufacturing. [/INST] Assistant: 6.  **Gloves with Integrated Safety Features**: Develop rubber gloves with integrated safety features, such as built-in shock-absorbing materials or pressure sensors, to protect wearers from injury in high-risk situations. This could be marketed towards workers in industries where accidents are common, such as construction or manufacturing."
