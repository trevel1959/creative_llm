    "**Expandable Design**: Create a suitcase with an expandable design that allows it to increase in size when more packing space is needed. This could be achieved through a series of zippers and folds that can be adjusted depending on the traveler's needs. This feature would cater to both minimalists and those who tend to overpack, making it versatile for different types of trips.",
    "**Built-in Power Bank and Charging Ports**: Equip the suitcase with a built-in power bank that includes multiple USB charging ports. This would allow travelers to charge their devices on the go without needing to find an outlet. The power bank could be rechargeable via solar panels embedded in the suitcase's exterior, providing an eco-friendly charging option.",
    "**Modular Compartments**: Design a suitcase with modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the traveler's preferences. These compartments could include sections for clothing, shoes, electronics, and toiletries, making organization easier and more customizable. This feature would help travelers keep their belongings neat and accessible during their journey.",
    "**Self-weighing Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-weighing mechanism that allows travelers to check the weight of their suitcase without needing a separate scale. This feature could include a digital display that shows the weight when the suitcase is lifted, helping to avoid overweight baggage fees at the airport. It could also have a built-in alert system that notifies the user if they exceed the airline's weight limit.",
    "**Anti-theft Locking System**: Enhance the suitcase with an advanced anti-theft locking system that includes biometric fingerprint recognition or a combination lock that can be reset remotely through a smartphone app. This would provide an extra layer of security for travelers, ensuring that their belongings are safe from theft while they are distracted or away from their luggage."
