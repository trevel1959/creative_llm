    "**Eco-Friendly Mulching Attachment**: Design an attachment that not only mows but also finely chops the grass clippings to create mulch. This would help in retaining moisture in the soil, suppressing weeds, and adding nutrients back into the lawn. The attachment could be easily detachable for those who prefer traditional mowing.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses water jets and brushes to clean the mower's blades and underside after each use. This would reduce the buildup of grass clippings and debris, enhancing the mower's efficiency and longevity. The cleaning system could be activated with a simple button press or automatically after the mower is turned off.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Enhancements**: Revamp the mower's design to include adjustable handles that can accommodate users of different heights, along with cushioned grips to reduce strain during extended use. Additionally, adding a lightweight, balanced frame would make it easier to maneuver, especially for those with limited strength or mobility.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Incorporate sound-dampening materials and innovative blade designs to significantly reduce the noise produced by gas and electric mowers. This would make mowing less disruptive to neighbors and wildlife, creating a more pleasant outdoor experience. A quieter mower could also be marketed as an eco-friendly option.",
    "**Solar-Powered Features**: Integrate solar panels into the mower's design to provide supplemental power for electronic features like GPS, lights, or even a small electric motor. This would reduce reliance on batteries and lower energy costs, making the mower more sustainable. The solar power could also be used to charge other garden tools or devices."
