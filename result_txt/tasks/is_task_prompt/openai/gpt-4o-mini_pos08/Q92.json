The students gasped, some even pointed, as he rolled through the doors. \"Is he going to take our jobs?\" one boy whispered. But Z3N was programmed to learn and adapt. During lunch, he overheard a group struggling with their math homework. With a flick of his wrist, he projected holographic equations, explaining them in simple terms. By the end of the day, laughter echoed through the halls as Z3N played tag with his new friends. Challenges transformed into friendships, and school became a place of wonder.",
