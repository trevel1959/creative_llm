    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a helmet with a modular design that allows users to customize different parts of the helmet according to their preferences. For instance, riders could choose different outer shells for style, or interchangeable visors for sun protection or goggles for visibility in different weather conditions. This would make the helmet not only safer but also a fashion statement.",
    "**Enhanced Ventilation System**: Innovate a helmet with an adjustable ventilation system that can be controlled by the rider. By incorporating small fans or vents that can open or close based on the rider's comfort level, the helmet would maintain optimal airflow and temperature, making it more comfortable during long rides or in hot weather.",
    "**Smart Impact Sensors**: Integrate smart sensors that can detect impact and measure the severity of a crash. These sensors could send an alert to emergency contacts or local authorities if the rider is unresponsive, ensuring quick assistance. The helmet could also provide feedback on the impact to help riders understand the severity of their accidents and when to seek medical attention.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Focus on sustainability by creating a helmet made from biodegradable or recycled materials. This helmet could be designed to break down naturally after its life cycle, reducing environmental impact. Additionally, a program could be established for recycling old helmets, encouraging users to return their used helmets for proper disposal or repurposing.",
    "**Adaptive Fit Technology**: Develop a helmet with adaptive fit technology that uses memory foam or adjustable internal components to mold to the rider's head shape. This would ensure a snug and comfortable fit, enhancing safety by minimizing movement during an accident. Riders could also adjust the fit on-the-go for comfort during different activities or conditions."
