    "\"Toothbrush Time Travel\": Create a toothbrush that allows users to travel through time while brushing their teeth. The toothbrush could have different colored bristles for different time periods, such as blue for ancient Egypt or red for the Wild West. As users brush their teeth, they can imagine themselves visiting different eras and experiencing the culture and history of those times.",
    "\"Toothbrush Transformation\": Design a toothbrush that transforms into a different object or character after each use. For example, the toothbrush could transform into a superhero cape, a musical instrument, or a work of art. This would add an element of surprise and fun to the daily routine of brushing teeth.",
    "\"Toothbrush Fitness Tracker\": Create a toothbrush that doubles as a fitness tracker, tracking the user's brushing time, pressure, and technique. The toothbrush could also track other fitness metrics, such as steps taken, calories burned, or distance run. This would provide an added incentive for users to brush their teeth regularly and stay fit.",
    "\"Toothbrush Augmented Reality\": Develop a toothbrush with augmented reality (AR) capabilities, such as displaying fun animations or games on the toothbrush handle while brushing. This could help make the daily routine more enjoyable and engaging, and could also help users brush their teeth more thoroughly and for the full recommended 2 minutes.",
    "\"Toothbrush Personal Assistant\": Create a toothbrush that acts as a personal assistant, reminding users to brush their teeth, scheduling appointments, and even ordering toothpaste and other oral care products. The toothbrush could also provide personalized oral health recommendations based on the user's brushing habits and dental history. This would make the daily routine of brushing teeth more convenient and efficient, and could also help users stay on top of their oral health."
