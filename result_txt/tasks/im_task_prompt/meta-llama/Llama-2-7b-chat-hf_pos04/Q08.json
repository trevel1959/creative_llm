    "A smart refrigerator that uses AI to optimize food storage and meal planning: The smart refrigerator of the future could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the contents of the fridge and suggest recipes based on what's already there. It could also automatically organize food into categories like \"use by today\" or \"use by next week\" to help users stay on top of their expiration dates. Additionally, the fridge could monitor the temperature and humidity levels to ensure that food is stored at the optimal conditions for freshness.",
    "A refrigerator that generates electricity: This refrigerator could be designed with a built-in generator that harnesses the energy from the motion of the door opening and closing to generate electricity. This could provide a small but steady stream of power to charge devices or power other appliances in the home. The generator could be powered by a small motor or a flywheel, and could be connected to a battery or a power grid to store or distribute the energy.",
    "A refrigerator with a built-in herb garden: This refrigerator could be designed with a small herb garden integrated into the door or the walls of the fridge. This would allow users to grow their own herbs at home, without taking up valuable space in the kitchen. The herbs could be grown using a hydroponic system, which would use a small amount of water and nutrients to keep the plants healthy and thriving. This would provide a convenient source of fresh herbs for cooking and meal prep.",
    "A refrigerator that uses augmented reality to help users shop: This refrigerator could be equipped with a see-through display that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to show users what's inside the fridge without having to open it. Users could simply scan the display with their phone or tablet to see a virtual inventory of the fridge's contents, including images and prices of the items. This could help users plan their meals and make a grocery list without having to physically open the fridge.",
