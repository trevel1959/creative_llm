    "Virtual Reality Peace Summit: Host the summit in a virtual reality platform, allowing participants to connect from anywhere in the world. This would eliminate the need for travel and reduce carbon emissions, making it a more sustainable and inclusive option. Participants could interact with each other in virtual reality environments, such as a virtual peace village or a virtual conflict resolution simulation.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Create an interactive art installation that represents the different perspectives and interests of the participating countries. The installation could include interactive elements, such as a \"peace wall\" where participants can write messages of peace, or a \"conflict resolution\" game where participants can work together to find solutions to simulated conflicts.",
    "Mobile App for Peacebuilding: Develop a mobile app that provides a platform for participants to connect and share ideas on peacebuilding. The app could include features such as a \"peacebuilder's network\" where participants can connect with each other, a \"peace journal\" where participants can reflect on their progress, and a \"peace library\" where participants can access resources on peacebuilding.",
    "Immersive Theatre Performance: Host an immersive theatre performance that tells the story of a fictional conflict and its resolution. The performance could be interactive, with participants playing the roles of characters involved in the conflict. This would allow participants to experience the impact of their actions on the outcome of the conflict and the importance of communication and empathy in resolving conflicts.",
    "Collaborative Mural Painting: Host a collaborative mural painting event where participants from different countries work together to create a large-scale mural that represents their shared vision for peace. The mural could be painted in a public space, such as a park or a wall, and could include symbols and messages of peace from each of the participating countries. This would provide a visual representation of the shared commitment to peace and the importance of collaboration in achieving it."
