    "The world would come to a complete standstill as people would be unable to perform their daily tasks and responsibilities.",
    "There would be an increase in crime and violence as people would lose their sense of empathy and morality.",
    "The economy would collapse as businesses would be unable to function without their employees.",
    "There would be a massive increase in mental health issues as people would struggle to cope with the loss of their memories.",
    "The world would be plunged into chaos as people would be unable to communicate with each other and would lose their sense of identity."
