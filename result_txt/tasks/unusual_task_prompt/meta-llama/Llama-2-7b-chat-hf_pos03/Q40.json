    "Cookie Jar with a Twist: Design a cookie jar with a unique twist mechanism that reveals a surprise inside each time a cookie is opened. For example, the user might find a fun surprise like a fortune cookie with a humorous quip or a small toy inside. This would add an element of excitement and surprise to the simple act of eating a cookie.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Built-in Cooling System: Create a cookie jar with a built-in cooling system that keeps cookies fresh for longer. This could be achieved through the use of a small refrigeration unit or a thermoelectric cooling system. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy baking and storing their own cookies, as it would help to keep them fresh for longer periods of time.",
    "Interactive Cookie Jar: Design a cookie jar that responds to voice commands or gestures, allowing users to interact with it in a more playful way. For example, the jar could play a fun sound or light up when a cookie is removed, or it could dispense a cookie in response to a specific command. This would add a fun and interactive element to the simple act of eating a cookie.",
    "Cookie Jar with a Social Twist: Create a cookie jar that connects to a social media platform, allowing users to share their cookie consumption habits with friends and family. This could be done through a companion app that tracks cookie consumption and allows users to share their progress on social media. Users could also earn rewards or badges for reaching certain cookie consumption milestones, adding a social element to the experience."
