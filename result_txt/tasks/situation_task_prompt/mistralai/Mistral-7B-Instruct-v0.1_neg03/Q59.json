    "Harness Solar Energy: While the sky may always be cloudy, the sun still shines through the clouds at times. We could harness this energy by installing solar panels on rooftops or other structures to capture the sunlight that does manage to break through the clouds. This energy could then be used to power homes, businesses, and other devices.",
    "Use Artificial Lighting: Another option would be to use artificial lighting to supplement the natural light that is available. This could include installing LED lights or other types of lighting in buildings or using portable lighting devices outside.",
    "Use Natural Lighting: While the sky may be cloudy, there may still be opportunities to capture natural light. For example, we could use large windows or skylights to allow sunlight to enter a building, even if it's not coming directly from the sun.",
    "Use Reflective Materials: We could also use reflective materials, such as mirrors or white paint, to reflect sunlight onto surfaces. This could help to brighten up a room or other area, even if the sky is cloudy.",
    "Use Augmented Reality: Finally, we could use augmented reality technology to create the illusion of sunlight in cloudy skies. This could involve using virtual reality headsets or other devices to create a simulated sunny day, even when the sky is cloudy in real life."
