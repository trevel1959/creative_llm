    "**Language Barriers**: If the exchange student is not fluent in the host family's language, communication can become a significant challenge. This can lead to feelings of isolation for the student and frustration for the host family. To address this, the family could learn basic phrases in the student's language, and the student could be encouraged to practice their language skills in a supportive environment, such as through language exchange apps or local language clubs.",
    "**Homesickness**: The exchange student may experience homesickness, particularly if they are far from home for the first time. This can manifest as sadness, withdrawal, or reluctance to participate in family activities. The host family can help by creating a warm and welcoming environment, allowing the student to maintain connections with home through regular video calls, and encouraging them to share their feelings openly.",
    "**Differences in Educational Systems**: The exchange student may come from a different educational background, which could lead to confusion regarding academic expectations, grading systems, or classroom behavior. To ease this transition, the host family can collaborate with the student's school to ensure they receive the necessary support and orientation to understand the local educational framework.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: The student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences that differ from the host family's usual meals, which could lead to tension during mealtimes. It’s important for the host family to discuss dietary needs beforehand and plan meals that are inclusive, allowing the student to participate in meal preparation, which can also serve as a cultural exchange opportunity.",
    "**Social Integration**: The exchange student might struggle to make friends and integrate into the local community, especially if they are shy or reserved. This could lead to feelings of loneliness. The host family can assist by introducing the student to their social circles, inviting them to community events, or encouraging participation in extracurricular activities that align with the student’s interests."
