    "markings on the ground: If all clocks and watches disappeared, we could use the sun and stars to mark time. By observing the position of the sun and stars, we could determine the time of day and night. We could also use the position of the moon to mark the passing of days and weeks.",
    "natural phenomena: We could use natural phenomena such as the changing of the tides, the blooming of flowers, or the migration of birds to mark time. For example, we could use the time it takes for a flower to bloom to mark the passing of days or weeks.",
    "the changing of the seasons: We could use the changing of the seasons to mark time. For example, we could use the time it takes for leaves to change color or for snow to cover the ground to mark the passing of months or years.",
    "the movement of the earth: We could use the movement of the earth to mark time. For example, we could use the time it takes for the earth to rotate on its axis to mark the passing of days or the time it takes for the earth to orbit the sun to mark the passing of years.",
    "technology: We could use technology to mark time. For example, we could use the time it takes for a computer to process information to mark the passing of seconds or minutes. We could also use the time it takes for a satellite to orbit the earth to mark the passing of days or years."
