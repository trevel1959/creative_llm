    "**Memory Foam Bedroll**: Instead of traditional pillows, create a customizable memory foam bedroll that can be shaped into various forms. Users can roll out the foam and mold it into a contour that perfectly fits their head and neck. The bedroll would be portable and easy to store, making it perfect for travel. With a built-in heating element, it could warm up to provide additional comfort, mimicking the cozy feeling of a pillow.",
    "**Neck Support Pillow**: Design a neck support pillow that wraps around the neck and cradles the head. This device would feature a series of inflatable compartments that can be adjusted for firmness, allowing users to customize the level of support. The pillow could also include a built-in massager that gently kneads the neck and upper back, helping to relieve tension and promote relaxation before sleep.",
    "**Nature’s Embrace**: For those who prefer a more natural approach, a \"Nature’s Embrace\" kit could be developed. This kit would include various materials found in nature, such as soft moss, feathers, or dried leaves, which can be arranged to create a comfortable resting spot for the head. The kit would come with a guide on how to create the perfect headrest using these natural elements, encouraging users to connect with the outdoors while they sleep.",
    "**Magnetic Headrest**: A futuristic magnetic headrest could be designed to provide a comfortable sleeping experience without the bulk of a traditional pillow. This device would use magnetic levitation technology to gently suspend the head above a supportive surface, reducing pressure points and allowing for a floating sensation. The headrest could be adjusted for height and angle, accommodating different sleeping positions.",
    "**Soundwave Sleep Pod**: Create a soundwave sleep pod that envelops the head in soothing sound frequencies while providing support. This pod would have a concave design that fits around the head and emits calming sounds or white noise to promote relaxation. The pod could also have a memory foam lining to offer additional comfort, allowing users to drift off to sleep while being cradled in sound."
