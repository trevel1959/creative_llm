    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Develop a microwave with a self-cleaning function using steam technology. By adding a water reservoir, the microwave can create steam that loosens food particles and grease. Once the cleaning cycle is complete, a simple wipe-down with a cloth would be all thatâ€™s needed, making maintenance easier and more hygienic.",
    "**Dual-Functionality Design**: Create a microwave that can also function as an air fryer or convection oven. By incorporating additional heating elements and a fan, users could switch between microwave cooking and healthier air frying or baking options, all in one compact appliance. This would save space in the kitchen and provide more cooking versatility.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**: Add a touchscreen interface to the microwave that displays recipes and cooking instructions. Users could select a recipe, and the microwave would automatically set the time and power level for optimal cooking. The screen could also feature cooking tips, nutritional information, and even video tutorials for more complex dishes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Introduce an energy-saving mode that uses less power when reheating or cooking small portions. This feature could be designed to optimize energy consumption by adjusting the cooking time based on the weight of the food, promoting sustainability and reducing electricity bills.",
    "**Customizable Interior Layout**: Design a microwave with adjustable shelves and removable turntables, allowing users to customize the interior space according to their cooking needs. This feature would accommodate larger dishes or multiple smaller items, providing flexibility and ease of use."
