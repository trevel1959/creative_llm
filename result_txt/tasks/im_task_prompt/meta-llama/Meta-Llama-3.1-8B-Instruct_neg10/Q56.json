    "**Musical Bell**: A bicycle bell that plays a musical tune instead of a traditional \"ding-ding\" sound. This could be achieved through a built-in speaker or a wireless connection to a smartphone. The musical bell could be customized to play a specific tune or even respond to the rider's mood, creating a more enjoyable experience.",
    "**Air-Powered Bell**: A bicycle bell that uses compressed air to produce a louder, more distinct sound. This could be achieved through a small air tank and a pneumatic system, making the bell more noticeable to pedestrians and other cyclists.",
    "**Safety Bell**: A bicycle bell with a built-in safety feature that alerts nearby drivers or pedestrians of an approaching cyclist. This could be achieved through a flashing light or a loud, high-pitched sound that is more noticeable to people with hearing impairments.",
    "**Customizable Bell**: A bicycle bell that allows riders to customize the sound, shape, and color of the bell to suit their personal preferences. This could be achieved through interchangeable components or a 3D printing system.",
    "**Power-Generating Bell**: A bicycle bell that generates electricity as the rider presses the bell, powering small devices such as a phone or a GPS watch. This could be achieved through a piezoelectric system or a small generator."
