    "Herbal Remedies: One creative solution to treat a common cold without medication would be to utilize herbal remedies. Herbs such as ginger, echinacea, and peppermint have natural anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties, which can help alleviate cold symptoms. For example, ginger can help reduce inflammation in the nasal passages, while peppermint can help clear congestion.",
    "Saltwater Gargle: Another creative solution would be to use a saltwater gargle to help reduce swelling in the throat and ease congestion. Mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water and gargling several times a day can help loosen mucus and reduce inflammation.",
    "Humidifiers: Humidifiers can help moisturize the nasal passages and throat, making it easier to breathe and reducing congestion. By adding moisture to the air, humidifiers can help thin mucus and make it easier to expel, providing relief from a common cold.",
    "Steam Inhalation: Steam inhalation is another creative solution that can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion. By inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam inhaler, the heat can help break up mucus and make it easier to expel. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to the water can also provide additional decongestant properties.",
    "Probiotics: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help boost the immune system and reduce the severity of cold symptoms. By taking a probiotic supplement or consuming probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt or kefir, the good bacteria can help fight off the cold virus and reduce inflammation in the body."
