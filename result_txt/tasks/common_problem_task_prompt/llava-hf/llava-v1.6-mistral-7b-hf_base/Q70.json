    "Difficulty in providing customer service: When customers contact a company with a customer service hotline, they expect to speak to representatives who speak the same language as them. In a multicultural workplace, it can be challenging for customer service representatives to provide adequate assistance to customers who speak a different language.",
    "Lack of cultural understanding: Language is not just about words and phrases but also about cultural nuances and context. In a multicultural workplace, employees may struggle to understand the cultural aspects of each other's communication styles and may inadvertently offend or misunderstand colleagues, leading to frustration and conflict.",
    "Lack of inclusive communication policies: A company with a multicultural workforce may struggle to create inclusive communication policies and processes that cater to the linguistic and cultural needs of all employees. This can lead to employees feeling excluded, frustrated or undervalued.",
    "Recruitment and hiring challenges: Recruiting employees who speak different languages can be challenging, and training them to speak the company's preferred language can be time-consuming and expensive.",
    "Increased use of technology: As companies become more reliant on technology to communicate with employees and customers, language barriers can lead to increased miscommunication and confusion, especially if the technology is not designed to accommodate different languages or if employees are not familiar with using it."
