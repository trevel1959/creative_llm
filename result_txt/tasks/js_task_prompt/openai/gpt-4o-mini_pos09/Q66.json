    "**Floating Gardens**: To enhance the island's natural beauty and promote biodiversity, I would create a series of floating gardens. These gardens would be made from biodegradable materials and planted with native flora, which would attract local wildlife and provide a serene environment for relaxation. Visitors could kayak or paddleboard around these gardens, enjoying the lush greenery and vibrant colors while also learning about the local ecosystem.",
    "**Wellness Retreat Center**: A dedicated wellness center would offer yoga classes, meditation sessions, and holistic healing therapies. The center would feature open-air spaces for yoga with views of the ocean, as well as treatment rooms for massages and spa services using organic, locally sourced products. There would also be a healthy caf√© serving nutritious meals made from island-grown ingredients, fostering a community of health and well-being.",
    "**Adventure Zone**: For those seeking thrills, an adventure zone would include activities such as zip-lining through the trees, rock climbing on natural formations, and an obstacle course built into the landscape. There would also be water sports available, including snorkeling, scuba diving, and paddleboarding. This area would be designed to encourage exploration and connection with nature while ensuring safety and sustainability.",
    "**Cultural Village**: To celebrate and preserve local traditions, a cultural village would be established, showcasing the heritage of the island's original inhabitants. This village would feature workshops where visitors can learn traditional crafts such as weaving, pottery, and cooking. Cultural events, music performances, and storytelling sessions would be held regularly, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the local culture and connect with the community.",
    "**Stargazing Observatory**: Given the island's remote location, an observatory would be built to take advantage of the clear night skies. Equipped with telescopes and guided by knowledgeable astronomers, guests could enjoy stargazing sessions, learning about constellations, planets, and the universe. The observatory would also have educational programs for children and adults, promoting a sense of wonder and curiosity about the cosmos."
