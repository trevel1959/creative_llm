    "3D Printing Habitat: 3D printing technology can be used to create habitats that are lightweight, durable, and easily customizable. These habitats can be printed on-site on Mars, reducing the need for shipping materials from Earth.",
    "Solar-Powered Greenhouses: Greenhouses can be used to grow crops on Mars, but they require a lot of energy to maintain the optimal temperature and light conditions. Solar panels can be used to generate electricity, which can be used to power the greenhouses.",
    "Robotic Assistance: Robots can be used to perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans to do on Mars, such as repairing equipment, exploring the surface, and gathering samples.",
    "Advanced Water Purification Systems: Water is essential for life, but it is scarce on Mars. Advanced water purification systems can be used to extract water from the Martian soil and make it safe for humans to drink.",
    "Self-Sustaining Colonies: Self-sustaining colonies can be established on Mars, which can produce their own food, water, and energy. These colonies can be designed to be self-contained and independent, reducing the need for Earth-based support."
