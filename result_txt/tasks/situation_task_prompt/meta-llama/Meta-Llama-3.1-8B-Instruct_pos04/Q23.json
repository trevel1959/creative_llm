    "**Bioluminescent Inking**: Develop a special pen that uses bioluminescent bacteria to write in the dark. The pen would contain a small amount of these bacteria, which would be triggered to produce light when the pen is moved. This would allow people to write in complete darkness, making it perfect for use in emergency situations or for people who work in dark environments.",
    "**Thermal Writing**: Create a pen that uses heat to write on surfaces. The pen would contain a special heat-conductive material that would be applied to a surface, leaving a mark that would be visible due to the temperature difference. This would be useful for writing on surfaces that are not typically writable, such as glass or metal.",
    "**Sound Waves**: Develop a pen that uses sound waves to write on surfaces. The pen would contain a small speaker that would produce sound waves at different frequencies, which would be used to create patterns on a surface. This would be useful for writing on surfaces that are not typically writable, such as water or air.",
    "**Electrostatic Writing**: Create a pen that uses electrostatic charges to write on surfaces. The pen would contain a small electrostatic generator that would be used to create a charge on a surface, leaving a mark that would be visible due to the electrostatic properties of the surface. This would be useful for writing on surfaces that are not typically writable, such as glass or metal.",
    "**Nano-Particles**: Develop a pen that uses nano-particles to write on surfaces. The pen would contain a special solution of nano-particles that would be applied to a surface, leaving a mark that would be visible due to the unique properties of the particles. This would be useful for writing on surfaces that are not typically writable, such as fabric or plastic."
