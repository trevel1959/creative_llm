    "Interactive Moon Landscape: Create an immersive and interactive experience that allows visitors to explore the surface of the moon. This could be achieved through a combination of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Visitors could walk on the moon's surface, collect virtual rocks and minerals, and even plant a virtual flag.",
    "Lunar Time Capsule: Create a time capsule that will be buried on the moon to be opened in the future. The capsule could contain a collection of artifacts and messages from people around the world, providing a glimpse into the lives of future generations. The capsule could also include a solar-powered clock that will continue to tick long after the last human has left the moon.",
    "Moon Hotel: Build a luxury hotel on the moon that will provide a unique and unforgettable experience for guests. The hotel could be designed to mimic the natural features of the moon, with craters and rock formations serving as the basis for the architecture. Guests could enjoy zero-gravity dining, moon-gazing from the hotel's observatory, and even take a moon buggy tour of the lunar surface.",
    "Lunar Garden: Create a sustainable and self-sufficient garden on the moon that will provide a habitat for a variety of lunar plants and animals. The garden could be powered by solar panels and use hydroponics to grow food, providing a source of fresh produce for both the garden's inhabitants and future lunar settlers. The garden could also serve as a symbol of cooperation and sustainability between different countries and cultures.",
    "Moon Museum: Establish a museum on the moon that will showcase the history and culture of human space exploration. The museum could feature artifacts and exhibits from past moon missions, as well as interactive displays and simulations that allow visitors to experience the thrill of space travel. The museum could also serve as a tribute to the pioneers of space exploration and a reminder of the importance of continued investment in space research and development."
