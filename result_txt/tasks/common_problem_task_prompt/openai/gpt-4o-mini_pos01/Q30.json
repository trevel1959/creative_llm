    "**Performance Optimization**: Mobile apps need to perform efficiently across a variety of devices and operating systems. If an app is slow to load or crashes frequently, users will likely abandon it. This can stem from poorly optimized code, excessive use of resources, or not accounting for different screen sizes and resolutions. Regular performance testing and optimization are essential to ensure a smooth user experience.",
    "**Security Vulnerabilities**: With increasing concerns over data privacy, ensuring the app is secure is paramount. Potential problems include data breaches, inadequate encryption, and insecure API connections. Developers must implement robust security measures, such as secure authentication methods and regular security audits, to protect user data and maintain trust.",
    "**Monetization Strategy Conflicts**: Choosing the right monetization strategy (e.g., ads, in-app purchases, subscriptions) can be challenging. If users feel overwhelmed by ads or find in-app purchases necessary to enjoy the app, it can lead to dissatisfaction. A balance must be struck between generating revenue and providing a positive user experience. Market research can help identify the most acceptable approach for the target audience.",
    "**Compatibility Issues**: The app must function correctly across various devices, operating systems, and screen sizes. Compatibility issues can arise from differences in hardware capabilities, software versions, or operating system updates. To address this, developers should conduct extensive testing on multiple devices and platforms to ensure a consistent experience.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the app's purpose, it may need to comply with various regulations (e.g., GDPR for data protection, COPPA for children's apps). Failure to comply can lead to legal issues, fines, or even removal from app stores. Developers must stay informed about relevant laws and incorporate compliance measures from the outset."
