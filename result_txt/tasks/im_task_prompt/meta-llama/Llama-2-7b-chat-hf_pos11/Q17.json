    "Washing machine with a built-in UV sanitizer: The washing machine of the future could incorporate a built-in UV sanitizer that uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can survive the washing process. This would provide an additional layer of hygiene and cleanliness, ensuring that your clothes are not only clean but also sanitized. The UV sanitizer could be powered by a separate electric coil or through the main motor, and could be activated with a simple button press or through a smartphone app.",
    "Self-cleaning washing machine: Imagine a washing machine that can clean itself! This innovative design would feature a self-cleaning mechanism that uses a combination of water jets and rotating brushes to remove dirt and debris from the interior of the machine. The self-cleaning mechanism could be activated after each use, or on a schedule set through a smartphone app. This would not only save time but also reduce the need for manual cleaning, making the washing machine more convenient and efficient.",
    "Smart washing machine with AI-powered fabric recognition: The next-generation washing machine could be equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) technology that recognizes the fabric type of the clothes being washed. This would allow the machine to adjust the wash cycle, water temperature, and detergent dosage accordingly, ensuring that your clothes are cleaned and cared for in the best possible way. For example, the machine could recognize when you are washing delicate silk or wool and adjust the water temperature accordingly, preventing damage to the fabric.",
    "Solar-powered washing machine: In a move towards sustainability, a solar-powered washing machine could harness the power of the sun to generate electricity and operate the machine. This would eliminate the need for traditional electricity and reduce the machine's carbon footprint. The solar panels could be integrated into the machine's design, providing a sleek and modern look while also providing a sustainable solution for cleaning your clothes.",
