    "**Shelter Construction**: Building a safe and comfortable shelter is crucial for protection against the elements. Without proper knowledge of construction techniques, survivors may face exposure to harsh weather, which can lead to hypothermia or heat-related illnesses. An innovative approach could be to utilize natural materials such as palm fronds, driftwood, and stones to create a sturdy, insulated shelter, while also incorporating camouflage to avoid detection by potential rescuers or predators.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: Ensuring visibility for rescue is essential, but survivors may lack tools or materials to create a noticeable signal. They could face challenges in attracting attention due to their remote location. A creative solution would be to create large symbols or messages on the beach using rocks, logs, or even sand patterns, while also using reflective materials like shiny shells or glass to catch the sun's rays during the day.",
    "**Mental Health Struggles**: Isolation on a deserted island can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and despair. The psychological toll of survival can be as challenging as the physical demands. To combat this, survivors could establish a daily routine that includes activities like journaling, meditation, or even creating art with natural materials found on the island, which can help maintain a positive mindset and foster a sense of purpose.",
    "**Wildlife Encounters**: The presence of wildlife can pose threats, from aggressive animals to the risk of disease from insects. Survivors may not be equipped to handle such encounters. A proactive approach could involve learning to recognize animal tracks and signs, allowing them to avoid dangerous areas, while also creating a natural insect repellent using local plants to reduce the risk of bites and stings.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: Without a compass or map, survivors may struggle to orient themselves and explore the island safely. This could lead to disorientation or accidental injuries. To address this, they could use natural landmarks, the position of the sun, and the stars at night to create a mental map of their surroundings, while also marking safe paths with stones or branches to avoid getting lost."
