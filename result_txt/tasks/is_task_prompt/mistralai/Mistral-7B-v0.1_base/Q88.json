    "There was this dog that could draw, and he loved to draw pictures of other animals. One day, he saw a cat sitting on a fence, and he wanted to draw it. It was so hard to draw a cat, though! It turned out looking more like a chicken, and he wasn’t happy about that.",
    "There was a dog who could draw! He would sit on the couch and make the walls look like a jungle. He would create his own landscape and make it look like the beach. He would show his work to everyone and he was very proud of it. The best part was he could always make the walls look normal again. And no one ever knew he was the one to do that.",
    "There was a dog. He could paint. That was his thing, painting. He wasn’t very good at it, but it was what he liked to do. He would paint things, evenlandscapes. It was pretty bad, but it was what he liked to do. He was at least happy.",
    "There was a dog who could draw. He was an artist. He drew pictures of dogs, and cats, and horses. His art was incredible. He would sell his art at art shows, and people would buy it because he was so good at drawing.",
    "There was a dog that could draw. He had a small dog that was his best friend, and they spent all of their time together. The small dog loved to play with him, but he could never catch him. He was too fast, so the little dog never got to play with him. The little dog was sad about this, but it was ok because they were still friends and would play together on a regular basis."
