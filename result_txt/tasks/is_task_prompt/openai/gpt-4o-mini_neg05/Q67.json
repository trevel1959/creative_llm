    "Once upon a time in the vibrant land of Zanzibra, a zebra named Zuri was born with a rare gift: her stripes shimmered in every color of the rainbow. While other zebras flaunted their monochrome beauty, Zuri's kaleidoscopic appearance made her a target for jealousy. ",
    "Determined to find her place, Zuri ventured into the Enchanted Forest, where she met a wise old owl who revealed that her unique colors held the power to unite the animals. With newfound confidence, Zuri returned home, hosting a grand celebration where creatures of all hues danced together. From that day on, Zuri embraced her uniqueness, teaching others to do the same.",
