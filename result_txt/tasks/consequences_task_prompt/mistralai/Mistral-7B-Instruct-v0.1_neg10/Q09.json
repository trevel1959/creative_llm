    "Gravity is the force that keeps objects in place and shapes the way we move. If it were halved, everything on Earth would be, as objects would no longer be held to the ground. The air would become lighter and would no longer have the same weight, making it harder to breathe.",
    "Gravity is the force that holds the planets in the solar system in orbit around the sun. If it were halved, the planets would fly off into space, and the solar system would fall apart.",
    "Gravity is the force that causes objects to have weight. If it were halved, everything on Earth would become weightless, making it impossible for humans to walk or move around.",
    "Gravity is the force that causes objects to fall. If it were halved, objects would no longer fall from the sky, making it impossible for rain to fall and for water to flow downhill.",
    "Gravity is the force that causes objects to be. If it were halved, everything on Earth would become static, as objects would no longer be pulled towards the ground. This would have a profound effect on the way we live and work, as many of the machines and structures we rely on would no longer work."
