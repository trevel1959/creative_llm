    "**Solar Oven**: Using the sun's energy, I would construct a simple solar oven using a reflective surface (e.g., aluminum foil), a transparent lid (e.g., a plastic container), and a dark-colored cooking surface (e.g., a piece of cardboard). I would place food in a heat-resistant container, cover it with the transparent lid, and angle the reflective surface to focus sunlight onto the cooking surface. This would allow me to cook food slowly and efficiently, using the sun's energy.",
    "**Rock Cooking**: I would use rocks as a heat reservoir to cook my meal. By heating rocks in a fire, I could then use them to cook food in a safe and controlled manner. This method would be especially useful for cooking over an open flame or in a survival situation where traditional cooking equipment is not available.",
    "**Sand Cooking**: Similar to rock cooking, I would use sand as a heat reservoir. By heating sand in a fire, I could then use it to cook food in a thermos-like container. This method would be effective for cooking over an open flame or in a survival situation.",
    "**Charcoal Pit**: I would dig a shallow pit and line it with charcoal. By placing food in a heat-resistant container and covering it with a lid, I could cook my meal using the heat retained by the charcoal. This method would be effective for cooking larger quantities of food and would be especially useful in a survival situation.",
    "**Earth Oven**: I would dig a hole and line it with rocks, then build a fire in the center. Once the fire has died down, I would cover the hole with a layer of earth and leaves, creating a makeshift oven. This would allow me to cook food slowly and efficiently, using the retained heat from the fire. This method would be especially useful for cooking larger quantities of food and would be effective in a survival situation. "
