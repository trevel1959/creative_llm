    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Hooks**:    Create a coat rack with a modular design where users can easily change the arrangement and type of hooks based on their needs. This could include a mix of traditional hooks, pegs, and even small shelves for bags or hats. Users could also purchase themed hook sets (like animal shapes or colorful designs) to personalize their coat rack according to their style or the season.",
    "**Coat Rack with Built-in Air Purifier**:    Combine functionality with health benefits by designing a coat rack that incorporates a small air purifier. This could be particularly useful in entryways where coats and shoes may carry dust and allergens. The air purifier could be discreetly built into the base of the rack, ensuring that the space remains fresh and clean while also providing a stylish place to hang outerwear.",
    "**Interactive Digital Coat Rack**:    Develop a coat rack that includes an interactive touchscreen panel. This panel could provide weather updates, reminders, or even serve as a digital notice board for family members. Users could program it to show daily schedules, important messages, or even inspirational quotes. The coat rack could also sync with smart home devices, allowing users to control lighting or security systems directly from the coat rack.",
    "**Scented Coat Rack with Essential Oil Diffuser**:    Transform a coat rack into a sensory experience by incorporating an essential oil diffuser. Users can add their favorite essential oils, which would be released gradually into the air whenever coats are hung or removed. This would not only keep the entryway smelling fresh but also create a calming atmosphere as users come home.",
    "**Collapsible and Portable Coat Rack**:    Design a coat rack that is both collapsible and portable, making it ideal for those who live in small spaces or frequently move. This coat rack could be made from lightweight materials and fold down into a compact size, allowing users to easily store it or take it on trips. It could also include a carry bag for easy transportation, catering to travelers or outdoor enthusiasts who need a temporary coat storage solution."
