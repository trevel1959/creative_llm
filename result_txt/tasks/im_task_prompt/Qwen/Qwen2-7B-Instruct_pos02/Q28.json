    "**Bicycle Helmet with Built-in Lighting System**: Design a bicycle helmet that includes a lighting system which can be activated through a smartphone app. The helmet could have LED lights on the front and back, allowing cyclists to customize their lighting pattern to increase visibility in low-light conditions or while riding in foggy weather. This idea not only enhances safety but also adds a personal touch to the helmet design, making it stand out.",
    "**Customizable Bicycle Helmets**: Develop a range of bicycle helmets that come with interchangeable panels or stickers that allow users to customize the appearance of their helmet according to their style preferences or team colors. This idea could tap into the market's growing interest in personalization and customization. It would also appeal to a wide audience, including casual riders, commuters, and even professional athletes.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Built-in Audio System**: Integrate a Bluetooth-enabled audio system into the helmet, allowing cyclists to listen to music, podcasts, or receive voice-guided navigation instructions without having to wear earphones. This would provide an immersive experience for long-distance rides and could be particularly appealing to cyclists who enjoy outdoor activities and listening to content on-the-go.",
    "**Ergonomic and Comfort-Focused Helmet**: Design a bicycle helmet that prioritizes comfort by incorporating advanced materials and innovative cushioning techniques. This could include memory foam padding, adjustable straps, and breathable mesh linings to ensure that the helmet fits comfortably and securely on various head sizes and shapes. Such a helmet would be particularly attractive to long-distance cyclists and commuters who might wear their helmets for extended periods.",
    "**Recyclable and Eco-friendly Bicycle Helmets**: Create a line of bicycle helmets made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastic or plant-based fibers. These helmets would not only be eco-friendly but also appeal to consumers concerned about environmental impact. They could feature unique designs inspired by nature or eco-conscious themes, making them both functional and stylish. This approach could position your brand as environmentally responsible and forward-thinking in the cycling industry."
