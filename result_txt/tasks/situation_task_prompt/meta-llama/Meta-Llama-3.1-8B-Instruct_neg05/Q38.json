    "**Soap-Free Soap Alternative**: Develop a plant-based, biodegradable paste made from natural ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and essential oils. This paste could be used for cleaning hands, surfaces, and even washing clothes. The unique blend of ingredients would provide a similar cleansing effect to traditional soap without the harsh chemicals.",
    "**Water Purification Systems**: Create portable, low-cost water purification systems that use natural materials like sand, charcoal, and plants to remove impurities from water. This would allow people to access clean drinking water even in areas where traditional water treatment facilities are unavailable.",
