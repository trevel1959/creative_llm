    "**A Library Book** - I would choose an old library book that's been collecting dust on the shelf for years. It would come to life as a magical librarian, capable of sharing its vast knowledge and wisdom with anyone who reads it. This idea is creative because it combines the timeless value of books with the modern concept of artificial intelligence, creating a personalized learning experience.",
    "**A Desk** - An ordinary desk would be transformed into a personal assistant that can anticipate your needs based on your daily habits. It would be equipped with sensors and AI capabilities to organize your work space, provide reminders, and even help with tasks like making appointments or managing your schedule. This idea is original as it takes a common household item and turns it into a highly functional and intelligent helper.",
    "**A Flower Pot** - The idea here is to bring a flower pot to life as a living garden center. It would grow different types of plants automatically, adapting to various conditions such as sunlight, water, and temperature. It would also offer gardening advice and tips, making it perfect for both experienced and novice gardeners. This concept is unique because it merges the art of gardening with smart home technology.",
    "**A Street Lamp** - A street lamp could come to life as a community hub, offering information about local events, weather updates, and public services.

This idea is innovative as it turns a mundane street fixture into a dynamic social and informational resource.",
