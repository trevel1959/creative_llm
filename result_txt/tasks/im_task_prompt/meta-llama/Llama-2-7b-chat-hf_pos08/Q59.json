    "Design a Bluetooth speaker that doubles as a plant pot. The speaker's outer casing is made of biodegradable materials, and it incorporates a built-in water reservoir for the plant's growth. When the user plays music through the speaker, the water reservoir is irrigated, providing a self-sustaining ecosystem for the plant.",
    "Develop a smart Bluetooth speaker that uses artificial intelligence to adapt to the user's music preferences. The speaker is equipped with a microphone that listens to the user's music choices and adjusts the sound quality accordingly. The more the user listens to music through the speaker, the more personalized the sound becomes.",
    "Create a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be powered by the sun. The speaker's solar panels are integrated into its design, allowing it to charge wirelessly when exposed to sunlight. This eliminates the need for a power cord, making it ideal for outdoor use.",
    "Design a Bluetooth speaker that doubles as a meditation aid. The speaker's inner casing is designed with a series of calming colors and patterns, such as ocean waves or forest landscapes, to help the user relax and focus. The speaker also includes a guided meditation feature, which provides the user with a soothing voice to guide them through their meditation practice.",
    "Develop a Bluetooth speaker that incorporates augmented reality technology. The speaker's display screen projects a virtual environment that enhances the user's listening experience. For example, the speaker could display lyrics to the music being played, or provide additional information about the artist or song. The user can also use the speaker to access virtual reality content, such as 3D visuals or immersive audio experiences."
