    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The ability to clone extinct animals would spark intense ethical debates. Questions surrounding the welfare of cloned animals, their right to exist, and the moral implications of \"playing God\" would arise. Society would need to grapple with whether it is ethical to resurrect species that may not thrive in today's environment or if we should focus on conserving existing endangered species instead.",
    "**Biodiversity Conservation**: Cloning extinct species could provide a second chance for biodiversity. By reintroducing these species, we could enhance genetic diversity within ecosystems, which is crucial for resilience against diseases and environmental changes. However, this could also lead to competition with current species, disrupting existing ecosystems and potentially causing harm to currently thriving species.",
    "**Scientific Advancements**: The technology and knowledge gained from cloning extinct animals could advance genetic research and biotechnology. This could lead to breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and conservation efforts. For instance, understanding the genetics of extinct species might help scientists address genetic diseases in modern animals or even humans, leading to improved health outcomes.",
    "**Tourism and Economic Opportunities**: The revival of extinct species could create new avenues for ecotourism. Imagine wildlife parks featuring cloned mammoths or dodos, attracting tourists eager to witness these long-gone creatures. This could generate significant revenue for local economies and create jobs in conservation, research, and tourism sectors.",
    "**Impact on Conservation Priorities**: The focus on cloning extinct animals might divert resources and attention away from current conservation efforts. With the allure of bringing back the past, funding and support might shift away from protecting endangered species that are still at risk of extinction. This could exacerbate the current biodiversity crisis if resources are not managed wisely."
