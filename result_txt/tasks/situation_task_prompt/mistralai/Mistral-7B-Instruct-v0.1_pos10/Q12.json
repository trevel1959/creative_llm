    "Solar Heating: Solar panels can be installed on the roof or walls of the house to capture the sun's energy and convert it into heat. This is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can beed to provide heat to the house.",
    "Geothermal Heating: Geothermal heating systems use the earth's natural temperature to heat the house. This is done by drilling holes in the ground and installing pipes to extract the heat from the earth. This is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be useded to provide heat to the house.",
    "Biomass Heating: Biomass heating systems use organic materials such as wood, agricultural waste, or pellets to generate heat. This is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used to provide heat to the house.",
    "Radiant Heating: Radiant heating systems use a network of pipes to circulate hot water or a low-temperature antifreeze solution throughout the house. This system heats the floors, walls, and ceilings, providinged heat to the house.",
    "Heat Pumps: Heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat from one place to another. In this case, a heat pump can be used to extract heat from the air outside the house and use it to heat the house. This is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used to provide heat to the house."
