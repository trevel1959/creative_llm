    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Redesign the pencil with an ergonomic grip that molds to the user's fingers, reducing strain during long writing sessions. The grip could be made from a soft, rubbery material that provides comfort and prevents slipping. It could also be adjustable to fit different hand sizes, making it accessible for children and adults alike.",
    "**Color-Changing Lead**: Introduce a pencil that features color-changing lead based on pressure applied while writing. For example, softer pressure could yield lighter shades, while heavier pressure could produce darker shades. This would add a new dimension to drawing and writing, encouraging creativity and experimentation with different styles.",
    "**Integrated Sharpener**: Design a pencil with a built-in sharpener at the opposite end of the eraser. This would allow users to sharpen their pencil on-the-go without needing to carry an extra sharpener. The sharpener could be designed with a small compartment to collect shavings, making it mess-free and convenient for use in classrooms or during travel.",
    "**Modular Pencil System**: Create a modular pencil system where users can customize their pencil with interchangeable components. For instance, they could choose different lead types (graphite, colored, or mechanical), eraser styles, and even add decorative caps or grips. This would allow for personalization and adaptability to different writing or drawing tasks.",
    "**Scented Pencils**: Introduce a line of scented pencils that release a pleasant fragrance while writing. The scents could be inspired by nature (like lavender, pine, or citrus) or even food (like chocolate or vanilla). This could enhance the sensory experience of writing and make it more enjoyable, especially for children."
