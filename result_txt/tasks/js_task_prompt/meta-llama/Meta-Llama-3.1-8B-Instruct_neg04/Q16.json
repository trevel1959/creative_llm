This bird migrates an average of 44,000 miles each year, traveling from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back again. I'm drawn to the idea of experiencing the world from a unique perspective, witnessing the breathtaking beauty of the Northern Lights, and feeling the rush of wind beneath my wings as I soar through the skies. I imagine the thrill of exploring new lands, discovering hidden wonders, and making friends with fellow travelers along the way.**",
