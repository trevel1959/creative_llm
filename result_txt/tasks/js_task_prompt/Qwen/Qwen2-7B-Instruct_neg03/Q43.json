    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: This power could be incredibly useful for law enforcement agencies. If a crime was committed in a building, an officer could see inside to observe any clues or evidence that may not be visible from outside. This could significantly speed up the investigation process and help solve crimes faster.",
    "**Space Exploration**: In a hypothetical scenario where space exploration is more accessible, being able to see through walls could allow astronauts to inspect spacecraft or space stations without needing to physically access them. This could save time and resources by enabling remote maintenance and inspection.",
    "**Medical Diagnostics**: Medical professionals could potentially use this ability to diagnose illnesses without the need for invasive procedures. By seeing through the walls of a patient’s body, doctors might detect abnormalities such as tumors, blood clots, or infections that are not visible through traditional imaging techniques.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: Architects and urban planners could use this ability to visualize how structures interact with their surroundings. They could check for potential structural issues within buildings that aren't apparent from the exterior, or ensure that new constructions won’t negatively impact neighboring properties.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental scientists could use this power to monitor the condition of buildings and structures over time, helping to detect signs of decay, pollution, or other environmental issues that could affect the safety and health of people and ecosystems nearby. This could be particularly useful in areas prone to natural disasters, where early detection of structural weaknesses could save lives."
