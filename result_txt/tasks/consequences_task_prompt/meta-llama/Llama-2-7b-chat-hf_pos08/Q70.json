    "Time dilation: If the speed of light were reduced by half, time would appear to slow down for objects moving at that speed. This means that for an observer on Earth, a light year away would appear to be longer than it currently is, taking longer to travel.",
    "Gravity manipulation: A reduction in the speed of light would affect the strength of gravity. Objects with mass would experience stronger gravitational pulls, causing them to attract more matter and exert a greater gravitational force on their surroundings.",
    "Energy efficiency: A slower speed of light would result in less energy being transmitted over long distances. This could lead to more efficient energy transmission technologies, as scientists and engineers would be forced to find new ways to transmit energy without relying on the speed of light.",
    "New forms of propulsion: With a slower speed of light, new forms of propulsion could emerge that rely on other forms of energy transmission. For example, a slower speed of light could make it possible for spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light by using exotic forms of energy, such as those found in black holes or other areas of high energy density.",
    "Changes in the fabric of space-time: A reduction in the speed of light could have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of the fabric of space-time. It could potentially lead to new theories about the nature of space and time, and could even challenge our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics."
