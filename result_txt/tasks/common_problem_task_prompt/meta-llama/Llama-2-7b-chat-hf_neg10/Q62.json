    "Create a scavenger hunt for your dog to explore new surroundings and stimulate their senses. Hide treats, toys, or other fun objects for them to find, and observe how they interact with their environment.",
    "Incorporate agility training into your daily routine. Set up a mini obstacle course in your backyard or living room, using items like tunnels, cones, and jumps. This will not only challenge your dog physically but also mentally, as they learn to navigate the course.",
    "Teach your dog to perform tricks in exchange for treats. Start with simple tricks like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"shake,\" and gradually progress to more complex ones like \"play dead\" or \"roll over.\" This will not only keep your dog engaged but also strengthen your bond with them.",
    "Create a \"doggy day spa\" at home. Give your dog a relaxing bath, trim their nails, and brush their coat to a silky smooth finish. You can even create a DIY dog facial using ingredients like olive oil and coconut oil to help soothe and moisturize their skin.",
    "Host a \"doggy playdate\" with other dogs in your neighborhood or online. Organize a virtual playdate or meetup with other dog owners, and let your dogs play and socialize with each other while you supervise. This will help reduce boredom and provide mental stimulation for your dog."
