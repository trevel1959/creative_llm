    "**The Haunted Mansion on Wheels**: This idea involves creating a haunted attraction that moves around, much like the title suggests. The house could be a giant RV or a converted trailer that travels to different cities, offering an eerie and unique experience. It could have interactive elements where the \"movable\" feature becomes part of the horror, for example, the house might suddenly stop in a remote area, trapping visitors inside, or it could unexpectedly speed up, causing chaos among the guests. ",
    "**The Living Furniture**: In this concept, the house is not just a moving structure but each piece of furniture within the house is alive and mobile. They could move autonomously, rearranging themselves into different configurations, creating unexpected spaces and obstacles. This idea plays on the theme of being out of one's depth by having characters constantly surprised and disoriented by the unpredictable movements of their surroundings.",
    "**The Transforming House**: This idea focuses on a house that changes its shape and layout as the story progresses. The rooms could transform based on the actions or decisions of the characters, leading them into different scenarios and challenges. This could create a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability, forcing the characters to adapt and strategize as they go along.",
    "**The Interactive Mystery**: In this scenario, the house itself acts as a central character with a hidden history or mystery to solve. The house could be designed with hidden passages, secret rooms, and puzzles that the characters must solve to uncover its secrets. As they progress through the house, they might encounter traps, ghosts, or other supernatural entities, all connected to the mystery at the heart of the house.",
    "**The House of Dystopian Future**: This idea takes the concept further by setting the story in a future where the house represents a dystopian society. The house could be self-sustaining, with advanced technology that controls every aspect of life within its walls. However, this technology might be misused or malfunction, leading to chaos and danger for those trapped inside. Characters could explore the consequences of a world run by machines and technology, highlighting themes of control, rebellion, and survival."
