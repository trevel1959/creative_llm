    "Control a drone with my mind: I would love to explore the world from up high and capture breathtaking aerial footage of landscapes, cities, and natural wonders. I could use my mind to control the drone's movements, zooming in and out, and adjusting the camera angle to capture the perfect shot. I could also use this ability to conduct aerial surveys, monitor wildlife populations, or even search for missing persons.",
    "Operate a prosthetic limb with my mind: With this ability, I could control a prosthetic limb with my thoughts, allowing me to perform everyday tasks with greater ease and precision. I could use my mind to move the limb, open doors, pick up objects, and even type on a keyboard. This would greatly improve the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities, allowing them to live more independently and participate in activities they may have previously been unable to do.",
    "Control a robot with my mind: I would love to have the ability to control a robot with my mind, allowing me to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans to do. I could use my mind to command the robot to move around, pick up objects, and even perform surgeries. This would be especially useful in search and rescue missions, where robots could be used to navigate through rubble and debris to find survivors.",
    "Manipulate digital objects with my mind: With this ability, I could control digital objects, such as 3D models or virtual reality environments, with my mind. I could use my thoughts to rotate, scale, and move objects, creating complex designs and structures. This would be a game-changer for industries such as architecture, engineering, and product design, where virtual prototyping is becoming increasingly important.",
    "Control a self-driving car with my mind: I would love to have the ability to control a self-driving car with my mind, allowing me to travel without the need for a steering wheel or pedals. I could use my mind to navigate through traffic, adjust the car's speed, and even change lanes. This would be especially useful for individuals with disabilities or injuries that prevent them from driving, as well as for those who are simply too busy or tired to drive."
