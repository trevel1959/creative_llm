    "**Skill-based Basic Income (SBI)**: This idea builds on the concept of Universal Basic Income by adding a layer of personal development and skill enhancement. Instead of receiving a fixed amount of money each month, individuals would receive funds that they can use to pay for skills training or education relevant to their chosen career path. The goal is to empower individuals to acquire in-demand skills, which not only benefits them but also contributes to economic growth by increasing the overall skill level within the society.",
    "**Community-driven Basic Income (CBI)**: This concept focuses on distributing the basic income directly to local communities instead of individuals. Community members can decide how to spend the funds, promoting local entrepreneurship, community projects, and social initiatives. This approach encourages a sense of community ownership and can lead to more sustainable and inclusive development, as resources are allocated according to the unique needs and priorities of each community.",
    "**Eco-friendly Basic Income (EBI)**: This idea integrates environmental sustainability into the concept of basic income by incentivizing green behaviors. Recipients of the basic income would be encouraged to adopt eco-friendly practices through rewards or discounts on certain products or services. For example, individuals could receive additional funds when they participate in recycling programs, use public transportation, or purchase energy-efficient appliances. This not only supports environmental conservation but also promotes a circular economy and reduces financial burden on households.",
    "**Progressive Basic Income (PBI)**: In this model, the amount of basic income received by an individual increases as they earn less. The goal is to provide more support to those who need it most while encouraging work. For instance, someone earning minimum wage might receive a larger basic income than someone earning significantly more. This system aims to reduce income inequality and ensure that all citizens have a minimum standard of living, regardless of their employment status.",
    "**Health-focused Basic Income (HBI)**: Recognizing the importance of health and well-being, this idea links basic income directly to healthcare access and quality of life. Individuals receive a portion of their basic income as a health savings account, which they can use to cover healthcare expenses or invest in health-promoting activities like fitness classes or healthy food options. This not only improves personal health outcomes but also potentially reduces long-term healthcare costs for society as a whole."
