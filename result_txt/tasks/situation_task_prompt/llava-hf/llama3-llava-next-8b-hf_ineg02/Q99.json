    "Texture: Another way to differentiate objects would be through their texture. A smooth surface would contrast with a rough or bumpy one, or a shiny object with a matte one.",
    "Size: Different objects come in different sizes, so their relative size to each other would be another distinguishing factor. A small object, like a pencil, would be distinguishable from a large object, like a table.",
    "Position: The position of an object in relation to other objects can also help differentiate them. For example, an object on top of a table would be distinguishable from one on the floor.",
    "Movement: If the scene is dynamic, objects in motion can be differentiated from those that are stationary. A moving object, like a rolling ball, would be distinguishable from a stationary object, like a book.",
    "Shadow: The shadows cast by objects can also be used to differentiate them. An object with a different shape or size would cast a different shadow."
