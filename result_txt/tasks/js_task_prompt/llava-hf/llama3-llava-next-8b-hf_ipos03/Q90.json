    "Improved Circulatory System: A more efficient circulatory system would be achieved by redesigning the heart and blood vessels. The heart could be made larger to accommodate more blood and pump it more efficiently. Blood vessels could be made thicker and more flexible, allowing for better regulation of blood pressure and flow.",
    "Enhanced Musculoskeletal System: A redesign of the human body would focus on creating a more efficient and durable musculoskeletal system. Bones could be made stronger and lighter, and joints could be made more flexible and stable. Muscles could be designed for better balance and control, allowing for increased agility and strength.",
    "Improved Nervous System: A redesign of the human body would prioritize the nervous system to improve communication between the brain and the body. The brain could be made larger to accommodate more neurons and improve cognitive function. The nervous system could be designed with more efficient pathways for faster response times and better coordination.",
    "Enhanced Digestive System: A redesign of the human body would focus on creating a more efficient digestive system. The stomach could be made larger and more muscular, allowing for better digestion and nutrient absorption. The intestines could be made more efficient for waste removal, and the liver could be made larger to handle increased nutrient processing.",
    "Improved Immune System: A redesign of the human body would prioritize the immune system to improve the body's ability to fight off infections and diseases. The immune system could be made more efficient and robust, with a stronger and more responsive immune response. The lymphatic system could be made more effective at filtering out toxins and delivering immune cells to the body."
