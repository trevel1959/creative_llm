    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing sufficient funding for the park's establishment and ongoing maintenance can be a significant challenge. This could lead to inadequate resources for staff, infrastructure, and conservation programs. To mitigate this issue, the park could explore multiple funding avenues, such as grants, partnerships with local businesses, crowdfunding campaigns, and establishing a membership program that offers exclusive benefits to supporters.",
    "**Community Involvement and Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging the local community and stakeholders in the conservation efforts is crucial, but it can also be a source of conflict. Some community members may have differing opinions on land use or conservation priorities. To address this, the park could host regular community forums and workshops that allow for open dialogue, ensuring that local voices are heard and incorporated into the park's management plan.",
    "**Visitor Management and Impact**: With the establishment of a nature conservation park, there is a risk of increased foot traffic leading to environmental degradation, such as soil erosion, littering, and disturbance to wildlife. To combat this, the park could implement visitor management strategies, including designated trails, educational signage about responsible behavior, and a system for limiting the number of visitors during peak times.",
    "**Climate Change Resilience**: The impacts of climate change pose a significant threat to the ecosystems within the conservation park. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can disrupt habitats and species. To build resilience, the park could develop adaptive management strategies that focus on restoring native ecosystems, enhancing habitat connectivity, and implementing conservation practices that consider future climate scenarios.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Establishing a nature conservation park often involves navigating a complex web of legal and regulatory requirements. Issues such as land ownership disputes, zoning laws, and compliance with environmental regulations can create significant hurdles. To streamline this process, the park could work closely with legal experts and government agencies to ensure all necessary permits are obtained and regulations are met from the outset."
