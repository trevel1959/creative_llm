    "Creating a New Rhythm: Without the cue of darkness, people would need to find a new way to signal their body that it's time to sleep. This could be done through a combination of regular sleep schedules, exposure to bright light during the day, and other environmental cues.",
    "Developing a Sleeping Pill: Scientists could develop a pill that can induce sleep without the need for darkness. The pill could work by blocking the production of wakefulness-promoting chemicals in the brain or by increasing the production of sleep-inducing chemicals.",
    "Using Virtual Reality to Create Night-time: People could use virtual reality technology to create a simulated night-time environment, complete with darkness and quiet, to help them sleep. This could be especially useful for people who work night shifts or live in areas with little natural darkness.",
    "Developing a Sleeping Pod: A sleeping pod could be developed that can create a dark and cool environment for sleep, regardless of the time of day. This pod could be used in a variety of settings, including homes, offices, and public spaces.",
    "Using Noise-Canceling Technology: People could use noise-canceling technology to create a quiet environment for sleep, even during the day. This could be especially useful for people who live in noisy environments or have difficulty sleeping in bright light."
