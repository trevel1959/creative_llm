    "**Multi-Speed Settings**: Create a control panel with multiple speed settings for precise blending control. This would be particularly useful for tasks like making sauces or soups, where different speeds are required at different stages.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mode**: Incorporate a self-cleaning function that uses a built-in cleaning cycle, utilizing the blades and the power of the motor to clean the blender after use. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and increase the overall convenience of the appliance.",
    "**Touch Controls**: Design a touch interface that allows for easy control of the blender's functions without the need for a traditional dial or buttons. This would make the blender more user-friendly, especially for those with limited mobility or dexterity.",
    "**Built-in Scale**: Develop a built-in scale that can measure ingredients as they are added to the blender. This would make precise recipe measurements more convenient and help reduce the chances of over- or under-blending.",
    "**Sound-Off Mode**: Implement a sound-off mode that reduces the noise generated by the blender. This would be particularly useful for those who want to blend without disturbing others or for use in noise-sensitive environments."
