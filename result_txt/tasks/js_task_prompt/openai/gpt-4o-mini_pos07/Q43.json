    "**Enhanced Home Security**: Homeowners could use this ability to monitor their property and ensure safety. They could easily spot intruders or suspicious activities happening inside or around their home without the need for cameras or alarms. This would allow for quicker responses to potential threats and provide peace of mind, knowing that they can always keep an eye on their surroundings. Furthermore, it could help in identifying any maintenance issues within the walls, such as leaks or pest infestations, before they escalate into larger problems.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: In situations of conflict, such as domestic disputes or negotiations, being able to see through walls could provide clarity and understanding. For example, mediators could use this ability to witness the interactions between parties in real-time, gaining insights into their emotional states and intentions. This could lead to more effective resolutions, as mediators would have a better understanding of the dynamics at play, allowing them to guide discussions towards constructive outcomes.",
    "**Historical Exploration**: Archaeologists and historians could utilize this power to explore ancient ruins or historical sites without disturbing the ground. By seeing through the layers of earth and stone, they could identify the layout of ancient structures, burial sites, or artifacts that are yet to be discovered. This non-invasive approach would preserve the integrity of the sites while providing valuable information about past civilizations, leading to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of history.",
    "**Healthcare Advancements**: Medical professionals could leverage this ability to improve patient care. Imagine doctors being able to see through a patient's skin to diagnose issues without invasive procedures like MRIs or CT scans. This could lead to faster diagnoses, reduced healthcare costs, and improved patient outcomes. Surgeons could also use this power to plan complex operations more effectively, visualizing the anatomy in real-time and reducing the risk of complications during surgery.",
    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: First responders, such as firefighters and paramedics, could greatly benefit from this power during emergencies. They could assess situations inside buildings during fires or natural disasters without entering hazardous environments. This would allow them to identify victims, navigate through smoke or debris, and plan their rescue operations more efficiently, ultimately saving lives and reducing the risk to their own safety."
