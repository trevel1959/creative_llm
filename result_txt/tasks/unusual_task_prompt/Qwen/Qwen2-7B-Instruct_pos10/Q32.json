    "**Customized Hairbrushes for Different Hair Types:** Design a series of hairbrushes that cater to different hair types, from fine to thick, curly to straight. Each brush would have bristles specifically tailored to its target hair type, reducing breakage and enhancing hair health. For instance, brushes for curly hair might have soft, wide-toothed bristles to avoid frizz and maintain natural texture, while those for thick hair could have strong, spaced-out bristles to effectively detangle without pulling.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush:** Create a hairbrush that automatically cleans itself after each use. This could be achieved through a small water reservoir inside the handle that sprays a gentle cleaning solution onto the bristles as you brush. After use, a small motor inside the handle rotates the bristles to remove all the dirt and debris, ensuring the brush remains clean and hygienic.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush with Health Monitoring Features:** Develop a hairbrush that integrates health monitoring technology. It could measure the user's hair and scalp health based on factors like hair loss, dryness, or oiliness. By syncing with a mobile app, users can track their hair health over time and receive personalized recommendations for products or changes in their routine.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush with Biodegradable Materials:** Craft a hairbrush using biodegradable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or natural fibers. This not only reduces waste but also appeals to consumers who are environmentally conscious. Additionally, incorporate sustainable practices in the manufacturing process, like reducing energy usage or utilizing renewable energy sources.",
    "**Innovative Hairbrush with Heat Protection:** Design a hairbrush with a built-in heat protection feature. This could include an adjustable temperature control on the handle that prevents the brush from getting too hot, protecting hair from heat damage caused by excessive brushing. The brush could also come with a sensor that detects when it's too close to the scalp and adjusts the heat accordingly, ensuring a safe and comfortable brushing experience. "
