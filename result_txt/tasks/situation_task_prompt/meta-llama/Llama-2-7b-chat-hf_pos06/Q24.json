    "Artificial Intelligence-based Enhancement Devices: People with poor vision could use AI-powered enhancement devices, such as smart glasses or contact lenses, to improve their vision. These devices could use machine learning algorithms to learn the individual's visual patterns and preferences, providing them with a personalized visual experience. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Visualization Training Programs: People with poor vision could benefit from visualization training programs that help them develop their visual skills. These programs could include exercises and activities that help improve visual acuity, depth perception, and other visual abilities. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could be used to restore vision in people with poor vision. BCIs work by detecting electrical signals in the brain and using them to control a computer or other device. This technology could potentially be used to create a visual prosthetic that allows people with poor vision to see again. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Nanotechnology-based Treatments: Nanotechnology could be used to develop new treatments for poor vision. For example, nanoparticles could be used to deliver drugs to the retina, helping to restore vision. Additionally, nanotechnology could be used to create new types of contact lenses or glasses that provide better vision. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Virtual Reality-based Training: Virtual reality (VR) could be used to provide people with poor vision with a simulated visual environment that mimics the real world. This could help people with poor vision practice and improve their visual skills in a controlled environment. Confidence Score: 0.9"
