    "Inflatable Boat: Create an inflatable boat that can be easily transported and stored when not in use. The boat would be made of durable, puncture-resistant material and equipped with oars or a small motor for propulsion. When the bridges collapse, the inflatable boat would provide a safe and reliable means of crossing the river. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Raft: Design a raft made from salvaged materials such as wooden planks and inflatable tubes. The raft would be sturdy enough to support multiple people and would be able to navigate through rough waters. In the event of a bridge collapse, the raft could be used to cross the river safely. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Bungee Cords and Ropes: Develop a system of bungee cords and ropes that can be used to create a makeshift bridge. The bungee cords would be attached to the shore and the ropes would be used to connect the cords across the river. This would create a bouncy, yet stable bridge that could be used to cross the river. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Tarzan Swing: Create a Tarzan-style swing made from vines or ropes that can be used to cross the river. The swing would be suspended from a tree or cliff on one side of the river and would have a secure landing on the other side. This would allow people to swing across the river with the help of a safety harness. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Water Taxi: Develop a water taxi service that can transport people across the river in a safe and efficient manner. The water taxi would be powered by a small motor and would have a stable, enclosed cabin for passengers.
