    "**Space Station Origami**: Design a space station that doubles as a giant origami model. The station's modules would be made from a lightweight, high-strength material that can be folded and unfolded like paper. The station's shape would change depending on the mission requirements, allowing for efficient use of resources and minimizing waste. For example, during launch, the station would be folded compactly to reduce weight and volume, and then unfold to its full shape in orbit. This design would not only showcase human ingenuity but also inspire a new generation of engineers and artists.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Water Purification**: Develop a water purification system that uses a combination of nanotechnology and plant-based filtration methods to remove pollutants and contaminants from water. The system would be powered by solar energy and would be designed to be portable and affordable, making it accessible to communities in need. The system would also include a built-in monitoring system to track water quality and provide real-time data on the purification process.",
    "**Smart Cities for Wildlife**: Design a network of interconnected smart cities for urban wildlife, providing a safe and sustainable habitat for animals in urban areas. The cities would be equipped with advanced sensors and monitoring systems to track animal behavior, habitat health, and environmental factors. The cities would also include innovative waste management systems, green roofs, and integrated renewable energy sources to minimize the urban wildlife's carbon footprint.",
    "**Underwater Farming**: Develop an underwater farming system that uses hydroponics and aquaponics to grow a variety of crops and raise fish in a sustainable and efficient manner. The system would be designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to different aquatic environments. The system would also include advanced monitoring and control systems to optimize crop growth and minimize waste.",
    "**Invisible Bike Lanes**: Design a system of invisible bike lanes that use advanced LED technology and AI-powered navigation to create a safe and efficient cycling infrastructure. The system would be integrated with existing road infrastructure and would provide real-time data on traffic patterns, bike usage, and road conditions. The system would also include a warning system to alert drivers of approaching cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents."
