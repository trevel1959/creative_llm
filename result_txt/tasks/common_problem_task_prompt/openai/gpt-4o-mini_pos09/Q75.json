    "**Environmental Degradation**: Increased foot traffic can lead to soil erosion, plant damage, and habitat destruction. To combat this, park managers could develop designated trails, install boardwalks in sensitive areas, and promote \"Leave No Trace\" principles through signage and visitor education campaigns.",
    "**Invasive Species**: Non-native species can disrupt the local ecosystem, outcompeting native flora and fauna. Park management can establish monitoring programs to identify invasive species early and develop removal strategies, such as organized volunteer days for community members to help with removal efforts.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, which can limit maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. To tackle this, park managers could seek partnerships with local businesses for sponsorships, apply for grants focused on conservation, and engage in fundraising activities to bolster resources.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Emergency Response**: With a variety of outdoor activities available, ensuring visitor safety can be challenging. The park can implement regular safety drills, establish clear emergency protocols, and maintain well-trained staff to respond to incidents. Additionally, enhancing communication systems for emergency alerts can keep visitors informed.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting wildlife habitats, plant life, and weather patterns. Park management could develop adaptive management plans that focus on preserving biodiversity, restoring ecosystems, and enhancing resilience to climate impacts through research and conservation initiatives."
