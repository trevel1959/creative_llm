    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often come with hefty budgets, and it's easy for costs to spiral out of control. Unexpected expenses such as location changes, special effects enhancements, or extended shooting days can quickly add up. A solution would be to implement a strict budget management system with regular financial reviews, allowing for adjustments in real-time and prioritizing essential expenditures over non-critical ones.",
    "**Creative Differences**: Directors may face challenges when their vision clashes with producers, screenwriters, or studio executives. This can lead to significant changes in the script or even the overall direction of the film, potentially diluting the original concept. To address this, the director should establish clear communication channels and set up regular meetings to ensure that all parties are aligned on the creative vision from the outset.",
    "**Weather Disruptions**: Filming on location can be heavily impacted by unpredictable weather conditions, causing delays and requiring last-minute adjustments to the shooting schedule. To combat this, the production team could have contingency plans in place, such as alternative indoor locations or flexible shooting schedules that allow for quick changes in response to weather forecasts.",
    "**Safety and Health Concerns**: With large crews and elaborate stunts, ensuring the safety and health of everyone involved is paramount. Accidents can occur, leading to injuries or worse, which can halt production and result in legal repercussions. A comprehensive safety protocol should be established, including regular safety drills, hiring experienced stunt coordinators, and ensuring that all cast and crew are briefed on safety measures before filming begins.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: Blockbuster movies often come with high expectations from audiences and critics alike. Failing to meet these expectations can result in poor box office performance and negative reviews. To navigate this, the director could engage in audience testing with early screenings to gauge reactions and make necessary adjustments before the film's official release."
