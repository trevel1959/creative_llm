    "**Biometric Identification Luggage Tag**: Design a luggage tag that uses biometric technology, such as fingerprint scanning, to secure and identify the owner of the luggage. When the bag is checked in or retrieved, the user can scan their fingerprint to confirm ownership. This would enhance security and prevent baggage mix-ups at airports.",
    "**Interactive Digital Luggage Tag**: Create a digital luggage tag with an e-ink display that can be updated via a mobile app. Users can change their contact information, destination, or special handling instructions dynamically. The tag could also display a QR code that, when scanned, provides detailed information about the luggage, such as contents, travel itinerary, and emergency contact details.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Reusable Luggage Tag**: Develop a luggage tag made from sustainable materials that can be reused multiple times. The tag could feature a writable surface for easy customization, allowing travelers to erase and update their information as needed. This approach promotes sustainability and reduces waste from single-use tags.",
    "**Color-Coded and Patterned Luggage Tags**: Introduce a line of luggage tags with vibrant colors and unique patterns that help travelers easily identify their bags on a crowded baggage carousel. Users could choose tags that reflect their personal style or represent their travel destinations, making it both a practical and fashionable accessory.",
    "**Integrated RFID Chip for Airport Security**: Equip luggage tags with RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) chips that can be scanned at airport security checkpoints. This technology would streamline the check-in process, allowing security personnel to quickly identify the owner of the luggage and verify that it matches their travel documents, enhancing both security and efficiency."
