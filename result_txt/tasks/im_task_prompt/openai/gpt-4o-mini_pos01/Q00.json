    "**Ergonomic Grip and Adjustable Weight**: Design a pencil with an ergonomic grip that can be adjusted for comfort based on the user's hand size and writing style. Additionally, the pencil could have removable weights that can be added or removed to customize the balance and heft, catering to different preferences for writing feel, especially beneficial for those who write for extended periods.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Refillable Pencil**: Instead of traditional wooden pencils that create waste, introduce a refillable pencil made from biodegradable materials. The pencil could have a mechanism that allows users to replace the graphite core easily, reducing the need for disposal. It could also include a compartment for storing additional graphite leads, ensuring that users have a sustainable option for their writing needs.",
    "**Color-Changing Pencil**: Develop a pencil that changes color based on the pressure applied while writing. This could serve as a visual cue for users to adjust their grip or pressure, helping them improve their writing technique. The color change could also be used creatively for art projects, allowing artists to create dynamic effects by varying pressure.",
    "**Integrated Sharpener**: Design a pencil with a built-in sharpener at the end. This could be a twist mechanism where the user can twist the end of the pencil to expose a sharpener. This feature would eliminate the need for carrying a separate sharpener, making it more convenient for students and artists on the go.",
    "**Multi-Function Pencil with Attachments**: Create a modular pencil system that allows users to attach different tools to the pencil body, such as a ruler, protractor, or eraser. These attachments could be magnetized or snap-on, allowing for quick and easy changes. This would cater to students and professionals who need versatile tools without carrying multiple items."
