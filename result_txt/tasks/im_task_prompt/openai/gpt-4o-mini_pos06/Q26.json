    "**Odor-Absorbing Technology**: Incorporating a built-in air filtration system that uses activated charcoal or a similar material to neutralize odors could significantly improve the user experience. This feature would be especially useful for kitchen trash cans, where food waste can lead to unpleasant smells. Users could replace the filter periodically, ensuring that the can remains odor-free.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Designing trash cans from biodegradable or recycled materials would enhance their sustainability. This could include using plant-based plastics or recycled metals, reducing the environmental impact of the trash can itself. Additionally, providing information on the materials used and their environmental benefits could encourage consumers to make more eco-conscious choices.",
    "**Interactive App Integration**: An app could be developed to work in conjunction with the trash can. The app could track waste disposal habits, provide tips on reducing waste, and even offer rewards for recycling efforts. For example, users could earn points for every time they recycle correctly, which could be redeemed for discounts at local businesses or for eco-friendly products.",
    "**Customizable Aesthetic Features**: Allowing users to customize the appearance of their trash can could make it a more appealing addition to home decor. Options could include interchangeable skins or covers with various designs, colors, or patterns. This would encourage people to keep their trash cans visible and accessible, rather than hiding them away.",
    "**Built-in Compost Bin**: A dual-compartment trash can that includes a separate, ventilated section for composting would promote sustainable practices in households. This section could have a removable inner bin that makes it easy to transport compost to a garden or community composting facility. Features like a carbon filter and aeration holes would help manage odors and encourage decomposition."
