    "Individual Waste Collection Systems: Create personal waste collection bins or containers for each household. These bins can be made of durable materials like plastic or metal and have a small capacity to minimize the amount of waste produced. Regularly scheduled pickups can be organized for households to deposit their waste into designated areas.",
    "Community Composting Centers: Establish community composting centers where individuals can bring their organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste. These centers can use a combination of aerobic and anaerobic composting methods to produce nutrient-rich compost that can be used for gardening and landscaping purposes.",
    "Mobile Waste Collection Units: Develop mobile waste collection units that can travel to different areas of the city or neighborhood to collect waste. These units can be equipped with compacting technology to maximize space and minimize the number of trips needed to transport waste to a central location.",
    "Waste-to-Energy Plants: Build waste-to-energy plants that can convert non-recyclable waste into energy sources like electricity or biofuels. These plants can use technologies like gasification or pyrolysis to produce energy while minimizing emissions and environmental impact.",
    "Circular Economy App: Create a circular economy app that connects individuals with local waste management services, including waste collection, recycling, and composting. The app can provide real-time information on waste management services, allow users to track their waste output, and offer suggestions for reducing waste."
