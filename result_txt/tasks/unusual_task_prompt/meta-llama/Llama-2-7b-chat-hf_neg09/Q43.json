    "Virtual Reality Bicycle Tours: Create a virtual reality (VR) experience that allows users to take a guided tour of their favorite cycling destinations from the comfort of their own homes. The VR tour could include realistic scenery, sounds, and even the feeling of wind resistance, making the user feel like they are actually cycling through the location.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: Develop a bicycle helmet with built-in sensors and AI technology that can detect potential hazards on the road, such as potholes, debris, or other vehicles, and alert the rider in real-time. The helmet could also have a built-in camera that captures footage of the ride and allows the rider to share their adventures on social media.",
    "Personalized Bicycle Routes: Create an AI-powered route planning app that takes into account the user's fitness level, cycling experience, and personal preferences to generate a customized route for their ride. The app could also provide real-time traffic updates and suggest alternative routes to avoid congestion or road closures.",
    "Bicycle-Sharing Service with AI-Powered Matching: Develop a bicycle-sharing service that uses AI to match riders with the best bike for their needs based on factors such as their weight, riding style, and the terrain they will be riding on. The AI could also provide recommendations on how to properly maintain and care for the bike to ensure it lasts longer and performs better.",
    "AI-Powered Bicycle Maintenance: Create an AI-powered maintenance system that can diagnose and repair common issues with bicycles, such as flat tires or loose parts. The system could use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the problem and provide step-by-step instructions for repair. This could save riders time and money by avoiding trips to the mechanic and reduce waste by repairing rather than replacing broken parts."
