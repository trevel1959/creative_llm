    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Equip cars with sensors that monitor the driver’s health in real-time. These sensors could track heart rate, stress levels, and even detect signs of fatigue. If the system identifies that the driver is too stressed or tired, it could suggest taking a break, recommend a nearby rest area, or even activate a self-driving mode to navigate to a safe location.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation**: Implement an augmented reality (AR) system that overlays navigation instructions directly onto the windshield. This would allow drivers to see turn-by-turn directions as if they were part of the road itself, reducing distractions caused by traditional navigation systems. The AR system could also highlight points of interest along the route, such as restaurants or gas stations.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Panel Roof**: Design a car roof embedded with solar panels that can power auxiliary systems like air conditioning, infotainment, and charging ports for devices. This would not only reduce the car's overall energy consumption but also provide a sustainable energy source, especially for electric vehicles, extending their range and efficiency.",
    "**Smart Parking Assistant**: Create an advanced parking assistant that utilizes a combination of sensors, cameras, and AI to find and reserve parking spots in real-time. This system could guide the driver to available spaces, communicate with parking meters for payment, and even park the car autonomously in tight spaces, reducing the stress and time spent searching for parking.",
    "**Personalized Entertainment System**: Develop a modular entertainment system that adapts to the passengers’ preferences. This could include features like voice recognition to play specific songs, podcasts, or audiobooks, and a visual interface that allows passengers to watch movies or shows on screens embedded in the headrests. Additionally, the system could recommend content based on previous choices, creating a tailored entertainment experience for every journey."
