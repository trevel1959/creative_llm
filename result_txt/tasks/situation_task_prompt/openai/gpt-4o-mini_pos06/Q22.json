    "**Aquatic Transit Systems**: If the roads vanished, utilizing rivers, lakes, or canals for transportation could be an innovative solution. Small electric boats or amphibious vehicles could ferry people and goods across these water bodies. This would not only ease congestion but also promote a cleaner environment, as many of these vessels could run on renewable energy sources.",
    "**Personal Hovercrafts**: In a world without roads, personal hovercrafts could become a popular mode of transport. These lightweight, compact vehicles would hover a few feet above the ground, allowing users to glide over obstacles and uneven terrain. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they could provide a quick and efficient way to traverse the urban landscape.",
    "**Smart Walkways**: A network of elevated smart walkways could be constructed, allowing pedestrians to move freely above the ground. These walkways would be equipped with sensors that provide real-time updates on foot traffic, weather conditions, and even virtual guides to help navigate the city. The elevated nature would keep pedestrians safe from potential hazards on the ground.",
    "**Community Drone Delivery**: In the absence of roads, drones could take on a dual role of transport and delivery. Residents could use a mobile app to summon a drone that would either transport them to their destination or deliver goods. These drones would be equipped with safety features to navigate through urban airspace, ensuring efficient travel while minimizing congestion.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Personal Mobility Devices**: Think of a new range of eco-friendly personal mobility devices, such as solar-powered scooters, skateboards, or bicycles that can adapt to various terrains. These devices would be lightweight, easy to use, and designed to cater to different preferences, promoting an active lifestyle while being environmentally friendly."
