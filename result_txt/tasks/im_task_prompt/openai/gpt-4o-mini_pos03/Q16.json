    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush that features a self-cleaning mechanism. This could be achieved through a UV light built into the base of the brush that sterilizes the bristles after each use, eliminating bacteria and preventing product buildup. A simple button could activate the cleaning process, ensuring the brush remains hygienic without the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Adjustable Bristle Settings**: Innovate a hairbrush with adjustable bristle stiffness and length. Users could customize their brushing experience depending on their hair type and styling needs. For instance, softer bristles could be used for delicate hair or sensitive scalps, while firmer bristles could be utilized for thicker hair. A dial on the handle would allow for easy adjustments.",
    "**Integrated Scalp Massager**: Combine a traditional hairbrush with a scalp massager. The brush could feature a detachable head that incorporates silicone or rubber bristles designed for massaging the scalp. This would not only help with detangling hair but also promote blood circulation, enhance relaxation, and stimulate hair growth.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Develop a sustainable hairbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This brush could also include replaceable bristle heads, reducing waste and allowing users to maintain their brush over time without needing to buy a completely new one. Packaging would be minimal and compostable.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Hairbrush**: Introduce a hairbrush that can heat or cool the bristles to help style hair more effectively. The heated setting could be used to smooth out frizz and enhance shine, while the cooling setting could set hairstyles in place or help soothe the scalp after heat styling. A digital display on the handle would allow users to select their desired temperature."
