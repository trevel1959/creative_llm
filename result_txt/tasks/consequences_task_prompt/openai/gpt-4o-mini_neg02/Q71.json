    "**Economic Impact**: An immortal population would drastically alter the job market and economy. Traditional retirement age would become obsolete, and the workforce could become saturated with experienced individuals, leading to increased competition for jobs. This might necessitate a shift toward more creative and fulfilling work, as individuals seek to find purpose beyond mere survival. The economy could also face inflationary pressures as demand for resources skyrockets, prompting a reevaluation of wealth distribution.",
    "**Environmental Strain**: With the potential for an ever-growing population of immortals, the planet's resources could become severely strained. Overpopulation could lead to increased demand for food, water, and energy, exacerbating environmental issues like climate change and habitat destruction. This could prompt a race for sustainable living solutions, such as advanced agriculture or alternative energy sources, but it might also lead to conflicts over dwindling resources.",
    "**Psychological Effects**: Living indefinitely could have profound psychological consequences. Individuals might experience existential crises, boredom, or a lack of motivation due to the perceived endlessness of life. The concept of time would shift dramatically, potentially leading to new forms of therapy and mental health challenges as people grapple with their identity and purpose in an immortal society.",
    "**Cultural Evolution**: Immortality could lead to significant shifts in culture, art, and literature. With more time to reflect and create, individuals might explore deeper philosophical questions, resulting in a renaissance of thought and creativity. However, there could also be a stagnation of cultural evolution, as long-lived individuals may cling to outdated ideas and resist change, creating a tension between innovation and tradition.",
    "**Scientific and Technological Advancement**: The pursuit of immortality might accelerate scientific research and technological development. With more time and resources, humanity could unlock new discoveries in fields such as medicine, genetics, and artificial intelligence. This could lead to unprecedented advancements, but it might also raise ethical concerns about the manipulation of life and the consequences of playing god."
