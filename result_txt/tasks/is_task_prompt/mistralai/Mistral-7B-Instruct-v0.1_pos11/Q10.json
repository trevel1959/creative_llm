    "A city made entirely of mirrors that reflects the surrounding landscape, creating an illusion of depth andess.",
    "A city that exists only in the digital realm, accessible only through virtual reality headsets.",
    "A city built underground, with a labyrinthine network of tunnels and caverns that the inhabitants never see the sun.",
    "A city where every building is made of a translucent material that allows people to see through it, creating a sense of openness and transparency.",
    "A city that is constantly in motion, with buildings and streets that are constantly shifting and changing, creating a sense of instability and uncertainty."
