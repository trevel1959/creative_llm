    "**Smart Laundry Management System:** This idea involves integrating a smart sensor in the washing machine that can monitor the laundry load's weight, fabric type, and dirt level. It then suggests the optimal wash cycle, detergent quantity, and energy usage. The system could also learn user preferences over time and automatically adjust settings accordingly.",
    "**Wearable Washing Machine:** A portable, wearable device designed to clean clothes directly on the body without needing a traditional washing machine. It uses ultrasonic waves to break down dirt particles and microfibers that are collected from the environment. This idea would be particularly useful for individuals who need to clean their clothes frequently but lack access to a washing machine.",
    "**Energy-Saving Washing Machine:** This innovative washing machine incorporates an AI-driven algorithm that learns the user's washing habits and adjusts its operation to use minimal water and electricity. It could also optimize the wash cycle based on the specific detergent used and the fabric type of the clothes being washed.",
    "**Recycling-Oriented Washing Machine:** This machine is designed to sort and recycle clothes effectively. It features sensors that identify different types of fabric and separate them into categories (e.g., cotton, synthetic, wool). The machine then processes each category using methods that minimize waste and maximize recycling potential, such as using biodegradable detergents and separating materials for reuse or upcycling.",
    "**Washing Machine as a Hub for Smart Home Devices:** This concept integrates the washing machine as a central hub for managing various smart home devices. Users can control other smart appliances, such as dryers, air purifiers, and smart lights, through the washing machine's interface. This integration streamlines household management, allowing users to coordinate tasks efficiently and save energy by optimizing appliance usage together."
