    "**Garden Protector**: Use gloves as protective coverings for young plants or seedlings. Cut the fingers off a glove and place it over fragile plants to shield them from harsh weather conditions or pests. The glove material can provide a light barrier against wind and rain, while still allowing sunlight to reach the plant.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Create a simple pet toy by stuffing an old glove with catnip or small treats. Sew or tie off the open end, and let your pet enjoy the new toy. The glove's shape and texture can make it appealing for dogs and cats to chew, toss, and play with.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: Fill a glove with dried herbs or essential oils, then tie off the wrist part. Hang it in a closet, car, or any small space to act as a natural air freshener. The glove material will allow the scent to escape slowly, providing a subtle fragrance over time.",
    "**Emergency Ice Pack**: In case of a minor injury, fill a glove with ice cubes and tie it off to create a makeshift ice pack. The glove's flexible material will conform to the shape of the injured area, providing relief while being easy to hold. This is a great alternative when you don't have a traditional ice pack on hand.",
    "**Hand Puppet**: Turn a glove into a fun hand puppet for storytelling or playtime. Use fabric markers, buttons, and other craft supplies to decorate the glove and create a character. This can be a delightful activity for children, fostering creativity and imagination."
