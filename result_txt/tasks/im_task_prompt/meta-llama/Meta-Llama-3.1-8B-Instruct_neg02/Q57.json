    "**Self-Sustaining Mouse** : This mouse would have a built-in solar panel and a small rechargeable battery. It would be able to charge itself during the day and provide power to the computer at night. The mouse would also have a small LED light that would indicate when it's charging or when the battery is low. This feature would be especially useful for people who work in areas with limited power outlets or for those who want to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Mouse** : This mouse would have a flexible and retractable design, allowing it to change shape to suit different user preferences. For example, it could be used as a standard mouse, a trackpad, or even a stylus for drawing or writing. The shape-shifting feature would be achieved through the use of advanced materials and mechanisms, such as electroactive polymers or shape-memory alloys.",
    "**Biometric Mouse** : This mouse would use advanced biometric sensors to track the user's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, or brain activity. The data collected would be used to provide personalized recommendations for physical and mental well-being, such as suggesting exercises or meditation techniques. The mouse would also have a built-in speaker that would provide gentle reminders and motivational messages.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Mouse** : This mouse would have advanced haptic feedback technology, allowing users to feel tactile sensations while interacting with digital objects. For example, users could feel the texture of a virtual surface or the resistance of a virtual spring. The haptic feedback would be achieved through the use of small actuators and vibration motors, providing a more immersive and engaging experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Mouse** : This mouse would have a built-in camera and projector, allowing it to display augmented reality (AR) content directly onto the user's workspace. The mouse would use machine learning algorithms to recognize objects and environments, providing personalized and interactive AR experiences. For example, users could see virtual objects or information overlaid onto their physical workspace, or use the mouse to manipulate virtual objects in 3D space. </s> [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are creative and original, but I'll provide you with a more detailed and structured response."
