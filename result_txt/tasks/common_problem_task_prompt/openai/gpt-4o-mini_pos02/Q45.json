    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and transportation for a large number of international delegates can be daunting. Potential problems include flight delays, visa issues, and accommodations that do not meet the expectations of dignitaries. To address this, organizers could partner with a specialized event management company experienced in international summits. This company would handle all logistics, provide real-time updates, and have contingency plans in place for any travel disruptions.",
    "**Security Concerns**: An international peace summit may attract not only participants but also protestors or individuals with malicious intent. Ensuring the safety of all attendees is paramount. Organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and security experts to develop a comprehensive security plan that includes screening processes, secure transportation routes, and emergency response strategies. Additionally, they could consider using technology such as drones for aerial surveillance and crowd monitoring.",
    "**Language Barriers**: Communication can be a significant hurdle, especially in a multilingual setting. Misinterpretations could lead to diplomatic faux pas or ineffective negotiations. To overcome this, organizers should provide professional interpreters and translation services, ensuring that all materials, including speeches and documents, are available in multiple languages. Additionally, incorporating technology such as real-time translation apps could facilitate smoother communication among delegates.",
    "**Agenda Conflicts**: With representatives from various nations, differing priorities and agendas may clash, leading to unproductive discussions or stalled negotiations. To tackle this, the organizing committee could conduct pre-summit surveys to identify key issues for each nation. This data would help in crafting a balanced agenda that addresses the most pressing concerns while allowing for collaborative discussions on less contentious topics.",
    "**Sustainability Issues**: Organizing an international summit can lead to significant environmental impacts, such as carbon footprints from travel and waste generation. To promote sustainability, organizers could implement a green summit initiative that includes measures like encouraging virtual attendance for those who canâ€™t travel, using eco-friendly materials for event materials, and partnering with local vendors who prioritize sustainability. Additionally, they could offset carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects."
