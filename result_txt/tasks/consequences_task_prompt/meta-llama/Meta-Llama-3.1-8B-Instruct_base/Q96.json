This could lead to a new era of human evolution, where species adapt to their environment in unprecedented ways. Scientists would need to study and understand these changes to ensure they align with human well-being.",
    "**Reimagined Education and Learning**: With the absence of sleep, traditional education systems would need to be reevaluated.
