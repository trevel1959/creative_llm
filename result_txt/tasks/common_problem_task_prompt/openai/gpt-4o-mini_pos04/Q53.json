    "**Plot Holes and Continuity Errors**: As the screenplay evolves, inconsistencies in the plot may arise, leading to confusion for the audience. For example, a character may have a skill or knowledge that seems to appear out of nowhere, or events may contradict earlier setups. To address this, the writer can create a comprehensive outline that tracks all plot points and character developments. Regularly revisiting and revising earlier scenes as new ideas are introduced can help maintain continuity and logical flow.",
    "**Pacing Problems**: A screenplay can suffer from uneven pacing, where certain scenes drag on while others feel rushed. This imbalance can disrupt the audience's engagement. To ensure proper pacing, the writer can employ techniques such as varying scene lengths, using cliffhangers, and strategically placing moments of tension and relief. Additionally, sharing the screenplay with trusted beta readers can provide valuable feedback on pacing and overall flow.",
    "**Dialogue Discrepancies**: Crafting authentic dialogue that resonates with the audience can be challenging. Writers may fall into the trap of making characters sound too similar or overly verbose. To avoid this, the writer can listen to real conversations, paying attention to speech patterns, slang, and the rhythm of dialogue. Writing scenes with the intent of each characterâ€™s unique voice and practicing with actors during read-throughs can also help refine the dialogue.",
    "**Theme Confusion**: The screenplay may struggle to convey a clear theme, leading to a muddled message. Without a strong thematic foundation, the audience may leave the film feeling unsatisfied or confused. To clarify the theme, the writer can start by identifying the core message they want to convey and ensuring that each character's journey and subplot aligns with that theme. Using symbolism and recurring motifs can also reinforce the central idea throughout the narrative.",
    "**Marketability Issues**: While the writer may be passionate about their story, it might not align with current market trends or audience preferences. This disconnect can hinder the screenplay's chances of being produced. To address this, the writer can conduct market research to identify popular genres, themes, and storytelling styles. Networking with industry professionals and attending film festivals can also provide insights into what resonates with audiences and producers."
