    "**Smart Hose Nozzle**: Develop a nozzle that automatically adjusts water pressure based on the type of watering needed (e.g., gentle for flowers, stronger for lawns). It could also include features like flow rate control, water-saving timers, and a built-in timer for setting watering schedules.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Garden Hose**: Incorporate technology into the hose that cleans itself after each use. This could involve a UV light that disinfects the hose, or a self-misting system that removes debris and residue, extending the hoseâ€™s lifespan and maintaining its efficiency.",
    "**Solar-Powered Garden Hose Reel**: Integrate solar panels into the reel mechanism to power an electric motor that automatically rewinds the hose when not in use. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of manual strain during rewinding.",
    "**Smart Leak Detection System**: Equip the hose with sensors that detect leaks and automatically shut off the water supply if a leak is detected. This would prevent water waste and damage from excessive water flow.",
    "**Versatile Garden Hose Connector Kit**: Design a kit that includes various nozzles, adapters, and attachments that can transform the hose into a multi-purpose tool. This could include a sprinkler attachment, a jet spray nozzle, and a drip irrigation adapter, making it suitable for different gardening tasks."
