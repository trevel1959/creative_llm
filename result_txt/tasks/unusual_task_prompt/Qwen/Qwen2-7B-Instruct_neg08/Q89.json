    "Spice Mill for Unique Flavors: Instead of using it for coffee, a coffee grinder can be repurposed to grind up spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and star anise, creating a custom blend for baking, cooking, or even making tea. This results in a unique flavor profile that complements specific dishes or beverages.",
    "Herb Drying Aid: To speed up the drying process of fresh herbs, grind them in a coffee grinder to break them down into smaller pieces. This increases surface area exposure, allowing the herbs to dry faster and retain more of their aroma and flavor.",
    "DIY Sandpaper Substitute: Grind down sandpaper into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can then be reformed into custom-sized sanding blocks for woodworking projects. This not only saves money but also allows for more precise control over the sanding process.",
    "Ice Shaver for Cold Beverages: Transform the coffee grinder into a makeshift ice shaver by filling it with shaved ice. This can be particularly useful when creating refreshing drinks like snow cones or adding a cool twist to hot summer drinks.",
    "Coffee Bean Flavoring Agent: Instead of grinding coffee beans, use the coffee grinder to finely chop up other ingredients like chocolate, dried fruits, or nuts. These flavorings can be mixed into coffee or used as toppings for desserts, providing a rich, textural experience."
