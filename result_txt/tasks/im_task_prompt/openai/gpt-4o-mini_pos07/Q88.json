    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Technology**:    - Ski poles that automatically adjust their length based on the terrain or user preference would be a game-changer. Using memory materials, these poles could sense the skier's grip pressure or the snow conditions and adjust their length accordingly, providing optimal support whether on steep slopes or flat terrain.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Heating Elements**:    - Cold hands can ruin a skiing experience. By integrating a rechargeable heating element into the grip, these ski poles would keep your hands warm without the bulk of gloves. The grip could be designed to fit comfortably in the hand, with textured surfaces for improved hold and control, ensuring comfort and functionality in extreme conditions.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tips for Versatile Use**:    - Instead of traditional tips, ski poles could come with interchangeable tips designed for various snow conditions and terrains. For example, one tip could be optimized for powder, while another could be designed for icy conditions. This feature would allow skiers to adapt their poles based on their immediate environment, enhancing performance and safety.",
    "**Integrated Avalanche Safety Features**:    - Ski poles could be equipped with safety features such as a beacon that activates in the event of an avalanche. The pole could also include a built-in shovel or probe that can be easily deployed. This combination of features would provide skiers with essential tools for avalanche safety without the need to carry additional equipment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**:    - With increasing awareness of environmental issues, ski poles made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled composites, would appeal to eco-conscious skiers. Additionally, a modular design could allow for easy repairs or upgrades, reducing waste and encouraging a longer lifespan for the product."
