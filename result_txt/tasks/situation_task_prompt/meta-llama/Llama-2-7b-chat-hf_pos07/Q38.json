    "Create a community-based hygiene system: Organize the community to adopt a shared hygiene system, where individuals contribute to a communal soap and cleaning product fund. This fund can be used to purchase essential hygiene products in bulk, ensuring a steady supply. Additionally, designate specific areas for personal hygiene and cleaning, such as designated bathing areas and cleaning stations.",
    "Utilize natural alternatives: Explore the use of natural alternatives for cleaning and hygiene, such as using ash and clay for cleaning, or using herbs and essential oils for personal hygiene. These alternatives can be just as effective as traditional cleaning products and are more sustainable in the long run.",
    "Innovate with repurposed materials: Repurpose items that can be used for hygiene purposes, such as old plastic bottles for hand-washing stations or reusing old towels for drying. This approach not only reduces waste but also promotes creativity and resourcefulness.",
    "Leverage technology for sanitation: Develop a mobile app that provides users with information on proper hygiene practices and sanitation. The app can also serve as a platform for individuals to report any issues or concerns regarding hygiene in their area, allowing for quick action to be taken.",
    "Establish a bartering system: Create a bartering system where individuals can exchange goods and services related to hygiene, such as exchanging cleaning services for fresh produce or sharing personal hygiene products with neighbors. This system promotes mutual support and community building, ensuring that everyone has access to basic hygiene necessities."
