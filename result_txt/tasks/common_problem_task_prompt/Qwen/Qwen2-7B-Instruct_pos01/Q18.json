    "**Solar-Powered Community:** This idea involves building a community that relies solely on solar power to meet its energy needs. The houses would be designed to capture as much sunlight as possible, using solar panels on rooftops, walls, and even windows. To store the energy, the community could utilize batteries or other energy storage systems. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8, as it's feasible with current technology and aligns with sustainability goals.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting System:** Instead of traditional light bulbs, the community could use bioluminescent plants and fungi to illuminate the area. These organisms naturally emit light, which could be harnessed to create a sustainable lighting system. Additionally, they can help in cleaning the air and provide natural beauty. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7, considering the challenges in controlling and scaling such a system.",
    "**Human-Powered Generators:** In areas where solar power isn't sufficient, human-powered generators could be used. People would pedal stationary bikes or walk on treadmills to generate electricity. These activities could be turned into a community event, promoting health and energy production simultaneously. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6, given the potential for resistance due to physical labor requirements.",
    "**Wind Turbine Integration:** For regions with consistent wind patterns, integrating wind turbines could provide a reliable source of electricity. These turbines would need to be strategically placed and possibly combined with energy storage solutions like pumped hydro storage or compressed air energy storage. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8, considering advancements in wind turbine technology and its widespread application.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Conversion:** Implementing waste-to-energy facilities within the community could convert organic waste into biogas, which can then be used to generate electricity. This process not only reduces waste but also provides a clean energy source. However, proper waste management and odor control are crucial factors. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7, given the potential environmental impact and technical complexities involved."
