    "**Compliance with Diverse Regulations**: Multinational companies must navigate a complex landscape of regulations, such as GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, and others. Each jurisdiction has specific requirements for data protection and breach notification. Developing a cybersecurity solution that adheres to all applicable laws can be challenging and may require continuous updates and legal consultations to ensure compliance.",
    "**Integration of Legacy Systems**: Many multinational companies have legacy systems that may not be compatible with modern cybersecurity solutions. Integrating these older systems with new security measures can create vulnerabilities. The solution must be designed to either modernize these systems or create a secure interface that protects them while still allowing necessary functionality.",
    "**Scalability of the Solution**: As a multinational company grows, its cybersecurity needs will evolve. The solution must be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users, devices, and data. This includes ensuring that the infrastructure can handle more complex threats as the company expands into new markets or adopts new technologies.",
    "**User Training and Awareness**: A significant portion of cybersecurity incidents stems from human error. Therefore, the solution should include a robust training program tailored to employees across different regions. This program must address varying levels of technical expertise and cultural differences in how security is perceived, ensuring that all employees understand their role in maintaining cybersecurity.",
    "**Incident Response and Communication Plans**: In the event of a security breach, a multinational company must have a clear incident response plan that includes communication strategies for different stakeholders, including employees, customers, and regulatory bodies. Developing a unified approach that can be adapted to various cultural contexts and languages is crucial to managing the fallout effectively."
