    "**Establish a Neighborhood Watch with a Twist**: In the absence of law enforcement, a neighborhood watch program can be adapted to incorporate community members who have received self-defense training or have experience in martial arts. This group can be equipped with communication devices, such as walkie-talkies or smartphones, to stay in touch and coordinate efforts. They can also be trained in basic first aid and CPR to respond to emergencies. To make it more effective, the group can be divided into smaller teams, each responsible for a specific area of the neighborhood, and they can work together to maintain a safe environment. This approach not only provides an added layer of security but also fosters a sense of community and cooperation among residents.",
