    "**Sunlight Sensor Sunglasses**: These sunglasses contain a built-in sensor that detects the intensity of sunlight. When the light becomes too strong, the lenses darken automatically to provide UV protection and comfort for the wearer. This innovative feature allows users to adjust their vision without manual intervention, making it perfect for outdoor activities.",
    "**Sunglasses as Wearable Technology**: Incorporate technology into the design by embedding a small screen or display within the frame. Users can check notifications, track fitness metrics, access GPS, and even make calls directly from their sunglasses. The screen could be hidden until activated, maintaining the aesthetic appeal of traditional sunglasses while offering convenient access to digital information.",
    "**Customizable Sunglasses**: Create a line of sunglasses where each lens can be customized to suit different light conditions. Users can choose from various tints (such as yellow, rose, or blue) depending on the environment they are in, enhancing color perception and reducing eye strain. The customizable feature can also extend to the frames themselves, allowing for a range of colors and designs.",
    "**Smart Sunglasses with Facial Recognition**: Integrate facial recognition technology into the sunglasses to unlock smartphones, enter secure buildings, or access personal information. By simply looking at the device or scanning a face, the wearer can quickly perform tasks without having to interact with a screen or touch interface.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses**: Develop a line of sunglasses made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or bio-based composites. These sunglasses not only provide fashion-forward looks but also contribute to environmental conservation efforts. The packaging and manufacturing processes should also prioritize eco-friendliness to reinforce the brand's commitment to sustainability."
