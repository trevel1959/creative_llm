    "Invent a new mode of transportation: I would start by creating a new mode of transportation that could help me move around my town or city.

I would also invest in a good quality bicycle that can handle different terrains and weather conditions.",

    "Use a drone: If all roads disappeared, I would use a drone to move around my town or city. I would purchase a high-quality drone that can be controlled with a smartphone or a remote control. I would use the drone to fly over the city and take pictures or videos of the sights and sounds.",
