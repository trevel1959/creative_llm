    "Dependency on Technology: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, people may become overly reliant on the technology, which could lead to a loss of driving skills. This could be problematic in situations where the car's systems fail, and the driver needs to take control of the vehicle. To address this issue, it's essential to provide drivers with the option to manually override the self-driving system and ensure that they are trained to do so.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Self-driving cars raise ethical questions about who is responsible in case of an accident or collision. Is it the car manufacturer, the software developer, or the owner of the vehicle? These questions highlight the need for clear guidelines and regulations to govern the use of self-driving cars and to ensure that all parties involved are held accountable for their actions.",
    "Liability for Damage: In the event of an accident, determining liability for damage to the vehicle or other property can be challenging. Insurance companies may need to adapt their policies to account for the unique risks associated with self-driving cars. Additionally, car manufacturers and software developers should be prepared to provide support and assistance to customers in case of accidents or damage.",
    "Legal and Regulatory Issues: As self-driving cars become more common, there may be a need for new laws and regulations to govern their use. This could include issues such as licensing requirements, liability for accidents, and privacy concerns related to data collection and storage. Governments must work closely with car manufacturers and other stakeholders to ensure that these regulations are fair, effective, and enforceable.",
    "Infrastructure and Road Safety: Self-driving cars rely on well-maintained roads and infrastructure, including traffic signals, road signs, and road markings. Ensuring that these elements are in good condition and compatible with self-driving technology is crucial for maintaining road safety. Additionally, there may be a need for new infrastructure, such as dedicated lanes for self-driving cars or charging stations for electric models."
