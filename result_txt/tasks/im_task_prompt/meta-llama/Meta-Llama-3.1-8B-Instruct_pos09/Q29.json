    "**Smart Lawn Mower with Autonomous Navigation**: Develop a lawn mower that uses AI and GPS to navigate and cut the lawn efficiently. The mower would be equipped with sensors to detect obstacles, slopes, and different types of grass, adjusting its cutting pattern accordingly. It would also be able to avoid collisions with pets, children, or other objects. The mower would be controlled via a mobile app, allowing users to schedule mowing sessions, monitor progress, and receive notifications when the job is complete.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Lawn Mower with Composting Capability**: Design a lawn mower that not only cuts the grass but also collects and composts the clippings. The mower would be equipped with a built-in composting system, using microorganisms to break down the clippings into nutrient-rich fertilizer. This would reduce waste, decrease the need for chemical fertilizers, and create a sustainable lawn care solution.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Integrated Watering System**: Develop a lawn mower that includes a built-in watering system, allowing users to water their lawn while mowing. The mower would be equipped with a water tank and a network of tubes and nozzles that would distribute water evenly across the lawn. This would save time and reduce water waste, making it an efficient and eco-friendly solution for lawn care.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Integrated Pest Control**: Design a lawn mower that includes a built-in pest control system, using natural methods to control pests and diseases. The mower would be equipped with a network of sensors that detect pests and diseases, and a system that releases beneficial insects or microorganisms to control the infestation. This would reduce the need for chemical pesticides and create a healthier lawn ecosystem.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Integrated Solar Power**: Develop a lawn mower that runs on solar power, reducing the need for fossil fuels and lowering emissions. The mower would be equipped with solar panels that charge a battery, powering the cutting mechanism and other systems. This would make the mower an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for lawn care, especially for small to medium-sized lawns.
