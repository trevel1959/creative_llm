    "**Solar Umbrella Helmet**: Design a lightweight, wearable helmet with a built-in, retractable umbrella. The umbrella would provide shade for the scalp, protecting it from the sun's harsh rays. The helmet could be made from a breathable, moisture-wicking material to keep the head cool and dry. The umbrella could be controlled by a small joystick or button, allowing the user to adjust the angle and position of the shade to suit their needs.",
    "**Sunscreen-infused Hair Replacement**: Develop a hair replacement system that incorporates a built-in sunscreen. This could be achieved through the use of nanotechnology, where tiny particles of sunscreen are embedded within the hair fibers themselves. This would provide continuous protection for the scalp, even when the hair is exposed to direct sunlight. The hair could be designed to be removable and washable, making it easy to clean and maintain.",
    "**Scalp Shield**: Create a portable, inflatable scalp shield that can be worn like a helmet. The shield would be made from a lightweight, waterproof material and could be easily deflated and stored in a compact pouch when not in use. The shield would provide a physical barrier between the scalp and the sun, preventing sunburn and damage. It could also be equipped with a built-in cooling system to keep the head cool and comfortable.",
    "**Reflective Scalp Wrap**: Design a wearable, reflective wrap that can be applied directly to the scalp. The wrap would be made from a thin, flexible material that can be easily removed and reapplied as needed. The reflective surface would help to deflect the sun's rays, reducing the amount of direct sunlight that reaches the scalp. The wrap could also be equipped with a built-in cooling system or ventilation system to keep the head cool and dry.",
    "**Personal Sun Shelter**: Develop a wearable, portable sun shelter that can be worn like a backpack or carried as a personal umbrella. The shelter would provide a physical barrier between the scalp and the sun, protecting it from the elements. The shelter could be designed to be adjustable, allowing the user to customize the amount of shade they receive. It could also be equipped with a built-in cooling system or ventilation system to keep the head cool and dry. [/INST] [/INST] "
