    "**Bioluminescent Insect Traps**: Develop a system that utilizes bioluminescent organisms to attract and trap insects. These organisms could be engineered to emit specific wavelengths of light that are attractive to pests, but not to beneficial insects. The trapped insects could then be disposed of or repurposed as a natural fertilizer. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Insectoid Robots**: Design and deploy insect-like robots that mimic the behavior and movement of real insects. These robots could be programmed to navigate and detect pests, and then use targeted methods to eliminate them. This approach could minimize the use of pesticides and reduce environmental impact. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Genetic Engineering of Beneficial Insects**: Develop genetically engineered insects that are resistant to pests and can outcompete them for resources. These beneficial insects could be released into the environment to control pest populations. This approach would require careful consideration of potential unintended consequences and long-term effects. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Atmospheric Ionization**: Utilize atmospheric ionization technology to create an electric field that disrupts the navigation and behavior of pests. This could be achieved through the deployment of ionizing devices or by leveraging natural atmospheric phenomena. The effectiveness of this method would depend on the specific pest species and environmental conditions. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Microbial Insect Control**: Engineer microorganisms that can target and eliminate specific pest species. These microorganisms could be designed to be highly specific, reducing the risk of collateral damage to beneficial insects. This approach would require a deep understanding of microbial ecology and the complex interactions within ecosystems. (Confidence: 0.95)"
