    "Virtual Towel: Create a smart towel that can be worn like a scarf and has sensors embedded in it to monitor the wearer's vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. The towel can also be used to detect and track the wearer's physical activity, such as steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned. The data can be synced to a mobile app or a cloud-based platform for analysis and tracking.",
    "Towel with Built-in Sanitizer: Design a towel with a built-in sanitizer that can be activated with a simple button press.

This can be a fun and unique feature for campers, beachgoers, or anyone who wants to add a little excitement to their bath time. The glow-in-the-dark towel can also be used as a safety feature in low-light environments, such as during a power outage or in a dark room.",
    "Smart Towel Rack: Design a smart towel rack that can hold and dry multiple towels at once. The rack can be equipped with sensors that detect when a towel is placed on it and automatically start the drying process. The rack can also be connected to a mobile app or a smart home system, allowing users to control the drying process remotely.",
    "Heated Towel: Create a heated towel that can be worn around the neck or on the body to provide warmth and comfort. The heated towel can be powered by a small battery or a built-in heating element, and can be controlled using a mobile app or a button. This can be a great feature for people who suffer from cold sensitivity or for those who want to stay warm and cozy during outdoor activities."
