    "**Communication Barriers**: Language differences can lead to misunderstandings and feelings of isolation for the exchange student. The host family may find it difficult to communicate effectively, which can create tension. To address this, both parties can engage in language-learning activities, such as using language apps together or setting up a buddy system with local students who can help with language practice and integration.",
    "**Different Dietary Preferences**: The foreign exchange student may have different dietary restrictions or preferences that the host family is unaware of. This could lead to uncomfortable situations at meal times. To avoid this, the host family should have an open discussion about food preferences and dietary needs before the student arrives, and involve the student in meal planning and preparation to ensure everyone is comfortable and satisfied.",
    "**Integration into Family Dynamics**: The presence of a foreign exchange student can disrupt the existing family dynamics, especially if there are children in the household. The host siblings may feel neglected or jealous of the attention given to the new student. To counter this, the family can set aside special time for each child to bond with the student, as well as family activities that include everyone, reinforcing a sense of belonging for the exchange student while ensuring the host children feel valued.",
    "**Social Integration and Loneliness**: The exchange student may struggle to make friends and feel isolated in a new environment, which can affect their overall experience. To help with social integration, the host family can introduce the student to local community events, clubs, or sports teams, and encourage them to participate in school activities. Additionally, arranging regular gatherings with other exchange students can create a support network for shared experiences.",
    "**Academic Differences**: The academic expectations and grading systems may differ significantly from what the exchange student is used to, potentially leading to academic struggles or frustration. The host family can help by communicating with the studentâ€™s teachers about their background and any special accommodations that may be needed. They can also assist with homework or study sessions to help the student adjust to the new academic environment."
