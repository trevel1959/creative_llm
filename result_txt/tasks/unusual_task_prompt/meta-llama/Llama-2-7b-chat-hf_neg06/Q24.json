    "Toothbrush Sanitizer: A toothbrush sanitizer is a small, portable device that uses UV light to sanitize toothbrushes. This device would be perfect for people who are always on the go and can't always wash their hands before brushing their teeth. The UV light would kill any bacteria on the toothbrush, ensuring a cleaner and healthier brushing experience.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-In Toothpaste Dispenser: This toothbrush features a built-in toothpaste dispenser that automatically releases the right amount of toothpaste onto the brush head each time it's used. This eliminates the need for manual toothpaste application and ensures that the right amount of toothpaste is used every time. The dispenser can be controlled by a small button or sensor, making it easy to use.",
    "Toothbrush with Vibrating Bristles: This toothbrush features vibrating bristles that help to loosen and remove plaque and food particles more effectively than a traditional toothbrush. The vibrations also help to stimulate blood flow in the gums, promoting healthy gum health. The vibrations can be adjusted to suit different brushing techniques and preferences.",
    "Toothbrush with Personalized Brushing Modes: This toothbrush features different brushing modes that can be personalized to suit an individual's brushing needs. For example, there could be a \"sensitive\" mode for people with sensitive teeth and gums, a \"deep clean\" mode for people who want to remove more plaque and food particles, and a \"whitening\" mode for people who want to brighten their teeth. The toothbrush can be programmed to automatically switch between modes based on the user's preferences.",
    "Toothbrush with Integrated Toothpaste Sensors: This toothbrush features sensors that detect when toothpaste is applied and automatically turn on the brushing mode. The sensors can also detect when the toothbrush is being used and automatically turn off the brushing mode when the user is finished. This eliminates the need for manual toothpaste application and ensures that the toothbrush is used correctly every time."
