    "Sleep under the stars: If there were no more night-time, we could sleep outside and gaze at the stars in the sky. It would be a unique experience to sleep under the bright and clear sky without any distractions. We could also take a stroll around and appreciate the beauty of nature.",
    "Use natural light: We could make use of the natural light during the day and sleep in a room with large windows that allow the sun to come in. This would give us a sense of waking up to a new day and help us feel refreshed.",
    "Use a sleep aid: We could use a sleep aid that mimics the effects of natural light, such as a light box or an app that simulates a sunrise. This would help us regulate our sleep patterns and feel more rested.",
    "Use a sleep tracker: We could use a sleep tracker to monitor our sleep patterns and make adjustments accordingly. This would help us understand our sleep cycles and make changes to our daily routine to improve our sleep quality.",
    "Try a new sleep routine: We could try a new sleep routine that involves different activities before bedtime, such as meditation, yoga, or reading. This would help us relax and unwind before bed, and improve our sleep quality."
