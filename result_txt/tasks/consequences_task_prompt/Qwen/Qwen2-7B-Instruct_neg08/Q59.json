    "**Cultural Shift in Education**: The education system would need to undergo a dramatic transformation. Schools and universities would have to cater to the diverse intellectual capabilities of students, perhaps by implementing personalized learning paths or creating specialized academies for different types of genius. This shift could lead to a more dynamic and engaging educational experience for all learners.",
    "**Economic Disruption**: The job market would likely experience significant disruption.

    "**Ethical Considerations and Equality**: The question of whether everyone becoming a genius is truly beneficial or fair arises.

This might lead to discussions around genetic enhancement ethics, accessibility to education, and social policies aimed at ensuring that the benefits are distributed fairly.",
    "**Social Dynamics and Relationships**: In this scenario, relationships between people could evolve. The way people interact, form alliances, and collaborate might change, as they navigate the new landscape of shared genius. Social hierarchies could shift, leading to new forms of community and social cohesion based on collective genius rather than individual achievement."
