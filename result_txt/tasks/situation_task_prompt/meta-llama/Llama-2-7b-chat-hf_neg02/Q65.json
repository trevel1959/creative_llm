    "Sunlight Harvesting: One creative solution to light up a room at night without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use sunlight harvesting technology. This involves using a specialized material that can absorb and store sunlight during the day, then release it at night as a soft, ambient light. The material could be applied to walls, ceilings, or even windows, providing a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "Glowing Paint: Another option is to use glowing paint that emits a soft, ambient light. This paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or furniture, providing a warm and cozy light without the need for any additional lighting fixtures. The paint could be made from a combination of phosphorescent and fluorescent materials, which absorb and store light during the day and release it at night.",
    "Bioluminescent Organisms: Bioluminescent organisms, such as fireflies or glowworms, could be used to light up a room at night. These organisms produce their own light through a chemical reaction, which could be harnessed and directed towards the desired area. This would provide a unique and sustainable source of light, as well as a natural and organic aesthetic.",
    "Solar-Powered LEDs: Another creative solution is to use solar-powered LEDs to light up a room at night. These LEDs could be placed in strategic locations around the room, such as on the ceiling or walls, and would be powered by solar panels during the day. The LEDs would then provide a soft, ambient light at night, without the need for any additional power sources.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Finally, light-emitting plants could be used to light up a room at night. These plants, such as the \"Glowing Plant\" or \"Luminous Plant,\" have been genetically engineered to produce their own light through a chemical reaction. These plants could be placed in pots or hanging baskets around the room, providing a natural and sustainable source of light without the need for any additional lighting fixtures."
