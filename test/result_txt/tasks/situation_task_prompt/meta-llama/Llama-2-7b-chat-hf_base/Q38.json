    "Create a natural soap-making community: With the disappearance of commercial soaps and cleaning products, a community of natural soap-makers could emerge. People could learn how to make their own soaps using natural ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and essential oils. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to commercial products. The community could share recipes, techniques, and knowledge, and even create a local market for homemade soaps.",
    "Utilize ash for cleaning: Ash from plants like bamboo or wood could be used as a natural cleaning agent. The ash acts as a mild abrasive and can be used to clean surfaces without leaving residue. This method is eco-friendly and can be used for cleaning floors, countertops, and other surfaces.",
    "Use vinegar and baking soda: Vinegar and baking soda are both natural cleaning agents that can be used to clean and disinfect surfaces. Vinegar has antibacterial properties, while baking soda acts as a mild abrasive. Mixing equal parts vinegar and baking soda can create a solution that can be used to clean and deodorize surfaces. This solution is non-toxic and environmentally friendly.",
    "Create a water-based cleaning system: In the absence of commercial cleaning products, a water-based cleaning system could be developed. This system would use water as the primary cleaning agent, along with natural cleaning agents like lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, and essential oils. The system could be designed to be easy to use and maintain, and could be adapted for various cleaning tasks like cleaning floors, countertops, and bathrooms.",
    "Use edible oils for cleaning: Edible oils like olive oil, coconut oil, and sesame oil can be used as natural cleaning agents. These oils have antibacterial and antiviral properties, making them effective for cleaning surfaces. They can also be used to clean and disinfect surfaces without leaving any residue. This method is eco-friendly and can be used for cleaning surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom, and other areas of the home."
