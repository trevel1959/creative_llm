    "Build a greenhouse: One creative solution to regulate indoor temperature without heaters or air conditioners is to build a greenhouse. A greenhouse uses natural sunlight and ventilation to maintain a comfortable temperature, making it an eco-friendly and cost-effective option. To build a greenhouse, you can use materials like plastic sheeting, polycarbonate panels, or glass. You can also incorporate insulation and shading materials to maintain a consistent temperature. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Utilize passive solar design: Another creative solution is to incorporate passive solar design principles into your home. This involves strategically placing windows and walls to maximize natural light and heat from the sun. By doing so, you can warm up the interior of your home during the winter months and cool it down during the summer months. You can also incorporate thermal mass materials like concrete or brick to absorb and release heat. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Use phase-change materials: Phase-change materials (PCMs) are materials that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By incorporating PCMs into your home's walls, floors, or ceilings, you can regulate the indoor temperature without relying on heaters or air conditioners. PCMs can be made from a variety of materials, including paraffin wax, salt hydrates, and silicates. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Create a natural ventilation system: A natural ventilation system can help regulate indoor temperature by using natural air currents to distribute heat evenly throughout the home. By installing vents, windows, and other openings in strategic locations, you can create a system that allows cooler air to enter the home during the summer months and warmer air to enter during the winter months. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Use evaporative cooling: Evaporative cooling is a natural cooling method that uses water to cool the air. By installing a evaporative cooling system, you can cool the air without relying on electricity or other energy sources. Evaporative cooling systems can be made using a variety of materials, including wet towels, pads, or even plants. Confidence score: "
