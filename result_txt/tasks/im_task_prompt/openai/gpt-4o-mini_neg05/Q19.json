    "**Customizable Lens Tinting**: Introduce lenses that can change tint based on the environment or user preference. Using a simple app, wearers could adjust the level of tint to reduce glare when outdoors or switch to clear lenses indoors. This technology could be powered by a small solar cell embedded in the frame, ensuring that the glasses are energy-efficient and self-sustaining.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop glasses that monitor vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and even stress indicators through sensors built into the frame. The data could be synced with a mobile app, providing users with real-time health insights and alerts. This would be especially beneficial for those with chronic health conditions or fitness enthusiasts looking to optimize their workouts.",
    "**Foldable and Lightweight Design**: Create a new type of glasses that can be easily folded into a compact size, making them more portable and convenient for users on the go. Using advanced materials like carbon fiber or flexible plastics, these glasses would not only be lightweight but also durable, ensuring they can withstand everyday wear and tear while being easy to store in pockets or small cases.",
    "**Built-in Audio System**: Integrate bone conduction speakers into the glasses' frame, allowing users to listen to music, take phone calls, or interact with voice assistants without the need for earbuds. This would enhance the user experience by keeping the ears open to ambient sounds while still providing high-quality audio. The audio system could also feature noise-cancellation technology to minimize distractions in loud environments.",
    "**Personalized Frame Styles with 3D Printing**: Offer a service that allows customers to design their own glasses frames using a 3D printing platform. Users could select from various styles, colors, and materials, ensuring their glasses are a perfect fit for their personality and face shape. This customization would also include the option to engrave names or meaningful symbols on the frame, making each pair unique."
