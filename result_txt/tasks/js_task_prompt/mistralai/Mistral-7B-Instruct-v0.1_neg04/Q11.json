    "Create a \"Weather Controlled\" vacation package: I would create a vacation package that allows people to control the weather in the destination they are visiting. This could include options to control the temperature, humidity, and precipitation. For example, if someone wanted to go on a beach vacation but didn't want to deal with the heat, they could use the package to lower the temperature.",
    "Weather-based art installations: I would use my weather-controlling powers to create art installations that are based on the weather. For example, I could create a large sculpture that changes color based on the temperature or a fountain that spouts water in a specific pattern based on the wind.",
    "Climate-based agriculture: I would use my powers to create a sustainable farming system that is based on the climate. For example, if the weather forecast predicts a heatwave, I could use my powers to create a greenhouse that maintains a cool temperature.",
    "Weather-based sports: I would create sports that are based on the weather. For example, I could create a snowboarding competition where the snow is made by controlling the temperature and humidity.",
    "Weather-based fashion: I would use my powers to create clothing that is based on the weather. For example, I could create a coat that changes color based on the temperature or a hat that changes shape based on the wind."
