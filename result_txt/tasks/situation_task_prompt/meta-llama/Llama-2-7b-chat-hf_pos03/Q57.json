    "Aqua City: Create an underwater metropolis that is a self-sustaining ecosystem. The city would be built with advanced materials that can withstand the high pressure of the deep ocean. It would have towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and a variety of industries such as marine research, renewable energy, and sustainable food production. The city would also have a network of underwater tunnels and transportation systems connecting it to other nearby oceanic communities.",
    "Floating Islands: Develop a series of floating islands that would provide a safe haven for people displaced by rising ocean levels. Each island would be made of a lightweight, buoyant material and would be anchored to the ocean floor using a system of underwater anchors. The islands would be designed to be self-sufficient, with their own food production, water collection, and waste management systems. They would also have housing, schools, and community centers.",
    "Submerged Cities: Transform existing coastal cities into submerged cities by building walls to enclose the city and protect it from the rising ocean levels. The walls would be made of advanced materials that can withstand the pressure of the water and would be designed to allow for the flow of ocean currents and marine life. Inside the walls, the city would continue to function as normal, with residents living their daily lives as if the city were a large, underwater bubble.",
    "Water-Breathing Cities: Create cities that are capable of breathing and adapting to the changing ocean levels. These cities would be designed with built-in water filtration systems that can purify seawater and make it potable for residents. The cities would also have advanced irrigation systems that can support agriculture and food production in areas where the water level is stable. As the ocean levels rise, the cities would expand to accommodate the water, and as the levels drop, they would contract to conserve resources.",
    "Ocean-Friendly Architecture: Design buildings and structures that are specifically adapted to the ocean environment. These structures would be made of materials that are resistant to corrosion and erosion, and would be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the ocean. They would also be designed to minimize their impact on the marine ecosystem, with features such as under"
