    "**Patterns and Rhythms**: Many animals and plants have built-in circadian rhythms that occur naturally and regularly. By observing the behavior of certain species or the blooming times of flowers and plants, one could potentially use this information to determine the time of day or the season.",
    "**Candle Clock**: Although this might not be precise, burning a large, slow-burning candle could help to judge the passage of time. By watching the amount of wax melting per hour, one could make a rough estimate of the time elapsed.",
    "**Marking the Sky**: With the understanding of the apparent path of the sun, one could mark the sky with small, temporary markings to track the time. As the sun moves across the sky, the position of these marks would indicate the time of the day.",
    "**Sandglass**: An ancient method of timekeeping is to use a sandglass. This involves pouring sand from one container to another, and the time elapsed can be inferred from the amount of sand transferred between the two containers.",
    "**Pendulums and Mechanisms**: Developing a simple pendulum or mechanical device that takes advantage of natural forces, such as oscillations or vibrations, could provide a way to measure time without electricity or other resources."
