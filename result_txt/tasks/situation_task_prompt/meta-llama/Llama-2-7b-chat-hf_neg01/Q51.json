    "Buoyant Bubble Bridge: Create a series of interconnected, air-filled bubbles that can be inflated and deflated as needed. These bubbles could be made of a durable, puncture-resistant material, such as silicone or plastic, and could be connected by a network of elastic cords or ropes. When inflated, the bubbles would provide a buoyant and stable platform for crossing the river. As the bubbles are deflated, they could be used as flotation devices for swimming or floating downstream.",
    "AquaTrike: Design a three-wheeled vehicle that can float on the water, with each wheel consisting of a hollow, watertight container filled with water. The container would provide buoyancy, allowing the vehicle to stay afloat while the driver steers and controls the direction of the vehicle. The AquaTrike could be powered by a combination of human pedaling and an electric motor, providing a sustainable and efficient means of transportation across the river.",
    "River Raft Treehouse: Create a treehouse-like structure that is designed to float on the river, using a combination of wooden planks and inflatable tubes. The treehouse could be anchored to the riverbank with ropes and anchors, providing a stable platform for crossing the river. The inflatable tubes would provide buoyancy, while the wooden planks would provide a sturdy and comfortable surface for passengers to stand or sit on.",
    "Water Wingsuit: Design a specialized jumpsuit with built-in wings that could be inflated with air or water, providing a secure and stable platform for crossing the river. The wingsuit would be made of a lightweight, durable material, such as nylon or polyester, and would be equipped with an inflation system that could be activated by a simple valve or lever. As the wearer jumps into the river, the wings would inflate, providing a stable and secure platform for swimming or floating downstream."
