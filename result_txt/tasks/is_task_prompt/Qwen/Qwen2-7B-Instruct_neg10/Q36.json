For instance, if you're cleaning your room, make it a competition to see how efficiently or creatively you can organize your belongings. Use timers to see if you can beat your previous record. If you're cooking, try to create a dish using only ingredients starting with the same letter. This adds an element of fun and creativity to everyday activities.",
