    "**Environmental Degradation**: The park may face issues related to soil erosion, pollution, and damage to ecosystems from overuse by visitors. This can be exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure, such as poorly maintained trails or insufficient waste disposal facilities. To address this, park managers could initiate a sustainable tourism plan that includes the construction of durable trails, designated camping areas, and waste management systems that encourage recycling and composting.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems, outcompete native flora and fauna, and lead to significant biodiversity loss. For example, invasive plants may choke out native plants, affecting food sources for local wildlife. A potential solution could involve regular monitoring and removal of invasive species, alongside educational campaigns to inform visitors about the importance of preserving native biodiversity and preventing the spread of invasive plants.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often operate under tight budgets, which can limit maintenance, staffing, and programming. This may lead to inadequate visitor services, unsafe conditions, and reduced conservation efforts. To combat this, park management could pursue alternative funding sources, such as partnerships with local businesses, grants from conservation organizations, and community fundraising events, to enhance resources for park operations.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Overcrowding**: High visitor numbers can lead to overcrowding in popular areas, increasing the risk of accidents and diminishing the quality of the visitor experience. Additionally, overcrowding can strain park resources and impact wildlife. To manage this, park officials could implement a reservation system for certain trails and campsites, establish visitor caps during peak seasons, and create alternative routes to distribute foot traffic more evenly throughout the park.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: Climate change poses significant threats to national parks, including altered weather patterns, increased frequency of wildfires, and shifting habitats for wildlife. This can lead to challenges in maintaining park infrastructure and preserving ecosystems. Park management could proactively develop climate adaptation strategies, such as creating firebreaks, restoring native vegetation, and implementing water conservation practices to enhance resilience against climate-related changes."
