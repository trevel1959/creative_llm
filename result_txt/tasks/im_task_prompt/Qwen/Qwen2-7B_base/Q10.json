    "Improved Battery Life: A laptop with longer battery life would make it more convenient for users to work or surf the internet without worrying about running out of power. Manufacturers can achieve this by using more efficient components or increasing the capacity of the battery.",
    "Increased Portability: Laptops can be made smaller and thinner without compromising on performance, allowing users to carry them around with greater ease. This means that laptops can be used on the go, and users don't have to carry bulky bags to carry their laptops.",
    "Enhanced Security: Security features can be added to laptops to improve on the existing security measures. One of the best ways to do this is by implementing biometric authentication that allows the user to unlock the laptop by simply using a fingerprint or facial recognition, rather than a static login password.",
    "Enhanced Durability: Improving the durability of laptops is essential to ensure that they last longer. Manufacturers can add features like shock absorbent casing and water and dust resistance to make sure that the laptop can withstand any weather or environmental conditions.",
    "Adding Backlit Keboards : A backlit keypad would make typing in low light environments more comfortable and easier. This also would prove beneficial in situations where there is no access to sufficient lighting."
