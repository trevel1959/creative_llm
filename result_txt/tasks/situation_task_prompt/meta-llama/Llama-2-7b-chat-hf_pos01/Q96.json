    "Sand-based games: I would create a sand-based board game where players compete to build the most creative sandcastle or sculpture. The game could be played on a large, flat surface, and players would use sand-filled containers to create their structures. The game would encourage creativity and teamwork, and the winner would be the player or team with the most impressive structure. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Sand-powered vehicles: I would design a vehicle that runs on sand, using the grains as a fuel source. The vehicle would be powered by a specialized engine that converts the kinetic energy of the sand into motion. The vehicle could be used for transportation or racing, and it would be a unique and environmentally friendly way to enjoy the beach. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Sand-based art: I would create a series of sand-based art installations that transform the beach into a work of art. The installations could include sand mandalas, sand sculptures, and sand-painted murals. The art would be created using a variety of techniques, including sand-pouring, sand-carving, and sand-painting. The installations would be temporary, lasting only as long as the tide or weather permits, adding an element of impermanence and beauty to the beach experience. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Sand-based music: I would create a musical instrument that uses sand as its primary sound source. The instrument could be a sand-filled container that is struck or scraped to produce different notes and sounds. The instrument could be used to create a variety of musical styles, from soothing ocean waves to energetic beach party tunes. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Sand-based architecture: I would design a series of sand-based structures that transform the beach into a miniature city. The structures could include sand-based buildings, sand-filled bridges, and sand-covered roads. The structures would be temporary, lasting only as long as the tide or weather permits, adding an element of impermanence and beauty to the beach experience. Confidence score: 0.9"
