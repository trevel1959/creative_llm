    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the coat rack, allowing it to connect to a mobile app. The app could provide reminders for when to wear certain coats based on weather forecasts, or it could include a tracking feature to locate lost items. Additionally, the rack could have built-in sensors to detect when a coat is hung or removed, providing insights into usage patterns.",
    "**Artistic Elements with Functional Lighting**: Design a coat rack that doubles as a piece of art by incorporating sculptural elements and integrated LED lighting. The lighting could change colors based on the time of day or mood settings, enhancing the ambiance of the entryway. This would transform a functional object into a stylish statement piece, making it visually appealing while still serving its purpose.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Upcycling Features**: Focus on sustainability by using reclaimed wood or recycled materials to construct the coat rack. Additionally, design the rack to include compartments for storing reusable shopping bags or umbrellas, encouraging eco-friendly practices. This not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also adds functionality to the coat rack.",
    "**Personalized Name Tags and Photo Displays**: Create a coat rack that features customizable name tags or photo frames on each hook. Users can display their family members' names or photos alongside their coats, making it easier to identify whose coat belongs to whom. This personal touch adds a sense of ownership and can be a great conversation starter for guests.",
    "**Multi-Functional Storage Solutions**: Integrate additional storage solutions into the coat rack, such as drawers or shelves for shoes, hats, or gloves. This multi-functional approach maximizes space and keeps the entryway organized. The drawers could have dividers for better organization, and the shelves could be adjustable to accommodate different sizes of items."
