    "Solar-Powered Lights: Utilize portable solar-powered lights, such as lanterns or battery-powered lights, to provide ample light during the day. These lights can be charged during the day using natural light or indoor light sources, ensuring they provide consistent light throughout the day.",
    "Light-Emitting Plant Covers: Develop plant covers with built-in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that can be placed on windowsills or other areas where plants are placed. These covers would provide a soft, natural light during the day, supplementing the lack of sunlight.",
    "Mirrored Reflective Windows: Install mirrored reflective windows in strategic locations to reflect natural light from surrounding areas into the room. This would amplify the available light, creating a brighter and more illuminated space.",
    "Light-Harvesting Fabrics: Design fabrics with built-in light-harvesting capabilities, such as photovoltaic cells or fiber-optic cables. These fabrics could be used to create awnings, curtains, or even clothing, providing a sustainable and portable light source.",
    "Atmospheric Lighting: Develop a system that utilizes atmospheric gases to create a soft, ambient light. This could involve using gases like helium or hydrogen to create a luminescent effect, providing a unique and creative lighting solution."
