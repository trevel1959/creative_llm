    "Interactive Virtual Reality Experience: Create an immersive VR experience where users are placed in a virtual environment where they see and interact with a virtual version of their own hand. Users can touch and manipulate the virtual hand, and the VR system will use sensors to track the user's movements, making the virtual hand move in sync with the user's real hand. This will create a strong sense of ownership and agency, making users feel as if their virtual hand is an extension of their own body.",
    "Sensory Deprivation Tank: Design a sensory deprivation tank that mimics the experience of having a rubber hand. The tank will be filled with water and will have a soft, flexible rubber hand that users can hold onto. The tank will be designed to completely isolate the user from external sensory inputs, such as light and sound, allowing the user to focus solely on the sensation of the rubber hand. This will create a dissociation between the user's body and their sense of self, leading to a deeper understanding of the nature of self and body awareness.",
    "Robotic Prosthetic Hand: Develop a robotic prosthetic hand that is designed to mimic the feel and movement of a rubber hand. The prosthetic will be made of soft, flexible materials and will be designed to be worn on the user's stump. The hand will be equipped with sensors that detect the user's movements and translate them into movements of the prosthetic hand, creating a seamless and intuitive experience. This will allow users to perform a wide range of tasks, such as grasping and manipulating objects, with greater ease and dexterity.",
    "Mindfulness Meditation App: Create a mindfulness meditation app that uses the concept of the rubber hand to help users cultivate a greater sense of body awareness and self-awareness. The app will use guided meditations and interactive exercises to help users focus on their breath, posture, and the sensations in their body. The app will also include a virtual rubber hand that users can interact with, allowing them to explore the sensation of their body and the boundaries of their self.",
    "Therapeutic Playground: Design a therapeutic playground that incorporates the concept of the rub"
