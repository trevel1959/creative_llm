    "Solar panels, if all batteries stopped working, one could use solar panels to generate electricity and power their devices. Solar panels can be attached to the roof or walls of a house or building and use the sun's energy to generate electricity. This is a great alternative to traditional batteries and can be usedBel for long-termBel usage.",
    "Wind turbinesBel, if all batteries stopped working,Bel one could use wind turbines to generate electricity and power their devices. Wind turbines can be installed in areas with high wind speeds andBel use the wind's energy to generate electricity. This is a great alternative to traditional batteries and can be usedBelBel for long-term usage.",
    "Hydroelectric powerBel, if all batteries stopped working,Bel one could use hydroelectric power to generate electricity and power their devices. Hydroelectric power is generated by the movement of water through turbines, which generates electricity. This is a great alternative to traditional batteries and can be usedBelBel for long-term usage.",
    "Geothermal energyBel, if all batteries stopped working,Bel one could use geothermal energy to generate electricity and power their devices. Geothermal energy is generated by the heat from the earth's core and can be used to generate electricity. This is a great alternative to traditional batteries and can be usedBelBel for long-term usage.",
    "Biomass fuel cellsBel, if all batteries stopped working,Bel one could use biomass fuel cells to generate electricity and power their devices. Biomass fuel cells use organic matter to generate electricity, which is a great alternative to traditional batteries. This is a great alternative to traditional batteries and can be usedBelBel for long-term usage."
