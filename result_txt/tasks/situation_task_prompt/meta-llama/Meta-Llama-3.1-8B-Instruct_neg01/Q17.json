    "**Solar-Powered Survival Kit**: I'd create a portable solar-powered kit that includes a water filtration system, a solar-powered stove, and a communication device (like a satellite phone or a two-way radio). This kit would allow me to purify water, cook food, and stay connected with the outside world, even without electricity. The solar panels would charge during the day, providing power for the night.",
    "**Wind-Powered Generator**: I'd build a wind-powered generator using a combination of a wind turbine, a battery bank, and a DC-DC converter. This setup would allow me to generate electricity from wind energy, powering essential devices like a water pump, a radio, and a lantern. I'd also install a backup power source, like a small battery pack, to ensure continuous power during periods of low wind.",
    "**Biomass-Powered Cooking**: I'd use a biomass-powered cooking system, which would burn organic materials like wood, charcoal, or agricultural waste to produce heat and energy. This system would allow me to cook food and boil water without relying on electricity. I'd also use a heat exchanger to capture and store excess heat, which could be used for other purposes, like warming a small space.",
    "**Human-Powered Tools**: I'd focus on developing and using human-powered tools, like a bicycle-powered generator, a hand-cranked water pump, and a manual saw. These tools would allow me to perform essential tasks, like pumping water, cutting firewood, and generating electricity, without relying on electricity. I'd also use a manual treadmill to generate electricity, which could power small devices like a radio or a lantern.",
    "**Hydro-Powered Water Purification**: I'd design a hydro-powered water purification system that uses a small hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity. This electricity would power a water purification system, which would use UV light, filtration, or other methods to purify water from a nearby stream or river. The system would also include a storage tank to hold purified water, ensuring a steady supply even during periods of low water flow."
