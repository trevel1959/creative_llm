    "The Sun Clock - Create a sundial that uses the position of the sun to indicate time. The sundial would have a flat surface with a vertical stick or gnomon that casts a shadow on a calibrated scale. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow will move along the scale, allowing people to tell time. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "The Water Clock - Develop a water clock that uses the flow of water to measure time. The clock would have a container filled with water, and a small hole at the bottom that allows water to flow out at a constant rate. The amount of water flowing out would be calibrated to indicate hours or minutes. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Shadow Clock - Create a clock that uses the shadows of objects to indicate time. The clock would have a series of objects with different lengths, each with a shadow that falls on a calibrated scale. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadows of the objects will move along the scale, allowing people to tell time. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Fire Clock - Develop a clock that uses the burning of a fuel source to indicate time. The clock would have a container with a fuel source, such as a candle or a small fire, and a calibrated scale that shows the amount of fuel consumed over time. As the fuel source burns, the amount of fuel consumed will indicate the passage of time. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "The Song Clock - Create a clock that uses music to indicate time. The clock would have a series of musical notes that are played at different intervals, with each interval representing a specific amount of time. As the musical notes are played, people can tell the time by recognizing the pattern of notes. Confidence Score: 0.7"
