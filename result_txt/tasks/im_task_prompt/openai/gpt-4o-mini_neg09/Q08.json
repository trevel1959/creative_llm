    "**Adjustable Temperature Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the specific needs of different items. For example, fruits and vegetables could have a slightly higher humidity zone, while meats and dairy could be kept at a colder temperature. Users could set these zones via a digital interface or an app, ensuring optimal storage conditions for each type of food.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Develop a refrigerator with a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light to disinfect surfaces and eliminate bacteria. This could help reduce odors and keep the interior hygienic without the need for regular manual cleaning. Users could activate this feature with a button or schedule it to run during off-peak hours.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Create a refrigerator that uses eco-friendly refrigerants and energy-efficient cooling technologies, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint but also lower energy costs for consumers. Additionally, a solar panel option could be integrated for off-grid use or energy savings.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Equip the refrigerator with a large, interactive touchscreen that serves as a central hub for family communication. Users could create grocery lists, post reminders, view calendars, and even watch cooking tutorials or stream music while in the kitchen. The screen could also display nutritional information for the items stored inside, helping users make healthier choices.",
    "**Flexible Shelving and Compartments**: Introduce modular shelving and compartments that can be easily adjusted or removed based on the size and shape of the items being stored. This could include sliding shelves, foldable racks, or even pull-out drawers that accommodate larger items like cakes or party platters, maximizing space and improving organization."
