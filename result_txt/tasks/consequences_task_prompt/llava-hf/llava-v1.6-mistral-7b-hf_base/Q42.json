    "Infrastructure would need to change: Buildings, roads, and other structures would be designed to withstand the lack of gravity. Additionally, transportation would likely involve some form of anti-gravitational propulsion system.",
    "Space and time dimension: The absence of gravity might alter the very fabric of space and time, leading to a different set of physics rules that govern the universe.",
    "New form of energy: If gravity is an optional force, it might be possible to harness it as a power source. Scientists might develop new ways to generate energy by manipulating the gravitational force between objects.",
    "Gravity tourism: Without gravity, tourists might be able to enjoy \"gravity-less\" activities, such as flying to various locations or walking on the walls of spacecrafts.",
    "The end of geology as we know it: Without gravity, natural processes like weathering and erosion would change, leading to a new scientific field that studies the earth's geology in a gravity-less world."
