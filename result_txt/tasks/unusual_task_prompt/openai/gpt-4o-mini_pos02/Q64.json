    "**Portable Candle Warmer**: Use a thermos to create a portable candle warmer. Simply place a small candle inside the thermos and pour hot water around it. The insulated walls will keep the heat in, gently warming the candle to release its fragrance without burning it. This is perfect for aromatherapy enthusiasts who want to enjoy their favorite scents anywhere.",
    "**Mini Greenhouse**: A thermos can serve as a mini greenhouse for starting seedlings. Fill the bottom with soil, plant your seeds, and then seal the thermos. The insulation helps maintain humidity and warmth, creating a perfect microclimate for germination. Once the seedlings are ready, you can easily transfer them to a garden or larger pot.",
    "**Emergency Survival Kit**: Repurpose a thermos as an emergency survival kit. Fill it with essential items like a whistle, firestarter, fishing line, hooks, a small knife, and some dried food. The thermos can keep these items safe from the elements, and in a pinch, you can use it to boil water or cook food.",
    "**Pet Travel Water Station**: Use a thermos as a portable water station for your pet during travel. Fill it with water and attach a collapsible pet bowl to the side. The thermos keeps the water cool and fresh, ensuring your furry friend stays hydrated on long trips or hikes without the mess of traditional bowls.",
    "**DIY Water Filter**: Turn a thermos into a simple water filter. Layer activated charcoal, sand, and gravel inside the thermos. When you pour dirty water in, the layers will filter out impurities, allowing you to drink cleaner water. While not a replacement for a professional water filter, this can be a useful tool in emergency situations."
