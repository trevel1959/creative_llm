    "Collecting water through fog harvesting: This is a process of collecting water droplets from fog using a special fog collection device. The device uses a material that attracts water droplets and then collects them into a container. This method can be used in areas where rainfall is scarce, and fog is present.",
    "Desalination: This is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it potable. This method can be used to collect freshwater from oceans and seas.",
    "Harvesting condensation: This method involves collecting water vapor that condenses on surfaces such as roofs, windows, and walls. This water can be collected using a condensation collection system, which includes a container and a cooling system.",
    "Collecting rainwater in underground tanks: This method involves digging underground tanks to collect rainwater. The tanks can be lined with a waterproof material to prevent leaks and can be connected to a filtration system to ensure that the water is clean and safe to drink.",
    "Using solar stills: This method involves using the sun's heat to evaporate water from a surface, such as a pond or river. The vapor is then condensed into a container, providing a source of freshwater. This method can be used in areas where rainfall is scarce, and the sun is present."
