    "**Task Envy**: Create a social media platform where people can share their task completion progress and compete with friends or colleagues. Users can set up a \"task board\" with their to-do lists and track their progress, earning badges and rewards as they complete tasks. The twist? The platform also allows users to share their progress publicly, fostering a sense of friendly competition and community.",
    "**Task Swap**: Develop an app that connects people who need help with specific tasks with individuals who are skilled in those areas. Users can browse through a list of available tasks, such as \"learn a new language\" or \"cook a new recipe,\" and swap tasks with others. For example, someone who wants to learn Spanish can swap tasks with someone who wants to learn French, and they can help each other out.",
    "**Task Mentor**: Design a platform that pairs individuals with mentors who can help them complete tasks more efficiently. Users can choose from a variety of mentors, each with their own expertise and experience. The mentor can provide guidance, share tips, and offer support to help the user complete their tasks.",
    "**Task Treasure Hunt**: Create a gamified platform that turns task completion into a treasure hunt. Users are presented with a series of tasks, each with a unique challenge or puzzle to solve. As users complete tasks, they earn rewards and unlock new challenges. The platform can also include a leaderboard, where users can compete with each other to see who can complete the most tasks.",
    "**Task Time Traveler**: Develop an app that allows users to travel back in time and relive their most productive hours. Users can select a specific time period, such as a productive morning or a focused afternoon, and relive those moments with the help of AI-powered reminders and task suggestions. The app can also provide insights on how to replicate those productive moments in the future. [/INST] "
