    "**Adaptive Lens Technology**: Develop sunglasses with lenses that automatically adjust their tint based on the intensity of sunlight and UV levels. This would provide optimal protection and comfort for the eyes in varying light conditions. Additionally, they could include a mode for indoor use, which reduces glare from artificial lighting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create sunglasses made from sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include recycled plastics or plant-based materials that reduce environmental impact. Promoting a line of eco-friendly sunglasses would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also contribute to reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames and Lenses**: Design sunglasses with a modular system that allows users to easily swap out frames and lenses. This customization would enable users to change colors or styles based on their outfits or activities. It would also reduce waste, as customers would only need to replace parts rather than the entire pair.",
    "**Built-in Audio Technology**: Incorporate bone conduction speakers into the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without blocking their ears. This design would enable users to stay aware of their surroundings while enjoying audio content, making it ideal for outdoor activities like cycling or jogging.",
    "**UV and Blue Light Protection**: Enhance sunglasses with dual protection against both UV rays and blue light emitted from screens. This feature would appeal to users who spend significant time outdoors as well as those who work on digital devices, providing comprehensive eye protection and reducing digital eye strain."
