    "**Eco-Friendly Infrastructure**: The city would be powered entirely by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Buildings would be designed with green roofs, and streets would be lined with trees and gardens to reduce urban heat island effects and improve air quality.",
    "**Innovative Transportation System**: The city would feature a network of self-driving electric vehicles, hyperloops, and high-speed maglev trains to reduce congestion and emissions. The transportation system would be integrated with a smart traffic management system to optimize routes and reduce travel times.",
    "**Sustainable Food Systems**: The city would have a closed-loop food system where food waste is minimized, and excess food is composted and reused as fertilizer. Urban farms and community gardens would provide fresh produce to residents, and a network of vertical farms would supply the city with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Inclusive and Accessible Public Spaces**: The city would feature a range of public spaces designed for people of all ages and abilities, including accessible parks, playgrounds, and public art installations. These spaces would be designed to promote social interaction, community engagement, and a sense of belonging.",
    "**Intelligent Waste Management**: The city would have a smart waste management system that uses AI and IoT sensors to optimize waste collection routes, reduce waste output, and increase recycling rates. This system would also provide real-time data on waste generation and recycling rates to inform policy decisions and public education campaigns."
