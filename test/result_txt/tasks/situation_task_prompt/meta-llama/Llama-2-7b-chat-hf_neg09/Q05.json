    "Use Solar-Powered Lamps: One solution would be to use solar-powered lamps that can provide light during the day. These lamps use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which can power LED bulbs. They are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and can be easily placed around the house or yard to provide ample light.",
    "Install LED Light Bulbs: Another option would be to replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs. LED bulbs use less energy and last longer than traditional bulbs, making them a more sustainable option. They also emit less heat, which can help reduce cooling costs during the summer months.",
    "Use Mirrors and Reflectors: Another creative solution would be to use mirrors and reflectors to bounce light around the room. By placing mirrors opposite windows or using reflectors to direct sunlight towards dark areas, more light can be reflected into the room. This can help supplement natural light during the day, reducing the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Install Skylights: For those who live in buildings with flat roofs, installing skylights can be a great option. Skylights can let in natural light from above, providing additional light during the day. They can be especially useful in rooms with limited natural light, such as basements or rooms on the north side of the building.",
    "Use Light-Emitting Plants: Finally, some plants are capable of producing their own light, known as bioluminescent plants. These plants can be placed around the house or yard to provide a natural source of light during the day. Some examples of bioluminescent plants include glowing mushrooms, glowing algae, and certain types of flowers."
