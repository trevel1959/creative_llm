    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: The handle of the paintbrush could be designed with an adjustable grip that molds to the artist's hand shape. Utilizing a soft, memory foam material, it would reduce fatigue during long painting sessions and improve control. The brush could also have a detachable grip that allows users to switch between different textures (smooth, ribbed, etc.) based on their preference.",
    "**Integrated Cleaning System**: To simplify the cleanup process, the paintbrush could feature a small reservoir for water or cleaning solution. After painting, the artist could press a button that releases the cleaning fluid through the bristles, flushing out the paint. This would save time and reduce the mess typically associated with cleaning brushes.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Instead of a single brush, this assistant could come with a variety of interchangeable brush heads that snap on and off easily. Artists could choose from fine-tipped, flat, round, or specialty shapes (like fan or angle brushes) depending on their project. Each head could have its own storage compartment within the handle for easy transport.",
    "**LED Light Guide**: For artists who work in low-light conditions, the paintbrush could feature a built-in LED light at the tip. This light would illuminate the painting surface, providing better visibility and precision, especially for detailed work. The brightness could be adjustable to suit different environments.",
    "**Digital Palette Integration**: The paintbrush could be designed to connect wirelessly to a digital palette that displays the colors being used in real-time. This palette could suggest complementary colors and track the artist's most-used colors, helping to streamline the creative process and encourage experimentation."
