    "**Sealing Plastic Bags**: Instead of using a heat sealer, a clothes iron can be used to seal plastic bags for food storage. By placing the bag between two pieces of parchment paper and running the iron over it, you can create a strong seal to keep food fresh. This is especially useful for vacuum-sealing items without a vacuum machine.",
    "**Removing Stickers and Adhesive Residue**: A clothes iron can help in removing stubborn stickers or adhesive residues from surfaces. By placing a cloth over the sticker and applying the iron on a low setting, the heat softens the adhesive, making it easier to peel off the sticker without damaging the underlying surface.",
    "**Creating Homemade Potpourri Bags**: Use a clothes iron to seal fabric pouches filled with dried flowers, herbs, and spices for potpourri. Simply sew or fold fabric into small bags, fill them with your chosen scents, and use the iron to seal the edges. This can create lovely gifts or fragrant additions to your home.",
    "**Quickly Flattening Craft Materials**: If you're working with paper crafts or scrapbooking, a clothes iron can quickly flatten curled or wrinkled paper. This can help you achieve a smoother surface for your projects without needing to buy a specialized tool.",
    "**Heat-Setting Fabric Paints**: After painting on fabric, you can use a clothes iron to heat-set the paint, ensuring it adheres properly and becomes washable. Place a cloth over the painted area and press the iron on a low setting for a few seconds, allowing your designs to last longer."
