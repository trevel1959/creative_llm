    "**Creative Writing Prompt Mirror**: Write a series of creative writing prompts that explore scenarios where the main character wishes they had started a project earlier.

    "**Visual Art Installation**: Create an art installation that visually represents the passage of time and the consequences of procrastination. Use mirrors to show different stages of a project, from conception to completion, with each mirror representing a moment when the project could have been started earlier.
