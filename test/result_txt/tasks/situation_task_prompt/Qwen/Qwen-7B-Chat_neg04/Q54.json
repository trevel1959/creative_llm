    "Using Airships: One possible solution could be to use airships to travel across the water. Airships are already being used for cargo transportation and can also be modified to carry passengers. With the absence of ships and boats, airships could become the primary mode of transportation over water.",
    "Using Drones: Another option could be to use drones to transport people and goods across the water. Drones have become increasingly popular in recent years and have been used for various purposes such as aerial photography and delivery services. With the right modifications, drones could be made capable of carrying larger loads and traveling longer distances.",
    "Using Hydrofoils: Hydrofoils are aircraft that operate by generating lift using wings that move through the water. They are already being used for military operations and can also be modified to carry passengers. With the absence of ships and boats, hydrofoils could become the preferred mode of transportation over water.",
    "Using Pneumatic Tires: Pneumatic tires are commonly used on land vehicles but can also be adapted for water transportation. By adding floats to the tires, it would be possible to create a boat-like vehicle that could navigate through the water. This could be a more affordable alternative to traditional boats and ships.",
    "Using Underwater Cables: Finally, underwater cables could be used to transport people and goods across the water. These cables could be laid beneath the surface of the water and connected to underwater stations. Passengers or cargo could then be transported from one station to another using underwater trains or submarines. While this idea may seem futuristic, it is not entirely impossible given advances in technology."
