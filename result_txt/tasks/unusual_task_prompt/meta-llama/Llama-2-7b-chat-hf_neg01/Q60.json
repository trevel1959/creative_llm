    "Smart Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger with built-in sensors that can detect when an item of clothing is placed on or removed from the hanger. The sensors can then use this information to automatically adjust the hanger's position in the closet, ensuring that clothes are always hung in the most efficient and organized way possible. This would save time and reduce clutter in the closet, making it easier to find what you're looking for.",
    "Virtual Closet: Develop a virtual closet app that allows users to upload photos of their clothes and create a digital inventory of their wardrobe. The app can then suggest outfit combinations based on the user's preferences and body type, as well as provide recommendations for styling and accessorizing. This would save time and reduce decision fatigue when getting dressed, as well as help users discover new and stylish combinations of clothes they may not have considered before.",
    "Scented Clothes Hangers: Create scented clothes hangers that can release fragrances throughout the day to keep clothes smelling fresh and clean. The hangers could be infused with natural essential oils or fragrances, such as lavender or eucalyptus, to provide a pleasant and relaxing scent. This would be especially useful for people who suffer from allergies or sensitivities to chemicals in traditional clothes hangers.",
    "Adjustable Clothes Hanger: Design a clothes hanger with adjustable height and angle settings, allowing users to customize the hanger to fit their specific clothing needs. For example, the hanger could have different height settings for different types of clothing, such as dresses, pants, and shirts, and different angle settings for different body types, such as petite, medium, or tall. This would ensure that clothes are hung in the most flattering and comfortable position for each individual.",
    "Interactive Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that can interact with users through voice commands or gestures, providing personalized styling suggestions and recommendations. For example, the hanger could ask the user about their preferences and style goals, and then provide suggestions for outfits and accessories based on their responses. The hanger could also offer fun and quirky comments or jokes to keep the user"
