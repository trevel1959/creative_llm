    "Pedal-powered vehicles: One creative solution would be to design and build pedal-powered vehicles, such as bicycles or tricycles, that could be used for long-distance travel. These vehicles would be powered by the rider's legs, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Solar-powered cars: Another idea would be to convert existing cars into solar-powered vehicles. This would involve installing solar panels on the car's body, which would capture sunlight and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle. This would not only provide a sustainable source of energy but also reduce the vehicle's carbon footprint.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could be used for long-distance travel. These trains use magnetic fields to lift and propel the train, reducing friction and increasing speed. Maglev trains are already in use in some countries, and they could be a viable option for inter-city travel in the event of a car breakdown.",
    "Hoverbikes: For shorter distances, hoverbikes could be an exciting solution. These bikes use fans or rotors to create lift and propulsion, allowing riders to glide above the ground without the need for wheels. Hoverbikes could be powered by electricity or even human energy, making them a sustainable and fun way to travel.",
    "Underwater travel: In the event of a car breakdown, underwater travel could be a unique solution. Submarines or other underwater vehicles could be used to transport people and goods between cities. This mode of transportation would be particularly useful for coastal cities or those located near large bodies of water."
