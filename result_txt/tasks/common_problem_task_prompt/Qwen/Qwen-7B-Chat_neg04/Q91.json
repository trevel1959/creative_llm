    "Water filtration system: Develop a low-cost water filtration system that can be easily installed in homes and communities in developing countries. The system could use materials like sand, gravel, and charcoal to remove impurities from contaminated water sources. This would provide access to clean drinking water for those who currently lack it.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Implement rainwater harvesting systems in schools, hospitals, and other public buildings in developing countries. These systems could capture and store rainwater for later use in irrigation or washing purposes. This would help conserve water resources and reduce dependence on groundwater.",
    "Water education program: Create a comprehensive water education program that teaches people about the importance of clean water and how to protect it. This program could include workshops, seminars, and educational materials in local languages. By educating people about water conservation and management, we can help ensure that future generations have access to clean water.",
    "Community-based water management: Establish community-based water management systems where local residents are responsible for managing and maintaining water resources. This approach would involve training local leaders and creating committees to oversee water distribution and conservation efforts. By involving the community in water management, we can build sustainable solutions that meet their needs.",
    "Water treatment plant: Invest in building a small-scale water treatment plant in a developing country. This plant could treat waste water from households and businesses and make it safe for consumption. By providing treated water to those who need it most, we can improve health outcomes and reduce waterborne diseases."
