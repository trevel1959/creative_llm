    "**Utilize Reflective Materials**: Develop a large, reflective surface that can be positioned strategically to reflect existing light sources. This could involve creating a giant mirror or using a series of smaller mirrors that are directed towards specific areas. This idea leverages the natural sunlight we currently have, enhancing its reach throughout the day.",
    "**Solar-powered Light Collectors**: Design a system of solar panels that not only harnesses the sun's energy but also collects ambient light from the sky. These collectors could be placed in strategic locations like rooftops or public squares. The collected light is then stored in batteries for use when the sun doesn't rise. ",
    "**Artificial Sky**: Create an artificial sky that simulates sunlight through a series of LED lights. This could be a large dome or canopy structure that covers an area, emitting light in the morning and evening hours. The system could be programmed to mimic sunrise and sunset times for natural light conditions.",
    "**Light-Generating Plants**: Cultivate plants specifically engineered to emit light at night. These plants could be genetically modified to produce a glow under certain conditions, providing illumination when natural light isnâ€™t available. This innovative solution involves biotechnology and could potentially lead to sustainable lighting alternatives.",
    "**Moonlight Magnification**: If the moon is visible, develop a system to magnify and channel moonlight into buildings and public spaces. This might involve large, reflective surfaces that collect moonlight and direct it into specific areas. The system could be automated to adjust angles based on the moon's position, ensuring maximum light intake during the lunar night. "
