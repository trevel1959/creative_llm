    "Geotextile-based Gardening: In a scenario where the ground becomes too hard to dig into, a creative solution would be to utilize geotextiles, which are permeable fabrics used in construction and engineering. Geotextiles can be used to create a raised bed garden, allowing for optimal drainage and aeration while still providing a suitable growing environment for plants. The geotextile material can be filled with a mixture of soil, compost, and other organic matter, providing a nutrient-rich environment for plants to thrive.",
    "Floating Raft Gardening: Another option for planting a garden in hard ground is to use a floating raft system. This involves creating a platform made of materials such as wood or plastic, which floats on top of the hard ground. The platform is then filled with a mixture of soil, compost, and other organic matter, allowing for planting and growth. This method provides excellent drainage and aeration, as well as protection from extreme weather conditions.",
    "Vertical Gardening: In situations where the ground is too hard to dig into, a vertical garden can be an excellent solution. This involves creating a garden structure that is elevated off the ground, providing a suitable growing environment for plants. Materials such as trellises, arbors, or even old pallets can be used to create a vertical garden. By stacking containers or pockets with soil and plants, a diverse range of vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be grown in a small space.",
    "Hydroponic Gardening: Hydroponic gardening is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This can be an excellent option for planting a garden in hard ground, as it eliminates the need for digging or tilling. By creating a hydroponic system using materials such as PVC pipes, tubes, and reservoirs, plants can be grown in a controlled environment, providing optimal conditions for growth and development.",
    "Living Roof Gardening: In areas where the ground is too hard to dig into, a creative solution can be to create a living roof garden. This involves installing a layer of soil and plants on top of a waterproof membrane, providing a green roof for the building. The living roof"
