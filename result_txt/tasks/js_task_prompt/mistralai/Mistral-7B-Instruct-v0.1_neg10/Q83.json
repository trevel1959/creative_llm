    "24 Hours: If I could decide the length of a day, I would choose 24 hours because it is the standard length of a day and it is what most people are used to. It would also allow for a balanced day-night cycle and would make it easier to plan activities and schedules.",
    "28 Hours: I would choose 28 hours because it would allow for an extra day in the week without disrupting the work week. This extra day could be used for personal activities, relaxation, or catching up on work.",
    "30 Days: I would choose 30 days because it would allow for a longer period of time to complete tasks, plan trips, or take time off from work. This would give me more flexibility and control over my schedule.",
    "48 Hours: I would choose 48 hours because it would allow for an extended period of time to complete tasks or take a break from work. This would give me more time to focus on my personal life and hobbies.",
    "12 Hours: I would choose 12 hours because it would allow for a shorter workday and more time for relaxation and personal activities. This would help me to feel more balanced and less stressed."
