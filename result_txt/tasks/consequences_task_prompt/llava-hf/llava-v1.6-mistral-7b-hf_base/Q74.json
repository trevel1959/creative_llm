    "Air Pollution: The concentration of factories, vehicles, and buildings in a single city would result in significantly higher levels of air pollution. This could have severe health implications for the population, with more people suffering from respiratory diseases and other pollution-related illnesses.",
    "Energy Depletion: The demand for energy resources would be extremely high in a single city, leading to depletion of natural resources at a faster rate. This could have long-term implications on the planet's overall energy supply.",
    "Strain on Infrastructure: The infrastructure of a single city would not be able to support the entire world population. This would lead to strain on resources like water, electricity, and housing, causing shortages and driving up prices.",
    "Overpopulation: With everyone living in one place, there would be overpopulation, leading to limited space, urban sprawl, and potential clashes between different cultural groups.",
