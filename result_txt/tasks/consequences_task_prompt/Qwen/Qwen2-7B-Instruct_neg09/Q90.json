    "**Economic Stimulus**: Erasing all world debt would instantly inject a huge amount of money into the global economy, potentially stimulating growth in several ways. Businesses that have been struggling due to high debt loads might be able to invest more in expansion or research and development. This could lead to job creation, increased productivity, and economic growth.",
    "**Enhanced International Cooperation**: Countries might be more willing to engage in international projects like infrastructure development or environmental initiatives if their financial constraints were lifted. This could lead to a surge in collaborative efforts across borders, fostering stronger diplomatic relationships and potentially reducing conflicts over resources.",
    "**Increased Consumer Spending**: With debt burdens removed, consumers would likely experience an increase in disposable income. This could result in higher spending, which would directly boost industries such as retail, tourism, and entertainment. This could further stimulate economic growth by creating a positive feedback loop between consumer spending and business expansion.",
    "**Global Financial Stability**: The eradication of world debt could significantly reduce the risk of global financial crises. Countries that are currently at risk of default due to high debt levels would be relieved of this burden, allowing them to focus on economic recovery and growth without the constant threat of debt restructuring or bailouts.",
    "**Redistribution of Wealth**: While the immediate effects of debt cancellation might be positive for economic growth, it could also lead to significant wealth redistribution issues. Those who have benefited from the current financial system, such as creditors, investors, and those who hold substantial amounts of debt themselves, might feel disadvantaged. This could lead to social and political tensions if the benefits of debt cancellation are not equitably distributed among society's members."
