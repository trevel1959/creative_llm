    "Sleeping Pods: In a world without nighttime, people could use sleeping pods that simulate the effects of darkness on the body. These pods would use special lighting and sound technology to mimic the darkness and silence of nighttime, allowing people to get the rest they need. The pods could be rented or purchased and could be used in homes, offices, or public spaces.",
    "Light-Emitting Pillows: A new type of pillow could be invented that emits a gentle, constant light. This light would simulate the darkness of nighttime and allow people to sleep without the need for actual darkness. The pillow could be powered by a small battery or solar power, and could be adjusted to different brightness levels to suit individual preferences.",
    "Dreamscapes: A virtual reality technology could be developed that allows people to experience different dreamscapes during the day. Users could wear a VR headset and be transported to different environments, such as a peaceful forest or a bustling city, that would mimic the sensory experience of nighttime. This could help people get the rest they need without the need for actual darkness.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Optimization: A new type of wearable device could be invented that optimizes the wearer's circadian rhythm. This device would use sensors to monitor the wearer's body temperature, hormone levels, and other factors to determine the best time for sleep. It could then use light, sound, or other stimuli to help the wearer relax and fall asleep at the optimal time.",
    "Light-Blocking Glasses: Special glasses could be invented that block out all light, allowing people to sleep during the day. These glasses could be worn like sunglasses and would use special lenses that filter out all light, creating a dark environment for the wearer. This could be especially helpful for people who work night shifts or have irregular sleep schedules."
