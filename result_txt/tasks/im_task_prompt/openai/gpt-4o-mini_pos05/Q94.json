    "**Scented Candle with Aroma Diffusion**: Design a candle that not only burns but also has a built-in aroma diffuser. The candle could have a compartment for essential oils or fragrance beads that release additional scents as the candle burns. This dual-action feature would allow users to enjoy the warmth and light of a candle while also experiencing a more complex and layered scent profile.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Candle**: Introduce a refillable candle system where the outer container is made from sustainable materials, and the wax can be purchased in eco-friendly refill packs. This approach reduces waste and allows users to experiment with different scents without having to buy a new container each time. The refill packs could be made from biodegradable materials and come in a variety of scents.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Seeds**: Develop a line of candles that contain embedded seeds in the wax. Once the candle has burned down, users can plant the remnants in soil, and the seeds will germinate, giving rise to flowers or herbs. This eco-conscious approach promotes sustainability and allows users to create a living memory of their candle experience.",
    "**Multi-Use Candle with Built-in Bluetooth Speaker**: Combine the ambiance of a candle with the functionality of a Bluetooth speaker. This innovative design would allow users to enjoy their favorite music or podcasts while creating a cozy atmosphere. The candle could also feature touch controls on the side for easy operation and volume adjustment.",
    "**Candle with Interactive Storytelling**: Create a line of candles that come with a QR code on the packaging. When scanned, the code leads to an interactive storytelling experience that unfolds as the candle burns. Each section of the story could correspond to different phases of the candle's burn time, enhancing the user's experience and making the act of lighting a candle a more immersive event."
