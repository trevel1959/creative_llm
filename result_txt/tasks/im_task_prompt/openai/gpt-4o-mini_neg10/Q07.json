    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Filter**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a small water filtration system. Users can fill a reservoir with tap water, and as they brush, the toothbrush filters out impurities, providing clean water for rinsing. This could promote better oral hygiene while also addressing concerns about water quality in certain areas.",
    "**Scented Toothbrushes**: Introduce toothbrushes with interchangeable, scented bristles that release a pleasant aroma during brushing. This could enhance the brushing experience, making it more enjoyable and encouraging children (and adults) to brush longer. Different scents could be available, like mint, vanilla, or even seasonal flavors like pumpkin spice.",
    "**Toothbrush with Replaceable Heads and Eco-friendly Materials**: Create a toothbrush that features a durable handle made from sustainable materials (like bamboo or recycled plastics) and offers a range of replaceable heads. This would reduce plastic waste while allowing users to choose bristle firmness and head shape based on their personal preferences.",
    "**Musical Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush that plays music or sounds while brushing. Users can sync it with their favorite songs or listen to short audio clips that last for the recommended two minutes of brushing. This could make the task more enjoyable, especially for kids, and help them maintain the right brushing time.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**: Design a toothbrush with bristles that change color to indicate when itâ€™s time to replace the brush or when enough pressure is applied while brushing. This visual cue can help users maintain their toothbrushes better and avoid damaging their gums due to excessive pressure."
