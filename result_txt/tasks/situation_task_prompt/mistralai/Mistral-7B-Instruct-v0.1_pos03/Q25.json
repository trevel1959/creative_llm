    "Use a rope ladder: If all elevators stopped working, one could use a rope ladder to climb up the elevator shafts. The ladder could be tied to a strong point on the ground floor and then pulled up to the higher floors. This would require a lot of physical effort and could be dangerous if the ladder is not secured properly.",
    "Use a drone: Another option could be to use a drone to fly up the elevator shafts. The drone could be equipped with a camera and a small crane to lift a person up the building. This would require a lot of technical knowledge and could be expensive.",
    "Use a fire escape: If the building has a fire escape, one could use it to climb up the building. The fire escape could be accessed from a lower floor and then used to climb up the building. This would require a lot of physical effort and could be dangerous if the fire escape is not secure.",
    "Use a staircase: If the building has a staircase, one could use it to climb up the building. This would require a lot of physical effort and could be time-consuming.",
    "Use a window cleaning machine: Some buildings have window cleaning machines that can be used to clean windows from the inside. These machines could be modified to be used as a makeshift elevator. This would require a lot of technical knowledge and could be expensive."
