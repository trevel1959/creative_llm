    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns with Energy Storage**: Design a portable lantern that can harness and store solar energy during the day. The lantern would have a built-in battery and a solar panel, allowing it to charge throughout the day. At night, the lantern would use the stored energy to provide light, ensuring a reliable source of illumination. The lantern could also have a backup power source, such as a hand-crank or a small fuel cell, to provide additional light in case of prolonged darkness.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant-Based Lighting**: Develop a plant species that can produce a soft, blue-green glow, similar to fireflies. These plants could be cultivated in large quantities and placed in strategic locations to provide ambient lighting. The plants would require minimal maintenance and could be used to light public spaces, such as parks and streets. The bioluminescent plants could also be used to create unique and captivating light displays.",
    "**Aerial Drone Lighting System**: Design a network of aerial drones equipped with high-intensity LED lights. The drones would be programmed to fly in a grid pattern, providing a grid of light across the city. The drones could be controlled remotely, allowing for real-time adjustments to the lighting pattern. This system would provide a flexible and dynamic lighting solution, able to adapt to changing environmental conditions.",
    "**Fiber-Optic Street Lighting**: Develop a fiber-optic street lighting system that uses thin, flexible fibers to transmit light from a central source to streetlights. The fibers would be embedded in the road or pavement, providing a safe and durable lighting solution. The system could be powered by a central solar array or a network of small, energy-harvesting devices.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Light Houses**: Design a series of self-sustaining light houses that can generate their own energy and provide light to surrounding areas. The light houses would be equipped with solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems, allowing them to operate independently. The light houses could be used to illuminate remote areas, such as rural communities or disaster zones, and could also serve as emergency shelters and communication hubs. [/INST] "
