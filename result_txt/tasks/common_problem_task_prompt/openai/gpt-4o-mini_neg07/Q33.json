    "**Food Sources**: Finding adequate food is crucial for survival. The island may have limited edible plants or wildlife. To solve this, one could study the local ecosystem to identify which fruits, nuts, or roots are safe to eat. Setting up traps or fishing lines in nearby waters can also provide protein sources. Learning basic foraging and fishing techniques before embarking on an adventure could be beneficial.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Without proper shelter, exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion. One creative solution is to build a shelter using natural materials found on the island, such as palm fronds for roofing and driftwood for the frame. Constructing a raised platform can also protect against flooding and pests.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: If rescue is the goal, getting lost or disoriented on the island can be a significant issue. To combat this, one could create a makeshift compass using a needle and a leaf floating in water. Marking significant landmarks or using natural features to navigate can help maintain orientation. Keeping a log of the sun’s position throughout the day can also aid in navigation.",
    "**Health Risks from Injuries**: Injuries sustained while exploring or building shelter can become life-threatening without proper medical attention. To address this, one could improvise a first aid kit using natural antiseptics like honey or aloe vera and create splints from sturdy branches. It’s essential to remain cautious and avoid risky activities, prioritizing safety.",
    "**Mental Health Struggles**: Isolation on a deserted island can lead to feelings of loneliness, despair, or anxiety. To combat this, establishing a daily routine can help maintain a sense of normalcy. Engaging in creative activities like building art from found objects, journaling thoughts, or even talking to oneself can provide emotional relief. Practicing mindfulness or meditation can also improve mental resilience."
