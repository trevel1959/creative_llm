    "**Interactive Learning Neck**: Create a guitar neck that incorporates LED lights along the fretboard, which illuminate to indicate finger placements for chords and scales. This neck could connect to an app that tracks progress, offers interactive lessons, and even suggests songs to learn based on the playerâ€™s skill level. This would make learning visual and intuitive, especially for beginners.",
    "**Multi-Functional Guitar Pick**: Design a guitar pick that features built-in functionalities such as a metronome, a tuner, and a mini amplifier. The pick could connect to an app via Bluetooth, allowing players to control the metronome speed or adjust their tone settings directly from their phone. This would streamline practice sessions by providing essential tools in one convenient device.",
    "**Augmented Reality Learning Glasses**: Develop AR glasses specifically for guitar players that overlay visual guides onto the real-world guitar. As players look at their instrument, the glasses could display chord shapes, scales, and even song lyrics in real-time. This would enhance the learning experience, making it easier to follow along with lessons or play along with songs.",
    "**Ergonomic Guitar Stand with Built-in Accessories**: Create a guitar stand that is not only ergonomic but also features built-in compartments for accessories like picks, capos, and sheet music. The stand could be adjustable to accommodate different playing heights and angles, ensuring comfort during practice or performance. Additionally, it could include a charging station for electronic devices, making it a versatile addition to any guitarist's setup.",
    "**Wireless Effects Pedal Board**: Innovate a wireless effects pedal board that connects to the guitar and amplifier without cumbersome cables. This pedal board could be controlled via a mobile app, allowing players to easily switch effects, adjust settings, and even create custom sound profiles on the fly. It would offer more freedom of movement on stage and during practice, reducing clutter and setup time."
