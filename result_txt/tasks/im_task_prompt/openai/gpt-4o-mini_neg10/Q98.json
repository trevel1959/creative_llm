    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature where the juicer can automatically rinse its parts after use. By simply adding water and a cleaning solution, the juicer would perform a cleaning cycle, using jets of water to flush out pulp and residue. This would save users time and encourage them to juice more often without the hassle of cleanup.",
    "**Modular Juicing System**: Create a modular juicer with interchangeable components for different juicing methods (e.g., centrifugal, masticating, cold press). Users can easily swap out parts based on their needs or preferences for the day, allowing them to experiment with different juicing techniques without needing multiple machines.",
    "**Juice Infuser Attachment**: Design an attachment that allows users to infuse their juices with herbs, spices, or superfoods. After juicing, users can add their chosen ingredients into a special compartment that steep into the juice, enhancing flavor and nutritional value. This would encourage creativity and experimentation with flavor profiles.",
    "**Juicer with Built-in Recipe Book**: Equip the juicer with a small screen that displays a rotating selection of juice recipes. Users can scroll through options and select recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. The juicer could even suggest complementary pairings or tips for enhancing flavors, making the juicing experience more interactive.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Pulp Compactor**: Integrate a pulp compactor that compresses the leftover pulp into compact disks, making it easier for users to dispose of or compost. This would not only reduce mess but also promote sustainability by encouraging users to recycle the pulp for other uses, such as baking or as garden compost."
