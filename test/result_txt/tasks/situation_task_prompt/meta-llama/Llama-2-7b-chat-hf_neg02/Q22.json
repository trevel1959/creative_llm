    "Personalized Transportation Networks: With all roads disappearing, individuals could create their personalized transportation networks using alternative modes of transportation like skateboards, scooters, and bicycles. This would enable them to move around their town or city with ease and convenience while reducing carbon footprints.",
    "Hyperloops: A futuristic solution could be the implementation of hyperloops, a high-speed transportation system that would allow people to travel long distances in a matter of minutes. This technology is still in its infancy but could revolutionize the way people move around if roads disappeared.",
    "Waterways: In coastal towns or cities, waterways could become the primary mode of transportation. People could use boats, kayaks, or even paddleboards to navigate through the water, providing a quick and efficient way to move around. This could also open up new opportunities for tourism and recreation.",
    "Airborne Transportation: For those who live in cities with nearby airports, airborne transportation could become the go-to mode of transportation. People could use small planes, helicopters, or even drones to travel short distances, reducing travel time and offering a unique perspective on the cityscape.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could become the primary mode of transportation in cities where there are existing maglev train systems. These trains use magnetic fields to levitate and move along tracks, reducing friction and allowing for faster travel times. This would be an efficient and eco-friendly way to move around a city without relying on roads."
