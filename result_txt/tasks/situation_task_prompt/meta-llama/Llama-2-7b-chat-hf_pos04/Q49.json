    "DIY Fireproof Shelter: Create a DIY fireproof shelter using materials like sand, soil, and water. Dig a trench around your home, filling it with a mixture of sand and soil. This will create a barrier that can help slow down the spread of flames. Cover the top of the trench with a layer of water, creating a watertight seal. This will help to smother the flames and protect your home from direct heat.",
    "Fire-Resistant Materials: Use fire-resistant materials like brick, stone, or concrete to build a wall around your home. These materials are non-combustible and can help to block the path of the fire. You can also use fire-resistant roofing materials like ceramic tiles or metal to protect your home from above.",
    "Fire-Fighting Drone: Develop a drone that can detect and extinguish fires. This drone can be equipped with sensors that can detect heat signatures, allowing it to locate fires quickly. It can also be equipped with a water tank or fire retardant to put out the flames.",
    "Fire-Proof Windows: Install fire-proof windows in your home. These windows are made of materials that are resistant to heat and flames, such as tempered glass or ceramic. They can help to keep the flames out of your home and protect you and your family from harm.",
    "Fire-Detecting System: Develop a fire-detecting system that can detect fires before they spread. This system can use sensors to detect heat signatures or smoke particles in the air, alerting you to the presence of a fire. It can also be connected to a fire alarm, sounding an alarm in your home if a fire is detected."
