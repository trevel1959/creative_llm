    "Kayak: Another option to travel across a large body of water would be to use a kayak. Kayaks are small, lightweight boats that can be easily maneuvered by a single person. They are often used for short trips or for exploring coastal areas, but they could also be used to cross larger bodies of water.",
    "Stand-up paddleboard: A stand-up paddleboard is a type of board that is propelled by a person standing on it and paddling with a long paddle. They are often used for recreational purposes, but they could also be used to travel across a large body of water.",
    "Raft: A raft is a type of boat that is made of inflatable materials and is often used for whitewater rafting. It could be used to travel across a large body of water, but it would not be suitable for rough seas or choppy waters.",
    "Hovercraft: A hovercraft is a vehicle that floats on a cushion of air and can travel over land or water. They are often used for short trips, but they could also be used to travel across a large body of water.",
    "Swim: If all ships and boats disappeared, one option to travel across a large body of water would be to swim. This would be the most direct way to cross the water, but it would be extremely challenging and would require a high level of physical fitness."
