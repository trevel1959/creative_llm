    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Safety Features and Wearable Tech**: Design a smart bicycle helmet that incorporates cutting-edge safety features, such as automatic collision detection, impact-absorbing materials, and a built-in emergency alert system. The helmet would also include wearable technology like GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, and integration with popular fitness apps. This innovative design would not only enhance the safety of cyclists but also provide valuable insights into their riding habits and health metrics.",
    "**Modular, Interchangeable Helmet Components**: Develop a modular bicycle helmet system where users can easily swap out different components, such as visors, ear protection, or even a built-in camera, to suit their specific needs and preferences. This design would allow riders to customize their helmet to match their riding style, weather conditions, or even their personal style. The modular design would also make it easier to upgrade or replace individual components, reducing electronic waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Augmented Reality Display**: Create a bicycle helmet with an integrated augmented reality (AR) display that provides riders with real-time information about their surroundings, such as traffic updates, road conditions, or even virtual navigation cues. The AR display would be projected onto a transparent visor, allowing riders to stay focused on the road while still accessing valuable information. This innovative design would revolutionize the way cyclists navigate and interact with their environment.",
    "**Biometric Feedback Helmet with Personalized Coaching**: Design a bicycle helmet that incorporates biometric sensors to track the rider's physical and mental state in real-time. The helmet would provide personalized coaching and feedback, offering suggestions for improving technique, managing fatigue, and enhancing overall performance. This cutting-edge design would enable riders to optimize their training, reduce the risk of injury, and enhance their overall cycling experience.",
    "**Sustainable, Recyclable Helmet Made from Plant-Based Materials**: Develop a bicycle helmet made from plant-based materials, such as bioplastics or natural fibers, that is fully recyclable and compostable. This eco-friendly design would not only reduce the environmental impact of traditional helmets but also provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution for cyclists. The helmet would be designed to be lightweight, durable, and comfortable, making it an attractive option for environmentally conscious riders. [/INST] "
