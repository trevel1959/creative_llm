    "**Innovative Seating Design**: Create a chair that combines ergonomic design principles with advanced technology. The chair can adjust its shape based on the user's posture, providing customized support to prevent back pain and promote comfort. It could also include features like vibration massage, heating elements, or built-in sensors that communicate with wearable devices to monitor health metrics such as heart rate and stress levels.",
    "**Sustainable Furniture**: Develop a line of chairs made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastics, bamboo, or reclaimed wood. These chairs would be designed for both indoor and outdoor use, offering durability and aesthetic appeal while reducing environmental impact. Incorporate modular components that allow for easy repair and recycling at the end of the chair's life cycle.",
    "**Interactive Learning Chair**: Design a chair specifically for students that integrates educational technology. The chair could have built-in tablets or projectors, allowing users to view educational content directly on the seat or armrests. It might also include haptic feedback for interactive learning experiences, such as simulating the sensation of riding a bike or experiencing a historical event.",
    "**Reclining Gaming Chair**: Create a gaming chair that not only supports long hours of gaming but also offers customization options for different gaming scenarios. The chair could have adjustable backrest angles, lumbar support, and headrests for various game types (e.g., action, strategy, sports). It might also include built-in audio systems, USB ports, and cooling fans to keep players comfortable during intense gaming sessions.",
    "**Portable Office Chair**: Design a lightweight, foldable chair that is perfect for remote workers who need to set up a temporary workspace in various locations.
