    "**Limited Communication**: The absence of electricity would severely limit access to communication tools such as phones, computers, and the internet. This could lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the outside world. To address this, people could rely on community bulletin boards, written letters, or even local meet-ups to share information and stay connected with friends and family.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Issues**: Living without electricity poses challenges for temperature control in homes. In colder climates, heating becomes a concern, as traditional heating systems rely on electricity. Individuals might need to explore alternative heating sources, such as wood stoves, kerosene heaters, or solar heating systems. In warmer climates, cooling becomes a challenge, requiring creative solutions like using fans powered by batteries or building shade structures.",
    "**Water Supply Limitations**: Many households depend on electric pumps for their water supply. Without electricity, accessing clean water can become a major hurdle. People may need to find alternative water sources, such as nearby rivers or lakes, and develop methods for purifying water through boiling or filtration. Rainwater harvesting systems could also be implemented to create a sustainable water supply.",
    "**Lack of Entertainment and Leisure Activities**: Without electricity, entertainment options become limited, leading to potential boredom and decreased mental well-being. To counter this, families and communities could engage in more outdoor activities, such as hiking, gardening, or playing sports. Board games, storytelling, and arts and crafts can also provide creative outlets for entertainment and bonding.",
    "**Increased Safety Risks**: Living without electricity can increase safety risks, especially at night when visibility is low. Without streetlights or indoor lighting, accidents and injuries may occur more frequently. To enhance safety, individuals can invest in solar-powered lights, lanterns, or candles. Communities could organize safety patrols or buddy systems to ensure that vulnerable individuals are supported during dark hours."
