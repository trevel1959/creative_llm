    "Increased herbivory on plants: Many insects act as natural pests, consuming plant leaves and stems. Without them, herbivorous animals like deer, goats, and rabbits would have more access to plant material, leading to overgrazing and plant degradation.",
    "Reduced pollination: Many insects, such as bees, butterflies, and moths, are responsible for pollinating plants. Without them, crops like fruits, vegetables, and flowers would struggle to reproduce, leading to a decrease in food production.",
    "Loss of biodiversity: Insects are incredibly diverse, with millions of species existing on Earth. Their disappearance would lead to a significant loss of biodiversity, making ecosystems less resilient to environmental changes.",
    "Increased spread of diseases: Insects help to control the spread of diseases by feeding on and killing harmful insects. Without them, diseases could spread more rapidly, causing more damage to crops and wildlife.",
    "Changes in climate: Insects play a role in the decomposition of organic matter, which helps to regulate the Earth's carbon cycle. Their disappearance could lead to an increase in greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming."
