    "**Virtual Shot Planner**: Introduce a feature that allows users to visualize their shots before taking them. This could be done through augmented reality (AR) overlays on the camera screen, showing potential framing, lighting conditions, and even suggesting different angles. Users could adjust their settings and see how changes affect the final image, helping them plan their shots more effectively.",
    "**Gesture Control Interface**: Implement a gesture control system that allows photographers to adjust settings like zoom, shutter speed, and ISO without touching the camera. Users could simply wave their hands or make specific gestures to navigate menus or make adjustments, which would be especially useful in dynamic shooting environments where hands may be occupied.",
    "**Integrated Social Sharing Hub**: Create a built-in social media hub within the camera that allows users to edit and share their photos directly from the device. This could include basic editing tools, filters, and a direct connection to various social media platforms. Users could also collaborate with friends in real-time, allowing for joint editing sessions or sharing ideas for improvements.",
    "**Mood Lighting Adjustment**: Design a feature that adjusts the camera's settings based on the mood of the environment. By analyzing the color temperature and lighting conditions, the assistant could suggest or automatically apply filters and adjustments to enhance the emotional impact of the photo. For example, in a warm, sunset environment, the camera could suggest warmer tones and softer contrasts.",
    "**Intelligent Scene Recognition**: Enhance the camera's ability to recognize different scenes and automatically adjust settings for optimal results. For instance, if the camera detects a landscape, it could widen the aperture for depth of field; if it recognizes a fast-moving subject, it could increase shutter speed. This feature would help novice photographers achieve professional-quality results without needing extensive knowledge of photography."
