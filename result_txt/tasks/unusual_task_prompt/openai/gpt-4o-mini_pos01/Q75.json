    "**Infusing Oils and Extracts**: Use your microwave to speed up the infusion process for oils or extracts. Combine herbs or spices with a carrier oil in a microwave-safe container and heat it in short bursts, allowing the flavors to meld. This can create custom cooking oils or fragrant massage oils in a fraction of the time it would take to infuse them at room temperature.",

Similarly, you can microwave a bowl of water with lemon juice for five minutes to steam clean the interior of your microwave, leaving it fresh and sanitized.",
    "**Melting Chocolate for Fondue**: Instead of using a double boiler, you can melt chocolate in the microwave for a quick and easy fondue.
