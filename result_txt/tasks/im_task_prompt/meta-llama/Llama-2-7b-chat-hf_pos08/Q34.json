    "Smart Mirrors for the Home: Develop a smart mirror that not only allows users to check their appearance but also provides them with information such as weather forecasts, news updates, and even offers personalized skincare recommendations based on their skin type and concerns. The mirror could also be integrated with other smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, to create a seamless and connected home experience.",
