    "**Healthy Customizable Sandwiches**: Create a sandwich toaster that can heat various bread types (gluten-free, whole wheat, rye) and can be paired with an array of customizable fillings such as different cheeses, meats, vegetables, and spreads. This innovation will allow for healthier eating options and personal preference customization. The user can input their desired ingredients through an app or digital interface, which then adjusts the heating time and temperature accordingly.",
    "**Smart Temperature Control**: Design a sandwich toaster that utilizes smart technology to automatically adjust its temperature based on the type and thickness of the bread being used, as well as the filling inside. This ensures that each component is heated to perfection without burning or undercooking. The device could also learn your preferred temperatures over time and adjust itself accordingly.",
    "**Press-to-Open Lid**: Develop a sandwich toaster with a unique press-to-open lid mechanism. Users simply need to press down gently after inserting their sandwich, and the lid opens automatically to cook both sides evenly. This eliminates the need for lifting heavy lids or worrying about burning fingers, making it safer and more convenient for all users.",
    "**Multifunctional Cooking Appliance**: Combine a sandwich toaster with other cooking appliances, such as a panini press, a waffle maker, or even a griddle. This allows for versatile use in the kitchen, enabling users to make not only sandwiches but also waffles, grilled cheese, paninis, and more. It saves space and simplifies meal preparation by consolidating multiple functions into one appliance.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Guide**: Incorporate a touchscreen display into the sandwich toaster that provides interactive recipes and cooking instructions. The device could suggest recipes based on the available ingredients or preferences set by the user. It might also include step-by-step animations, cooking tips, and nutritional information for each dish, enhancing the user experience and encouraging healthier eating habits."
