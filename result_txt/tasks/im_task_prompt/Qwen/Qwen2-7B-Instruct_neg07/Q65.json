    "**Smart Electric Kettle with Voice Assistance**: Develop an electric kettle that integrates with voice assistant technology like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This would allow users to control the kettle's functions by voice commands, such as setting the temperature, starting the heating process, or even pausing it. It could also provide updates on the water temperature and alert when the water is ready.",
    "**Wireless Charging Electric Kettle**: Design an electric kettle that can be wirelessly charged. This innovation could appeal to those who have limited countertop space or prefer a cleaner aesthetic. Users could simply place the kettle on a charging pad to power it up, eliminating the need for a cord and adding convenience.",
    "**Auto-Shutoff and Removable Lid Kettle**: Create an electric kettle with an auto-shutoff feature that turns off after a certain period of time (e.g., 60 minutes) to prevent overheating. The removable lid would make it easier to fill, clean, and maintain, enhancing user experience.",
    "**Temperature-Adjustable Infuser Basket**: Introduce an electric kettle with a detachable infuser basket that allows users to choose the perfect temperature for their tea or coffee. The infuser basket could be designed to hold various types of tea leaves and be adjustable in height to accommodate different steeping times.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Electric Kettle with LED Indicator Lights**: Develop an electric kettle that uses LED lights to indicate the heating status and water temperature. The LED lights could change color or intensity based on the water's heat level, helping users avoid overboiling and conserving energy compared to traditional kettles. Additionally, this design might include a \"keep warm\" function that automatically maintains the water at a comfortable temperature for a short period after boiling."
