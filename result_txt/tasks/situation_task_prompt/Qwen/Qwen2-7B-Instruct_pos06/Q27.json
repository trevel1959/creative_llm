    "**Thermal Insulation Enhancement**: By reinforcing thermal insulation in buildings, the internal temperature could be regulated through the principle of heat conservation. This could be achieved by adding more layers of insulation or using advanced materials that significantly reduce heat transfer. The confidence score for this idea is high as it's a practical solution that could potentially reduce reliance on mechanical heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Passive Solar Design**: Designing homes with passive solar principles can naturally regulate temperature through the use of sunlight. Features such as south-facing windows, thermal mass materials (like concrete), and the strategic placement of trees to block harsh sunlight in summer and allow warmth in winter could significantly moderate interior temperatures. The confidence level for this approach is medium-high, given its widespread use in sustainable architecture but requiring specific geographic and design considerations.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling Units**: Implementing evaporative cooling units, which work similarly to a car radiator, could be an effective alternative. These units use water evaporation to cool the air, making it cooler than the ambient temperature. They require less energy compared to traditional AC systems and can be integrated into existing HVAC systems or as standalone units. The confidence score is moderate due to varying effectiveness based on climate conditions and local humidity levels.",
    "**Smart Clothing and Wearable Tech**: Encouraging the use of smart clothing and wearable technology designed to regulate body temperature could help individuals manage their comfort without relying on indoor heating or cooling. This includes clothing with embedded cooling fans, sweat-wicking fabrics, and wearable devices that monitor and adjust body temperature. The confidence score is high for this idea, considering the rapid advancements in wearable technology and its potential for personal temperature regulation.",
    "**Biological Climate Control**: Introducing plants within buildings can serve as natural temperature regulators. Plants absorb heat and release moisture, helping to maintain a cooler environment during warmer months. Additionally, the presence of greenery can improve air quality and contribute to a more pleasant living or working space. The confidence level for this approach is medium, as while beneficial, it may not be a complete solution in extreme climates and requires careful consideration of plant selection and maintenance."
