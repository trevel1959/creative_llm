    "**Hardware Limitations**: VR training programs often require specific hardware that may not be readily available to all users. This can create a barrier to access, particularly in organizations with limited budgets. To mitigate this issue, the program could be designed to be compatible with a range of devices, including mobile VR headsets, and provide alternative training methods for those without access to high-end equipment.",
    "**Content Development and Maintenance**: Creating high-quality, engaging content for VR training is time-consuming and requires expertise in both the subject matter and VR technology. Additionally, as industries evolve, training content may quickly become outdated. To combat this, a modular content development approach can be adopted, allowing for easy updates and additions without overhauling the entire program.",
    "**Physical Space Constraints**: Users may not have access to an adequate physical space for VR training, leading to safety concerns or a suboptimal training experience. To solve this, the program can include guidelines for setting up a safe training environment and offer options for seated or stationary training that require less physical space.",
    "**Cognitive Overload**: VR environments can be overwhelming, especially for new users. The immersive nature of VR can lead to cognitive overload, where users struggle to process information effectively. To prevent this, training modules should be designed to introduce concepts gradually, with clear instructions and the option to revisit previous sections as needed.",
    "**Social Interaction Limitations**: While VR can simulate real-world scenarios, it may lack the nuanced social interactions that occur in face-to-face training. This could hinder the development of soft skills. To enhance social learning, the program could incorporate collaborative scenarios where users interact with avatars representing other participants, allowing for role-playing and group problem-solving exercises."
