    "Bike: If all public transport stopped working, one of the most practical ways to travel long distances without a car would be to ride a bike. Biking is a great way to get some exercise and fresh air while also getting around.",
    "Walk: If you are not in a rush, walking is another option to consider. It's free, environmentally friendly, and a great way to get some exercise.",
    "Carpool: If you have a group of people traveling together, carpooling could be an option. This would allow you to split the cost of gas and maintenance while also reducing the number of cars on the road.",
    "Public Transport: While public transport may not be available, it's worth checking if there are any alternative modes of transportation available. For example, some cities have bike-sharing programs that allow you to rent a bike for a few hours or a day.",
    "Flying: If all else fails, flying could be an option. While it's not always practical or affordable, it's a great way to get around quickly and efficiently."
