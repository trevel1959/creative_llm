    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often come with hefty budgets, and it’s easy for costs to spiral out of control due to unforeseen circumstances, such as location changes, special effects needs, or extended shooting schedules. To address this issue, the director should work closely with the production team to create a detailed budget and timeline, including contingency plans for unexpected expenses, ensuring that there is a buffer for any overruns.",
    "**Scheduling Conflicts**: Coordinating the schedules of a large cast and crew can be a logistical nightmare. Actors may have prior commitments, and crew members might have overlapping projects. To combat this, the director can implement a robust scheduling system using software that allows for real-time updates and availability checks, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and minimizing downtime.",
    "**Location Issues**: Filming on location can introduce a variety of problems, such as weather disruptions, permit issues, or even local community resistance. To counter these potential issues, the director should conduct thorough research on locations ahead of time, securing all necessary permits and maintaining good communication with local authorities and communities to foster goodwill and cooperation.",
    "**Technical Challenges**: Blockbuster films often utilize cutting-edge technology for special effects, sound design, and cinematography. However, these technologies can sometimes fail or produce unexpected results. To prepare for technical challenges, the director should ensure that there is a skilled technical team on hand for troubleshooting, as well as backup equipment and contingency plans for critical scenes.",
    "**Casting Issues**: Finding the right actors for the roles can be a daunting task, especially if the studio has a specific vision that doesn’t align with the director’s choices. There can also be last-minute changes if an actor drops out or is unable to fulfill their role. To address casting issues, the director should have a strong casting director and maintain a list of backup actors who can step in if needed, while also advocating for their creative vision during the casting process."
