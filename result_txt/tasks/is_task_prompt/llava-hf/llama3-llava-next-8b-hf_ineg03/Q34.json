One of them, an elderly woman, told him that the sunflower was waiting for its mate to bloom. The farmer looked around the field, but there was no other sunflower in sight.

The children carefully placed the mouse in a safe spot and tended to the sunflower. As they waited, the sunflower bloomed, and the children were amazed by its beauty.
