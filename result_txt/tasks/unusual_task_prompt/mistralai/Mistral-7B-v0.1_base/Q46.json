    "Pillowcases can be used to line the walls of your bed and prevent light from getting through into your living space.",
    "Pillowcases are ideal for storing small items that you don't use on a daily basis, such as keys, spare coins, or cellphones. Once inside your bag will hide them from view.",
    "Pillowcases can help you conceal your identity during an emergency by disguising yourself under them and concealing your facial features (if any) underneath the fabric's folds like an old-timey mask that is made of cotton!",
    "Pillowcases are great for hiding objects underneath them so you don't have to worry about someone seeing what's inside if they happen to glance down at the bed from above!",
    "When used correctly, a simple pillowcase can be repurposed into a makeshift backpack if you have something to take along for whatever purpose it may need."
