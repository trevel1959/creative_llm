    "**Travel Game Board**: Use a coffee mug as the base for a portable game board. You can create a simple tic-tac-toe game by drawing a grid on a piece of paper and placing it inside the mug. Use small candies or tokens as game pieces. This makes for a fun travel game to keep kids entertained during long car rides.",
    "**Personalized Candle Holder**: Instead of using a traditional candle holder, pour wax into a coffee mug to create a unique candle. You can customize the scent by adding essential oils and even mix in colored wax for a layered effect. Once the candle has burned down, the mug can be cleaned and reused for drinks or as a decorative piece.",
    "**Portable Snack Container**: Turn your coffee mug into a snack container for on-the-go munching. Fill it with nuts, trail mix, popcorn, or even cut-up fruits. The handle makes it easy to carry, and the ceramic keeps your snacks safe and secure. Itâ€™s a great way to avoid plastic bags while keeping your snacks organized.",
    "**DIY Phone Stand**: Use your coffee mug as a makeshift phone stand. Simply place your phone horizontally on the edge of the mug or position it vertically if the mug has a wider opening. This is particularly useful for watching videos or video calling without needing to hold your phone, and it adds a quirky touch to your workspace.",
    "**Brush and Tool Holder**: Repurpose a coffee mug as a holder for your art brushes, makeup brushes, or small tools. By filling it with decorative stones or sand, you can keep your brushes upright and organized. This not only helps you keep your workspace tidy but also adds a personal touch to your creative area."
