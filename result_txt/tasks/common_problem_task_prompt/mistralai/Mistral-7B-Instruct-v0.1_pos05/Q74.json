    "**Designing a modular satellite:** Creating a satellite with interchangeable modules allows for more flexibility and adaptability in space. Each module can have a specific function, such as communication, imaging, or scientific research. This design also allows for easier maintenance and upgrades.",
    "**Using renewable energy:** Incorporating solar panels or other renewable energy sources into the satellite design reduces the need for resupply from Earth. This not only reduces costs but also reduces the environmental impact of space exploration.",
    "**Building a satellite swarm:** Launching a group of small, low-cost satellites into orbit can provide more coverage and data collection than a single large satellite. These satellites can work together to perform tasks such as weather monitoring, Earth observation, and communication.",
    "**Using 3D printing:** 3D printing technology can be used to create lightweight and customizable satellite components. This can reduce the overall weight of the satellite, making it easier and cheaper to launch.",
    "**Designing a satellite with a self-deploying mechanism:** A satellite with a self-deploying mechanism can reduce the need for human intervention during launch. This can increase the efficiency and safety of the launch process. The mechanism can release the satellite from its launch vehicle and deploy its solar panels or other components."
