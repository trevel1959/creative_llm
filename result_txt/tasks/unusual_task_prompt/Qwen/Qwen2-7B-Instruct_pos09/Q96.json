The hub could offer a wide range of customization options, including various paper textures, sizes, and color profiles. Users can purchase high-quality prints directly from the platform, with the option to frame them for a seamless art-buying experience. Additionally, the platform could host virtual art exhibitions and workshops led by professional artists.",

By promoting digital over physical copies, this system aims to reduce paper waste and carbon footprint.",
    "**Educational Print-On-Demand Library** - Establish an online platform that provides a vast collection of educational resources, such as textbooks, study guides, and supplementary materials, which can be printed on-demand.
