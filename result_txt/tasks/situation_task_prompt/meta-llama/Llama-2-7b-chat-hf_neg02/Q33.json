    "Nature's Rhythm: Utilize the natural rhythm of the environment to keep track of time. For instance, observe the sun's position in the sky to estimate the time of day. Observe the flow of the river or the tides to estimate the time of day or night.",
    "Sand Hourglass: Create a sand hourglass with different-colored sands to represent different time intervals. Each color can represent a different time segment, such as 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour. As the sands flow, you can estimate the time by observing how much sand has passed through each section.",
    "Shadow Clock: Create a sundial using a stick or a pole. Mark the shadow of the stick at different times of the day to estimate the time. The longer the shadow, the later the time. This method works best when the sun is directly overhead.",
    "Time Beads: Develop a set of beads with different colors or shapes that represent different time intervals. Thread the beads onto a string or a cord, and use them to count time. For example, each bead could represent 15 minutes, and you can unwind the string to measure the time.",
    "Time Garden: Create a garden with different plants that bloom at different times of the day or year. Observe the different stages of growth and blooming to estimate the time. For example, a plant that blooms in the spring may indicate the time is around April or May, while a plant that blooms in the summer may indicate the time is around June or July."
