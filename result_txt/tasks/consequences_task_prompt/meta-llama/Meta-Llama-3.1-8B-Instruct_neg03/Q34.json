    "**Rapid Sea Level Rise**: The most immediate consequence would be a catastrophic rise in sea levels, potentially reaching as high as 100 meters (328 feet) in a matter of hours. Coastal cities, low-lying areas, and entire nations would be submerged, displacing millions of people and causing unprecedented humanitarian crises.",
    "**Global Weather Chaos**: The sudden loss of polar ice caps would disrupt global weather patterns, leading to extreme and unpredictable weather events. This could include massive storms, droughts, and temperature fluctuations, causing widespread devastation and disruption to food production and distribution.",
    "**Mass Extinctions**: The melting of polar ice caps would have a profound impact on global ecosystems, leading to the extinction of countless species that rely on the ice caps for survival. This could include iconic species like polar bears, penguins, and walruses, as well as many others that are less well-known.",
    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The sudden loss of polar ice caps would have a profound impact on global trade and commerce, particularly in industries that rely on sea routes and coastal trade. This could lead to a global economic collapse, as supply chains are disrupted and markets are thrown into chaos.",
    "**Unprecedented Migration and Conflict**: The displacement of millions of people due to sea level rise and extreme weather events would lead to unprecedented migration and conflict. This could include the displacement of entire nations, the creation of massive refugee camps, and the rise of global conflict over resources and territory."
