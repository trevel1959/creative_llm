    "The new energy source would be called \"Solarite\" and it would harness the power of solar radiation to generate electricity. It would work by absorbing the sun's energy and storing it in cells that could be used to power homes, businesses, and even vehicles.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Fusionite\" and it would use nuclear fusion to generate electricity. It would work by combining atoms of hydrogen and helium to create a powerful energy release that could be harnessed to power homes, businesses, and even cities.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Geothermalite\" and it would use the heat of the Earth's core to generate electricity. It would work by drilling deep into the Earth's crust and using the heat to create steam that drives turbines to generate electricity.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Windwave\" and it would use the kinetic energy of wind to generate electricity. It would work by using large wind turbines to capture the energy of the wind and use it to power homes, businesses, and even cities.",
    "The new energy source would be called \"Biolite\" and it would use the energy stored in living organisms to generate electricity. It would work by using genetically modified bacteria to convert organic matter into electricity that could be harnessed to power homes, businesses, and even cities."
