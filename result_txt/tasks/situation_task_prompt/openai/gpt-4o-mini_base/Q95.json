    "**Memory Foam Rollers**: Develop a series of memory foam rollers that can be placed under the neck or along the spine. These rollers would come in various sizes and densities, allowing users to customize their sleeping position. The unique shape of the rollers would cradle the head and neck while maintaining proper spinal alignment, reducing strain and discomfort.",
    "**Smart Sleep Mask**: Design a sleep mask equipped with adjustable support that cradles the head. This mask would feature a soft, padded area around the head and neck, providing gentle support while blocking out light. It could also include built-in speakers for calming sounds or white noise, enhancing relaxation and promoting better sleep.",
    "**Towel Tuck**: Introduce a versatile sleeping towel that can be folded and tucked into various shapes to create a makeshift pillow. This towel would be made from soft, breathable fabric that wicks away moisture. Users can fold it into a roll, a flat pad, or any shape that suits their comfort needs, making it an adaptable solution for restful sleep.",
    "**Hammock Headrest**: Create a lightweight, portable hammock-style headrest that suspends the head in a gentle cradle. This device would attach to the sides of a bed or a chair and provide a supportive yet soft surface for the head to rest on. The hammock design would distribute weight evenly, reducing pressure points and allowing for a comfortable sleeping position.",
    "**Body-Contouring Sleep Bag**: Develop a sleep bag with built-in contours that cradle the head and neck. This sleep bag would be made from a combination of soft fabrics and memory foam, allowing the user to sink into the material while providing support. The design would ensure that the head is elevated and aligned with the spine, making it an ideal solution for those who prefer sleeping on their side or back."
