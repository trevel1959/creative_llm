    "**Biomimetic Water Filtration**: Develop a filtration system inspired by nature, mimicking the filtering processes of certain plants and animals. For instance, the lotus leaf's ability to repel water and contaminants can inspire a surface coating for filters. This system would use layers of natural materials such as sand, charcoal, and plant fibers to filter out pollutants. It could be designed as a portable unit that individuals can use to filter water from nearby sources, providing a low-tech, eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesters**: Create devices that capture moisture from the air, even in arid environments. These devices could use advanced materials that condense humidity at night and collect the resulting water. By integrating solar panels, they could be self-sustaining and operate continuously, providing a consistent source of clean drinking water. This technology could be particularly useful in areas where groundwater is scarce or contaminated.",
    "**Community Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Establish community-based rainwater harvesting systems that collect and store rainwater in large cisterns. These systems could include filtration and purification processes using natural materials, ensuring the collected water is safe for drinking. By implementing educational programs on the importance of water conservation and management, communities can become more resilient to water shortages and pollution.",
    "**Microbial Fuel Cells for Water Purification**: Innovate a system that combines water purification with energy generation using microbial fuel cells (MFCs). These cells use bacteria to break down organic matter in contaminated water, producing clean water and generating electricity in the process. This dual-purpose technology could be particularly beneficial in areas with limited access to both clean water and electricity, providing a sustainable solution for both needs.",
    "**Wastewater Treatment Gardens**: Design ecological wastewater treatment gardens that utilize a series of plants, soil, and microorganisms to naturally filter and purify contaminated water. By creating a tiered garden system with different plant species, each layer can target specific contaminants, ultimately resulting in clean water that can be used for irrigation or even drinking after further treatment. This approach promotes biodiversity and can enhance local ecosystems."
