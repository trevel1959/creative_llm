    "**Smart Toothbrush Integration with Virtual Reality (VR) for Oral Hygiene**: Design an electric toothbrush that connects via Bluetooth to a VR headset. The user would immerse themselves in a virtual world while brushing, which could include games or educational content about oral hygiene. This not only makes brushing more engaging but also ensures the user follows the recommended brushing techniques for two minutes.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care Regimen through AI**: Develop an app that pairs with the electric toothbrush. Users input their dental health history, dietary habits, and any specific needs (like gum sensitivity). The AI then customizes the brushing pattern and intensity based on these inputs. The toothbrush adjusts its settings automatically during use to provide personalized oral care.",
    "**Sustainable Electric Toothbrush with Biodegradable Handle**: Create an eco-friendly electric toothbrush by using a biodegradable handle made from materials like bamboo or cornstarch. The handle can be composted after use, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, the brush heads could be designed to be easily detachable and recyclable, promoting responsible disposal.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Health Monitoring Capabilities**: Integrate the electric toothbrush with wireless charging technology. When placed on a designated charging pad, the toothbrush not only charges but also syncs data about brushing habits, such as duration, pressure applied, and areas of the mouth brushed less often. This data could be analyzed by a dental app to provide insights and improve brushing efficiency.",
    "**Dental Health Education and Reminder System**: Incorporate an interactive display on the toothbrush handle that provides educational content about dental health, such as tips on proper brushing techniques, information on different types of toothpaste, and updates on dental news. Additionally, it could send reminders for regular dental check-ups and track brushing frequency over time, encouraging consistent oral hygiene practices."
