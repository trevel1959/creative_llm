    "Climate Change Scavenger Hunt: Develop a mobile app that allows users to explore their local environment and identify climate change-related phenomena such as sea level rise, melting glaciers, or extreme weather events. Users can earn points and badges for each observation, which can be shared on social media to raise awareness about the issue.",
    "Virtual Reality Climate Change Experience: Create a virtual reality (VR) experience that simulates the impacts of climate change on different ecosystems. Users can explore a melting glacier, a flooded coastal city, or a drought-stricken desert, and learn about the consequences of climate change on biodiversity and human communities.",
    "Climate Change Memory Game: Develop a card game that teaches players about climate change impacts on different regions of the world. Each card features a different location and the challenges it faces due to climate change, such as more frequent natural disasters, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, or loss of biodiversity. Players must match the cards by location and impact to win the game.",
    "Climate Change Time Capsule: Create a time capsule that captures the current state of climate change and its impacts on the environment and society. The capsule can include artifacts such as sea level rise maps, temperature records, and images of melting glaciers, as well as personal stories from people affected by climate change. The capsule will be opened in the future to serve as a reminder of the urgent need to address climate change.",
    "Climate Change Art Installation: Design an immersive art installation that visualizes the impacts of climate change on different ecosystems and communities. The installation can feature large-scale sculptures, interactive displays, and virtual reality experiences that bring to life the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and loss of biodiversity. The installation can be displayed in public spaces to raise awareness and inspire action on climate change."
