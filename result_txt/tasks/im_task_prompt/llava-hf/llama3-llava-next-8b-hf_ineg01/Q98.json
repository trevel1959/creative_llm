    "Self-cleaning function: Integrate a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light or other methods to sanitize the juicer after use. This would make the cleaning process more efficient and reduce the need for manual cleaning.",
    "Multiple juicing modes: Offer multiple juicing modes, such as a \"high-speed\" mode for faster extraction, a \"slow and steady\" mode for better nutrient extraction, and a \"pulp-free\" mode for those who prefer smoother juices.",
    "Smart juicing: Add a smart feature that automatically detects the type of fruit or vegetable and adjusts the juicing process accordingly. This could include adjusting the speed, pressure, and extraction time to optimize the juicing process for different types of produce.",
    "Built-in strainer: Integrate a built-in strainer that can be easily removed and cleaned. This would allow users to catch any remaining pulp or fiber from the juice, resulting in a smoother and more consistent juice.",
    "Customizable juicing trays: Offer customizable juicing trays that can be adjusted for different types of produce. This would allow users to accommodate larger or smaller fruits and vegetables, as well as those with unique shapes or sizes."
