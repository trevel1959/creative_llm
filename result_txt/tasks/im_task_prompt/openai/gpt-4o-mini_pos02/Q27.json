    "**Multi-Sensory Experience**:    - Design a shower head that incorporates aromatherapy and sound therapy. It could have a compartment for essential oils that releases soothing scents as water flows. Additionally, the shower head could include a small Bluetooth speaker to play calming sounds or music, transforming a regular shower into a relaxing spa-like experience.",
    "**Color-Changing LED Temperature Indicator**:    - Create a shower head with built-in LED lights that change color based on water temperature. For example, blue for cold, green for warm, and red for hot. This visual cue can help users avoid burns and ensure a comfortable shower experience without needing to test the water manually.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    - Implement a self-cleaning mechanism using UV-C light technology within the shower head. This feature would automatically activate after each use, sanitizing the interior surfaces and preventing the buildup of mold, bacteria, and limescale, ensuring a cleaner and healthier shower experience.",
    "**Adjustable Pressure and Spray Patterns**:    - Introduce a shower head with customizable pressure settings and spray patterns that can be adjusted via a mobile app or voice command. Users could choose from options like mist, rainfall, jet, or pulsating spray, allowing for a personalized shower experience tailored to their mood or needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Water Recycling System**:    - Develop a shower head that incorporates a small filtration and recycling system, allowing it to capture and filter the water that runs off while users are waiting for the temperature to adjust. This recycled water could be reused for the initial flow, reducing overall water waste without compromising the shower experience."
