    "In a small town, there lived a scruffy dog named Doodle. Unlike other dogs, Doodle had a unique talent: he could draw! One day, he found a piece of chalk and began sketching on the sidewalk. Passersby stopped, mesmerized by his artwork—a portrait of a girl, a sunset, and even a playful cat. Word spread, and soon, children gathered daily to watch Doodle create. Inspired, they picked up their own chalk and joined him. Doodle’s drawings brought the community together, sparking joy and creativity. From that day on, Doodle wasn’t just a dog; he was the town’s beloved artist, leaving paw prints on hearts.",
