    "Global Economic Boost: Erasing world debt would give a significant economic boost to countries worldwide. It would release a huge burden on governments and businesses, allowing them to invest and grow without the weight of debt. This could lead to increased economic activity, job creation, and higher standards of living.",
    "Redistribution of Wealth: With the erasure of debt, wealth would be redistributed more evenly across the globe. The wealthy would no longer hold most of the financial power, and the poor and middle class would see a significant increase in their net worth. This could lead to a more equitable society with reduced income inequality.",
    "Reduction in Poverty: Erasing world debt would likely reduce poverty globally. Without the burden of debt, governments could focus on social welfare programs and investments that benefit the poor and marginalized. This could lead to a significant reduction in poverty rates and improved living standards.",
    "Increased Investment in Infrastructure: With the weight of debt lifted, governments could invest more in infrastructure projects such as transportation, energy, and education. This could lead to improved quality of life, increased economic growth, and better job opportunities.",
    "Shift in Global Power Dynamics: The erasure of world debt could lead to a shift in global power dynamics. Countries that were previously reliant on debt to finance their economic growth would need to find new sources of capital, leading to a shift in the balance of power towards countries with stronger economies. This could lead to a more multipolar world with multiple economic centers of power."
