    "**Personalized Oral Care Routine**: Create an interactive toothbrush that adapts to your brushing style. This toothbrush would learn your brushing habits and suggest improvements or adjustments. For instance, if you tend to brush too hard in certain areas, it could gently vibrate or change color to remind you to ease up. It could also play different music genres or sounds (like nature sounds) based on how well you're brushing, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with AI**: Develop a smart toothbrush integrated with artificial intelligence that can provide personalized oral health advice. This toothbrush would monitor your brushing patterns, pressure, and duration, and give real-time feedback. If necessary, it could schedule appointments with dentists or send reminders for dental check-ups based on your oral health needs.",
    "**Toothbrush with Gamification Elements**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates game-like elements into daily brushing routines. The toothbrush could track brushing sessions and assign points for thoroughness, timing, and consistency. Users could earn badges, progress through levels, or compete with friends, turning mundane brushing into a fun challenge.",
    "**Toothbrush with Sensory Feedback**: Introduce a toothbrush that uses sensory feedback technology, such as haptic vibrations or smells, to make brushing more engaging. For example, it might emit a light scent after brushing, or vibrate differently depending on the type of toothpaste used. This could be particularly appealing for children or those who enjoy sensory experiences.",
    "**Subscription Service for Customizable Toothbrushes**: Launch a subscription service that allows users to customize their toothbrushes according to personal preferences. Options could include color, design, and even features like water resistance or battery life. Users could choose from a range of designs inspired by art, nature, or popular culture, making the toothbrush a stylish accessory rather than just a tool."
