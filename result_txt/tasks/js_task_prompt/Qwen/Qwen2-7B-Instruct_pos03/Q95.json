    "**Rainforest Canopy Habitat**:    Design a towering structure mimicking the dense, lush canopies of a rainforest. The habitat would feature multiple levels, each representing different layers of the rainforest ecosystem - from the forest floor to the canopy layer. The structure would incorporate elements such as dense vegetation, waterfalls, and mist to create a humid environment. Artificial sunlight and temperature control systems would ensure the right conditions for various rainforest species.",
    "**Sub-Antarctic Penguin Colony**:    Create an icy habitat designed to mimic the cold, harsh conditions of the Antarctic region. The habitat would include artificial ice formations, deep pools, and a snow-covered landscape. It would also have areas that simulate the open sea, complete with water currents and varying temperatures, essential for penguins' natural behavior and breeding cycles.",
    "**Arctic Fox Den**:    This habitat would replicate the snowy landscapes of the Arctic, focusing on the natural habitats of Arctic foxes. It would feature igloo-like structures made of durable materials to resemble their natural dens. The area would include a frozen lake or pond for fishing and play, along with tunnels and hiding spots to mimic the Arctic tundra's terrain.",
    "**Savannah Giraffe Lookout**:    Design a habitat that allows giraffes to experience life in their natural savannah habitat while providing them with elevated viewing platforms. The habitat would consist of a series of raised walkways and towers that offer panoramic views of a vast, open space. The surrounding environment would include tall grasses, trees, and a watering hole to encourage natural behaviors like grazing and social interactions.",
    "**Deep-Sea Exploration Habitat**:    Create a specialized habitat that simulates the deep-sea environment where creatures like giant squids and anglerfish live. The habitat would be pressurized and illuminated by artificial light to mimic the darkness and luminescence found at great depths. It would include various zones representing different ocean depths, with artificial reefs, underwater caves, and simulated ocean currents to provide a diverse and challenging environment for deep-sea creatures."
