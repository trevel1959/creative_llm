    "**Whisk with Adjustable Tension**: This innovative whisk would allow users to adjust the tension of the wires based on the viscosity of the ingredients. For thicker mixtures like dough, the whisk can be set to a firmer tension to ensure proper mixing, while for lighter mixtures like egg whites, it can be loosened for a more gentle approach. This feature would enhance the effectiveness of whisking and provide better control over the mixing process.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: This whisk would include a temperature sensor that allows users to monitor the temperature of their mixtures in real-time. An LED display on the handle would show the current temperature, helping bakers achieve perfect results, especially when working with delicate ingredients like chocolate or custards that require specific temperatures.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: This whisk would feature a self-cleaning mechanism using ultrasonic waves to dislodge food particles. After use, the whisk could be placed in a special base that activates the cleaning process, ensuring itâ€™s ready for the next task without the hassle of scrubbing. This would be especially useful for those who struggle with sticky or thick mixtures.",
    "**Multi-Functional Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: This whisk would come with a variety of interchangeable heads designed for different mixing tasks. For instance, a balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for sauces, and a spiral whisk for thick batters. The ergonomic handle would allow for easy swapping, making it a versatile tool in the kitchen.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Scale**: This innovative whisk would feature a digital scale integrated into the handle, allowing users to weigh ingredients directly in the mixing bowl. This would streamline the cooking process by eliminating the need for separate measuring cups, making it easier to follow recipes accurately."
