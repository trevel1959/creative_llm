    "Stress and Anxiety: The pressure of needing to remember everything could lead to stress and anxiety. Humans might feel the weight of their increasing knowledge, especially if they are unable to forget irrelevant or trivial information. Stress related to recalling information could become a significant health concern.",
    "Lack of Privacy: In a world where everyone remembers everything they read, privacy would be severely compromised. Every piece of information, no matter how sensitive or personal, would be ingrained in each individual's memory. This could lead to a lack of trust and a new level of intrusion in human relations.",
    "Social Isolation: If some individuals have a natural tendency to remember more than others, the world might become more unequal. Those with prodigious memories could become more dominant in society, leading to a widening social divide. People who struggle to retain information might feel isolated and left behind.",
    "Shift in Literature and Entertainment: If people could remember everything they read, the nature of literature and entertainment could change. Authors might find it challenging to surprise readers with plot twists, and humor relying on surprise or ignorance might become obsolete.",
    "Increased Fact-Checking: With everyone able to remember everything they read, the need for fact-checking would be eliminated. The credibility of information might become self-regulating, with individuals relying on the knowledge of others to verify claims."
