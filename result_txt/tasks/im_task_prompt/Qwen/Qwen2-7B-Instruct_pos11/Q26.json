    "**Smart Trash Can for Waste Management**: Design a smart trash can that not only sorts waste into recyclable and non-recyclable items but also uses sensors to detect when it's full and sends notifications to the user or waste management service. This can help in reducing the frequency of waste collection trips and promote recycling habits.",
    "**Trash Can as a Social Media Hub**: Create an interactive trash can that becomes a mini hub for social interaction. It could have a touchscreen display where users can post messages or pictures, similar to a digital bulletin board. This could encourage community engagement and foster a sense of belonging within neighborhoods.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Can Liners**: Develop trash can liners that are made from biodegradable materials like corn starch or plant cellulose. These liners can decompose much faster than traditional plastic ones, reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal.",
    "**Educational Trash Can**: Design a trash can that doubles as an educational tool. It could have QR codes on its sides linking to information about waste reduction, recycling processes, and the impacts of waste on the environment. Users can scan these codes using their smartphones to learn more about waste management.",
    "**Interactive Art Installation**: Transform a trash can into a piece of public art. For example, it could be a sculpture that collects and displays waste in a visually striking way, sparking conversations about waste and encouraging people to think more critically about their consumption habits. This could also serve as a platform for local artists to showcase their work. "
