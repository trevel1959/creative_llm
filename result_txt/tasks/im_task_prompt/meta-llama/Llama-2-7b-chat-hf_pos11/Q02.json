    "Bicycle-powered water purification: Develop a bicycle-powered water purification system that can be used in remote areas where access to clean water is limited. The system would use the pedaling motion of the bicycle to power a filtration system, removing impurities and contaminants from the water, making it safe for consumption.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: Create a smart bicycle helmet that can detect potential hazards and alert the rider. The helmet would be equipped with sensors that can detect obstacles, such as potholes, and alert the rider through a built-in speaker or vibration. The helmet could also have a built-in GPS and navigation system to help riders navigate their route more safely.",
    "Bicycle-sharing platform: Develop a bicycle-sharing platform that allows users to rent bicycles for short periods of time. The platform could be integrated with a mobile app, allowing users to locate and unlock bicycles nearby, and track their usage and rental history. The platform could also include features such as real-time tracking, insurance, and maintenance services.",
    "Bicycle-powered electricity generation: Create a bicycle-powered generator that can convert the kinetic energy of pedaling into electrical energy. The generator could be used to power small appliances, such as lights, laptops, and mobile phones, in areas where access to electricity is limited. The generator could also be used in disaster relief situations, providing a reliable source of power for emergency responders and affected communities.",
    "Bicycle-assisted therapy: Develop a bicycle-assisted therapy program for individuals with physical or mental disabilities. The program would use bicycles to help individuals build strength, endurance, and confidence, while also providing a sense of independence and freedom. The program could be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual, and could be conducted in a group or one-on-one setting."
