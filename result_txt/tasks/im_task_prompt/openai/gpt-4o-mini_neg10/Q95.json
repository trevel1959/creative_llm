    "**Modular Design**: Create a laundry basket with a modular design that allows for multiple compartments. Users can separate whites, colors, and delicates right from the start, reducing the need to sort later. Each compartment could be removable, allowing for easy transport to the washing machine and preventing any cross-contamination of fabrics.",
    "**Integrated Folding Station**: Design a laundry basket with a built-in folding station on the lid. This station could have adjustable heights and surfaces to accommodate various folding techniques. It would include guides for different types of clothing (like shirts, pants, and towels) to make folding easier and more efficient.",
    "**Odor-Reducing Technology**: Incorporate odor-neutralizing technology into the fabric of the laundry basket. Using activated charcoal or essential oil-infused materials, this basket would absorb unpleasant smells from dirty laundry, keeping the surrounding area fresh. An optional UV light feature could also help sanitize the basket between uses.",
    "**Laundry Basket on Wheels**: Develop a laundry basket that features a wheeled base, making it easier to transport heavy loads from different areas of the home. The handle could be adjustable in height and angle, allowing users to push or pull it comfortably. Additionally, it could have a locking mechanism to keep it stationary while loading or unloading.",
    "**Interactive Educational Feature for Kids**: Design a laundry basket aimed at children that includes interactive elements to teach them about sorting laundry. It could feature fun graphics and sounds that encourage kids to sort clothes by color or fabric type. Gamifying the process would make it an engaging chore, helping children learn responsibility."
