    "**DIY AI Robot**: Build a computer that not only functions as a standard PC but also has the capability to interact with its environment through sensors and actuators. This project involves building an AI system that can perform tasks such as object recognition, navigation, and decision-making based on sensor inputs. It could be used in educational settings to teach AI principles or in practical applications like home automation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Desktop**: Create a desktop computer that utilizes renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines for power. This involves designing a custom enclosure that can house solar panels and a battery system to store excess energy. The computer itself would need to be energy-efficient, possibly using components that are specifically designed for low-power consumption.",
    "**Interactive Museum Display**: Develop a computer that can serve as an interactive display in museums or educational institutions. This computer would have a large touch screen and a powerful GPU to handle complex graphics and animations. It could be programmed to showcase historical events, scientific concepts, or cultural heritage in an engaging way, allowing users to explore content through interactive timelines, simulations, and multimedia presentations.",
    "**Personalized Health Monitoring System**: Build a computer that can be used as a health monitoring device. This would involve integrating various sensors (e.g., heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, accelerometer) to track user health metrics continuously. The computer would analyze this data and provide personalized health insights, alerts for potential issues, and recommendations for lifestyle improvements.",
    "**Customizable Gaming Console**: Design a gaming console that allows users to customize their hardware setup. This could include a modular motherboard where users can swap out components like GPUs, CPUs, and RAM according to their gaming needs. Additionally, the console could feature advanced cooling solutions and high-quality audio components to enhance the gaming experience."
