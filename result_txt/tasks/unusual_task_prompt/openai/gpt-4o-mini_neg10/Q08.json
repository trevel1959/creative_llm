    "**DIY Phone Holder**: Turn a sock into a makeshift phone holder. Cut the toe off the sock and stuff it with soft materials like cotton or rice to create a small pillow. This can be propped up on a desk or nightstand to hold your phone at a comfortable viewing angle, perfect for video calls or watching shows.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Old socks can be transformed into fun toys for pets. Simply tie a knot in the sock or fill it with crinkly paper or a small ball, and your dog or cat will have a new toy to chew on or chase around. You can also braid several socks together for a tug-of-war toy.",
