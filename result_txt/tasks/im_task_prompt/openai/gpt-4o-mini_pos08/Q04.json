    "**Mood-Based Lighting**: Create a book with built-in LED lights that change color based on the mood of the scene being read. For example, if the protagonist is in a dark, suspenseful moment, the lights could turn red or blue. If it's a joyful scene, they could shift to warm yellows or greens. This feature would create an immersive reading environment and help readers connect emotionally with the narrative.",
    "**Modular Books**: Design books with removable, interchangeable chapters or sections. This allows readers to customize their reading experience by rearranging the order of chapters, adding their own notes or stories, or even swapping chapters with other readers. This format encourages a community of readers to share and create new narratives together, fostering collaboration and creativity.",
    "**Personalized Soundtrack**: Pair each book with a unique soundtrack or soundscape that can be accessed through a QR code or an app. This could include background music, sound effects, or even voice acting for characters. The soundtrack would enhance the atmosphere of the story, allowing readers to dive deeper into the world created by the author.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Smart Pages**: Develop a book made from eco-friendly materials that also features smart pages. These pages could have a built-in digital display that changes text based on the reader's preferences (e.g., font size, style, language). Additionally, the pages could include a thin layer of solar cells to power the display, making it sustainable and reducing the need for physical printing.",
    "**Book Companion Kits**: Create kits that accompany specific books, containing items that enhance the reading experience. For example, a fantasy novel could come with a map of the fictional world, character cards, or even themed snacks. This approach transforms reading into an event, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book's universe."
