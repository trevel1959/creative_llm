    "Pressure and Oxygen Supply: The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is immense, which can pose risks to the physical health of the team. Additionally, the supply of oxygen at such depths is limited, and the team must be equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or oxygen supply systems to ensure their safety.",
    "Environmental Risks: The ocean floor is a complex and potentially dangerous environment. The team must be aware of the risks associated with underwater geology, such as the presence of underwater volcanoes, earthquakes, and potential hazards from marine life.",
    "Equipment Failure: The equipment used during the mission, such as submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and communication devices, must be reliable and able to withstand the harsh underwater environment. Equipment failure can be costly and time-consuming to repair, so it is essential to have backup systems in place.",
    "Psychological and Physical Stress: The pressure and isolation of the underwater environment can take a toll on the mental and physical health of the team. Prolonged exposure to high pressure can lead to decompression sickness, and the confined space of the submersible can cause anxiety and claustrophobia. The team must be well-trained to manage these challenges and ensure the safety of themselves and their equipment.",
    "Environmental Impact: The mission must be conducted in a way that minimizes its impact on the ocean floor and marine life. The team must follow strict protocols for collecting samples, disturbing marine life, and disposing of waste materials."
