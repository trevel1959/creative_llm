    "**Innovative Lawn Mower with Solar Panels**: Design a lawn mower that is equipped with solar panels on its roof. The solar panels would convert sunlight into electricity which can then be used to power the mower. This idea is not only eco-friendly but also ensures that the mower operates without needing to be plugged into an electrical outlet. It could be particularly useful for large lawns or those in remote areas where access to electricity might be limited.",
    "**Smart Lawn Mower with AI Navigation System**: Create a lawn mower equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) that uses sensors and mapping technology to navigate around your garden efficiently. The mower could identify different sections of the lawn, adjust its speed according to the terrain, and even learn from past mowing patterns to optimize future tasks. This would save time and ensure a more uniform cut across the entire lawn.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lawn Mower**: Develop a lawn mower that has built-in mechanisms to clean itself after each use. The system could include brushes, water sprayers, and other cleaning agents to remove grass clippings, dirt, and debris from the blades and wheels. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and maintenance, making it easier for users to keep their mower in top condition.",
    "**Lawn Mower as a Mobile Composting Station**: Integrate a composting system directly into the design of the lawn mower. As the mower cuts through the grass, it could collect organic waste like grass clippings and leaves. The collected material would be processed and turned into compost inside the machine, which could then be used to enrich the soil in the garden. This idea combines two essential gardening tasks – mowing and composting – into one convenient tool.",
    "**Electric Lawn Mower with Extendable Battery Life**: Design an electric lawn mower with advanced battery technology that allows for longer run times between charges. This could involve using high-capacity lithium-ion batteries, smart energy management systems, or even wireless charging capabilities. Such a mower would significantly reduce the need for frequent recharging, making it more practical for larger lawns and ensuring continuous operation throughout the mowing session."
