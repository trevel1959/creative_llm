    "**The Inverted Web**: Imagine a spider that lives in a world where gravity works differently. The spider's web is not a traditional, horizontal structure, but rather an inverted, curved shape that crisscrosses the sky. The spider's fear of heights is not about falling, but about the unsettling feeling of being suspended in mid-air, with no solid ground beneath its feet.
