    "Create a sponge-based cleaning robot: This robot could be designed to cleaners, scrub floors, and other surfaces using a sponge as its cleaning tool. It could be programmed to use different types of cleaning solutions and sponges depending on the surface it is cleaning. This idea has a confidence score of 0.5 as it is a unique and practical concept that could be useful in many households.",
    "Develop a sponge-based water filtration system: This system could use a sponge to filter water by absorbing impurities and contaminants. The sponge could be made of a special material that is designed to absorb and hold onto water, while also filtering out harmful substances. This idea has a confidence score of 0.4 as it is a unique concept, but it may require additional research and development to be effective.",
    "Create a sponge-based sound insulation material: This material could be made by combining sponges with a special adhesive to create a flexible, sound-absorbing surface. It could be used to insulate walls, floors, and ceilings in buildings to reduce noise levels. This idea has a confidence score of 0.3 as it is a unique concept, but it may require additional research and development to be effective.",
    "Develop a sponge-based solar panel: This solar panel could use sponges to capture and store solar energy. The sponges could be designed to absorb sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which could be stored in a battery for later use. This idea has a confidence score of 0.2 as it is a unique concept, but it may require additional research and development to be effective.",
    "Create a sponge-based air purifier: This air purifier could use sponges to filter the air and remove pollutants and contaminants. The sponges could be designed to absorb and hold onto airborne particles, while also releasing clean air into the room. This idea has a confidence score of 0.1 as it is a unique concept, but it may require additional research and development to be effective."
