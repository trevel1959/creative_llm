    "**Resource Management**: Conducting a large-scale experiment requires a lot of resources, including funding, equipment, and personnel. Researchers must be mindful of the budget and allocate resources efficiently to ensure the success of the experiment.",
    "**Data Management**: Large-scale experiments generate a lot of data, which must be managed and analyzed effectively. Researchers must develop strategies for data collection, storage, and analysis to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.",
    "**Time Management**: Large-scale experiments can take a long time to complete, which can be challenging for researchers who are working on tight deadlines. Effective time management is crucial to ensure that the experiment is completed on schedule and within budget.",
    "**Subject Recruitment**: Recruiting a large number of subjects for a scientific experiment can be difficult, especially if the study requires a specific population or demographic. Researchers must develop strategies for subject recruitment, including advertising and outreach, to ensure that they have a diverse and representative sample.",
    "**Protocol Adherence**: Researchers must adhere to strict protocols to ensure the integrity of the experiment. This includes following the experimental design, maintaining the integrity of the data, and reporting the results accurately."
