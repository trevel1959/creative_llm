Cycling infrastructure would see a surge in development, with designated bike lanes, bike-sharing services, and bike repair shops popping up in every city. Bicycles would become the new symbol of freedom and adventure, and people would rediscover the joy of pedaling through the countryside or city streets.",
    "Pedal-Powered Trains: In the absence of cars, trains would become the primary mode of transportation. However, instead of relying on traditional diesel or electric power, trains would be powered by pedal-power. Passengers would pedal stationary bicycles attached to the train, generating electricity to propel the train forward. This innovative solution would not only provide a sustainable means of transportation but also offer a unique and engaging experience for passengers.",
    "Waterways Revival: With cars off the road, rivers and lakes would become the new highways. People would turn to water transportation to travel between cities, and waterways would see a resurgence in popularity. This would lead to the development of new watercraft, such as sleek and efficient hydrofoils, as well as the revitalization of old-fashioned paddlewheel boats. Waterways would become an integral part of the transportation network, providing a relaxing and scenic alternative to land travel.",
    "Personal Airships: In a world without cars, people would turn to airships as a means of long-distance travel. These airships would be powered by solar panels and equipped with advanced navigation systems, making them both sustainable and efficient. Passengers would be able to travel in comfort and style, taking in breathtaking views of the landscape below. Airships would also serve as a symbol of innovation and progress, representing a new era of transportation.",
    "Hyperloop Network: With cars off the road, the focus would shift to high-speed transportation. The hyperloop, a vacuum-sealed tube through which pods could travel at incredible speeds, would become the go-to mode of transportation for long-distance travel. The hyperloop network would connect major cities, reducing travel time to a fraction of what it"
