    "Caravans: With cars unable to function, people could form caravans, where they travel together in groups, sharing resources and support. This would provide a sense of community and security while traveling long distances. Caravans could be organized by destination, with people traveling together to reach their desired location.",
    "Cycle-tourism: Bicycles could become the primary mode of transportation for short and medium-distance travel. Cycle-tourism would not only provide a means of transportation but also promote physical activity and environmental sustainability. Companies could offer guided cycling tours, and local communities could set up bike-share programs.",
    "Hydrogen-powered trains: With cars out of commission, hydrogen-powered trains could become the preferred mode of transportation for long-distance travel. These trains would be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional trains, as they produce only water vapor and heat as emissions. Additionally, hydrogen fuel cells could be produced using renewable energy sources, further reducing the carbon footprint.",
    "Personal aircraft: For those who need to travel long distances quickly, personal aircraft could become a viable option. These aircraft could be electric or solar-powered, reducing noise pollution and emissions. Additionally, they could be designed to carry small groups of people, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional airplanes.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could become the go-to mode of transportation for long-distance travel. These trains would float above the tracks using magnetic fields, reducing friction and energy consumption. They would also be faster and more efficient than traditional trains, making them an attractive option for those looking to travel long distances quickly and sustainably."
