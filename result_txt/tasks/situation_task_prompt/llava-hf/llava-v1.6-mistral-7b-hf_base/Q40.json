    "Wind Power: Wind turbines can be installed in homes or communities to generate electricity. The wind turns the turbines, which in turn generates electricity that can be used to power devices.",
    "Hydroelectric Power: If there is a nearby water source, a small hydroelectric power plant can be set up to generate electricity. The water flow can be harnessed to turn turbines and generate electricity.",
    "Human Power: Pedaling a stationary bike or using a handcrank can generate electricity to charge devices. This is a sustainable and eco-friendly option that doesn't rely on batteries.",
    "Fuel Cells: Fuel cells can be used to generate electricity from a fuel source, such as hydrogen or methane. This can be a reliable alternative to batteries, especially for larger devices.",
    "Battery-less Devices: Develop new technologies that don't rely on batteries, such as piezoelectric devices that generate electricity from vibrations or electromagnetic devices that generate electricity from magnetic fields."
