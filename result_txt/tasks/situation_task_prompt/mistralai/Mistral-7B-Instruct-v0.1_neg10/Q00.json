    "Train: Another option would be to take the train. It would be a bit more time-consuming, but it would be a more comfortable and enjoyable way to travel.",
    "Public Transportation: Public transportation is always a good option. One could take the bus or subway to get to their destination.",
    "Walking: Walking is another great way to travel. It would be a bit more time-consuming, but it would be a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the scenery.",
    "Carpooling: If there are other people traveling to the same destination, they could carpool. This would be a great way to split the cost of gas and travel together."
