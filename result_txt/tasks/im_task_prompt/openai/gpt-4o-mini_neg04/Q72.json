    "**Modular Surfboard Design**: Create a surfboard with interchangeable parts, allowing surfers to customize their boards for different wave conditions. For instance, surfers could swap out fins, tail shapes, or even the board's length, enabling them to adapt quickly to varying surf conditions without needing to own multiple boards.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard Materials**: Develop surfboards made from sustainable materials, such as bio-resins or recycled plastics. This initiative would not only reduce the environmental impact of surfboard production but also appeal to eco-conscious surfers. The boards could feature unique designs that showcase the recycled materials used.",
    "**Integrated GPS and Safety Features**: Equip surfboards with GPS tracking and emergency features that can alert lifeguards or emergency services if a surfer is in distress. The board could have a small, waterproof emergency beacon that activates when a surfer is in trouble, providing peace of mind for both surfers and their families.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in Cooling System**: Design a surfboard that incorporates a cooling gel layer to regulate temperature, preventing the board from overheating under the sun. This would enhance comfort during long surf sessions and reduce the risk of burns or discomfort from a hot board.",
    "**Augmented Reality Surfing Experience**: Develop an augmented reality (AR) app that pairs with a surfboard to provide surfers with real-time wave information, navigation, and even virtual coaching. Surfers could wear AR glasses that display wave patterns, optimal riding paths, and tips from professional surfers, enhancing their overall experience."
