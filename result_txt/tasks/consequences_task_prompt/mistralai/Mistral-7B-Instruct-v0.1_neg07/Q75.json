    "The first thing that would happen is that the ocean levels would drop dramatically, leading to a global sea level drop. This would cause coastal flooding and erosion, which could have devastating effects on coastal communities and ecosystems. ",
    "The second thing that would happen is that the salt content in the oceans would be diluted, making the water less salty and more suitable for human consumption. This would have a significant impact on marine life, as many species are adapted to the high salt content of ocean water. ",
    "The third thing that would happen is that the ocean's currents would change, leading to a shift in weather patterns and climate. This could cause more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts. ",
    "The fourth thing that would happen is that the ocean's tides would change, leading to a shift in the energy of the ocean. This could have a significant impact on marine life, as many species rely on the ocean's tides for food and shelter. ",
    "The fifth thing that would happen is that the ocean's acidity would change, leading to a shift in the pH of the water. This could have a significant impact on marine life, as many species rely on the ocean's pH to regulate their bodies."
