    "A Lack of R&D Opportunities: Without diseases to study and cure, pharmaceutical companies would lose their primary source of revenue and research funding. This would lead to a significant decline in the biotech industry, resulting in loss of employment opportunities in this sector.",
    "Loss of Incentive for Healthy Habits: If people know they can't fall ill, they may be less likely to maintain healthy habits. This could lead to a decline in overall health and wellness over time.",
