    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR)**: Develop sunglasses that incorporate augmented reality features, allowing users to receive real-time information such as navigation prompts, weather updates, or fitness tracking data directly within their field of vision. This could be achieved through a small heads-up display that overlays digital information on the lens, enhancing the user experience while keeping their hands free.",
    "**Smart UV Monitoring**: Create sunglasses equipped with UV sensors that monitor the level of UV exposure in real-time. These sunglasses could connect to a smartphone app that alerts the user when they have reached their daily UV exposure limit, helping to prevent skin damage and promote sun safety. The app could also provide personalized sun care tips based on the user's skin type and location.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames and Lenses**: Design a modular sunglasses system where users can easily swap out frames and lenses according to their style preferences or functional needs. This could involve a magnetic attachment system that allows for quick changes, enabling users to customize their sunglasses for different occasions, such as sports, casual outings, or formal events.",
    "**Built-in Audio Technology**: Integrate bone conduction audio technology into the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for additional headphones. This would provide a discreet listening experience while still allowing ambient sounds to be heard, making it safer for outdoor activities like biking or walking.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Production**: Shift towards sustainable practices by creating sunglasses from recycled ocean plastics or biodegradable materials. Additionally, implement a take-back program where customers can return old sunglasses for recycling or repurposing, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impact."
