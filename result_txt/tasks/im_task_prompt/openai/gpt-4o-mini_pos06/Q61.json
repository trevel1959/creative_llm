    "**Personalized Recommendation Calendar**: Create a calendar that syncs with user preferences and activities. It could suggest events, activities, or even wellness tips based on the userâ€™s schedule and interests. For example, if a user has a busy week, the calendar might suggest short meditation breaks or local events to unwind.",
    "**Interactive Family Calendar**: Design a family-oriented calendar that allows multiple users to contribute and manage it collaboratively.
