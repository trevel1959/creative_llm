    "**Integrated Gesture Control**:    Enhance the mouse with gesture recognition technology that allows users to perform specific commands with hand movements. For instance, users could swipe their hand above the mouse to scroll through documents or make a \"pinch\" gesture to zoom in or out. This would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the computer, reducing reliance on traditional clicks and scrolls.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**:    Develop a mouse made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastics or plant-based composites. This mouse could feature a modular design, allowing users to replace parts easily rather than discarding the entire device. By promoting an eco-friendly alternative, users would not only have a functional product but also contribute positively to the environment.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**:    Incorporate health monitoring features directly into the mouse. Sensors could track hand movements, grip pressure, and even heart rate. This data could be synced with an app that provides feedback on posture, suggests breaks, and tracks the user's overall health while working. This would appeal to health-conscious users and those concerned about the long-term effects of prolonged computer use.",
    "**Customizable RGB Lighting and Themes**:    Elevate the aesthetic appeal of the mouse with customizable RGB lighting that can sync with other peripherals or change colors based on user activity. Additionally, users could create themes for different tasks (e.g., work, gaming, relaxation) that alter the mouse's appearance and settings, providing a personalized touch to their workspace.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity**:    Design a mouse that can seamlessly switch between multiple devices, such as a laptop, tablet, and smartphone, with a simple button press or gesture. This would be particularly useful for users who work across various platforms, allowing them to maintain productivity without the hassle of constantly reconnecting devices. The mouse could also include a built-in rechargeable battery with an extended life to support heavy use."
