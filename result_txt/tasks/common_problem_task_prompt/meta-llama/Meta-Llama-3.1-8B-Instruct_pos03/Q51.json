    "**Eco-Friendly Carnival**: Create a sustainable carnival with a twist. Set up an eco-friendly theme where all activities and materials used are environmentally friendly. Partner with local businesses to source recycled materials for decorations, food, and drinks. Organize games and challenges that promote eco-consciousness, such as a recycling sorting competition or a \"green\" scavenger hunt. This event will not only entertain employees but also raise awareness about the importance of sustainability.",
    "**Escape the Ordinary**: Design an immersive escape room experience that takes participants on a journey through the company's history, mission, and values. Each room will represent a different decade or milestone in the company's history, with puzzles and challenges that reveal key events and decisions that shaped the company's growth. This interactive experience will engage employees on a deeper level and foster a sense of community and shared purpose.",
    "**Foodie Frenzy**: Host a culinary extravaganza where employees can explore different cuisines and flavors from around the world. Set up food stations or restaurants that cater to various dietary preferences and restrictions. Invite guest chefs or culinary experts to share their cooking techniques and stories behind the dishes. This event will not only delight employees' taste buds but also encourage cultural exchange and appreciation.",
    "**Wellness Oasis**: Create a tranquil and rejuvenating experience that prioritizes employee well-being. Set up a wellness fair with various stations offering massages, meditation sessions, yoga classes, and healthy snack options. Partner with local wellness experts to provide workshops on stress management, mindfulness, and self-care. This event will help employees relax, recharge, and feel more connected to their colleagues.",
    "**Time Capsule Challenge**: Plan a time capsule event where employees are tasked with creating a capsule that represents the company's current state and vision for the future. Each team will have a set amount of time to design and build their capsule, which will be sealed and opened at a future date (e.g., a company anniversary or milestone). This event will encourage creativity, collaboration, and forward thinking, while also providing a unique keepsake for the company's history. [/INST] "
