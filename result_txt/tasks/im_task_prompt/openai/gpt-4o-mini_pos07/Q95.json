    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Utilize UV-C light technology and antimicrobial materials to create a self-cleaning laundry basket. After a load of laundry is removed, the basket could activate a cleaning cycle that eliminates bacteria and odors, ensuring that it stays fresh and hygienic for the next use. This would be especially useful for households with pets or children.",
    "**Modular Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket that consists of stackable, modular components. Each module could represent a different category of laundry (e.g., whites, colors, delicates) and can be easily detached for convenience. This would make sorting laundry simpler and more organized, as users can take out only the module they need without disturbing the others.",
    "**Portable Laundry Basket with Built-in Hamper**: Create a laundry basket that doubles as a portable hamper. This basket would have a collapsible design with wheels and a retractable handle, making it easy to transport laundry from one location to another. It could also feature a removable inner liner that can be taken out and washed separately, making it easy to keep clean.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Sorting Compartments**: Introduce a laundry basket that has built-in sorting compartments for different types of fabrics and colors. Each compartment would have a mesh or breathable fabric cover to prevent odors from mixing and to allow air circulation. This design would help users sort laundry right from the start, reducing the time spent sorting before washing.",
    "**Interactive Laundry Basket with Reminder System**: Design a laundry basket that has a built-in voice assistant feature. Users can set reminders for washing, drying, and folding laundry by simply speaking to the basket. The basket could also provide tips on fabric care and washing cycles based on the contents, helping users take better care of their clothes."
