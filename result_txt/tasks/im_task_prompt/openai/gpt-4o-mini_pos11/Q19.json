    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Create glasses that incorporate augmented reality (AR) capabilities. By embedding a small display within the lenses, users could receive notifications, navigation prompts, and even access real-time information about their surroundings (like identifying landmarks or translating signs). This would not only enhance functionality but also make everyday tasks more efficient and engaging.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Introduce a revolutionary self-cleaning coating for lenses that utilizes nanotechnology. This coating would repel water, dust, and smudges, keeping the glasses clean with minimal effort. The surface could be designed to break down grime using photocatalytic properties activated by sunlight, ensuring clarity and comfort for the wearer.",
    "**Customizable Frame Design**: Design glasses with modular frames that allow users to easily swap out parts for a completely personalized look. Different colors, materials, and shapes could be offered, enabling individuals to express their style without the need to buy multiple pairs. This approach would promote sustainability by reducing waste while also catering to fashion trends.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Develop glasses that incorporate health-monitoring technology, such as heart rate sensors, UV exposure tracking, and posture correction alerts. This would transform eyewear into a multi-functional health device, providing users with valuable insights about their well-being throughout the day. The data could be synced with a smartphone app for comprehensive health management.",
    "**Comfort Fit Technology**: Introduce a new line of glasses featuring adjustable nose pads and temple arms that conform to the wearer’s face shape. Using a memory foam-like material that molds to the contours of the user’s face, these glasses would provide an unparalleled level of comfort, reducing pressure points and preventing slippage during activities like exercise or sports."
