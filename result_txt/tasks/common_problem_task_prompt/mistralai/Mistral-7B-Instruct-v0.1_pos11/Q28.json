This could involve setting up recycling bins in public spaces, providing educational materials and resources to encourage recycling, and offering incentives for businesses and schools that participate in the program.",
    "Another idea could be to launch a city-wide campaign to reduce plastic waste. This could involve promoting the use of reusable bags, water bottles, and containers, as well as encouraging businesses to reduce their use of single-use plastics. The campaign could also involve organizing events such as beach cleanups and community garden workshops to raise awareness about the impact of plastic waste on the environment.",
    "A third idea could be to establish a city-wide composting program. This could involve setting up composting stations in public spaces, providing educational materials and resources to encourage composting, and offering incentives for businesses and schools that participate in the program.",
    "A fourth idea could be to launch a city-wide recycling challenge. This could involve encouraging residents and businesses to compete to see who can generate the most recyclable waste. The challenge could be promoted through social media and other marketing channels, and could be accompanied by educational materials and resources to encourage recycling.",
    "A fifth idea could be to establish a city-wide recycling infrastructure. This could involve investing in new recycling facilities, providing recycling bins in public spaces, and offering incentives for businesses and schools that participate in the program. The infrastructure could be promoted through a city-wide campaign to encourage recycling and reduce waste."
