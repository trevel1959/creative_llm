    "A Subterranean Aquatic Habitat: Create a vast underground aquatic habitat that mimics the diverse ecosystems found in the world's oceans. The habitat would feature a series of interconnected chambers, each with its unique water conditions, such as temperature, salinity, and currents. Visitors could explore the habitat through a network of underwater tunnels and observation areas, witnessing the fascinating creatures that inhabit each chamber.",
    "A Flying Forest: Design an enclosed habitat that replicates the conditions of a tropical rainforest, but with a twist - the animals would be able to fly! The habitat would feature towering trees with branches and leaves that would allow birds, bats, and gliders to soar and glide through the air. Visitors could observe the animals in their natural habitat, as well as learn about the unique adaptations that enable them to fly.",
    "A Desert Oasis: Create a habitat that simulates the harsh conditions of a desert environment, but with a lush and vibrant ecosystem. The habitat would feature towering sand dunes, rocky outcroppings, and oases, where visitors could observe a variety of animals that have adapted to survive in this challenging environment. The habitat would also include interactive exhibits that explore the unique strategies that desert animals use to conserve water and protect themselves from the intense sun.",
    "A Temperate Reef: Design a habitat that replicates the conditions of a temperate reef, with crystal-clear waters and a diverse array of marine life. The habitat would feature a series of interconnected reef formations, each with its unique geography and marine life. Visitors could explore the habitat through a network of underwater tunnels and observation areas, witnessing the fascinating creatures that inhabit each reef.",
    "A Nocturnal Forest: Create a habitat that simulates the conditions of a dense, primal forest, but at night. The habitat would feature towering trees with glowing leaves, illuminating the forest floor, where visitors could observe a variety of nocturnal animals, such as owls, bats, and raccoons. The habitat would also include interactive exhibits that explore the unique adaptations that allow these animals to th"
