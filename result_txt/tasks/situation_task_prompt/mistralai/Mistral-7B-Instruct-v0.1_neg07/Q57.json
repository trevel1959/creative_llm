    "Build a floating city: In the event of a drastic rise in ocean levels, one option could be to build a floating city. This could involve constructing large platforms or ships that are equipped with everything necessary for human habitation, such as housing, food, and water supply systems. These floating cities could be anchored in strategic locations around the world, allowing people to continue living in areas that are now at risk of flooding.",
    "Convert to high-rise living: Another option could be to convert to high-rise living. This could involve building tall buildings in areas that are not at risk of flooding, such as on hills or in urban areas. These buildings could be designed to withstand high winds and other extreme weather conditions, and could be equipped with amenities such as elevators and water supply systems.",
    "Move to higher ground: If the ocean levels rise drastically, one option could be to move to higher ground. This could involve relocating to areas that are not at risk of flooding, such as hills or mountains. These areas could be equipped with water supply systems and other necessary infrastructure, allowing people to continue living in a safe and secure environment.",
    "Build underground cities: Another option could be to build underground cities. This could involve constructing large underground tunnels or caverns that are equipped with everything necessary for human habitation, such as piped water supply systems and food storage facilities. These underground cities could be located in areas that are not at risk of flooding, allowing people to continue living in a safe and secure environment.",
    "Develop new technologies: Finally, new technologies could be developed to help people adapt to a drastic rise in ocean levels. For example, new types of water purification systems could be developed to extract water from the ocean, or new types of building materials could be developed that are more resistant to flooding and other extreme weather conditions. These new technologies could help people continue living in areas that are now at risk of flooding, and could pave the way for a more sustainable future."
