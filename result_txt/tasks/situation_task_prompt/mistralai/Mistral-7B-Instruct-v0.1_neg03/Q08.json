    "Develop a water filtration system: Create a portable and efficient water filtration system that can remove contaminants and bacteria from polluted water sources. This system can be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar power, making it sustainable in the long run.",
    "Create a rainwater harvesting system: Harvesting rainwater can be an effective way to obtain clean drinking water. By collecting rainwater from rooftops, surfaces, or other-off surfaces, you can filter and purify it to make it safe for consumption.",
    "Implement-off water treatment-offless: Water treatment-offlesshes can be used to purify water by removing impurities and contaminants. By installing these-offlesshes in homes and public spaces, you can ensure that clean drinking water is always available.",
    "Develop a water desalination process: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe for consumption. By developing a desalination process that can be used on polluted water sources, you can obtain clean drinking water.",
    "Use bioremediation: Bioremediation is the process of using microorganisms to break down contaminants in water. By introducing beneficial bacteria and other microorganisms into polluted water sources, you can cleanse the water and make it safe for consumption."
