    "**Plant Watering System**: Repurpose a soap dispenser to create a self-watering system for your indoor plants. Fill it with water and place it upside down in the soil of a potted plant. The water will slowly dispense into the soil as it dries out, ensuring your plant receives a steady supply of moisture without the risk of overwatering.",
