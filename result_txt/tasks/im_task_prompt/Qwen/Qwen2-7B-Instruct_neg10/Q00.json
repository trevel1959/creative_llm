    "**Customizable Pencils**: Create a system where users can personalize their pencils with different colors, designs, and materials. This could include options like wood from sustainable sources, eco-friendly materials, or even 3D-printed pencils with intricate designs. This personal touch would make each pencil unique and exciting to use.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Storage**: Design a pencil with a small compartment inside where users can store small items like paper clips, staples, or other office supplies. This would eliminate the need for additional containers and reduce desk clutter.",
    "**Pencil with Ergonomic Design**: Develop a pencil that offers better comfort and grip, especially for those who spend long hours writing or drawing. This could involve innovative shapes, textures, or adjustable components that adapt to different hand sizes and preferences.",
    "**Pencil with Light**: Incorporate a tiny LED light into the pencil for use in low-light conditions. This would be particularly useful for students, artists, or anyone working late at night or in dimly lit areas.",
    "**Pencil with Audio Feedback**: Create a pencil that emits a sound when it reaches the end of its lead. This would prevent accidental smudging and ensure a consistent writing or drawing experience."
