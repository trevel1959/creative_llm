    "**Aerostat Tunnels**: A network of pressurized, translucent tubes that crisscross the globe, allowing for rapid and sustainable transportation. These aerostat tunnels would be supported by buoyant helium-filled bladders, reducing the need for traditional infrastructure and minimizing environmental impact. Passengers would travel in sleek, high-speed capsules, enjoying breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape while reaching speeds of up to 3,000 km/h (1,864 mph). Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Gravitational Elevators**: A system of vacuum-sealed, spiral-shaped tubes that connect the Earth's surface to geosynchronous orbit. These elevators would utilize advanced magnetic levitation technology and rotating sections to counteract the effects of gravity, allowing for efficient and safe transportation of people and cargo. The journey would take approximately 7 minutes, offering a unique opportunity for passengers to experience weightlessness and witness stunning celestial views. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Subsonic Sky Pods**: A fleet of high-speed, pod-like vehicles that travel through a network of evacuated tubes, propelled by advanced electromagnetic acceleration systems. These sky pods would reach speeds of up to 4,000 km/h (2,500 mph), reducing travel times between cities to mere minutes. The vacuum environment would minimize air resistance, making the journey smooth and quiet. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Catenary**: A futuristic transportation system consisting of a series of interconnected, elevated catenary lines that crisscross the globe. Magnetically levitated vehicles would glide along these lines, propelled by advanced electromagnets and guided by sophisticated navigation systems. This system would offer a high degree of flexibility, allowing for easy integration with existing infrastructure and efficient transportation of people and goods. Confidence score: 0.92",
    "**Quantum Tunneling**: A revolutionary transportation system that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to create stable, wormhole-like tunnels between two points in space. This technology would allow for near-instant transportation of people and cargo, revolutionizing global connectivity and reducing travel times to almost zero. However, the complexity and energy requirements of this system would necessitate significant advancements in our understanding of quantum physics. Confidence score: 0.78"
