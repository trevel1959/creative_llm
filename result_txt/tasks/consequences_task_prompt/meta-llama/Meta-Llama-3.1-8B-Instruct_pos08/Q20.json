    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The sudden halt of all electronic devices would cripple the global economy, leading to widespread job losses, food shortages, and a collapse of the financial system.

    "**Loss of Critical Infrastructure**: The shutdown of electronic devices would cripple critical infrastructure such as power grids, water treatment plants, and transportation systems, leading to widespread power outages, water shortages, and transportation disruptions.",
    "**Environmental Disasters**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would lead to a catastrophic failure of environmental monitoring systems, allowing pollution to go unchecked and potentially causing irreversible damage to the environment.",
    "**Reversion to a Primitive Society**: The loss of electronic devices would force people to adapt to a primitive society, where they would have to rely on manual labor, paper-based communication, and basic tools to survive. This would lead to a significant decline in the standard of living, as people would have to revert to a more basic way of life."
