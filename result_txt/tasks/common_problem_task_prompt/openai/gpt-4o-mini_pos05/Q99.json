    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Create a wearable device, like a wristband or belt, that uses haptic feedback to convey information about the surroundings. The device could vibrate in different patterns to indicate various obstacles or changes in terrain. For example, a quick pulse might indicate a step down, while a steady vibration could signal a wall nearby. This device would empower visually impaired users to understand their environment through touch, providing a layer of awareness that traditional methods may lack.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Cane**: Design a smart cane that not only assists with navigation but also integrates voice-activated features. Users could ask the cane for information about their surroundings, such as the distance to the nearest bus stop or the names of streets. The cane could also have a built-in GPS and connect to a smartphone app for enhanced navigation, allowing users to receive updates about public transport schedules or nearby points of interest.",
    "**Interactive Smart Home System**: Develop a smart home system tailored for visually impaired users that relies heavily on voice control and tactile interfaces. The system could allow users to control lighting, appliances, and security systems through voice commands or a tactile remote. Additionally, it could feature a customizable interface that uses audio feedback to inform users of the status of various devices, enhancing their independence and comfort in their own homes.",
    "**AI-Powered Object Recognition App**: Create a mobile application that uses AI to help visually impaired individuals identify objects in their environment. Users could point their phone camera at an object, and the app would describe it audibly, providing information about its color, shape, and even its function. This could help users make informed decisions while shopping or navigating unfamiliar places, significantly enhancing their autonomy.",
    "**Social Interaction Companion Robot**: Design a small, mobile robot that serves as a companion for visually impaired individuals. This robot could assist with social interactions by providing information about people nearby, such as recognizing faces and recalling names. It could also facilitate conversations by suggesting topics based on the context or previous interactions, helping users feel more connected in social settings and reducing feelings of isolation."
