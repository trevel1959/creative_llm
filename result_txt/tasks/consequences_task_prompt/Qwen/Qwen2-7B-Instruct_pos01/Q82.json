    "**Eternal Youth and Workforce:** If humans could stop aging, it would have profound implications on workforce dynamics. People would not retire at a certain age, leading to a significantly older population in the workforce. This could potentially lead to a wealth of experience and knowledge being available, but also raises questions about job opportunities for younger generations.",
    "**Medical Advances and Healthcare Costs:** The discovery of anti-aging would spur unprecedented advancements in medical science, including personalized treatments and preventative care for age-related diseases. However, this would also significantly increase healthcare costs due to the ongoing need for treatment and monitoring of a much larger elderly population.",
    "**Societal Impact and Aging Norms:** Cultures around the world would be forced to adapt to a new norm where aging is no longer inevitable. This could lead to changes in societal values regarding age, retirement, and life stages. There might be increased pressure on individuals to maintain youthful appearances and lifestyles, potentially leading to new trends in cosmetics and lifestyle choices.",
    "**Psychological and Emotional Changes:** The ability to live indefinitely would bring about complex psychological and emotional challenges. Individuals would need to redefine their sense of purpose, personal growth, and legacy since the concept of \"living long enough\" to achieve them would no longer apply. This could lead to discussions around existentialism and the meaning of life.",
    "**Resource Allocation and Sustainability:** A large population living indefinitely would place immense pressure on global resources such as food, water, and energy. It would require significant investments in sustainable technologies and resource management to ensure equitable distribution and prevent depletion. This could lead to new policies and international cooperation aimed at sustainable living."
