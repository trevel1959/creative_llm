    "DIY Thermal Mass System: Create a thermal mass system using locally sourced materials like clay, concrete, or stone. These materials absorb and release heat slowly, allowing you to regulate the indoor temperature. For example, you could create a clay-based radiator that absorbs heat from the sun during the day and releases it at night, maintaining a comfortable temperature.",
    "Greenhouse Windows: Install greenhouse windows that allow natural light and heat to enter the building during the day, while keeping cold air out. These windows are designed to trap heat and maintain a consistent temperature, even during extreme weather conditions.",
    "Insulated Shades: Use insulated shades or curtains to block out cold air and retain warmth. These shades can be made from materials like wool, cotton, or bamboo, which provide excellent insulation against cold temperatures.",
    "Passive Ventilation: Create a passive ventilation system that uses natural airflow to regulate the indoor temperature. This can be achieved through strategic placement of windows, vents, and chimneys. For example, you could install a vent in the roof that allows warm air to escape during the day and cool air to enter at night.",
    "Radiant Floor Heating: Install radiant floor heating, which involves heating the floor itself rather than the air. This can be achieved through a network of pipes under the floor that carry a heated fluid, such as water or a specialized heating fluid. As the fluid heats the floor, it also heats the air, providing a consistent and efficient heating solution."
