    "Create a line of rubber ducks with different personalities and emotions, such as a happy duck, a sad duck, a grumpy duck, and a mischievous duck. Each duck would have a unique expression and accessories to match its personality, such as a smiling duck with a party hat or a grumpy duck with a scowl and a coffee mug.",
    "Design a rubber duck-themed escape room where participants have to solve puzzles and challenges to escape the room before time runs out. The room would be decorated with duck-themed elements, such as a giant rubber duck in the center of the room, duck-shaped locks, and duck-themed puzzles.",
    "Create a rubber duck-themed board game where players roll dice and move around the board, collecting duck-themed items and completing challenges to win the game. The game would include different duck-themed spaces, such as a pond where players can collect duckweed, a farm where players can collect eggs, and a race track where players can race their ducks.",
    "Develop a rubber duck-themed augmented reality app where users can take pictures of themselves with a virtual rubber duck and create fun duck-themed filters and effects. Users can also collect virtual duck-themed items and complete challenges to unlock new items and features.",
    "Create a line of rubber duck-themed craft beers, each with a unique flavor and label design inspired by the different personalities of the rubber ducks.
