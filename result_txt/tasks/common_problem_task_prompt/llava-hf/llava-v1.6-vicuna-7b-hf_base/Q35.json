    "Animal welfare concerns: Another potential problem for a zoo is ensuring the welfare of the animals in their care. This includes providing adequate nutrition, healthcare, and enrichment activities to keep the animals mentally and physically stimulated. It can be challenging to meet the specific needs of each animal, especially when they have different dietary requirements, behavioral patterns, or physical limitations.",
    "Financial constraints: Running a zoo can be expensive, and financial constraints can limit the resources available for improvements, maintenance, and staffing. Zoos may struggle to cover the costs of providing for the animals, maintaining facilities, and educating the public about conservation and wildlife.",
    "Public safety: Zoos must ensure the safety of both the animals and the visitors. This includes preventing escapes, containing outbreaks of illness, and managing aggressive or dangerous animals. Zoos must balance the need to protect visitors and staff with the need to provide a safe and engaging environment for the animals.",
    "Conservation and breeding efforts: Zoos often play a crucial role in conservation efforts, including breeding programs for endangered species. However, this can be challenging if the animals do not mate naturally, or if the zoo does not have the resources to provide the necessary care for breeding and raising young animals.",
    "Staffing challenges: Zoos require a variety of staff, including animal keepers, veterinarians, educators, and administrators. Finding and retaining qualified staff can be challenging, especially in a highly competitive job market. Additionally, staff may face physical and emotional demands related to working with animals and the public."
