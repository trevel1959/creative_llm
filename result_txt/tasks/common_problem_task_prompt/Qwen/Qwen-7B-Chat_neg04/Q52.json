    "\"Deskercise Challenge\": Encourage employees to incorporate short bursts of physical activity throughout the day by creating a challenge where they have to complete a certain number of desk exercises within a designated time frame. For example, they could do a few squats or lunges during their lunch break, or do some stretches while on a phone call.",
    "\"Office Yoga Class\": Offer regular yoga classes for employees during their lunch breaks or after work hours. This can help them relax and de-stress, as well as improve their flexibility and balance.",
