    "**Toothbrush with a Built-in Electric Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that comes with an integrated electric toothbrush head. The user can simply switch between manual and electric modes as needed. The electric mode could be controlled via a button on the handle or through a mobile app that tracks brushing habits, suggests improvements, and sends reminders for optimal oral hygiene routines.",
    "**Toothbrush with UV-C Sanitizing Cap**: Incorporate a UV-C light into the cap of the toothbrush to sanitize the brush after each use. This feature kills bacteria and germs that might remain on the bristles, ensuring a cleaner and safer experience for the user. The cap could have an automatic shut-off mechanism to prevent overexposure to UV light.",
    "**Adaptive Pressure Sensor Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush with sensors that detect the pressure applied during brushing. If the user applies too much force, the toothbrush vibrates gently to remind them to reduce pressure. This helps in preventing damage to tooth enamel and gum irritation, promoting gentler and more effective brushing techniques.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothpaste Toothbrush**: Combine the functionality of a regular toothbrush with teeth whitening toothpaste. The bristles are infused with mild whitening agents that work as you brush. The toothpaste can also come in a tube that connects to the toothbrush handle, providing a convenient and streamlined process for users looking to maintain a brighter smile without additional steps.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Voice Guidance**: Create a toothbrush that uses AI voice technology to guide users through their brushing routine. The device can track how long and which areas of the mouth were brushed, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement. It could also learn from user behavior over time to customize the brushing experience, offering personalized tips and adjustments based on individual dental needs."
