    "Blue would be a cool, refreshing mint, crisp and clean, reminiscent of a summer breeze.",
    "Green would be a bright, zesty lime, tangy and invigorating, like the first bite of a fresh spring morning.",
    "Yellow would be a sunny, ripe lemon, warm and citrusy, like a burst of sunshine on a summer day.",
    "Orange would be a vibrant, juicy orange, sweet and tangy, like a burst of energy from a summer sunset.",
    "Purple would be a rich, dark berry, rich and indulgent, like a secret garden hidden away from the world."
