    "**Educational Rubber Hand Kit**: Create an interactive educational kit that uses a rubber hand to teach children about anatomy and physiology. The kit could include various parts of a human body made from rubber, allowing kids to assemble and disassemble the human figure. This hands-on approach would make learning about complex body systems more engaging and fun for young students.",
    "**Interactive Sensory Experience**: Develop an immersive sensory experience where participants wear rubber gloves filled with different textures (like sand, water beads, or crushed ice) that simulate various sensations felt by people with amputations. This can help raise awareness about the challenges faced by individuals with limb loss, fostering empathy and understanding among the public.",
    "**Artistic Rubber Hand Sculptures**: Encourage artists to create large-scale, abstract sculptures using rubber hands as their primary medium. These pieces could be placed in public spaces like parks or city squares, creating a unique urban art installation that sparks conversations about identity, human connection, and creativity.",
    "**Therapeutic Rubber Hand Exercises**: Design a series of exercises for occupational therapists and physical therapists to use with patients who have had limb amputations. By placing a rubber hand on the stump, therapists can guide patients through movements that help improve motor skills and reduce phantom limb pain. This innovative approach combines traditional therapy techniques with modern technology.",
    "**Virtual Reality Rubber Hand Simulation**: Utilize VR technology to create a realistic simulation where users can interact with a virtual rubber hand. This could be used for training purposes, such as teaching surgeons how to perform delicate procedures involving the hand, or for individuals to practice dexterity exercises at home. The simulation could also incorporate haptic feedback to provide a more immersive and effective learning experience."
