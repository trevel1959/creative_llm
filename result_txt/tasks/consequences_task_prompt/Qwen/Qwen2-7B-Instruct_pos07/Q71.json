    "**Economic Transformation**: The discovery of immortality could drastically alter global economies. With an endless workforce, the concept of retirement would become obsolete. This could lead to significant shifts in job markets, as industries would need to adapt to a continuous influx of labor. Additionally, pension systems would need to be restructured or eliminated altogether, leading to potential economic reforms and social changes.",
    "**Cultural Shifts**: Immortality might profoundly impact human culture and societal norms. People might start to prioritize experiences over material possessions, leading to a greater emphasis on personal growth, learning, and creative pursuits. Concepts like \"legacy\" and \"leaving a mark\" would likely evolve, as individuals seek to make meaningful contributions over potentially infinite time spans.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas and Quality of Life**: With immortality comes the challenge of maintaining quality of life and preventing suffering. There could be ethical debates around when and how to treat illnesses and disabilities. It might also raise questions about population control and resource distribution, especially as the population potentially grows without a natural end.",
    "**Impact on Religion and Spirituality**: The existence of immortality could significantly affect religious beliefs and spiritual practices. Many religions incorporate the concept of an afterlife or reincarnation. With the possibility of living forever on Earth, traditional views on death, rebirth, and the soul might undergo transformations. New spiritual movements or interpretations could emerge that explore what it means to exist indefinitely.",
    "**Technological Advancements and Societal Structure**: The pursuit of immortality could spur unprecedented technological advancements aimed at prolonging life. Research in fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence would accelerate, potentially leading to breakthroughs in health care, longevity treatments, and even cognitive enhancements. However, these advancements could also exacerbate existing social inequalities if access is limited, creating new divides within society based on wealth and technological access."
