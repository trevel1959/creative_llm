    "**Eco-Luxury Retreat**: This idea combines eco-tourism with luxury accommodation, making it appealing to those who prioritize environmental responsibility. The park could offer exclusive lodges or camps that are built using sustainable materials, powered by renewable energy sources like solar panels, and feature locally-sourced amenities. Activities would include guided tours of the park's natural habitats, workshops on local flora and fauna, and perhaps even opportunities for visitors to participate in conservation efforts.",
    "**Nature-based Wellness Resort**: This concept focuses on integrating nature into wellness practices such as yoga, meditation, and spa treatments. The park could have several themed zones dedicated to different types of healing environments - a rainforest area for meditative walks, a beachside location for yoga classes, and perhaps a mountain top for guided breathing exercises. Accommodations could include treehouses, yurts, or traditional huts that blend seamlessly into the environment.",
    "**Interactive Education Center**: Create an interactive learning space where visitors can learn about the importance of conservation through hands-on activities. This could include virtual reality experiences, interactive exhibits, and live demonstrations by park rangers and wildlife experts. The center could also host workshops on topics such as sustainable living, animal care, and environmental science. This would educate visitors while also providing a revenue stream through ticket sales.",
    "**Wildlife Research Station**: Collaborate with academic institutions or research organizations to establish a station within the park. Researchers can study various aspects of wildlife ecology, behavior, and habitat management. This not only contributes to scientific knowledge but also provides valuable data for the park's management. Public tours could be organized to educate visitors about ongoing research projects and the importance of scientific research in conservation efforts.",
    "**Community Engagement Programs**: Develop programs that involve local communities in the conservation efforts. This could include vocational training for locals in fields like ecotourism, sustainable agriculture, and wildlife monitoring. By empowering the community, they become active participants in the preservation of the park, which fosters a sense of ownership and sustainability. Additionally, these programs can create economic opportunities for the local population, encouraging them to support conservation initiatives."
