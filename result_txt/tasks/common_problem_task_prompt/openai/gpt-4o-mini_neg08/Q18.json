    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is not possible without electricity, which can lead to food spoilage. To combat this, individuals can explore alternative preservation methods such as canning, drying, or fermenting foods. Additionally, community initiatives could be set up to create shared cold storage solutions using ice or other natural cooling methods.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Issues**: Depending on the climate, living without electricity can lead to extreme discomfort, whether from cold winters or hot summers. To mitigate this, homes can be designed or retrofitted for better insulation, and residents can use passive heating and cooling techniques, such as thermal mass and natural ventilation. Community workshops could teach residents how to build solar ovens or implement green roofs for temperature regulation.",
    "**Water Supply and Sanitation**: Many modern water supply systems rely on electricity for pumping and filtration. Without it, access to clean water can become a significant issue. To address this, communities can invest in gravity-fed water systems or rainwater harvesting techniques. Additionally, workshops on building simple filtration systems using sand and charcoal can help ensure access to safe drinking water.",
    "**Healthcare Access**: Without electricity, medical facilities may struggle to operate effectively, impacting access to healthcare. Mobile clinics powered by solar energy can be established to reach remote areas. Furthermore, training community members in basic first aid and emergency response can help mitigate health risks during power outages.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: The absence of streetlights and electronic security systems can increase the risk of accidents and crime. Communities can come together to create neighborhood watch programs and organize regular patrols. Installing solar-powered lights in public areas can also enhance safety during nighttime."
