    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable parts that allow riders to customize their experience. Users could switch out wheels for different terrains (street, park, or off-road), swap decks for varying sizes or shapes, and even change grip tape designs. This modular approach would enable riders to tailor their skateboard to their preferences and needs, enhancing versatility and personal expression.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard with Recycled Materials**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable and recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood for the deck and recycled plastics for the wheels. This initiative could also include a program where users can return their old skateboards for recycling, promoting environmental responsibility. Additionally, the skateboard could feature a stylish design that highlights its eco-friendly materials.",
    "**LED-Enhanced Skateboard for Night Riding**: Introduce a skateboard with integrated LED lights along the sides and under the deck. These lights could change colors based on the rider's speed or could be controlled via a smartphone app to create personalized light shows. This feature would not only improve visibility for night riding but also add a fun and stylish element to the skateboarding experience.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Imagine a skateboard that comes with built-in Bluetooth speakers, allowing riders to play their favorite music while they skate. The speakers could be strategically placed for optimal sound quality without compromising the skateboard's design. This feature would create a more immersive and enjoyable experience, especially for those who love to ride with music.",
    "**Shock-Absorbing Wheels**: Innovate skateboard wheels with a shock-absorbing technology that can adapt to different surfaces. These wheels could have a unique internal structure that absorbs impact, providing a smoother ride on rough terrain. This feature would appeal to riders who frequent urban environments or enjoy off-road skating, reducing the risk of injury and enhancing comfort."
