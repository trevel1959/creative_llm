    "Once upon a time in the whimsical land of Eldergrove, there lived a dragon named Zephyr who had a peculiar problemâ€”he couldn't stop sneezing! Every time he sneezed, colorful clouds of glittery dust erupted from his snout, showering the villagers with sparkles. While some found it enchanting, others were frustrated as their laundry turned into a dazzling display. One day, a clever little girl named Lila decided to help Zephyr. She crafted a giant feather duster to tickle his nose gently. With a final, mighty sneeze, Zephyr learned to control his sneezes, bringing joy instead of chaos to Eldergrove.",
