    "**Smart Hydration Reminder**: Develop a water bottle with built-in sensors that track the user’s hydration levels based on their activity, temperature, and personal health data. The bottle could connect to a smartphone app that sends reminders to drink water at optimal intervals. It could also suggest personalized hydration goals and alert users when they’ve met their daily intake.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Design a detachable chamber within the bottle that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or flavorings. The chamber would have a mesh design to keep solids contained while allowing the flavors to seep into the water. This would encourage more people to drink water by making it more enjoyable, especially for those who dislike plain water.",
    "**Collapsible Design**: Create a water bottle that can collapse into a smaller size when empty, making it more portable and convenient for travel. This design could feature a series of interlocking sections that can be compressed down to fit in a bag or pocket, making it ideal for hikers, travelers, or anyone with limited space.",
    "**Integrated Filter System**: Equip the water bottle with a built-in filtration system that allows users to fill it with tap or natural water sources. The filter would purify the water as it is dispensed, ensuring that users can drink clean water on-the-go, especially in areas where water quality is questionable. This would be particularly beneficial for campers, hikers, and travelers.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cap**: Design a cap that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could include a built-in cup for sharing drinks, a detachable straw for easy sipping, or even a small compartment for storing keys or cash. This would add convenience for users who want a versatile bottle that meets multiple needs during outdoor activities or workouts."
