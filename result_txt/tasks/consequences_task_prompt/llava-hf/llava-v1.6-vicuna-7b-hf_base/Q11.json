    "Gravitational Pull: The combined gravitational pull of the two moons would exert a greater force on the Earth, causing it to bulge and potentially leading to geological instability and increased risk of earthquakes.",
    "Cosmic Debris: The increased gravitational pull could also cause a stirring of cosmic debris, increasing the likelihood of comets and asteroids colliding with the Earth, leading to mass extinctions and catastrophic events.",
    "Climate Change: The tidal forces created by two moons could significantly impact the Earth's climate, causing dramatic fluctuations in temperature and weather patterns.",
    "Lunar Eclipses: The presence of two moons would also result in more frequent and dramatic lunar eclipses, which could cause disruptions to human activities and impact the global economy.",
    "Cosmic Ray Increase: The gravitational pull of the two moons could also cause an increase in the amount of cosmic rays reaching the Earth's surface, which could have negative effects on human health and disrupt global communications."
