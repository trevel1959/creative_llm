    "If there were no more planes, one creative way to travel to another continent would be to build a giant catapult that could launch humans into space. The catapult would be designed to propel individuals to the destination continent, where they would then land safely and securely.",
    "Another idea would be to build a fleet of large, high-speed boats that could cross the oceans to reach other continents. These boats would be equipped with the latest technology and amenities to ensure a comfortable and safe journey.",
    "A third option could be to construct a network of high-speed trains that would connect the continents. These trains would be designed to travel and through, and would be to the destination continent.",
    "An even more ambitious idea would be to build a series of underground tunnels that would connect the continents. These tunnels would be designed to be safe and secure, and would allow for the rapid transportation of people and goods between continents.",
    "Finally, to the destination continent would be to build a fleet of large, high-speed electric cars that could travel from one continent to another. These cars would be designed to be safe and reliable, and would be powered by clean, renewable energy."
