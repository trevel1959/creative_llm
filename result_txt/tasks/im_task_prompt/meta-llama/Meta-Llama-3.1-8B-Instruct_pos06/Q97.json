    "**Smart Leash with Health Monitoring**: Design a leash that incorporates health monitoring features for both the dog and the owner. The leash would have built-in sensors to track the dog's vital signs, such as heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen levels. It would also monitor the owner's physical activity, including steps taken, calories burned, and sleep quality. This data would be synced with a mobile app, providing insights and recommendations for improving overall health and well-being. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Interactive Leash with Augmented Reality**: Create a leash that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the dog-walking experience. The leash would have a small display that projects virtual obstacles, such as other dogs, squirrels, or even virtual treats, to keep the dog engaged and focused. The owner could also use the leash to access virtual training sessions, interactive games, and educational content about dog behavior and psychology. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Eco-Friendly Leash with Built-in Composting**: Develop a leash made from sustainable, compostable materials that can break down naturally in the environment. The leash would be designed to minimize waste and reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional leashes. The compostable material would also provide a natural, antimicrobial coating to prevent bacterial growth and keep the leash clean. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Leash with Integrated Treat Dispenser**: Design a leash that includes a built-in treat dispenser, which would release treats at set intervals or in response to the dog's behavior. This would provide mental stimulation and reward good behavior, helping to reduce separation anxiety and destructive behavior. The treat dispenser would be refillable and adjustable, allowing owners to customize the treat release schedule and amount. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Leash with Built-in GPS and Social Features**: Create a leash that incorporates GPS tracking and social features, allowing owners to share their dog-walking routes and experiences with friends and family. The leash would have a built-in camera that captures photos and videos, which could be shared on social media or with a private network of dog owners. The GPS feature would also enable owners to track their dog's location and receive alerts if the dog wanders off or gets lost.
