    "Temperature: Deep-sea environments can have extreme temperatures. The cold can cause equipment to freeze, and the heat can cause equipment to melt or malfunction.",
    "Water Quality: Deep-sea water can contain high levels of pollutants, such as oil, chemicals, and sewage, which can contaminate equipment and pose a risk to the health of the crew.",
    "Oxygen Supply: At great depths, the availability of oxygen is limited. This can lead to a risk of oxygen poisoning or a lack of breathable air for the crew.",
    "Communication: Deep-sea environments can be difficult to communicate with due to the water's density and the pressure. This can make it difficult for the crew to communicate with the surface or other vessels.",
    "Navigation: Navigating in deep-sea environments can be challenging due to the lack of clear landmarks, the presence of underwater currents, and the potential for equipment to become lost or disoriented."
