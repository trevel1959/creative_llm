    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush that uses ultrasonic vibrations to gently remove surface stains from teeth, making them whiter without the need for harsh chemicals or additional whitening products. The brush would be equipped with sensors that detect the amount of pressure applied by the user, ensuring gentle brushing even when too much pressure is used.",
    "**Oral Health Monitoring Toothbrush**: Integrate a smart toothbrush with Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in sensor to track brushing habits, duration, and technique. The device would send data to an app on the user's smartphone, providing personalized feedback and reminders to improve oral hygiene practices.",
    "**Gentle Electric Toothbrush for Sensitive Teeth**: Create a toothbrush specifically designed for individuals with sensitive teeth. It would feature a soft bristle brush head with a gentle electric motor that vibrates at a lower frequency than traditional electric brushes, reducing irritation while still effectively cleaning teeth.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-In Mouthwash Dispenser**: Incorporate a small reservoir within the handle of the toothbrush that dispenses mouthwash as the user brushes. This design ensures that users are more likely to use mouthwash regularly, as it becomes a seamless part of their daily oral care routine.",
    "**Dental Floss Toothbrush**: Combine a traditional toothbrush with a detachable flossing tip. This innovative design allows users to easily clean between teeth during brushing, eliminating the need for separate flossing routines.
