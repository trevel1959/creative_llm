    "**Sweet Artisan Workshops**: Establish a series of workshops within the Land of Sweets and Treats, offering classes in various sweet-making techniques like pastry arts, candy crafting, and chocolate sculpting. Participants can learn from skilled artisans who demonstrate traditional and modern methods, allowing attendees to create their own sweets under professional guidance. This experience combines education with hands-on learning and creativity.",
