    "The ability to perceive electromagnetic fields: This new sense would allow humans to detect and interpret electromagnetic fields in their environment, including the electromagnetic fields of other living beings. This sense would be particularly useful for understanding the emotional states of others, as the electromagnetic fields of humans can change depending on their emotional state. For example, a person's electromagnetic field may be more relaxed and calm when they are feeling happy, but more anxious and agitated when they are feeling stressed.",
    "The ability to see the past: This new sense would allow humans to see historical events and experiences that occurred at a particular location.

    "The ability to hear the sounds of the universe: This new sense would allow humans to hear the sounds of the universe, including the sounds of distant stars, planets, and galaxies. This sense would be particularly useful for astronomers and scientists studying the universe, as they would be able to hear the sounds of celestial bodies in real-time. For example, a person with this sense could hear the sound of a black hole as it distorts space-time around it, or the sound of a star exploding as it goes supernova.",
    "The ability to perceive the emotions of inanimate objects: This new sense would allow humans to understand the emotional states of objects in their environment. For example, a person with this sense could tell when a tree is feeling stressed due to pollution or when a chair is feeling happy when it is being used. This sense would be useful for people who work with objects, such as furniture restorers or interior designers.",
    "The ability to see the invisible: This new sense would allow humans to see things that are invisible to the naked eye, such as ultraviolet light, infrared light, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. This sense would be particularly useful for scientists studying the universe, as they would be able to see phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye, such as the heat signature of a distant planet or the ultraviolet glow of a nebula. For example, a person with this"
