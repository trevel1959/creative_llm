    "**Creating a Sensory Library**: Build a library where each book has not only words but also tastes, smells, textures, and sounds associated with them. For example, a book about a forest could have pages that smell of pine, feel like bark, and make rustling sounds when flipped through. This idea taps into the boy's ability to taste words and creates an immersive experience for other readers.",
    "**A Taste-Driven Storytelling Session**: Develop a storytelling workshop or event where the stories are told in a way that involves all senses, including taste. Each story could be accompanied by small samples of food, music, and other sensory experiences related to the story. The boy could taste the words of the stories and provide feedback on how accurately they convey the intended flavors.",
    "**Sensory Food Adventure Books**: Create a series of childrenâ€™s books where each chapter is a different type of cuisine from around the world. The boy can taste the words describing each dish, allowing readers to experience the flavors and aromas through their imagination. Accompanying recipes and detailed descriptions of ingredients and preparation methods can help readers recreate the dishes at home.",
    "**Word Taste Matching Game**: Design a game where players match words to their corresponding tastes. The game could involve cards with words on one side and pictures of foods with the same taste on the other. The boy would taste the words and find the correct food card. This could be expanded to include other senses, such as touch and sound, to create a more comprehensive sensory learning experience.",
    "**Taste-Enhanced Reading Rooms**: Transform specific areas in schools or libraries into \"taste-enhanced reading rooms\" where students can taste words while reading. For instance, setting up a corner with books about fruits, where each page could contain a taste sample of the fruit mentioned. This interactive approach would engage the boy's unique ability and encourage others to explore the world through all their senses. "
