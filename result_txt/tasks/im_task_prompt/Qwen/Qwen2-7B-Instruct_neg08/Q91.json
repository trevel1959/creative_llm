    "**Smart Luggage Tag Integration**: Develop a smart luggage tag that can connect via Bluetooth to a traveler's smartphone. The tag could alert the owner when it's time to claim luggage at the carousel or notify them if the tag gets separated from the luggage. It could also include a panic button to help locate lost bags.",
    "**Self-Healing Material**: Use a self-healing polymer in the construction of the luggage tag. This would ensure that any minor scratches or damage to the tag can heal over time, maintaining its aesthetic appeal and functionality even after years of use.",
    "**Biodegradable Luggage Tags**: Create eco-friendly luggage tags made from biodegradable materials like bamboo, cork, or cornstarch. These tags are environmentally friendly and reduce the carbon footprint associated with travel.",
    "**Customizable Design System**: Offer a customizable design system where users can upload their own images, choose colors, fonts, and designs to create personalized luggage tags. This feature would allow each traveler to express their unique style while ensuring their luggage stands out.",
    "**Luggage Tracking App**: Alongside the smart luggage tag, develop an accompanying app that allows users to track their luggage across various airports, showing its location on a map. The app could also provide real-time updates on flight status and airport delays."
