    "**Economic Collapse**: The global economy heavily relies on the Internet for trade, banking, and commerce. E-commerce would vanish, leading to massive losses for businesses that operate online. Stock markets would face chaos as trading platforms shut down, and supply chains would be disrupted, resulting in shortages of goods. Small businesses that depend on online sales would struggle to survive, leading to widespread unemployment and a potential recession. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Educational Setback**: The cessation of the Internet would have a profound impact on education. Students would lose access to online resources, research databases, and digital learning platforms. Educational institutions would be forced to revert to outdated methods of teaching, relying on physical textbooks and in-person lectures. This would hinder the learning process, especially for those in remote areas where access to educational resources is already limited. The global knowledge gap could widen significantly. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Cultural Isolation**: The Internet has become a platform for cultural exchange and the sharing of ideas. Without it, people would be more isolated within their own cultures, leading to a decline in global understanding and empathy. This could result in increased nationalism and xenophobia as people become less exposed to diverse perspectives. Cultural movements, trends, and collaborations would diminish, leading to a stagnation in artistic and social innovation. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Technological Stagnation**: The Internet is a catalyst for technological advancement. Without it, research and development would be severely hindered. Collaboration among scientists, engineers, and innovators would become challenging, slowing down progress in fields such as medicine, renewable energy, and artificial intelligence. The sharing of breakthroughs and innovations would be limited, resulting in a technological plateau that could have long-term consequences for society. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Loss of Personal Freedom**: The Internet has become a platform for activism and the expression of personal freedoms. Its absence would stifle voices advocating for social justice, human rights, and political change. Grassroots movements that rely on social media for organization and outreach would struggle to mobilize support. This could lead to increased oppression in authoritarian regimes, as dissenters would have fewer means to communicate and organize against oppressive practices. Confidence Score: 0.7"
