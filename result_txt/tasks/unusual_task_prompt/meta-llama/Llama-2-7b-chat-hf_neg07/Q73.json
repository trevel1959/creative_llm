    "Smart Lightbulb with AI-Powered Routine: Develop a lightbulb that can learn and adapt to your daily routine, adjusting brightness, color temperature, and even turning on/off based on your habits. This smart lightbulb could be controlled through a mobile app, allowing you to customize your lighting experience and save energy by automatically turning off lights when you leave a room.",
    "Glowing Plant-Based Lightbulbs: Create a lightbulb that mimics the natural glow of plants, using bioluminescent technology to produce a soft, natural light. These lightbulbs would be perfect for creating a calming and relaxing atmosphere in the home, office, or any other space.",
    "Shape-Shifting Lightbulbs: Develop a lightbulb that can change its shape and size to fit different lighting needs. For example, a lightbulb could start as a small, compact bulb for task lighting, then expand to provide broader light coverage when needed. This innovative design would offer flexibility and versatility in lighting design.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Lightbulbs: Create a lightbulb that can harness and store energy from natural light sources, such as sunlight or indoor lighting. This energy could then be used to power the lightbulb at night or during periods of low light, reducing the need for external power sources and minimizing energy waste.",
    "Personalized Lighting Experience: Develop a lightbulb that can adjust its color temperature, brightness, and even light distribution based on the user's preferences and mood. This smart lightbulb could use sensors and AI algorithms to detect changes in the user's emotional state and adjust the lighting environment accordingly, creating a personalized and adaptive lighting experience."
