    "Smart Ice Tray: Create an ice tray with built-in sensors that monitor the temperature and automatically alert the user when the ice is ready to be removed. This smart ice tray can also be connected to a smart home system, allowing the user to control the temperature and timing of the ice cubes remotely.",
    "Ice Tray with Built-In Cooler: Design an ice tray with a small built-in cooler that can keep the ice cubes cold for a longer period. This can be achieved by using a thermoelectric cooler or a Peltier cooler, which can efficiently cool the ice cubes without using any refrigerants.",
    "Multi-Functional Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can perform multiple functions, such as making ice cubes, chilling drinks, and even acting as a desk organizer. The tray can have different compartments for different functions, making it a versatile and convenient tool in the kitchen.",
    "Solar-Powered Ice Tray: Design an ice tray that can harness solar energy to generate ice cubes. This can be achieved by using a solar panel that powers a small refrigeration system, which can cool the water and freeze it into ice cubes. This eco-friendly ice tray can be a great addition to any outdoor party or camping trip.",
    "Personalized Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can be personalized with the user's name or initials. This can be achieved by using a 3D printer to create a custom mold for the ice tray, which can be filled with water and frozen. When the ice cubes are removed, the user can enjoy their personalized ice cubes with their name or initials visible."
