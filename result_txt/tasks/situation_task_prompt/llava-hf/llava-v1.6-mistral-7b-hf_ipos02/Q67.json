    "Weather Balloons: Weather balloons are filled with helium and float high into the atmosphere. They carry instruments that measure temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The data collected from these balloons can be used to predict weather patterns.",
    "Radar Systems: Radar systems can detect weather patterns by bouncing radio waves off the atmosphere. The time it takes for the waves to return gives information about the distance and size of clouds and other weather systems. This information can be used to predict the movement and intensity of storms and other weather events.",
    "Weather Stations: Weather stations are equipped with various instruments that measure temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric conditions. By analyzing data from these stations, meteorologists can predict local weather patterns.",
    "Computer Models: Computer models use mathematical equations to simulate weather patterns based on current atmospheric conditions. These models can predict weather patterns for the next few days and help meteorologists understand long-term trends.",
    "Earthquake Detection: Although not directly related to weather prediction, earthquakes can sometimes cause changes in atmospheric conditions. By monitoring seismic activity, scientists can predict changes in weather patterns."
