    "**Truthful Politics**: I would apply this power during political debates and campaigns. Politicians would be compelled to speak honestly about their policies, past actions, and future plans. This would allow voters to make informed decisions based on the true intentions and capabilities of their leaders. Imagine a world where election promises are not just empty words, but genuine commitments backed by honest assessments of what can realistically be achieved.",
    "**Truth in Justice**: In courtrooms, I would use this ability to ensure that witnesses and defendants are compelled to tell the truth. This would help eliminate wrongful convictions and ensure that justice is served fairly. For example, in a murder trial, all testimonies would be stripped of bias and manipulation, allowing juries to make decisions based solely on factual accounts rather than influenced narratives.",
    "**Healing Relationships**: I would facilitate truth-telling sessions among individuals in conflict, such as couples or family members. By making each person reveal their true feelings and intentions, misunderstandings could be resolved, and healing could begin. Picture a couple on the brink of separation, finally able to express their fears and desires without the usual defenses, leading to a renewed understanding and connection.",
    "**Education Reform**: In educational settings, I would apply this power to uncover the true motivations behind curriculums and teaching methods. Educators and administrators would be required to reveal the genuine reasons for their choices, leading to more effective and student-centered learning environments. For example, a school board might admit that standardized testing is more about funding than student success, prompting a shift towards more holistic educational practices.",
    "**Corporate Transparency**: I would introduce this ability in corporate environments to ensure that companies are honest about their practices, product quality, and labor conditions. Consumers would benefit from knowing the true ethical standing of brands, leading to more responsible consumerism. Imagine a major clothing brand revealing the real conditions under which their products are made, pushing the industry towards more ethical practices."
