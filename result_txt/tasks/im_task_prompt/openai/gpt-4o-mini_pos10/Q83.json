    "**Eco-Friendly Cart with Solar-Powered Features**:    Design a shopping cart made from sustainable materials that incorporates solar panels to power small devices. These panels could charge USB ports for shoppers' devices, or power LED lights that illuminate the cart's contents at night. This feature would not only promote eco-friendliness but also provide practical benefits for customers shopping in dimly lit stores or markets.",
    "**Modular Shopping Cart System**:    Create a shopping cart with detachable modular components that can be customized based on the shopper's needs. For example, a cart could have sections that can be added or removed for different types of shopping trips (groceries, clothing, or bulk items). Each module could come with specialized compartments, such as insulated sections for frozen foods or separate areas for fragile items, making the cart versatile for various shopping experiences.",
    "**Health & Wellness Tracker**:    Integrate a health and wellness tracking system into the shopping cart that can analyze the nutritional value of items as they are added. The cart could display calorie counts, suggest healthier alternatives, and even provide meal plans based on the items in the cart. This feature would appeal to health-conscious shoppers and encourage them to make better dietary choices while shopping.",
    "**Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**:    Equip shopping carts with AR technology that connects to a shopperâ€™s smartphone or built-in display. As customers navigate the store, the cart could provide real-time directions to items on their shopping list, highlight discounts, or offer promotions on products nearby. This would enhance the shopping experience by making it more engaging and efficient, especially in larger retail spaces.",
    "**Multi-Functional Shopping Cart with Built-in Seats**:    Design a shopping cart that includes foldable seats for parents with young children or elderly shoppers who may need to take breaks. The seat could be safely integrated into the cart's structure and could be equipped with safety straps. This would allow caregivers to shop comfortably without having to juggle their children or find a place to sit down."
