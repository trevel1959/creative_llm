    "**Guitar with Shape-Shifting Body**: Design a guitar body that can change shape or material to suit different playing styles, genres, or environmental conditions. For example, a jazz player might prefer a smooth, rounded body, while a metal player might prefer a more aggressive, angular design.",
    "**Guitar with Built-in Theremin**: Integrate a theremin-like technology into the guitar, allowing the player to create eerie, wavering sounds by moving their hands near the instrument. This could be especially useful for ambient or experimental music.",
    "**Guitar with Built-in Looper and Sampler**: Add a built-in looper and sampler, allowing the player to record and layer sounds, create complex rhythms, and even build entire songs without the need for external equipment.",
    "**Guitar with Augmented Reality Display**: Incorporate a small AR display on the fretboard or body of the guitar, providing the player with real-time information such as chord charts, lyrics, or even video tutorials.",
    "**Guitar with Dynamic Resonance Tuning**: Develop a system that adjusts the guitar's tuning in real-time based on the player's playing style, allowing for more expressive and dynamic performances."
