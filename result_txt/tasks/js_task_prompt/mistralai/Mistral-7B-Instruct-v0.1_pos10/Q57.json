    "draft: A draft government is a form of government that drafts citizens for a period of time to serve in various areas of public service, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This system would be based on a draft lottery, where all citizens are required to serve for a certain period of time, typically in their late teens or early 20s. This form of government would ensure that all citizens have a chance to contribute to the public good, and could potentially lead to draft more diverse and inclusive forms of government.",
    "outline: An outline government is a form of government that is based on a system of participatory budgeting, where citizens have the power to allocate government funds directly through voting and other participatory processes. This form of government would be highly decentralized, with power distributed among small communities or neighborhoods, rather than a central authority. This system would empower citizens to have a direct say in the policies and decisions that affect their lives, and could potentially lead to outline more responsive and accountable government."
