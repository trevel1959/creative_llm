    "**The Meritocratic Council** : This system would be a hybrid of direct democracy and meritocracy. Citizens would participate in regular town hall meetings to discuss and vote on key issues. However, instead of a simple majority, decisions would be made based on a weighted voting system where citizens with expertise in a particular area would have more influence. For example, a doctor's opinion would carry more weight when discussing healthcare policy. This system would ensure that decisions are made by those who are knowledgeable and experienced in the relevant field.",
    "**The Rotating Council** : In this system, a group of citizens would be randomly selected to serve on a council for a fixed period, say 2-3 years. This would ensure that the council is diverse and representative of the population. The rotating council would be responsible for making decisions and implementing policies. This system would prevent the concentration of power and promote civic engagement.",
    "**The Decentralized Network** : This system would be a decentralized, blockchain-based network where citizens would be able to propose, vote, and implement policies. The network would be secured by cryptography and would ensure transparency and accountability. This system would enable citizens to participate directly in the decision-making process and would prevent corruption.",
    "**The Participatory Budgeting** : In this system, citizens would have a direct say in how a portion of the budget is allocated. They would be able to propose projects and vote on which ones to fund. This system would ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively. It would also promote civic engagement and community development.",
    "**The Expert-Led Assembly** : This system would consist of a group of experts in various fields who would come together to form an assembly. The assembly would be responsible for making decisions and implementing policies. The experts would be chosen based on their knowledge and experience in a particular area. This system would ensure that decisions are made by those who are knowledgeable and experienced in the relevant field."
