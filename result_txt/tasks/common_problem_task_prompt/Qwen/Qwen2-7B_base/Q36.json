    "**Cost** - Another potential problem may be the high cost of installation and maintenance of solar panels. The initial cost of the solar panels and the installation can be expensive, especially for low-income households. The cost of maintenance and repairs may also be high, particularly if the panels are not installed properly or if they are damaged by weather or other factors.",
    "**Safety Concerns** - One potential problem may be the safety of the solar panels. The panels can be heavy and fragile, which may lead to accidents during installation or when handling the panels. Additionally, the panels can generate electricity, which can be dangerous if not installed properly or if they are not maintained.",
    "**Reliability** - Another potential problem may be the reliability of solar power. Solar power is dependent on sunlight, which may not be available all the time. During periods of poor weather, there may not be enough sunlight to generate enough power to meet the needs of the city. This could lead to blackouts and other power shortages.",
    "**Grid Integration** - One potential problem may be the integration of solar power into the city's electrical grid. Solar power is intermittent, which can make it difficult to integrate into the existing grid. The grid may need to be upgraded to accommodate the increased amount of solar power, which can be expensive. Additionally, the grid may not be able to handle the variable nature of solar power, which can lead to power fluctuations and other issues.",
    "**Political Considerations** - One potential problem may be the political implications of installing solar panels in every home. There may be concerns about the impact on property values, the visual impact of solar panels on the city's skyline, and the potential for conflicts between residents who support and oppose the installation of solar panels. Additionally, there may be concerns about the potential use of solar panels for propaganda or other political purposes."
