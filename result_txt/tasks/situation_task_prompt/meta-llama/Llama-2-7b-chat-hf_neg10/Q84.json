    "Virtual reality mobility: With the help of virtual reality technology, you could create a mobile experience that allows you to explore new places and environments without ever leaving your bed or wheelchair. Using a VR headset and motion sensors, you could \"travel\" to exotic destinations, visit historical landmarks, or even soar through the skies without ever having to move from your current location.",
    "Hoverchair: Imagine a wheelchair that uses advanced magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground, allowing you to move around with ease and grace.

    "Teleportation device: If you could no longer move around physically, you could use a teleportation device to instantly transport yourself to any location you desire. This could be a wearable device that uses advanced quantum technology to beam you from one place to another, or even a stationary device that allows you to teleport yourself from one room to another. With the help of teleportation, you could explore new places and experiences without ever having to physically move from your current location."
