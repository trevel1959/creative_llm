    "Water-Harvesting Satellites: Launch a network of satellites that can collect and purify water from the atmosphere. These satellites can use advanced technologies like atmospheric water generators or condensation systems to collect and purify water vapor from the atmosphere, making it available for drinking water.",
    "Aqua-Farms: Develop large-scale aqua-farms that can cultivate algae and other microorganisms that can be used to purify water. These farms can be located in areas with abundant sunlight and can produce clean drinking water through a process called algal turbidity reduction.",
    "Water-Filtration Towers: Create tall, tower-like structures that can filter out pollutants from water using advanced filtration systems. These towers can be placed in strategic locations near water sources and can be designed to filter out a wide range of pollutants, including bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals.",
    "Portable Water Purifiers: Develop portable, handheld devices that can purify water on the go. These devices can use advanced technologies like UV light, activated carbon, or nanomaterials to remove pollutants from water, making it safe for drinking.",
    "Artificial Water Bodies: Create artificial water bodies like lakes, ponds, or reservoirs that can act as natural filters for water. These bodies can be designed to capture and filter pollutants, making the water clean and safe for drinking. The water can then be stored and distributed to areas with water scarcity."
