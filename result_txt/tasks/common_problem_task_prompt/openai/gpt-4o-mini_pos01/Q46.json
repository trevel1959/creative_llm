    "**Public Resistance to Change**: Citizens often have established routines and preferences regarding transportation. Overhauling the system could face backlash from the public, especially if the changes disrupt their daily commutes or lead to increased travel times. Effective communication and community engagement will be essential to mitigate resistance and ensure public buy-in.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: The existing infrastructure may not support the proposed changes, requiring extensive construction and renovation. This could lead to disruptions in current services, increased traffic congestion, and prolonged construction timelines. Additionally, the integration of new technologies may face compatibility issues with outdated systems.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While the goal of overhauling the transportation system may be to create a more sustainable option, the construction phase could have significant environmental impacts. This includes noise pollution, disruption of local ecosystems, and increased emissions from construction vehicles. A thorough environmental impact assessment will be crucial to address these concerns.",
    "**Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The new transportation system must cater to all demographics, including individuals with disabilities, the elderly, and low-income communities. Failing to design an inclusive system could lead to further marginalization of these groups, resulting in legal challenges and public outcry.",
    "**Technology Integration**: Incorporating advanced technologies such as real-time tracking, mobile payment systems, and autonomous vehicles presents both opportunities and challenges. Issues could arise from cybersecurity threats, data privacy concerns, and the digital divide, where some populations may not have access to the necessary technology to utilize the new system effectively."
