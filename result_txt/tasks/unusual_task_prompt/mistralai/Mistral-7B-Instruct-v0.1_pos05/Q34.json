    "Tape Measure App: Develop a mobile app that uses the phone's camera to measure objects. Simply place the object on a flat surface, open the app, and let it do the rest. It uses advanced image recognition technology to accurately measure the object's dimensions.",
    "Smart Tape Measure: Create a smart tape measure that can measure objects in multiple dimensions. It can measure length, width, depth, and even the circumference of objects. It can also store the measurements in a digital database for easy access.",
    "Augmented Reality Tape Measure: Develop an augmented reality tape measure that overlays the dimensions of an object onto the real world. It uses the phone's camera to display the measurements in real-time, making it easy to visualize the dimensions of an object.",
    "Voice-Activated Tape Measure: Create a voice-activated tape measure that can measure objects without the need for a physical device. Simply say the command \"measure [object]\" and the tape measure will provide the dimensions of the object.",
    "Self-Charging Tape Measure: Develop a tape measure that can charge itself when it runs out of power. It uses a built-in solar panel to capture energy from the sun and recharge the battery. This eliminates the need to carry extra batteries or chargers."
