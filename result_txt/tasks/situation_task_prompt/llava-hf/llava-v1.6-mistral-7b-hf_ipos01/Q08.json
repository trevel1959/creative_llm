    "**Greywater Recycling**: Greywater is the relatively clean wastewater that results from sinks, showers, washing machines, and other kitchen appliances. Greywater recycling systems can be installed in homes and businesses to reuse this water for non-potable uses such as flushing toilets, watering plants, and cleaning. With all water sources being polluted, greywater recycling systems could be upgraded to provide clean drinking water.",
    "**Desalination Plants**: Desalination plants are facilities that remove salt and other minerals from seawater to produce clean drinking water. These plants could be set up near coastlines to provide a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Water Filtration Systems**: Advanced water filtration systems could be developed and deployed to remove pollutants from contaminated water sources. These systems could be set up in communities to provide clean drinking water.",
    "**Water Delivery Services**: In areas where all water sources are polluted, water delivery services could be established to deliver clean drinking water to households and businesses. This would require setting up a network of trucks or pipelines to transport water from clean sources to polluted areas.",
    "**Water Purification Kits**: Portable water purification kits could be distributed to households and businesses in areas where all water sources are polluted. These kits could include filters, chemicals, and other equipment to purify contaminated water."
