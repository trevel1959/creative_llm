    "**Interactive Pet Workshops**: Each class has a specific pet that teaches a different subject through interactive workshops. For example, a dog named \"Math Max\" could lead math lessons using real-life scenarios like counting treats or measuring distances during playtime. This makes learning fun and engaging for students.",
    "**Pet Therapy Sessions**: Incorporate pets into the school's mental health support system. Dogs, cats, and even rabbits can provide comfort and reduce stress levels in students, especially during exam periods or times of high emotional distress. These sessions can also be beneficial for teaching empathy and care for living creatures.",
    "**Pet-Related Curriculum Projects**: Students could be assigned projects related to their pets or a pet of their choice. For instance, they might research how to care for a specific breed, learn about animal rights, or even write a story from the perspective of their pet. This encourages creativity and deepens their understanding of animals.",
    "**Animal-Assisted Learning (AAL) Programs**: Introduce AAL programs where pets are used as tools to enhance traditional learning methods. For example, using horses for physical education activities, or birds for biology lessons on ecosystems and biodiversity. This approach helps students connect theory with practical experiences.",
    "**Career Exploration Through Animal Professions**: Organize guest speakers who work in various fields related to animals, such as veterinarians, wildlife conservationists, or animal trainers. Students can shadow these professionals for a day or participate in mock job interviews. This not only educates them about potential career paths but also inspires them to think beyond conventional academic goals."
