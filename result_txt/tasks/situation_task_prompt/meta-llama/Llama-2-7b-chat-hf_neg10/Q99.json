    "Use texture to differentiate objects: If everything turned black and white, you could use the unique textures of different objects to identify them. For instance, a rough, bumpy surface could indicate a rock, while a smooth, glossy surface could be a mirror or a window.",
    "Deploy the sense of smell: While colors are gone, your sense of smell remains. You could use distinctive scents to identify objects. For example, a citrusy aroma could indicate a citrus fruit, while a pungent smell could be a sign of rotting food.",
    "Employ sound to identify objects: Sound can be a powerful identifier even in a world without colors. You could use the unique sounds of different objects to distinguish them. For instance, a jingling sound could be a sign of coins, while a rustling sound could be a sign of leaves or fabric.",
    "Utilize the weight of objects: Since everything has turned black and white, you could use the weight of objects to identify them. Heavier objects like books or rocks would be easier to distinguish from lighter objects like feathers or balloons.",
    "Create a mental catalog of shapes: Since colors are no longer a factor, you could use shapes to identify objects. Create a mental catalog of the unique shapes of different objects, such as the circular shape of a coin, the triangular shape of a pineapple, or the rectangular shape of a book. Then, use these shapes to identify objects when you encounter them."
