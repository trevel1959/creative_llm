    "Cloning extinct animals could allow for the reintroduction of species that were previously lost, potentially restoring balance to ecosystems and preserving biodiversity.",
    "Cloning could also allow for the preservation of endangered species, providing a safety net for populations that are struggling to survive in the wild.",
    "However, there are also potential risks associated with cloning extinct animals, such as the possibility of genetic mutations or the unintended consequences of introducing cloned animals into existing ecosystems.",
    "Cloning could also lead to ethical concerns, such as the potential for cloned animals to be exploited for their genetic material or used for unethical purposes.",
    "Confidence Score: 0.8/1 - While cloning extinct animals has the potential to be a valuable tool for conservation, there are also many potential risks and ethical considerations that must be carefully considered before such technology is developed."
