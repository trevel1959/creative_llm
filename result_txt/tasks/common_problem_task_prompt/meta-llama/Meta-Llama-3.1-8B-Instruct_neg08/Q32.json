    "**\"Symphony of the Senses\"**: Create an immersive experience where each stage is designed to evoke a specific emotion, scent, and texture. For example, the \"Romance\" stage would feature a rose-petal-covered catwalk, soft lighting, and a playlist of classic love songs. Meanwhile, the \"Euphoria\" stage would be a vibrant, neon-lit area with a fog machine and a playlist of high-energy electronic dance music. This concept would allow attendees to explore different emotions and moods throughout the festival.",
    "**\"Festival of Fusions\"**: Invite artists from various genres to collaborate on new, genre-bending performances. For instance, a classical violinist could join forces with a hip-hop artist to create a unique blend of traditional and contemporary sounds. This would not only showcase the artists' versatility but also push the boundaries of what music can be.",
    "**\"Time Traveler's Ball\"**: Curate a lineup that takes attendees on a musical journey through different decades and eras. Each stage would be designed to resemble a specific time period, with decorations, fashion, and music to match. This would allow attendees to experience the evolution of music and culture firsthand.",
    "**\"Sonic Sanctuary\"**: Create a festival that prioritizes sustainability and wellness. Partner with eco-friendly brands to offer compostable cups, reusable water bottles, and biodegradable wristbands. The stages would be designed to minimize waste and maximize natural light, with plenty of green spaces for attendees to relax and recharge.",
    "**\"Mystery Mansion\"**: Host a festival that's more like a treasure hunt. Hide clues and puzzles throughout the festival grounds, leading attendees on a journey to uncover hidden stages, secret performances, and exclusive experiences. This would create a sense of excitement and adventure, making the festival feel like a thrilling mystery to solve.
