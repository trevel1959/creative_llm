    "DIY Raft: Gather materials like plastic sheets, wooden dowels, and rope. Construct a makeshift raft to provide a safe crossing for the group. Ensure that the raft is buoyant and can support the weight of everyone.",
    "Natural Crossing Points: Look for natural crossing points like shallow areas, narrow sections, or rock formations that could be used as makeshift bridges. Cross the river using these points while maintaining safety.",
    "Water Containers: Collect water containers such as buckets, jugs, or large plastic bags. Fill them with water and use them to create a makeshift raft. Cross the river by distributing the weight of the containers evenly.",
    "Canoes or Kayaks: If there are canoes or kayaks available, use them to cross the river one by one, ensuring everyone stays safe and secure during the crossing.",
    "Build a Bridge: If the group is skilled in construction, work together to build a temporary bridge using local materials like logs, branches, and rocks. This will provide a safer and more stable crossing."
