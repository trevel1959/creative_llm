    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Design a wearable device, like a wristband or belt, that uses haptic feedback to guide visually impaired users through their surroundings. The device would have sensors that detect nearby objects and obstacles, providing tactile vibrations that indicate direction and distance. For example, a gentle vibration on the left wrist could signal an obstacle to the left, helping users navigate without relying solely on auditory cues.",
    "**Smart Cane with Augmented Reality**: Develop a smart cane that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology. The cane could have a built-in camera and sensors that detect obstacles and provide visual information through a paired smartphone or smart glasses. This would allow users to see their surroundings in a new way, with highlighted paths, detected hazards, and points of interest displayed in an AR format, enriching their navigation experience.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Home Assistant**: Create a smart home assistant specifically designed for visually impaired users, with advanced voice recognition and interaction capabilities. This device would allow users to control home appliances, access information, and manage daily tasks using voice commands. It could also provide personalized reminders and notifications, enhancing independence and improving the overall quality of life for visually impaired individuals.",
    "**Tactile Learning Kit for Education**: Develop an educational kit that combines tactile learning materials with assistive technology for visually impaired students. The kit could include 3D-printed models, Braille books, and interactive electronic components that provide audio feedback when touched. This would facilitate hands-on learning experiences, making subjects like science and mathematics more accessible and engaging for visually impaired learners.",
    "**Social Interaction App for the Visually Impaired**: Create a mobile app that connects visually impaired individuals with peers and mentors for social interaction and support. The app could include features like audio chat rooms, virtual meetups, and forums for sharing experiences and advice. By fostering a sense of community, this app would help reduce feelings of isolation and provide valuable resources for navigating daily challenges."
