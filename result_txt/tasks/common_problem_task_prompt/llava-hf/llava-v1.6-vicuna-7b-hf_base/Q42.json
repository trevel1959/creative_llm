    "Inadequate Planning: Failure to plan thoroughly can result in miscommunication and misallocation of resources. For instance, researchers might not have a clear idea of the timeline, objectives, and milestones of the experiment.",
    "Poor Communication: Effective communication is crucial when coordinating a large team of scientists, technicians, and other stakeholders. A breakdown in communication can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and cost overruns.",
    "Risk of Contamination or Mixing Samples: In a large-scale experiment, there is a significant risk of cross-contamination or mixing samples unintentionally. This could lead to the results of a specific experiment being compromised or rendered useless.",
    "Inadequate Training: It is essential to ensure that all personnel involved in the experiment, including technicians and researchers, have the necessary training and expertise. A lack of training can lead to mistakes and accidents during the experiment.",
    "Ethical Concerns: When conducting a large-scale experiment, one must consider the ethical implications of the research. For example, the experiment must comply with the principles of the Belmont Report and the Declaration of Helsinki."
