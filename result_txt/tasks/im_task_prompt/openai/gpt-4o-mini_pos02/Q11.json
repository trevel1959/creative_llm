    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Utilize UV-C light technology in the lid of the bottle to provide self-cleaning capabilities. When activated, this feature would kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses within the bottle, ensuring that it remains clean and safe to use. This would be particularly beneficial for outdoor enthusiasts or people who frequently refill their bottles in public places.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a detachable chamber within the bottle that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or tea leaves. This chamber would have a mesh filter to prevent solid particles from mixing with the water, allowing for a variety of flavor combinations. The infuser could be easily cleaned and replaced, making it a fun way to encourage more water consumption.",
    "**Temperature Control System**: Incorporate a double-walled vacuum insulation system with an adjustable temperature control feature. Users could set their desired water temperature (cold, room temperature, or warm) through a small touchscreen on the bottle. The bottle would then maintain that temperature for hours, making it perfect for hot tea, cold beverages, or room temperature water, regardless of external conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Plant-Based Design**: Create a water bottle made from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based bioplastics. The design could incorporate a small seed capsule at the base, allowing users to plant the bottle after its lifecycle. This would encourage sustainability and promote environmental awareness while providing a functional water bottle.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cap**: Design a cap that serves multiple purposes, such as a built-in cup, a measuring tool for hydration tracking, and a storage compartment for vitamins or supplements. The cap could also feature a straw or a spout for easy drinking. This multi-functional design would cater to active individuals who need convenience and versatility in their hydration solutions."
