    "**Smart Oven Integration with AI Personal Assistant**: Develop an oven that integrates with popular AI personal assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This oven would allow users to control its functions using voice commands. It could preheat, adjust temperature, set timers, and even provide recipe suggestions based on the ingredients available in your pantry. This integration makes cooking more convenient and efficient, allowing busy individuals to manage their meals without having to physically interact with the oven.",
    "**Portable Oven for Outdoor Cooking**: Design a compact, lightweight oven that can easily be carried to outdoor events such as picnics, camping trips, or festivals. This oven would feature durable materials and have a compact design, making it suitable for those who enjoy cooking away from home. It could include features like a detachable grill or griddle, adjustable temperature settings, and possibly a built-in battery pack for cordless operation.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Experience Oven**: Create an oven that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the cooking experience. When a user places a recipe book or smartphone with a cooking app near the oven, the device projects cooking instructions onto the food being cooked, allowing the user to see exactly where to place toppings, how to flip items, or when to add ingredients. This interactive feature could make learning new recipes more engaging and fun.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Smart Oven with Waste Reduction Features**: Design an oven that not only cooks food efficiently but also helps reduce waste. The oven could come with a built-in food waste composter, which processes leftover food scraps into compost during cooking. It might also feature sensors that detect when certain ingredients are running low and suggest recipes that use up these items before they expire. This eco-friendly feature appeals to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Customizable Flavor Infusion Oven**: Develop an oven that allows users to customize the flavor of their dishes by infusing them with various flavors during the cooking process. The oven could contain small chambers within it where users can place different flavorings or spices. As the food cooks, the heat causes the flavorings to vaporize and infuse into the food, creating unique and customizable dishes. Users could experiment with different flavor combinations to suit their preferences, enhancing the overall dining experience."
