    "**ECHO (Elevated Cognitive Harmony Oscillator)**: A wearable device that uses AI-powered audio signals to create a 3D audio map of the surroundings. This technology would allow visually impaired individuals to \"hear\" their environment, detecting obstacles, people, and objects through a unique sound wave pattern. ECHO would use machine learning algorithms to adapt to the user's preferences and environment, ensuring a seamless experience.",
    "**Lumina**: A smart cane that integrates a high-resolution camera, GPS, and AI-powered computer vision. This device would provide real-time feedback to the user, offering a detailed description of their surroundings, including obstacles, stairs, and even the identity of people nearby. Lumina would also offer navigation assistance, guiding the user through unfamiliar areas with turn-by-turn directions.",
    "**SoundScape**: A home automation system designed specifically for visually impaired individuals. This innovative technology would use a combination of audio cues, smart home devices, and AI-powered voice assistants to create a personalized and immersive experience. SoundScape would allow users to navigate their home with ease, receiving audio feedback on temperature, lighting, and even the location of family members or pets.",
    "**Tactile Navigator**: A wearable device that uses haptic feedback to guide visually impaired individuals through their environment. This technology would employ a network of tiny sensors and actuators to create a tactile map of the surroundings, allowing users to feel their way through spaces. Tactile Navigator would be particularly useful for individuals with limited mobility or those navigating complex environments.",
    "**Vista**: An AI-powered smart glass that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide real-time visual feedback to visually impaired individuals. Vista would use machine learning algorithms to recognize and identify objects, people, and environments, superimposing relevant information onto the user's field of vision. This technology would enable users to \"see\" their surroundings in a way that's both familiar and accessible."
