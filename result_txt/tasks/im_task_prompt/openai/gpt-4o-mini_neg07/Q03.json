    "**Built-in Recipe Database**: Incorporate a touchscreen interface that connects to an extensive database of recipes. Users can select a dish, and the microwave will automatically adjust the time and power settings based on the selected recipe. This feature could also suggest cooking times for different food items, making it easier for novice cooks.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Function**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high temperatures to sanitize the interior of the microwave. After cooking, users could activate this function to eliminate food splatters and odors, ensuring a cleaner cooking environment without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "**Dual Cooking Chambers**: Design a microwave with two separate cooking chambers that can operate independently. This would allow users to cook or reheat different foods at the same time without flavor contamination. For instance, one side could steam vegetables while the other side reheats a casserole.",
    "**Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: Implement advanced sensors that monitor the temperature and humidity levels inside the microwave. This would allow for precise cooking adjustments, ensuring that food is cooked evenly and thoroughly. The microwave could alert users if it detects that food is drying out or overcooking.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Mode**: Create an energy-efficient mode that uses lower power settings for reheating smaller portions or specific types of food. This mode would reduce energy consumption while still delivering satisfactory results, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers."
