    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a built-in dispenser that uses biodegradable, concentrated detergent pods. The machine could calculate the precise amount of detergent needed based on the load size and soil level, minimizing waste and environmental impact. This would encourage eco-conscious consumers to use less harmful products while still achieving clean clothes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Integrate a self-cleaning feature that utilizes UV light and high-temperature steam to sanitize the drum and hoses after every few cycles. This would help prevent mold and bacteria buildup, ensuring that clothes come out fresh and clean every time, and reducing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Modular Wash Settings**: Create a customizable interface that allows users to program specific wash settings based on their preferences or fabric types. Users could save their favorite cycles and share them with friends or family through a mobile app. This feature would cater to diverse laundry needs and improve user experience.",
    "**Laundry Folding Assistant**: Incorporate a robotic folding system that can gently take clothes out of the washing machine and fold them neatly. This could be done using soft robotic arms that mimic human movements, making laundry less of a chore. Users could select different folding styles, such as casual or formal, for various clothing types.",
    "**Integrated Drying Feature**: Develop a washing machine that can also dry clothes using advanced heat pump technology. This feature would eliminate the need for a separate dryer, saving space and energy. Users could wash and dry their clothes in one cycle, with options for various drying settings to suit different fabrics."
