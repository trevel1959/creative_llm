    "**Agricultural Changes**: Farming practices would need to adapt to the increased size of animals. Larger animals would require more space and resources for feeding and breeding. Farmers would need to redesign their farms to accommodate these changes, potentially leading to changes in the types of crops and animals raised.",
    "**Wildlife Impact**: The ecosystem would be significantly disrupted. Predators would need to adapt to hunting larger prey, while prey animals would need to adapt to evading larger predators. This could lead to a cascade effect throughout the food chain.",
    "**Housing and Living Spaces**: Buildings would need to be designed to accommodate the increased size of animals. This could include larger living spaces, larger furniture, and higher ceilings. Additionally, cities would need to be redesigned to accommodate the increased space requirements.",
    "**Economic Impact**: The economy would be affected by the increased demand for resources to support larger animals. This could lead to increased prices for goods and services, as well as changes in the workforce.",
    "**Education and Research**: There would be a need for new educational programs and research to understand the biological and behavioral changes that would occur in animals. This could lead to a greater focus on animal biology and ecology in schools and universities."
