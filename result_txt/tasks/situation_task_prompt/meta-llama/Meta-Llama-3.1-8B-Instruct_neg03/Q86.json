    "**Bio-luminescent Bacteria Soap Alternative**: Develop a product that harnesses the power of bio-luminescent bacteria to create a natural, non-toxic soap substitute. These bacteria, found in certain species of fungi, can be engineered to break down organic matter and produce a soft, gentle lather. This soap alternative would not only be eco-friendly but also provide a unique, glowing cleaning experience.",
    "**Electrostatic Dusting Device**: Design a handheld device that utilizes electrostatic charges to attract and trap dust particles, making it a soap-free solution for cleaning surfaces. This device would be powered by a rechargeable battery and feature interchangeable filters to capture various types of dust and debris.",
    "**Nano-particle Cleaning Solution**: Create a soap-free cleaning solution that utilizes nano-particles to break down and remove dirt and grime. These particles would be made from natural materials like plant extracts or minerals and would be engineered to target specific types of stains and substances. The solution would be applied to surfaces using a specialized applicator or spray bottle.",
    "**UV-C Light Sanitizer**: Develop a device that uses UV-C light to sanitize surfaces, eliminating the need for soap. This device would feature a compact, handheld design and would be powered by a rechargeable battery. The UV-C light would be carefully calibrated to target and destroy bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms without damaging surfaces.",
    "**Microfiber Cleaning Mitts with Built-in Sanitizers**: Design a line of microfiber cleaning mitts that incorporate built-in sanitizers, eliminating the need for soap. These mitts would feature a unique, textured surface that traps dirt and debris, while the built-in sanitizers would utilize natural ingredients like essential oils or plant extracts to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. The mitts would be machine washable and reusable, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly cleaning solution.
