    "**Sustainable Sponge Innovation**: Design a sponge that absorbs and filters water, making it a self-sustaining product for households, hotels, and restaurants. The sponge would have a built-in system that collects and recycles water, reducing waste and minimizing the need for frequent replacements.",
    "**Smart Sponge Technology**: Develop a sponge that can detect and alert users to potential health risks, such as bacterial or viral contamination. This could be achieved through the integration of sensors that detect changes in the sponge's composition or the presence of specific pathogens.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Sponge Alternative**: Create a biodegradable sponge made from natural materials like coconut coir, bamboo, or mushroom mycelium. This sponge would be compostable, reducing plastic waste and promoting a more circular economy.",
    "**Aesthetic Sponge Design**: Design a sponge that doubles as a decorative piece for the home or office. The sponge could be shaped like a sculpture, have a unique texture, or be made from a variety of colors and materials, making it a conversation-starting piece.",
    "**Sponge for Space Exploration**: Develop a sponge that can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, making it suitable for use in space exploration. The sponge could be used to absorb and filter water in spacecraft or on planetary surfaces, ensuring a reliable source of hydration for astronauts."
