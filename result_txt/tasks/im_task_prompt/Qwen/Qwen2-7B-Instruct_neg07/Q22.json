    "**Innovative Flashlight Design**: Create a flashlight that incorporates multiple light modes for various uses. For example, it could have modes like a standard flashlight, an emergency beacon, an SOS signal, and a dimmer mode for reading or navigating in low light conditions without blinding others. The design could include features such as a magnetic base for hands-free use, a water-resistant casing for outdoor use, and an integrated solar panel for charging. ",
    "**Voice-Activated Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that can be activated by voice commands. This could be particularly useful in dark environments where the user needs both hands to perform tasks. By integrating voice recognition technology, the flashlight could be turned on and off by saying \"light\" or \"on\" and \"off,\" respectively. This would also allow users to change brightness levels or activate specific modes with voice commands.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with Bluetooth Connectivity**: Design a flashlight that connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth. Users could control the flashlight's functions, such as turning it on and off, adjusting brightness, and switching between modes, directly from their phone. Additionally, the flashlight could send alerts to the user's phone if it's left behind, or sync with fitness apps to track usage over time.",
    "**Portable Rechargeable Power Bank Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that doubles as a portable power bank for charging other devices. This idea combines two common needs - emergency lighting and device charging - into one product. The flashlight could have a USB-C or USB-A port for charging smartphones, tablets, or other USB-powered devices. It would be ideal for camping trips, outdoor events, or power outages.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Flashlight with Renewable Energy Source**: Develop a flashlight that runs on renewable energy sources, such as kinetic energy, solar power, or even water. Kinetic energy could be generated by shaking the flashlight, while solar power would charge the flashlight through a built-in solar panel. Alternatively, a small turbine could generate electricity when submerged in water, making the flashlight a practical choice for aquatic activities. These eco-friendly designs would not only reduce reliance on batteries but also promote sustainable practices."
