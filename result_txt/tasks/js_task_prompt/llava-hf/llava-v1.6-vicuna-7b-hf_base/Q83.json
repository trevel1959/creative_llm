    "28-hour day: This length of day is based on the 28-day lunar cycle, which is the length of time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth. An 28-hour day would provide a more consistent day length throughout the year, as the length of a day varies throughout the year due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. This would also be useful for those who work night shifts or have irregular sleep patterns.",
    "30-hour day: This length of day is based on the 30-day solar cycle, which is the length of time it takes for the sun to complete one orbit around the Earth. An 30-hour day would provide a more even distribution of daylight throughout the year, which could be beneficial for those who enjoy outdoor activities or work outdoors.",
    "26-hour day: This length of day is based on the 26-day lunar month, which is the average length of time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth. An 26-hour day would provide a more even distribution of daylight throughout the year, which could be beneficial for those who work night shifts or have irregular sleep patterns.",
    "29.5-hour day: This length of day is based on the 29.5-day lunar month, which is the actual length of time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth. An 29.5-hour day would provide a more consistent day length throughout the year, as the length of a day varies throughout the year due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. This would also be useful for those who work night shifts or have irregular sleep patterns.",
    "31-hour day: This length of day is based on the 31-day solar cycle, which is the length of time it takes for the sun to complete one orbit around the Earth. An 31-hour day would provide a more even distribution of daylight throughout the year, which could be beneficial for those who enjoy outdoor activities or work outdoors."
