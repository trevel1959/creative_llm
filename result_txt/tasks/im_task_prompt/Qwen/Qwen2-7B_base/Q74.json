    "Self-Watering Watering Can: Develop a self-watering can that would include a mechanism for the can to know when it's full and when it needs to be refilled. The can can also have an alarm or buzzer when the reservoir is empty. With this, there is no need for the user to monitor the water level manually and refill every time.",
    "Battery-Powered Watering Can: A feature can be built into the watering can that requires no power source other than sunlight. The watering can can use solar power cells that charge during the day and use that power to irrigate plants at night. This not only saves energy but also ensures that the can is usable 24/7.",
    "Water-Savvy Watering Can: For areas where water scarcity is a concern, a smart watering can can be designed. The can can measure how much water is used and how much is saved through various techniques like reducing spillage, reducing water waste by only irrigating the roots and not the soil, and even harvesting and reusing rainwater.",
    "Human-Body Warmth-Based Irrigation: If the can is taken inside during winter, a small heating element can be installed in the can that is activated by the warmth of human bodies (e.g., through a sensor detecting proximity, humidity etc.) This can reduce the loss of water due to evaporation on cooler days.",
    "Compost Watering Can: The can can have a filter that captures and processes compost waste with the rainwater, providing nutrients to the soil."
