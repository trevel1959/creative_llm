The watch could have a built-in mechanism that uses quantum entanglement to create a stable wormhole, allowing the wearer to travel through time. The watch could also have a feature that allows the wearer to communicate with their past or future self.",
    "Solar Powered Watch: Design a watch that runs entirely on solar power. The watch could have a built-in solar panel that charges during the day and powers the watch at night.
