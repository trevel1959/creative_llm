    "Another potential problem could be the cost of implementing the solution. Building or renting housing and providing resources can be expensive, and the city may not have the budget to support it.",
    "The solution may not be sustainable in the long term. Without ongoing funding or support, the solution may fall apart or become ineffective.",
    "The solution may not address the root causes of homelessness. If the solution only provides temporary housing or resources, it may not address the underlying issues that cause people to become homeless in the first place.",
    "The solution may not be accessible to all homeless individuals. There may be certain groups of homeless people who are unable to access the resources or housing provided by the solution.",
    "The solution may not be culturally sensitive. The needs and preferences of homeless individuals may vary depending on their cultural background, and the solution may not take these differences into account."
