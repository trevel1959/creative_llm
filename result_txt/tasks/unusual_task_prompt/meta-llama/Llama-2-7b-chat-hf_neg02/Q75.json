    "Smart Microwave Oven with AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions: Create a microwave oven with an AI-powered system that can suggest recipes based on the user's dietary preferences, cooking skills, and the ingredients available in their kitchen. The microwave would be equipped with sensors to detect the food's nutritional content and suggest healthy recipes. Additionally, the AI system could provide step-by-step instructions and voice guidance to ensure the user cooks the dish correctly.",
    "Portable Microwave-Powered Water Purifier: Design a portable microwave-powered water purifier that can be used in remote areas or during natural disasters. The device would use microwave energy to kill bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants in water, making it safe for consumption. The portability of the device would make it easy to transport and use in different locations.",
    "Microwave-Powered Wireless Charging System: Develop a wireless charging system that uses microwave energy to charge electronic devices. The system would consist of a base station with a microwave emitter and a series of receiving pads that can be placed on or near the electronic devices to be charged. This would eliminate the need for cables and provide a convenient and efficient way to charge devices wirelessly.",
    "Microwave-Based Food Sanitization System: Create a system that uses microwave energy to sanitize food surfaces, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. The system would use microwave energy to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms on food surfaces, making it safer for consumption. This system could be particularly useful in hospitals, restaurants, and other food service establishments.",
    "Microwave-Powered Space Exploration: Design a microwave-powered spacecraft that can be used for interplanetary travel. The spacecraft would use microwave energy to propel itself through space, eliminating the need for traditional propulsion systems. This would make space travel faster, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly. Additionally, the microwave energy could be used to power advanced life support systems and other onboard equipment."
