    "**Finding Food**: A deserted island may not provide immediate access to food. Survivors might struggle with identifying edible plants, fruits, or seafood. To solve this, they could research local flora and fauna to understand which are safe to consume. Setting traps for small animals or fishing using improvised tools could also provide sustenance. Learning basic survival skills before heading out could be beneficial.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can pose a significant threat to survival. Without adequate shelter, individuals risk hypothermia or sunburn. Survivors should utilize natural materials like palm leaves, branches, and driftwood to construct a sturdy shelter that offers protection from wind and rain. Positioning the shelter away from potential hazards, such as falling branches or flooding areas, is crucial.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: Being lost on a deserted island can lead to confusion and disorientation. Survivors may struggle to determine their location or the direction of potential rescue. Creating a makeshift compass using a needle and a magnetized object, or using natural landmarks like the sun's position, can help in navigation. Marking trails or establishing a signal point for rescuers can also enhance chances of being found.",
    "**Health and Hygiene Issues**: Prolonged isolation can lead to health issues, including infections or illness due to poor hygiene. Without access to medical supplies, survivors must find ways to maintain cleanliness. They could use natural antiseptics, like honey or aloe vera, to treat wounds. Establishing a routine for washing hands and bathing in freshwater sources can also help prevent infections.",
    "**Psychological Strain**: The mental toll of being stranded can lead to anxiety, depression, or panic. To combat this, survivors should establish a daily routine that includes tasks like foraging, building, and resting. Engaging in mindfulness practices, such as meditation or journaling, can help maintain mental clarity. Finding ways to stay connected with nature, like observing wildlife or sunsets, can also provide emotional comfort."
