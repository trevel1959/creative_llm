    "Smart Soap Dispenser with Voice Control: Create a soap dispenser that can be controlled through voice commands. This would allow users to easily dispense soap without having to physically touch the dispenser, making it ideal for public restrooms or high-traffic areas where hygiene is a concern. The dispenser could be equipped with a small speaker and microphone, allowing users to activate it with voice commands like \"Dispense soap\" or \"Refill soap.\"",
    "Soap Dispenser with UV Light Sanitizing Technology: Design a soap dispenser that incorporates UV light sanitizing technology to kill bacteria and germs on the dispenser and the soap. This would provide an additional layer of hygiene in public restrooms, where the risk of bacterial transmission is higher. The UV light could be positioned inside the dispenser to ensure that the soap is sanitized before it is dispensed.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Built-in Soap Sensors: Create a soap dispenser that can detect when soap is running low and automatically refill it. This would eliminate the need for manual checks and refills, ensuring that the soap is always available when needed. The dispenser could be equipped with sensors that detect the level of soap inside and trigger the refill mechanism when the level falls below a certain threshold.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Augmented Reality Display: Design a soap dispenser that incorporates an augmented reality (AR) display. The dispenser could display information such as the remaining soap level, the time of day, or even advertisements and promotions. The AR display could be projected onto a surface near the dispenser, providing an interactive and engaging experience for users.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Air Purification: Create a soap dispenser that incorporates air purification technology. The dispenser could be equipped with a small air purifier that circulates clean air around the dispenser, providing a more hygienic and comfortable environment for users. This would be particularly beneficial in restrooms with poor ventilation or high levels of airborne germs and bacteria."
