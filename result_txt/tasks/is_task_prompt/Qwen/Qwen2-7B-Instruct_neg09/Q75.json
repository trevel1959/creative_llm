    "**Sound Visualization Workshop:** Develop a workshop where participants learn to visualize sounds in different colors, shapes, and sizes. The workshop could be tailored for children, particularly the \"Little Girl Who Could See Sounds.\" The concept could involve using music theory as a foundation, teaching kids about scales, chords, and notes.
