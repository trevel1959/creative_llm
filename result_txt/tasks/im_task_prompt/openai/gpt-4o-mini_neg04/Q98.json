    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high-pressure water jets to clean the juicer after use. This would eliminate the tedious task of disassembling and scrubbing parts, making the juicing process more convenient and encouraging users to juice more often.",
    "**Dual-Chamber Juicer**: Create a juicer with two separate chambers: one for fruits and another for vegetables. This design would allow users to create complex juice blends without the flavors mingling prematurely. Each chamber could have its own settings for optimal extraction, ensuring that both fruits and vegetables are juiced to perfection.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a juicer made entirely from sustainable, biodegradable materials. The design could incorporate solar panels to power the motor, reducing electricity consumption. Additionally, the packaging could be minimal and compostable, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Personalized Juice Subscription Service**: Pair the juicer with a subscription service that delivers fresh, pre-prepped ingredients tailored to individual preferences and health goals. Users could receive weekly boxes with seasonal fruits and vegetables, complete with recipe cards and nutritional information, making juicing easy and enjoyable.",
    "**Modular Juicer System**: Create a modular juicer that allows users to customize and upgrade their juicing experience. Users could add attachments for different functions, such as a smoothie blender, nut milk maker, or even a food processor. This flexibility would cater to various culinary needs and preferences, making the juicer a multifunctional kitchen tool."
