    "Nature's Rhythm: Embrace the natural rhythm of the world around us to keep track of time. Observe the sun's position in the sky, the changing shadows, and the tides to estimate time. For instance, the position of the sun in the sky can indicate the time of day, while the changing shadows can help mark the passage of time.",
    "Time Stones: Create a system of stones or rocks with unique markings or colors to represent different time intervals. For example, a red stone could represent 15 minutes, a blue stone could represent 30 minutes, and a green stone could represent an hour. As time passes, add or remove stones to keep track of the minutes, hours, and days.",
    "Sand Timers: Use hourglasses or sand timers to measure time. Fill the hourglasses or sand timers with different colored sands to represent different time intervals. As the sands flow, the colored sands will mix, providing a visual representation of the passing time.",
    "Memory Jars: Create a series of jars with different levels of water to represent different time intervals. Each jar can have a different color or symbol to help you distinguish between them. As time passes, observe the level of water in each jar to determine the time. For example, a jar with a low level of water could represent 30 minutes, while a jar with a higher level of water could represent an hour.",
    "Time Tapestry: Weave a tapestry with different colored threads to represent different time intervals. Each color can represent a different unit of time, such as minutes, hours, or days. As time passes, add or remove threads to keep track of the passing time. The tapestry can also serve as a visual representation of the passage of time, allowing you to see the progression of minutes, hours, and days."
