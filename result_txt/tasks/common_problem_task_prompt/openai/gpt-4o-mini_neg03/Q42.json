    "**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: If the experiment involves human subjects, recruiting a diverse and representative sample can be challenging. Additionally, retaining participants throughout the duration of the study can be problematic due to dropouts or lack of engagement. Developing an incentive program and maintaining regular communication with participants can enhance recruitment and retention efforts.",
    "**Resource Allocation**: Large-scale experiments often require significant resources, including funding, equipment, and personnel. Mismanagement or unexpected shortages can lead to delays or compromises in the experiment's quality. Creating a detailed budget and resource management plan, along with contingency strategies, can help address potential shortages or misallocations.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Large-scale experiments often require collaboration across multiple disciplines, which can lead to communication barriers and differing methodologies. These differences can create conflicts or misunderstandings among team members. Establishing clear communication channels and regular interdisciplinary meetings can foster collaboration and ensure everyone is aligned on goals and methods.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Conducting large-scale experiments, especially those involving human or animal subjects, raises ethical concerns. Issues such as informed consent, potential harm to participants, and data privacy must be carefully considered. Developing a comprehensive ethics review process and adhering to established guidelines can help navigate these challenges and maintain the integrity of the research.",
    "**Environmental and External Factors**: Experiments can be influenced by external environmental factors such as weather conditions, political climate, or even technological disruptions (e.g., power outages). These factors can introduce variability that may skew results. Designing the experiment with flexibility in mind, such as including control groups or alternative testing conditions, can help mitigate these risks."
