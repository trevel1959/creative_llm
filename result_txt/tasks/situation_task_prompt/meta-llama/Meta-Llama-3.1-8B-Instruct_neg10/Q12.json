    "**Bio-Luminescent House**: I'd create a bio-luminescent house that harnesses the power of bioluminescent organisms to produce light and heat. The walls and ceiling would be covered in a specialized membrane that contains microorganisms like glowing mushrooms or plankton. These organisms would convert chemical energy into light and heat, providing a sustainable and eerie glow to my home. The bio-luminescent effect would also create a mesmerizing ambiance, making the mundane task of heating the home a fascinating experience.",
    "**Solar Still House**: I'd design a house that incorporates a solar still system to harness the power of the sun. The house would have a series of stills that use the sun's heat to evaporate water from a reservoir, which would then be collected and used for heating. The stills would be made from a transparent material that allows sunlight to penetrate, and the collected water would be used in a hydronic heating system. This system would not only provide heat but also purify the water, making it a self-sustaining and eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Thermal Mass House**: I'd build a house that uses thermal mass to store heat from the sun during the day and release it at night. The house would be constructed with thick, heavy walls made from materials like concrete or brick, which would absorb and store heat from the sun. During the day, the walls would be heated, and at night, the heat would be released, providing a natural and efficient heating system. The thermal mass would also help regulate the indoor temperature, reducing the need for artificial heating.",
    "**Geothermal House**: I'd create a house that leverages geothermal energy to heat and cool the home. The house would be built over a geothermal well that taps into the Earth's natural heat. A heat exchanger would be used to transfer the heat from the well to a hydronic system, which would distribute the heat throughout the house. This system would provide a reliable and consistent source of heat, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and lowering energy bills.",
    "**Recycled Material House**: I'd design a house that uses recycled materials to create a unique and sustainable heating system. The house would be constructed from recycled plastic or glass, which would be melted and molded into a thermal mass. The thermal mass would be used to store heat from the sun or a small wood stove, and would release it at night, providing a natural and efficient heating system. The use"
