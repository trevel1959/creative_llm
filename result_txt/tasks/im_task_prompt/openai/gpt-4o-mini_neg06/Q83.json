    "**Ergonomic Design Enhancements**: Redesign the shopping cart with an adjustable handle that can be raised or lowered based on the user's height, promoting comfort and reducing strain. Additionally, the cart could have a wider base and larger wheels to improve stability and maneuverability, especially in crowded aisles.",
    "**Interactive Child Seat**: Incorporate a fun, interactive child seat that entertains kids while parents shop. The seat could have a small touchscreen with games, educational apps, and even a virtual shopping assistant that helps children learn about healthy food choices, making shopping a more enjoyable experience for families.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a shopping cart made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. The cart could feature solar-powered LED lights for visibility in dimly lit areas, and a built-in compost bin for organic waste, encouraging shoppers to think about sustainability while they shop.",
    "**Mobile Checkout Integration**: Create a shopping cart with a built-in scanner and payment system, allowing shoppers to scan items as they place them in the cart. At the end of their shopping trip, they can pay directly from the cart using a credit card or mobile payment app, bypassing long checkout lines and making the process faster and more convenient.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Equip the cart with sensors that can monitor the shopper's heart rate and stress levels through a handle grip. If stress levels rise, the cart could suggest a break or a calming breathing exercise on its display. This feature would be especially useful for elderly shoppers or those with health concerns, promoting a more mindful shopping experience."
