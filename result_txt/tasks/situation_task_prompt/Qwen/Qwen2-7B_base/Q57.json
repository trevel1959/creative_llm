    "Construct self-sustaining, energy-efficient micro homes on stilts, either on the coast or inland at higher elevations. Designing and building these structures would require using energy-efficient materials and technologies, as well as incorporating renewable energy sources like solar panels. The micro homes could be energy-independent, with water recycling and harvesting systems integrated.",
    "Create coastal \"ark\" communities that use land reclamation techniques to expand the land area above sea level. These arks would be designed to rise with the sea level, using sustainable materials and self-sufficient design principles, such as composting toilets, natural ventilation, and solar power.",
    "Build self-sustaining vertical gardens and urban farms on a high-rise construction platform to support communities. These vertical gardens would grow food and provide oxygen while also functioning as a barrier to protect against strong wind and waves caused by rising sea levels. The platform could include solar panels to power the farms and communities, as well as rainwater harvesting and other low-impact technologies.",
    "Develop underground structures and urbanization within flooded city areas. By building subterranean structures that can accommodate people, businesses, and infrastructure, the existing urban areas can continue to function without being displaced by rising sea levels. The subterranean design could include tunnels for transportation, office spaces, and living areas, as well as emergency power and water reserves.",
    "Establish modular, relocatable building systems with energy-efficient designs. Using modular construction materials that can be assembled easily at higher elevations, structures can be built on stilts or raised foundations. These buildings can be designed to be relocatable, giving communities the option to move to safer sites if necessary, while also reducing the environmental impact of constructing large numbers of permanent buildings."
