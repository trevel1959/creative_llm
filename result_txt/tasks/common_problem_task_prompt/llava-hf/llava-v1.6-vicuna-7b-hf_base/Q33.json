    "Lack of tools and equipment: In urban areas, people have access to a wide variety of tools and equipment. But on a deserted island, one may not have access to tools to build shelter, prepare food, or protect themselves from the elements. This could lead to discomfort and potential safety risks.",
    "Harsh environmental conditions: The island environment can be hostile, with extreme temperatures, strong winds, and rough seas. One needs to be prepared to handle these environmental challenges, which can include wearing sufficient protective gear, and having the knowledge and ability to build shelters to protect themselves from the elements.",
    "Limited communication: The deserted island will have limited or no access to communication equipment, making it difficult to contact rescue teams or inform someone on the mainland about their whereabouts.",
    "Lack of knowledge about island wildlife: Being unfamiliar with the island wildlife can lead to dangerous encounters and can also hinder efforts to survive by limiting access to available resources.",
    "Uncertainty about rescue time: Although there is usually a timeframe for rescue, knowing and estimating that time is essential for any survivor on a deserted island. It can impact the way one plans and manages their resources, whether it is rationing food and water, conserving energy, or looking for rescue opportunities."
