    "**Submarine Travel**: Another option for long-distance travel could be submarine vessels. These underwater vehicles would allow people to travel beneath the ocean's surface, avoiding surface-level hazards and congestion. Submarine travel could be used for both passenger and cargo transport, and they could be powered by nuclear reactors or advanced battery technology.",
    "**Space Travel**: In the event of all impassable roads, space travel could become the new standard for long-distance travel. With the development of reusable rockets and space shuttles, humanity could establish a network of space stations and lunar colonies. This would allow for rapid travel across the solar system, as well as the possibility of interstellar travel in the future.",
    "**Maglev Trains**: Maglev trains, which use magnetic levitation to lift the train above the tracks, could become the new standard for high-speed transportation. Maglev trains are much faster than traditional trains and can travel at speeds of over 300 mph. They could be used for both passenger and cargo transport, and they could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind.",
    "**Automated Tunnels**: Another solution could be the development of automated tunnel systems. These tunnels could be built using advanced robotics and construction technology, allowing for rapid and efficient transportation of people and goods. They could be built at a faster pace than traditional tunnels, and they could be powered by geothermal or hydroelectric energy.",
    "**Floating Cities**: In a world where all roads are impassable, floating cities could become a viable solution for long-distance travel. These cities could be built on large, specially designed barges or airships, and they could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind. Floating cities could be used for both residential and commercial purposes, and they could provide a unique and sustainable mode of transportation."
