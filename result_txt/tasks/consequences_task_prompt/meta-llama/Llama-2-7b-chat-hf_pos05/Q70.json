    "Gravity would be stronger: If the speed of light were reduced by half, the gravitational force between objects would increase. This means that objects would be drawn towards each other more strongly, causing their orbits to shrink and their rotation periods to speed up.",
    "Time dilation would be more extreme: As the speed of light is reduced, time dilation would become more pronounced. This means that time would appear to pass more slowly for objects in the vicinity of the reduced light speed, causing strange effects like time loops and slow motion.",
    "The cosmic microwave background radiation would be different: The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. If the speed of light were reduced, the CMB would appear different, with a lower temperature and different spectrum.",
    "Black holes would be different: Reducing the speed of light would affect the behavior of black holes. They would be less massive and have different event horizons, causing their gravitational pull to be weaker. This would also affect the way they distort space-time around them.",
    "The universe would be younger: If the speed of light were reduced, the universe would appear younger than it actually is. This is because the light that is available to observe the universe would be less intense, making it appear smaller and less evolved than it actually is."
