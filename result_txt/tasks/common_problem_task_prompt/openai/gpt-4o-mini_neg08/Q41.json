    "**Life Support System Complexity**: Designing a reliable life support system poses numerous challenges. Potential problems include ensuring a sustainable supply of oxygen and water, managing carbon dioxide levels, and recycling waste. If the system fails, it could jeopardize the crew's safety. Moreover, redundancy in these systems is essential, which can complicate the design and increase costs.",
    "**Navigation and Communication Limitations**: The vastness of space presents significant navigation and communication challenges. Issues may arise from the delay in signal transmission over long distances, which can hinder real-time communication with mission control. Additionally, navigating through uncharted territories could lead to potential collisions with space debris or celestial bodies.",
    "**Energy Source Reliability**: Selecting a power source for the spaceship is crucial, as it needs to be reliable over long missions. Problems may include the limited lifespan of batteries, the efficiency of solar panels in deep space, or the risk of fuel contamination in nuclear propulsion systems. Each energy source comes with its own set of risks and benefits that need to be carefully evaluated.",
    "**Crew Dynamics and Psychological Factors**: Long-duration space missions can take a toll on the crew's mental health. Potential problems include isolation, interpersonal conflicts, and the stress of confined living conditions. Designers must consider how to create spaces that promote well-being, such as private areas for relaxation and recreational activities to alleviate psychological strain.",
    "**Emergency Protocols and Safety Measures**: Developing comprehensive emergency protocols is essential for the safety of the crew. Problems may arise in anticipating all possible emergencies, such as system failures, fires, or medical emergencies. The challenge lies in training the crew to respond effectively under pressure and ensuring that the spaceship is equipped with necessary safety equipment and escape routes."
