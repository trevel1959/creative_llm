    "Establish a Community Waste Collection System: Create a network of volunteers who would collect and transport waste to designated areas for composting, recycling, or proper disposal. This system could be organized through a community app or social media platform, allowing residents to sign up and coordinate collection times.",
    "Invent a Waste-to-Energy Device: Design a device that converts waste into usable energy, such as electricity or fuel. This could be powered by a combination of biomass, organic waste, and other non-recyclable materials. The device could be small enough for individual households or larger installations for communities.",
    "Create a Waste-Sharing Economy: Develop a platform where individuals can share waste reduction and recycling practices, as well as resources and expertise. This could include sharing tips, recipes, and DIY projects for repurposing or upcycling waste materials. The platform could also facilitate the exchange of waste-reducing tools and equipment.",
    "Establish a Community Garden: Transform unused spaces into community gardens, where waste materials can be used as fertilizer and compost. This would not only reduce waste but also provide a space for community members to grow their own food and promote sustainability.",
    "Develop a Waste-to-Product Innovation Lab: Create a dedicated space where innovators and entrepreneurs can experiment with new ways to transform waste into valuable products. This could include developing new materials, products, or processes that reduce waste and promote sustainability. The lab could also provide resources and mentorship for individuals interested in waste reduction and innovation."
