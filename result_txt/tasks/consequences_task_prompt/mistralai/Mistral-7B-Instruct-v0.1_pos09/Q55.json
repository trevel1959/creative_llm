    "It would also have implications for scientific research and experimentation, as time dilationcause bycausingcausing different gravitational fields or speeds of light would affect the accuracy of measurements and observations.",
    "It would also have implications for human psychology and perception, as people would have to adjust their mental and emotional processes to cope with the different time zones and the way time moves at different speeds in different parts of the world."
