    "**Eco-Friendly Tower**: Design a high-rise building that doubles as a living organism, incorporating sustainable features such as solar panels, wind turbines, and a green roof. The building's façade would be covered in a layer of algae-based biofilm, which would produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. The structure would be constructed using locally sourced, recycled materials, minimizing waste and environmental impact. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Inflatable Skyscraper**: Develop a modular, inflatable building system that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. The structure would be composed of interconnected, inflatable modules that provide a flexible and adaptive space. This design would allow for rapid deployment in emergency situations or temporary events, reducing the need for permanent infrastructure. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Self-Sustaining Habitat**: Create a high-rise building that serves as a self-sustaining ecosystem, incorporating features such as on-site water collection and recycling, urban agriculture, and energy harvesting. The building would be designed to minimize its carbon footprint and promote biodiversity, with a focus on creating a thriving community within the structure. Confidence: 0.85",
    "**Shape-Shifting Building**: Develop a high-rise building with a dynamic, shape-shifting façade that can adapt to changing environmental conditions and user needs. The building's surface would be covered in a layer of responsive, nanotechnology-based materials that can change color, texture, and reflectivity in response to temperature, humidity, and light. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Subterranean Skyscraper**: Design a high-rise building that is partially or entirely underground, using geothermal energy and natural light to power and illuminate the structure. The building would be constructed using advanced tunnel boring techniques and materials, minimizing visual impact and environmental disruption. Confidence: 0.8"
