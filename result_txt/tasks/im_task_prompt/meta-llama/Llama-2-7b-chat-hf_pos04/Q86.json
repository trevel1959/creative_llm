    "Wheelchair with a built-in virtual reality (VR) system: The wheelchair of the future could be equipped with a VR system that allows users to immerse themselves in a virtual world. This could be especially beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments who may not be able to participate in physical activities. The VR system could provide a variety of experiences, such as virtual hikes, bike rides, or even virtual dance classes. The user could control their movement and interaction with the virtual environment using their wheelchair's joystick or other input devices.",
    "Wheelchair with a robotic arm: A wheelchair with a robotic arm could provide users with additional support and mobility. The robotic arm could be used to pick up objects, open doors, or even help the user get dressed. The arm could be controlled using a joystick or voice commands, allowing the user to have greater independence in their daily activities. The robotic arm could also be used to assist the user in navigating their surroundings, providing additional support and stability.",
    "Wheelchair with a built-in oxygen generator: For individuals with respiratory impairments, a wheelchair with a built-in oxygen generator could provide a life-saving feature. The oxygen generator could provide a steady supply of oxygen to the user, allowing them to move around more comfortably and safely. The generator could be powered by a rechargeable battery, ensuring that the user always has access to oxygen when they need it. This could be especially useful for individuals who are unable to carry oxygen tanks with them.",
    "Wheelchair with a hydrogen fuel cell: A wheelchair powered by a hydrogen fuel cell could provide a clean and sustainable source of energy. The fuel cell could convert hydrogen into electricity, which could be used to power the wheelchair's motors. This could provide a long-lasting source of energy, reducing the need for frequent recharging. Additionally, the use of hydrogen as a fuel source could reduce the environmental impact of the wheelchair, making it a more sustainable option for individuals with mobility impairments.",
