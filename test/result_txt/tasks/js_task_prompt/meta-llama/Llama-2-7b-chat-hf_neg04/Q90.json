    "Hydraulic Limbs: Instead of the traditional bone and muscle structure, the human body could be designed with hydraulic limbs. This would allow for greater strength and flexibility, as well as the ability to adjust limb length and shape on the fly. The hydraulic system would be powered by a compact, high-efficiency engine located in the torso, which could be fueled by a variety of sources, including biofuels, solar power, or even the body's own energy reserves.",
    "Built-in Exoskeleton: A built-in exoskeleton would provide additional support and protection for the human body, allowing for greater mobility and endurance in a variety of environments. The exoskeleton could be made of lightweight, durable materials such as carbon fiber or titanium, and could be powered by a combination of electric motors and spring-based actuators. This design would also allow for greater precision and control in delicate tasks such as surgery or fine motor skills.",
    "Bioluminescent Body: The human body could be designed with bioluminescent properties, allowing for enhanced visibility in low-light environments. This could be achieved through the use of specialized cells or tissues that produce light, such as those found in fireflies or glowworms. This design would be particularly useful for individuals who work or live in dark environments, such as search and rescue workers, firefighters, or astronauts.",
    "Environmental Adaptation: The human body could be designed with the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or air pressure. This could be achieved through a variety of means, including specialized cells or tissues that can change shape or composition in response to changing conditions, or through the use of advanced sensors and control systems that can adjust the body's physiology in real-time. This design would allow individuals to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments, from the freezing cold of Antarctica to the blistering heat of the desert.",
    "Invisible Skin: The human body could be designed with invisible skin, allowing for enhanced sensory capabilities and improved protection from external threats. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials that are transparent or semi-transparent"
