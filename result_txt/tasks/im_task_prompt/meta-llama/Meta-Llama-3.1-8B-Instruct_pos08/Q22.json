    "**Lumina Leap**: Develop a portable, wearable device that converts kinetic energy into light. Users can harness the energy generated from their movements, such as jumping or running, to power a flashlight. This innovation could be particularly useful for individuals who need a reliable light source in emergency situations or for outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Solar Sails**: Design a lightweight, flexible material that can harness solar energy to generate electricity. This material could be used to create a portable, inflatable solar sail that can be deployed in various environments, providing a sustainable source of power for devices like flashlights.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Light**: Engineer a microorganism that produces a stable, sustainable light source. This could be achieved by introducing a bioluminescent gene into a microbe, which would then emit a soft, warm glow. This technology could be used to create eco-friendly flashlights or even decorative lighting.",
    "**Quantum Dot Illumination**: Develop a flashlight that uses quantum dots to produce a high-intensity, directional light. Quantum dots are tiny crystals that can be excited to emit specific wavelengths of light, allowing for precise control over the color and intensity of the illumination.",
    "**Smart Lens**: Create a smart contact lens that integrates a miniature flashlight and a microcontroller. The lens could be equipped with sensors to detect ambient light levels, automatically adjusting the brightness and color temperature of the light to optimize visibility in different environments."
