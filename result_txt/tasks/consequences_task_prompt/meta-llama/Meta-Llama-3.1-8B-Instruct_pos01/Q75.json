    "**Rapid Global Ecosystem Shift**: With oceans turning into freshwater, marine life would face extinction, and the entire food chain would collapse. Freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers and lakes, would experience a massive influx of new species, leading to competition for resources and potentially disrupting the delicate balance of these ecosystems. This shift would have a profound impact on global biodiversity, with many species struggling to adapt to the new environment. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Increased Freshwater Resources**: The sudden availability of freshwater from the oceans would alleviate the global freshwater crisis, providing a significant increase in drinking water, irrigation, and industrial use. However, this would also lead to over-exploitation of the resource, potentially causing long-term environmental damage. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Rise of Coastal Cities**: As the oceans turn into freshwater, coastal cities would experience a significant influx of people seeking to capitalize on the new resource. This would lead to rapid urbanization, putting a strain on infrastructure, services, and the environment. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Freshwater Agriculture Boom**: The increased availability of freshwater would enable large-scale agriculture in coastal regions, potentially leading to a significant increase in food production. However, this would also lead to the displacement of traditional fishing communities and the destruction of coastal ecosystems. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Global Economic Disruption**: The sudden change in ocean chemistry would have a profound impact on global trade, commerce, and industry. The loss of marine resources, such as fisheries and shipping, would lead to economic instability, potentially triggering global economic crises. Confidence: 0.9"
