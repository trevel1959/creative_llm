    "Variable line thickness control: Allow users to adjust the line thickness while writing. This could be achieved through a rotary dial, a squeeze control, or an automatic setting that allows for consistent line weight through different ink cartridges.",
    "Enhanced ink flow: Implement a smoother, more consistent ink flow that allows for a continuous line without skip strokes. This could include an innovative feed system, increased nib hardness options, or an integrated ink cartridge with micro-sponge technology.",
    "Smart features: Add features that make the fountain pen more efficient and convenient. This could include Bluetooth connectivity for transferring notes to devices, automatic calibration for improved precision, or built-in sensors to indicate when the pen requires refilling, cleaning, or maintenance.",
    "Environmental sustainability: Design an eco-friendly fountain pen made from recycled materials, such as recycled e-waste or agricultural waste. This would demonstrate a commitment to reducing environmental impact and promote environmentally responsible use.",
    "Multi-functional design: Develop a versatile pen that can serve as both a fountain pen and a regular pen for different writing needs. This could involve modular design, interchangeable nibs, or a retractable tip for ballpoint or rollerball pens."
