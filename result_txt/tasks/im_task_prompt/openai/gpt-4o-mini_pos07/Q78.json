    "**Multi-Device Integration**:    Develop a universal remote that seamlessly integrates multiple devices, such as smart home appliances, gaming consoles, and media devices, into one interface. This remote would utilize a customizable touchscreen that can be configured to display controls for different devices based on context. Users could swipe between profiles for TV, gaming, or smart home controls, reducing clutter and complexity.",
    "**Haptic Feedback and Gesture Control**:    Incorporate haptic feedback technology and gesture control into the remote. Users could perform gestures in the air to navigate menus or adjust volume, and the remote would provide tactile feedback to confirm actions. This feature would make the remote more intuitive and could also be helpful for those with limited mobility.",
    "**Voice Command with Context Awareness**:    Enhance the remote with advanced voice recognition that understands context. Instead of just basic commands, it could interpret phrases like \"Play the next episode\" or \"Turn on the lights for movie time.\" This would streamline interactions and reduce the need for physical buttons, making it easier for users to control their entertainment environment.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**:    Design a remote control that incorporates solar panels on its surface for self-charging. This eco-friendly solution would eliminate the need for batteries, ensuring the remote is always ready to use. Additionally, a small LED indicator could show the charging status, and the remote could also feature a backup USB-C port for charging in low-light conditions.",
    "**Customizable Button Layouts**:    Create a remote control with a modular design where users can customize the button layout and function. Users could rearrange buttons physically or digitally through an app, allowing them to prioritize the controls they use most. This feature would cater to different user preferences and accessibility needs, making the remote more user-friendly."
