    "**Key Finder with Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Create a key that has a built-in Bluetooth tracker and is compatible with an AR app. If a user misplaces their keys, they can use their smartphone to activate the AR feature, which would overlay directional arrows on their screen to guide them to the keys’ location. This could also include a feature that allows users to make the keys emit a sound to help locate them quickly.",
    "**Multi-Functional Key with Built-in Tools**: Design a car key that includes essential tools such as a mini flashlight, a bottle opener, and a small screwdriver. This would make the key not just a means to start the car but also a handy tool for everyday situations. The flashlight could be particularly useful for finding the lock in the dark, while the other tools could assist in minor emergencies.",
    "**Personalized Key Covers with Mood Indicators**: Offer customizable key covers that change color based on the owner's mood or preferences. For instance, a key cover could have a temperature-sensitive material that changes color with body heat, or a programmable LED cover that lights up in different colors. This would not only make the key visually appealing but also serve as a fun way to express one’s mood.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring Features**: Develop a key that monitors health metrics, such as heart rate or stress levels, through a built-in sensor. The key could connect to a smartphone app to provide real-time feedback, encouraging users to take breaks or practice mindfulness while on the road. This could promote a healthier lifestyle, especially for those who spend long hours driving.",
    "**Rechargeable Key with Solar Technology**: Design a key that features a small solar panel on its surface, allowing it to recharge while exposed to sunlight. This would eliminate the need for battery replacements and ensure that the key is always functional. Users could also receive notifications on their smartphone when the key is fully charged or needs sunlight."
