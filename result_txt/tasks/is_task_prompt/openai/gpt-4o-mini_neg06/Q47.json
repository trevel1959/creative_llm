    "Once, in a vibrant forest, lived a young bird named Lila who soared high among the treetops. One day, she spotted a dazzling rainbow and, mesmerized, forgot how to flap her wings. Days turned into weeks, and Lila remained earthbound, watching her friends take flight. Determined to reclaim her joy, she began practicing, first hopping, then gliding. One sunny morning, as the rainbow reappeared, Lila took a deep breath, remembered the thrill of the wind beneath her wings, and leaped into the sky. With newfound courage, she soared higher than ever, realizing that sometimes, we must rediscover our own magic.",
