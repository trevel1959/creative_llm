    "**Smart Hanger with Built-in Lighting**: Design a clothes hanger with integrated LED lights that can be turned on and off using a simple touch sensor. The lights are activated when the hanger is hung on a piece of clothing to provide additional visibility in low-light areas such as closets or wardrobes. The hanger could also have a small power bank for charging smartphones or other small devices.",
    "**Personalized Clothing Organizer**: Create a customizable clothes hanger with slots or pockets where users can insert tags, labels, or stickers with their names, sizes, or garment types. This allows for easy organization and identification of clothes without the need for sorting through each item. The hangers could be made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic to reduce environmental impact.",
    "**Hanging Desk Organizer**: Develop a multi-functional clothes hanger that doubles as a desk organizer. The hanger can hold files, papers, or stationery items, making it perfect for home offices or dorm rooms. The design should include hooks for hanging folders, clips for attaching papers, and compartments for storing pens, pencils, and other office supplies.",
    "**Smart Hanger with Voice Assistant Integration**: Integrate a clothes hanger with a built-in speaker and microphone, allowing it to connect to a user's voice assistant (like Alexa or Google Assistant). Users can give commands to the hanger, such as adjusting lighting levels, setting reminders, or controlling smart home devices, all while organizing their clothes.",
    "**Recycling Hanger System**: Design a clothes hanger that is not only functional but also environmentally conscious. For example, the hanger could be made from biodegradable materials and have a recycling program associated with it. When customers purchase new clothes, they can return their old clothes to the store along with their used hangers. The store then collects these hangers, processes them into new hangers, and uses the materials again, reducing waste and promoting sustainability."
