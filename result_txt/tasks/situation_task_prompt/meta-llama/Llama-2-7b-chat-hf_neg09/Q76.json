    "Carrier Pigeons: With all phones stopped working, people could resort to using carrier pigeons as a means of long-distance communication. Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries as a reliable and efficient means of communication, especially during times of war or natural disasters. Trainers could be trained to send messages via pigeon, and the pigeons could be used to carry small notes or even digital messages attached to their legs.",
    "Homing Pigeon Racing: Another option for long-distance communication could be homing pigeon racing. Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home loft, but they can also be trained to carry messages. Races could be organized between different locations, with the pigeons carrying messages that are decoded upon arrival. This would not only provide a means of communication but also a fun and exciting way to connect people across distances.",
    "Semaphore Flags: Semaphore flags are a visual communication system that uses a series of flags to convey messages. This system was commonly used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for maritime communication. By using semaphore flags, messages could be sent between two locations along a coastline or along a route with a clear line of sight. This method would be particularly useful for communication between islands or coastal towns.",
    "Homemade Talking Drums: In the absence of phones, people could use homemade talking drums to communicate over long distances. Talking drums are percussion instruments that can produce a wide range of sounds and rhythms, which can be used to convey messages. By creating a system of drum beats and rhythms, people could send messages to one another across long distances. This method would require a great deal of practice and coordination, but it could be an effective way to communicate in areas where other methods are not possible.",
    "Mirror Signaling: Another option for long-distance communication could be mirror signaling. This method involves using mirrors to reflect sunlight and create signals that can be seen from a distance. By using a series of mirrors and reflective surfaces, messages could be sent across long distances using sunlight and shadows. This method would require careful planning and coordination, but it could be an effective way to communicate in areas where"
