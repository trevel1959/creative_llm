    "Once in a lush jungle, there lived a mighty tiger named Tigris. With stripes that gleamed like the sun, he was feared by all. Yet, deep inside, Tigris harbored a secret: he was terrified of mice! Every time he spotted one scurrying by, his heart raced, and he would leap onto a nearby rock, growling in panic. One day, a tiny mouse named Momo approached him, curious and unafraid. \"Why are you scared of me?\" Momo squeaked. Tigris confessed his fear, and to his surprise, Momo laughed. \"I’m just a little creature! Let’s be friends!\" From that day, Tigris learned that even the mightiest can have fears, and friendship can conquer them all.",
