    "**Eco-Friendly Tissue Box Packaging**: Develop a series of eco-friendly tissue boxes made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled paper.

This not only reduces waste but also appeals to consumers who prioritize environmental responsibility.",
    "**Personalized Tissue Box Service**: Offer a personalized service where customers can design their own tissue box by choosing colors, patterns, and even custom messages or photos. This service can be accessed online, allowing customers to customize their order according to their preferences. This personal touch can make a simple product feel unique and special.",
    "**Health and Wellness Tissue Box**: Introduce a range of tissue boxes infused with essential oils known for their therapeutic properties. For example, lavender can help promote relaxation, eucalyptus can aid in respiratory health, and peppermint can provide a refreshing scent. Each box would come with a small card detailing the benefits of the oil used, making it a thoughtful gift for friends and family.",
    "**Interactive Tissue Box Experience**: Create an interactive digital experience tied to the purchase of a tissue box. Customers could scan a QR code on the packaging to access a website or app where they can engage in activities like virtual decorating, receive tips on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, or participate in contests for a chance to win prizes. This gamification approach makes the simple act of purchasing a tissue box a more engaging and memorable experience."
