    "A \"Green\" Wedding Garden: Create a stunning garden setting for the ceremony and reception that incorporates eco-friendly elements such as recycled materials, native plants, and a rainwater harvesting system. The couple can work with a local nursery to source plants that are native to the area, reducing the carbon footprint of transportation. Additionally, the use of recycled materials such as old pallets, crates, or bottles can add a unique and creative touch to the decor.",
    "Eco-Friendly Wedding Favors: Instead of traditional favors that can end up in landfills, the couple can choose eco-friendly options such as seed bombs, tree seedlings, or even a donation in the couple's name to a local conservation organization. This not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainability and gives back to the community.",
    "Solar-Powered Lighting: Use solar-powered lights instead of traditional electric lights for the ceremony and reception. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the wedding but also provides a unique and memorable ambiance. The couple can work with a local solar panel installer to install the lights and ensure they are properly maintained.",
    "Compostable Wedding Dress: Consider a wedding dress made from compostable materials such as bamboo or organic cotton. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the wedding but also promotes sustainability and reduces waste. The couple can also incorporate a \"dress for the future\" theme, encouraging guests to donate their old wedding dresses to be repurposed into new clothing or rags.",
    "Eco-Friendly Transportation: Instead of traditional limousines or cars, the couple can choose eco-friendly transportation options such as electric or hybrid vehicles. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the wedding but also provides a unique and memorable experience for the couple and their guests. The couple can also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation to attend the wedding."
