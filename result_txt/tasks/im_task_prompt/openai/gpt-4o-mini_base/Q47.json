    "**Self-Cleaning Filter Technology**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter mechanism. This could use a series of vibrations or bursts of air to dislodge dust and debris from the filter, ensuring optimal performance without the need for frequent manual cleaning. This feature would not only extend the life of the filter but also improve suction power and reduce maintenance for the user.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize it for different cleaning tasks. For instance, a user could swap out the brush head for a specialized attachment for pet hair, hardwood floors, or upholstery. This modular approach would make the vacuum cleaner versatile and adaptable to various cleaning needs.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cleaning Guide**: Implement an AR feature through a companion app that guides users on how to clean specific areas of their home effectively. Using their smartphone or AR glasses, users could receive visual overlays that highlight areas needing attention, suggest optimal cleaning paths, and even provide tips for maintaining different surfaces.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solutions Integration**: Design a vacuum cleaner that can work in tandem with eco-friendly cleaning solutions. It could have a built-in reservoir for a biodegradable cleaning solution that gets dispensed during vacuuming, effectively cleaning surfaces while reducing the need for harsh chemicals. This feature would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Noise-Cancellation Technology**: Equip vacuum cleaners with noise-cancellation technology to significantly reduce the sound they make while in operation. By using advanced soundproofing materials and active noise control, the vacuum could operate quietly, making it more user-friendly, especially in homes with small children or pets who may be startled by loud noises."
