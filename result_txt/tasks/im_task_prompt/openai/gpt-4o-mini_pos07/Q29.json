    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Panels**: Design a lawn mower that is powered entirely by solar energy. Incorporate small solar panels on the mower’s surface to charge its battery during the day. This not only reduces reliance on fossil fuels but also minimizes noise pollution. Additionally, the mower could feature a hybrid mode that allows it to switch to electric power when needed, ensuring it has enough energy for larger lawns.",
    "**Multi-Function Lawn Mower with Attachments**: Create a modular lawn mower that allows users to swap out attachments for various gardening tasks. In addition to mowing, it could have attachments for mulching, aerating, and even a seed spreader. This versatility would make it a one-stop solution for yard maintenance, saving space and reducing the need for multiple tools.",
    "**Robotic Lawn Mower with Autonomous Charging Station**: Develop a robotic lawn mower that can autonomously return to a charging station when its battery is low. The station could also include a self-cleaning feature that removes grass clippings and debris from the mower’s blades, ensuring optimal performance. The mower could be programmed to operate at specific times, avoiding the need for manual intervention.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Noise Reduction Technology**: Introduce a lawn mower designed with advanced sound-dampening materials and technology to significantly reduce noise levels during operation. This would make mowing more pleasant for users and their neighbors, especially in residential areas. Features could include quieter blades and a specially designed motor that minimizes vibration and sound.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Built-In Compost Bin**: Innovate a lawn mower that features a built-in composting system. As it mows, the mower could collect grass clippings and other organic material in a designated compartment, which would then be processed into compost. This would encourage sustainable gardening practices and allow homeowners to create nutrient-rich compost for their gardens without additional effort."
