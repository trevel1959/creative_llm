    "Utilize Natural Resources: Create a shelter using natural materials like palm fronds, vines, and rocks. Build a hut or a lean-to shelter to protect yourself from the elements. Use coconuts for water, and hunt for fish and crabs in the nearby waters for food. Explore the island for fruits, berries, and edible plants to supplement your diet.",
    "Signal for Help: Use the resources on the island to create a makeshift flag or signal fire to alert passing ships or planes of your presence. You can also use a mirror or any shiny object to reflect sunlight towards any possible rescuers. Set up a daily routine of shouting for help or making noise to attract attention.",
    "Find a Sustainable Water Source: Locate a freshwater source like a stream, river, or a hidden underground spring. Use a container or a hollowed-out coconut to collect and store water. Set up a system to purify the water using sand, charcoal, or boiling. Create a water collection and storage system to ensure a steady supply.",
    "Build a Fishing Net: Use local materials like vines, palm fronds, and rocks to create a fishing net. Tie the net to a long stick or branch to help you reach deeper waters. Use bait like fish guts or shiny objects to lure fish into the net. Set up a system to dry and preserve the caught fish for future meals.",
    "Create a Navigation System: Use natural signs like the sun, moon, and stars to navigate the island. Create a sundial or a shadow stick to measure time. Set up a system to mark your progress and keep track of your location on the island. Use a makeshift compass using a magnetized needle or a piece of magnetic rock to orient yourself."
