    "Wheelchair with a twist: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, you could design a chair that can transform into a Segway-like vehicle. This would allow you to move around more easily and efficiently, while still maintaining your independence. The chair could have a built-in joystick or handlebars that you can use to control the movement, and it could be equipped with sensors to detect your movements and adjust its speed accordingly.",
    "Hoverchair: Imagine a chair that can hover above the ground using magnetic levitation technology. This would allow you to move around without touching the ground, making it easier to navigate through tight spaces or climb stairs. The hoverchair could be equipped with sensors and a control system that allows you to steer and stop, and it could be powered by a rechargeable battery.",
    "Exoskeleton suit: An exoskeleton suit is a wearable device that can amplify your movements and provide support for your body. By wearing an exoskeleton suit, you could move around more easily and with less effort, even if you can't stand up. The suit could be designed to support your legs, arms, and back, and it could be equipped with sensors and motors that allow you to control its movements.",
    "Glider chair: Instead of using wheels or a hover mechanism, you could design a chair that uses a system of gliders to move around. The gliders could be made of lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber or aluminum, and they could be attached to the chair using a system of pulleys and cables. By leaning forward or backward, you could control the movement of the gliders and move around with ease."
