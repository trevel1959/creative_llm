    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop an app that uses AR to project mathematical problems into the user’s environment. For example, when calculating the dimensions for a room, the calculator could overlay measurements onto the real world through a smartphone camera. Users could visualize problems in 3D, making it easier to grasp complex concepts such as geometry or spatial calculations.",
    "**Gamification of Calculations**: Introduce a gamified experience where users earn points and rewards for solving problems. Users could engage in challenges that test their speed and accuracy in calculations, with levels that increase in difficulty. This would not only make math more enjoyable but also encourage regular practice, enhancing users' mathematical skills over time.",
    "**Personalized Learning Mode**: Incorporate an adaptive learning feature that tracks user performance and tailors exercises to their specific needs. For instance, if a user struggles with fractions, the calculator could suggest targeted practice problems and provide hints or explanations, creating a customized learning experience that evolves with the user’s progress.",
    "**Multi-Function Tool with Physical Components**: Design a hybrid calculator that includes physical components like a ruler, protractor, and compass, which can be used in conjunction with the calculator for geometry and measurement tasks. This would allow users to not only calculate but also visualize and measure directly, bridging the gap between theoretical math and practical application.",
    "**Collaborative Calculation Platform**: Create a social feature where users can share problems and solutions with friends or classmates in real-time. Users could work together on challenging problems, exchange tips, or compete in friendly math challenges. This would foster a sense of community and encourage collaborative learning, making math a more social experience."
