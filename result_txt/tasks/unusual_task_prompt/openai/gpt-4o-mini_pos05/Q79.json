    "**Coaster for Hot Drinks**: Instead of using a traditional coaster, a mouse pad can serve as an effective barrier between your hot beverage and your desk. The cushioned material helps absorb heat and prevents condensation from damaging the surface beneath, all while adding a bit of personality to your workspace.",
    "**Kneeling Pad for Gardening**: If youâ€™re an avid gardener, an old mouse pad can be repurposed as a kneeling pad. The soft surface provides comfort while you work on your garden, protecting your knees from hard ground and allowing you to work for longer periods without discomfort.",
    "**Sound Dampener**: Cut up an old mouse pad and place the pieces under furniture legs to reduce noise and vibrations. This can be particularly helpful for heavy furniture like tables or chairs that tend to squeak or slide on hard floors, creating a quieter and more peaceful environment.",
    "**DIY Phone Stand**: With a little creativity, you can turn a mouse pad into a makeshift phone stand. Simply fold or cut the pad to create a triangular support that can hold your phone upright, allowing you to watch videos or video chat hands-free while you work.",
