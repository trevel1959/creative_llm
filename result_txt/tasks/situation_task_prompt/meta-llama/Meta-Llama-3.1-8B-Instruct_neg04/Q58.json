    "**Insect Farming**: Establish a network of insect farms to cultivate beneficial insects like bees, butterflies, and ladybugs. These insects can be used for pollination, pest control, and even as a food source. The farms could be designed to mimic natural habitats, ensuring the insects' well-being and maximizing their productivity.",
    "**Bioluminescent Pest Control**: Develop bioluminescent organisms that can be used to repel or attract pests. For example, genetically engineered bacteria could be used to produce a glowing substance that repels mosquitoes or other insects. This method would be non-toxic and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Robotics and AI-Powered Pest Control**: Design and deploy robots that can detect and eliminate pests using AI-powered algorithms. These robots could be equipped with sensors to identify the type of pest, its location, and its behavior, allowing for targeted and efficient pest control. They could also be programmed to learn from their experiences and adapt to new situations.",
    "**Microbial Pest Control**: Utilize beneficial microorganisms like bacteria and fungi to control pest populations. These microorganisms can be engineered to produce compounds that are toxic to pests or can outcompete them for resources. This method would be a natural and sustainable way to manage pest populations.",
    "**Insect-Resistant Crops**: Develop crops that are resistant to insect pests using genetic engineering or traditional breeding techniques. These crops would reduce the need for pesticides and minimize the impact of pests on agricultural productivity. They could also be designed to produce beneficial compounds that attract beneficial insects or repel pests."
