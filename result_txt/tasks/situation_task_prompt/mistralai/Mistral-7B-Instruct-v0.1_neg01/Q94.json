    "Create an immersive, interactive experience using virtual reality technology. Users could wear VR headsets and be transported to a virtual movie theater where they can watch movies in-style settings. This would allow for a more interactive and engaging movie-going experience.",
    "Host movie screenings in-style settings, but with a twist. Instead of traditional movie screens, use projection mapping technology to create immersive, interactive environments that respond to the action on the screen. This would allow users to feel like they are a part of the movie, rather than just watching it.",
    "Create a mobile app that allows users to watch movies on their smartphones, but also provides a virtual reality experience. Users could use their phone to watch the movie, but also use their phone's sensors to interact with the virtual environment. This would allow for a more interactive and engaging movie-going experience.",
    "Host movie screenings in pop-up locations, such as-style settings. But instead of just showing the movie on a screen, create interactive installations that allow users to explore the movie's themes and story in a more immersive way. This could include interactive exhibits, performance art, and other immersive experiences.",
    "Create a subscription service that delivers movie-themed experiences to users' homes. This could include a monthly box with movie-themed items, such as-style popcorners, as well as access to-style movies-style screenings. This would allow users to have a cinematic experience in the comfort of their own homes, but still have access to the interactive and engaging experiences that come-style theaters offer."
