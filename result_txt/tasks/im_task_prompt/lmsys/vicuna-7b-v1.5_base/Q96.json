    "Augmented Reality Overlay: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows users to overlay digital information, such as bird identification data or distance measurements, onto the live view through the binoculars. This would enhance the user's experience and make it easier to identify and track wildlife.",
    "Wireless Charging: Add wireless charging capabilities to the binoculars, allowing users to charge the device without the need for cords or batteries. This would make it more convenient for users to keep their binoculars powered up and ready to use.",
    "Waterproof and Durable: Make the binoculars waterproof and highly durable, with features like rubberized coatings and reinforced glass lenses. This would make them suitable for outdoor enthusiasts who may encounter wet or rough terrain while using the binoculars.",
    "Adjustable Eyecups: Design the binoculars with adjustable eyecups that can be easily adjusted to fit the user's interpupillary distance (IPD). This would make the binoculars more comfortable to use for a wider range of users, including those with different IPDs.",
    "Night Vision Capability: Incorporate night vision technology into the binoculars, allowing users to observe wildlife and their surroundings in low-light conditions. This would be especially useful for nighttime birdwatching or wildlife observation."
