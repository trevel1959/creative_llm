    "**Smart Lighting Adjuster**: Develop a camera accessory that automatically adjusts the lighting based on the environment. This could be a small, portable light that uses sensors to detect the ambient light conditions and adjusts its brightness and color temperature accordingly. It would ensure that subjects are well-lit regardless of the shooting conditions, enhancing the quality of photos taken in challenging light.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Zoom and Focus**: Introduce a gesture control system that allows photographers to zoom in or out and adjust focus simply by using hand movements. This would be particularly useful for wildlife or sports photographers who need to make quick adjustments without taking their eyes off the viewfinder. The camera could utilize motion sensors to interpret the gestures accurately.",
    "**Integrated Drone Photography**: Design a camera that can detach from its body and transform into a small drone for aerial photography. The drone would be equipped with the same camera sensor, allowing for seamless transitions between ground and aerial shots. Photographers could use this feature to capture unique perspectives without needing additional equipment.",
    "**Virtual Reality Viewfinder**: Create a VR-enabled viewfinder that allows photographers to visualize their shots in a 3D space before taking the photo. By wearing VR goggles, users could walk around their subject and see how different angles and perspectives would look in the final image. This would be particularly beneficial for landscape photographers who want to explore various compositions without physically moving their camera.",
    "**Multi-Sensor Integration**: Incorporate multiple sensors that capture different wavelengths of light (like infrared and ultraviolet) along with the standard RGB sensors. This would allow photographers to capture unique images that reveal aspects of the scene invisible to the naked eye. Such capabilities could be used in artistic photography, scientific research, or even environmental monitoring."
