    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and high-pressure water jets to clean the internal components of the juicer after use. This would eliminate the hassle of disassembling and scrubbing, making it much more user-friendly. The user could simply add water and a cleaning solution, press a button, and the juicer would clean itself in a few minutes.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Blending Capabilities**:    Create a juicer that also functions as a blender. This juicer could have interchangeable attachments, allowing users to switch between juicing and blending seamlessly. This way, users can create smoothies, soups, and sauces without needing multiple appliances, thus saving counter space and making it more versatile for different culinary needs.",
    "**Nutrient Preservation Technology**:    Implement a technology that preserves the nutrients in juice for a longer period. This could involve using a vacuum seal system that removes air from the juice container immediately after juicing, preventing oxidation. Additionally, a built-in cooling system could keep the juice fresh for up to 48 hours, making it ideal for meal prep enthusiasts who want to juice in advance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design with Composting Feature**:    Design a juicer that incorporates a composting feature for the leftover pulp. Users could have the option to collect the pulp in a dedicated compartment, which then can be composted directly into a small bin attached to the juicer. This would encourage sustainability and provide users with a way to reduce kitchen waste while also promoting eco-friendly practices.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**:    Equip the juicer with an interactive touchscreen interface that provides users with real-time feedback on the juicing process. The screen could display the nutritional content of the juice being made, the amount of juice extracted, and even tips on how to optimize the juicing process. Users could also customize their juicing preferences, such as pulp levels or juice thickness, through the interface."
