    "Virtual Reality: I would create a virtual reality experience that allows users to enter a movie-like world where they can interact with the characters and environment. This would provide a fully immersive experience that would transport users to a different world.",
    "Interactive Live-Action: I would create an interactive live-action experience where the audience can influence the story and characters' actions. This could be done through the use of motion capture technology, allowing the audience to physically interact with the characters and the environment.",
    "Outdoor Cinema: I would create an outdoor cinema experience that takes place in natural settings such as parks or beaches. This would provide a unique and picturesque backdrop for the movie, and would allow the audience to enjoy the film under the stars.",
    "360-Degree Filming: I would create a 360-degree filming experience that allows the audience to see the movie from all angles. This would provide a more immersive experience, as the audience would feel like they are part of the action.",
    "Pop-up Theatres: I would create a series of pop-up theatres that appear in unexpected locations such as parks, public spaces, and even on the sides of buildings. This would provide a unique and memorable experience for the audience, as they would be able to enjoy a movie in a non-traditional setting."
