    "Social Hierarchy: If everyone could choose their physical appearance, it could lead to a new form of social hierarchy based on physical attractiveness. People with certain features that are considered more attractive may be given more privileges or opportunities in life, leading to a more unequal society.",
    "Self-Expression: On the other hand, allowing people to choose their physical appearance could also be seen as a form of self-expression, allowing individuals to fully express themselves and their identities through their appearance. This could lead to a more accepting and diverse society.",
    "Genetic Engineering: If physical appearance was completely up to the individual, it could also lead to genetic engineering becoming more accessible and widespread. This could have both positive and negative implications, such as eradicating genetic diseases but also potentially leading to a new form of eugenics.",
    "Environmental Impact: The ability to choose physical appearance could also have a significant impact on the environment. If people were able to choose their appearance at will, it could lead to a significant increase in the demand for cosmetic products and procedures, which could have negative environmental consequences.",
    "Identity: Allowing people to choose their physical appearance could also have implications for identity. If people were able to completely change their appearance, it could lead to a loss of identity and a sense of self. On the other hand, it could also allow people to fully express their identity and feel more confident in their appearance."
