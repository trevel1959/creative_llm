    "**Enhanced Braille Reading Systems:** One innovative solution could be to develop more advanced Braille reading systems that utilize high-tech touch screens or tactile feedback devices. These devices can translate text into a series of vibrations or textures that can be felt by users. This would enable individuals with poor vision to read digital content and printed materials through a more intuitive and accessible method.",
    "**Audio-Visual Aids for Navigation:** For those who need assistance in navigating their environment, audio and visual cues could be used to create a more immersive experience. This might include wearable technology like smart glasses equipped with sensors that detect obstacles, changes in elevation, or even the user's surroundings. The device would provide real-time auditory guidance, such as voice commands or sound effects, to help users navigate safely.",
    "**Tactile Mapping:** Tactile maps could be created using a variety of textures, such as raised lines, bumps, and different materials, to represent terrain, buildings, and other features. These maps can be physically walked on, allowing individuals to explore and understand their surroundings through touch. Additionally, these maps could be interactive, using haptic feedback to guide users through complex environments or provide specific directions.",
    "**Enhanced Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants:** With glasses and contacts no longer available, advancements in hearing technology could become crucial. New types of hearing aids that can adjust to different light conditions and environments, as well as cochlear implants that provide enhanced auditory feedback, could significantly improve the quality of life for those with hearing impairments related to vision loss.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Training Programs:** AR applications could be developed to train individuals with poor vision in various skills, such as cooking, crafting, or performing daily tasks. These programs would overlay virtual instructions and visual aids onto the user's environment, providing step-by-step guidance and enhancing their ability to perform tasks independently. This could include virtual assistants that offer real-time advice and adjustments based on the user's actions and environment."
