    "**Cultural Dilution**: An influx of tourists can lead to the commercialization of local culture, where authentic traditions and practices are replaced by tourist-friendly versions. To combat this, the city could implement programs that promote cultural exchange, allowing tourists to engage with local artisans, chefs, and performers in a way that honors and preserves the true essence of the culture.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Increased tourism can result in environmental degradation, such as pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. To address this, the city could adopt eco-tourism initiatives, promoting sustainable practices among businesses and encouraging tourists to participate in conservation efforts, such as beach clean-ups or tree planting activities.",
    "**Housing Affordability Crisis**: As demand for short-term rentals rises, local residents may find it increasingly difficult to afford housing. This can lead to displacement and community resentment. The city could introduce regulations on short-term rentals, ensuring that a percentage of available housing remains affordable for locals, while also incentivizing developers to create more affordable housing options.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: An increase in tourists can lead to a rise in petty crime, scams, or even more serious safety issues. To mitigate these risks, the city could enhance its public safety measures by increasing police presence in tourist areas, implementing community watch programs, and providing tourists with safety resources and information upon arrival.",
    "**Overtourism**: Popular attractions may become overcrowded, diminishing the experience for both tourists and locals. To manage this, the city could introduce a reservation system for certain attractions, spreading out visitor numbers and encouraging exploration of lesser-known sites. Additionally, marketing campaigns could highlight off-peak travel times and alternative attractions."
