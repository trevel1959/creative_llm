    "Cost: Renewable energy power plants can be expensive to build and maintain, which may make them less attractive to investors and consumers.",
    "Intermittent Energy Supply: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning they are not always available when they are needed. This can make it difficult to rely on them as a primary source of energy.",
    "Infrastructure: Building a renewable energy power plant requires a lot of infrastructure, such as roads, transmission lines, and storage facilities. This can be expensive and time-consuming to build.",
    "Energy Storage: Renewable energy power plants often require energy storage solutions to store excess energy for use when it is needed. This can be expensive and may not be as efficient as other energy storage solutions.",
    "Grid Integration: Renewable energy power plants may not be able to easily integrate into existing power grids, which can make it difficult to distribute the energy to consumers."
