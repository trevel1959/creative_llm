    "**Integrated LED Light**: Design scissors with a built-in LED light that illuminates the cutting area. This feature would be particularly useful for precision cutting in low-light conditions, such as crafting or sewing projects. The light could be activated by a small switch on the handle, ensuring that users can see their work clearly without needing an additional light source.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Combine scissors with other tools to create a multi-functional device. For instance, include a small knife blade, a screwdriver, and a bottle opener in the design. This would make the scissors versatile for various tasks, appealing to crafters, campers, and DIY enthusiasts who need multiple tools in one compact device.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Innovate scissors with self-sharpening blades that use a built-in mechanism to maintain sharpness during use. This could involve a small sharpening stone or ceramic element positioned along the cutting edge that gently sharpens the blades as they are used. This feature would eliminate the need for regular sharpening, ensuring optimal performance over time.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Measurement Features**: Develop smart scissors equipped with a digital display that shows measurements and guides users for precise cutting. Users could input desired lengths or angles, and the scissors would provide visual or auditory cues to help them achieve accuracy. This would be particularly beneficial for sewing, crafting, and other projects requiring precision.",
    "**Safety Locking Mechanism**: Introduce a safety locking mechanism that allows users to lock the blades in an open or closed position easily. This feature would enhance safety, especially for households with children. The lock could be activated with a simple slide or button, providing peace of mind when storing or transporting the scissors."
