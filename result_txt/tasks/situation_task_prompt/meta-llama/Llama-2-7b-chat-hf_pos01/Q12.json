    "Geothermal Heating System: Utilize the constant temperature of the Earth's core to heat homes through a system of pipes buried underground. This would be a sustainable and renewable source of energy, as it would not require the burning of fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Solar Thermal Heating: Install solar panels on the roof to capture sunlight and heat water, which can then be used to warm homes. This system would be energy-efficient and reduce reliance on non-renewable fuels. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Biomass Heating: Utilize organic materials such as wood chips, agricultural waste, or even food waste to create a sustainable heating source. This system would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide an alternative to fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Install hydrogen fuel cells in the home to generate electricity and heat, which would produce only water vapor and heat as emissions. This system would be a clean and efficient alternative to traditional heating sources. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Passive Solar Design: Design homes with large south-facing windows and strategically placed insulation to maximize heat retention during the day and minimize heat loss at night. This system would rely on natural sunlight and temperature fluctuations to heat the home, reducing the need for any external heating sources. Confidence Score: 0.7"
