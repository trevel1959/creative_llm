    "**Biodegradable Water Bottle**:    - **Idea**: Design a water bottle made from biodegradable materials like plant-based plastics or corn starch. This would reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste. The design could also include a feature where users can add plants directly into the bottle, which would help in air purification when carried around.",
    "**Personalized Water Bottle System**:    - **Idea**: Create a customizable water bottle system where users can choose various parts of their bottles, such as color, size, material, and even add their own logos or messages. This could be done through an online platform where they select their preferences and receive a personalized bottle. This not only encourages individual expression but also promotes reusability over single-use bottles.",
    "**Water Filtration Cap for Bottles**:    - **Idea**: Develop a cap that integrates advanced filtration technology into a standard water bottle. This could filter out harmful chemicals, bacteria, and other impurities from tap water, making it safe to drink anywhere. It might include a small UV light to kill bacteria, or a ceramic filter to remove contaminants.",
    "**Eco-friendly Insulated Water Bottle**:    - **Idea**: Design an insulated water bottle made from sustainable materials like bamboo or cork, which are both renewable and eco-friendly. The insulation could be made from natural fibers like hemp or recycled materials, keeping drinks cold or hot for longer periods. The bottle could also come with a companion app that tracks hydration levels and suggests water intake based on physical activity.",
    "**Water Bottle as a Community Tool**:    - **Idea**: Create a series of water bottles that serve dual purposes. For example, a bottle could have a compartment that allows users to carry a small amount of seeds or plants. When the water in the bottle is finished, it can be used to water these plants, promoting sustainability at a personal and community level. Additionally, the bottle could include QR codes linking to educational content about water conservation, recycling, and environmental issues."
