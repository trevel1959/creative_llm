    "**Hot Stone Cooking**: I would gather smooth, flat stones and heat them over an open flame (using gathered wood and kindling). Once the stones are hot enough, I could place them on a bed of green leaves to create a makeshift cooking surface. I could then place food items, such as fish wrapped in leaves or thinly sliced vegetables, directly on the stones to cook. The heat from the stones would transfer to the food, allowing it to steam and cook thoroughly.",
    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: I would create a simple fire pit by digging a shallow hole and surrounding it with stones to contain the fire. Once the fire is burning, I could use skewers made from sturdy sticks to grill vegetables, fruits, or small pieces of meat over the open flames. Additionally, I could wrap food in large leaves and place them in the hot coals to bake, utilizing the heat for a delicious smoky flavor.",
    "**Clay Pot Cooking**: If I could find clay, I would mold it into pots and then bake them in a fire to harden. Once dried, these clay pots could be used to cook stews or soups. I would fill the pot with ingredients like grains, beans, and vegetables, add water, and bury it in the hot embers of the fire, allowing the heat to slowly cook the food while infusing it with earthy flavors.",
    "**Natureâ€™s Grill**: I would create a grill using a large, flat piece of wood or a natural plank and elevate it above a fire using sturdy sticks. This would serve as a grilling surface where I could place sliced vegetables, fruits, or fish directly on the wood. The heat from the flames would char the food, creating a deliciously smoky taste while allowing for a rustic cooking experience.",
    "**Foraging and Raw Meal Preparation**: In the absence of cooking equipment, I would focus on foraging for edible plants, fruits, nuts, and seeds. I could prepare a raw meal by creating a vibrant salad using wild greens, berries, and nuts, adding herbs for flavor. Additionally, I could make a nut butter by grinding nuts between two flat stones to create a spread for raw fruits or vegetables."
