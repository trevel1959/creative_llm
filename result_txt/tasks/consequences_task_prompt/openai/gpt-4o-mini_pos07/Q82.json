    "**Overpopulation and Resource Management**: A significant increase in the population could occur if people no longer age and die. This would put immense pressure on resources such as food, water, and energy. Governments and organizations would need to devise innovative solutions for sustainable living, potentially leading to advancements in agriculture, renewable energy, and urban planning. New societal structures may emerge to manage these resources effectively, sparking debates about ethics, governance, and environmental responsibility.",

Additionally, the insurance industry would need to adapt, as life insurance models would change significantly.",
    "**Cultural and Philosophical Implications**: The philosophical understanding of life, death, and purpose would undergo profound changes. Questions about the meaning of life, legacy, and mortality would take on new dimensions. Literature, art, and culture would likely reflect this shift, exploring themes of eternal youth and the psychological implications of living indefinitely. New belief systems or spiritual movements might arise, addressing the moral and ethical considerations of immortality.",

Relationships could become more complex, with longer partnerships and potential challenges in navigating love and companionship over centuries.",
    "**Innovation and Creativity Boom**: With the potential to live indefinitely, individuals might feel less pressure to rush their creative pursuits. This could lead to a renaissance of innovation and creativity, as people take the time to explore their passions and develop their skills without the constraints of aging. We could witness breakthroughs in arts, sciences, and technology as a result of a more extensive and diverse pool of experienced minds contributing to society over longer periods."
