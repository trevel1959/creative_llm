    "Individual Composting: In the absence of trash cans, individuals could adopt a composting system in their homes or gardens. This would involve separating organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, and allowing it to decompose naturally into a nutrient-rich soil amendment. By composting at home, people could reduce their reliance on municipal waste management services and create a valuable resource for their gardens or communities.",
    "Waste-to-Energy: With the absence of trash cans, communities could adopt waste-to-energy technologies to convert non-organic waste into usable energy. This could involve using anaerobic digesters to produce biogas, which could be used to power homes, businesses, or even transportation. The remaining waste could be converted into briquettes or pellets for use as fuel in boilers or furnaces.",
    "Waste Reduction Initiatives: In the absence of trash cans, individuals and communities could focus on reducing waste generation in the first place. This could involve implementing waste reduction strategies such as buying products with minimal packaging, avoiding single-use items, and choosing products made from sustainable materials. By reducing waste at the source, communities could significantly reduce the amount of waste that needs to be managed.",
    "Community-Led Recycling: Without trash cans, communities could come together to establish community-led recycling programs. This could involve setting up recycling centers where residents can drop off their recyclables, and organizing community events to promote recycling and educate residents about the importance of proper waste management. By involving the community in the recycling process, people could take greater ownership of their waste management and feel more invested in making a positive impact.",
    "Mobile Waste Collection: In the absence of trash cans, mobile waste collection units could be introduced to collect waste from residents. These units could be equipped with specialized containers for different types of waste, such as organic waste, recyclables, and non-recyclables. By providing a convenient and efficient way to dispose of waste, mobile collection units could help reduce the amount of waste that is illegally dumped or goes uncollected."
