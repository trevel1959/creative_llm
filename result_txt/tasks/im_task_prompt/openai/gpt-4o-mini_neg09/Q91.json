    "**QR Code Luggage Tag**: Create a luggage tag that includes a unique QR code that links to a digital profile for the bag. This profile could include information about the owner, travel itinerary, and contact details. If the luggage is lost, airport staff or other travelers can scan the code to access the owner's information and facilitate its return. The tag could also include a secure way for the owner to update their information remotely.",
    "**Personalized Design and Color Coding**: Offer customizable luggage tags that allow travelers to choose colors, designs, and even add personal photos or graphics. This would not only help in identifying bags easily but also add a personal touch. A color-coding system could be introduced for frequent travelers, where each color represents a different destination or type of trip (business, leisure, etc.).",
    "**Integrated RFID Chip**: Equip luggage tags with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) chips that allow for seamless check-ins at airports. When placed near an RFID reader, the chip could automatically provide information about the bag, such as its owner and destination, reducing wait times and improving efficiency during the check-in process.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop luggage tags made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable options. This would appeal to environmentally conscious travelers and promote sustainability in travel. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds could be donated to environmental causes, creating a sense of purpose in purchasing.",
    "**Emergency Contact Feature**: Design a luggage tag that includes a small, discreet compartment for emergency contact information. In case of an accident or emergency, this information would be easily accessible. The tag could also include a QR code that links to a digital emergency profile, providing medical information and contacts in case of an emergency."
