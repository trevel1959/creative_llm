    "**Foldable and Stackable Design**: Create a laundry basket that can easily fold down flat when not in use, allowing for efficient storage. Additionally, design it to be stackable with other baskets of the same type, so users can save space in small apartments or laundry rooms. This would also be ideal for families, as multiple baskets can be stacked for organization.",
    "**Built-in Odor Neutralizer**: Incorporate an odor-neutralizing technology, such as activated charcoal or a specialized filter, within the fabric of the laundry basket. This feature would help to keep dirty clothes smelling fresh, preventing the accumulation of unpleasant odors in the basket and the surrounding area.",
    "**Self-Dispensing Laundry Detergent**: Design a laundry basket with a built-in compartment for laundry detergent that dispenses the right amount automatically when the clothes are loaded into the washing machine. This would ensure that users never have to worry about measuring detergent again and would help reduce waste by preventing overuse.",
    "**Color-Changing Fabric**: Use a color-changing material for the laundry basket that reacts to the heat or humidity of the clothes inside. For instance, the basket could change color when itâ€™s time to wash the clothes, providing a visual cue to remind users. This feature could also indicate if the clothes are too dirty to be left in the basket for too long.",
    "**Integrated Weight Scale**: Incorporate a weight scale into the base of the laundry basket that measures the total weight of the laundry. This feature could help users gauge how much laundry they have and alert them when they are approaching the maximum load for their washing machine. An app could provide tips on how to balance loads for optimal washing."
