    "Inequality: A universal basic income may exacerbate existing income inequality if it is not designed and implemented in a way that takes into account the needs of different income groups. This could be addressed by implementing targeted measures such as means-testing or adjusting the amount of the basic income based on income level.",
    "Work Disincentives: A universal basic income may discourage people from working if the amount provided is not sufficient to meet their basic needs. This could be addressed by ensuring that the basic income is sufficient to cover the cost of living and providing incentives for work, such as earned income tax credits.",
    "Administrative Costs: Implementing a universal basic income would require significant administrative costs, including the development of new systems for distributing payments and monitoring compliance.",
    "Political Opposition: There may be political opposition to implementing a universal basic income, particularly from those who argue that it would be too expensive or lead to inflation.",
    "Limited Funding: Implementing a universal basic income may require significant funding, which may not be available or may be limited in scope. This could be addressed by exploring alternative funding sources, such as private donations or crowdfunding."
