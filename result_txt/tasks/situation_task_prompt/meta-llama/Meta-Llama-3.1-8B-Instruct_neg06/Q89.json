    "**Eco-Friendly Bioplastics**: Develop bioplastics that are biodegradable and non-toxic, derived from renewable resources such as corn starch, sugarcane, or potato starch. These bioplastics can be used for packaging, disposable cutlery, and other single-use items. ",
    "**Seaweed-Based Materials**: Utilize seaweed as a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics. Seaweed can be harvested, processed, and molded into various shapes and forms, creating a versatile material for packaging, textiles, and even construction materials. ",
    "**Mushroom-Based Materials**: Explore the use of mycelium (mushroom roots) to create sustainable materials. Mycelium can be grown into various shapes and forms, producing a lightweight, durable, and compostable material for packaging, insulation, and even building materials. ",
    "**Algae-Based Plastics**: Develop plastics made from algae, which can be sourced from wastewater or algae farms. Algae-based plastics are biodegradable, non-toxic, and can be used for packaging, cosmetics, and even medical applications. ",
    "**Fungi-Based Composites**: Combine fungi with other natural materials like wood, straw, or cotton to create strong, durable, and sustainable composites. These composites can be used for building insulation, packaging, and even fashion items. "
