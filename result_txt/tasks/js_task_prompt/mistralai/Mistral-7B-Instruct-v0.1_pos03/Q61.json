    "A \"Soundwave Symphony\" - An instrument that creates music by generating and manipulating soundwaves in the air. The user can control the frequency, amplitude, and direction of the soundwaves to create a wide range of sounds and tones. The instrument could be played by moving the user's hands in the air, or by usingatic gloves that translate hand gestures into soundwave manipulation.",
    "\"Synth-Wave\" - An instrument that uses synth waves to create unique and otherworldly sounds. The user can control the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the synth waves to create a wide range of sounds, from ethereal to industrial. The instrument could be played by manipulatingatic gloves that translate hand gestures into synth wave manipulation.",
    "\"Rhythmic Rain\" - An instrument that creates music by manipulating raindrops. The user can control the frequency, amplitude, and direction of the raindrops to create a wide range of sounds and rhythms. The instrument could be played by manipulatingatic gloves that translate hand gestures into raindrop manipulation.",
    "\"Harmonic Haze\" - An instrument that creates music by manipulatingatic haze. The user can control the frequency, amplitude, and direction of the haze to create a wide range of sounds and tones. The instrument could be played by manipulatingaticatic gloves that translate hand gestures into haze manipulation.",
    "\"Resonance Reverb\" - An instrument that creates music by manipulating resonance and reverb. The user can control the frequency, amplitude, and direction of the resonance and reverb to create a wide range of sounds and tones.
