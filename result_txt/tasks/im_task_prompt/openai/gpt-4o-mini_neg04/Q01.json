    "**Modular Design**: Create a wristwatch with interchangeable modules for different functionalities. Users could swap out modules for GPS tracking, additional battery life, or even a mini-projector for displaying notifications on any surface. This allows for customization based on the user's needs, making the watch versatile and adaptable.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a wristwatch using sustainable materials such as recycled metals, biodegradable plastics, and organic leather alternatives. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in fashion and technology.",
    "**Gesture Control Interface**: Implement a gesture control feature that allows users to navigate through functions without touching the screen. For example, users could wave their hand to scroll through notifications or shake their wrist to answer calls, enhancing convenience and hygiene.",
    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR)**: Equip the wristwatch with AR capabilities that can project useful information onto the user’s field of vision. For instance, while navigating, the watch could display directional arrows on the road or overlay notifications in real-time, merging digital information with the physical world.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Enhance the wristwatch with a built-in AI assistant that learns the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could manage schedules, suggest optimal workout times, remind users of important tasks, and even offer motivational quotes based on the user’s mood."
