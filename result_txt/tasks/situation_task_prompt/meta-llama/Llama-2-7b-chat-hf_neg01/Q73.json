    "Shade-Seeking Umbrellas: Design a collapsible umbrella with a built-in solar panel that can harness energy during the day and use it to power a built-in fan. When the umbrella is opened, the fan would provide a cooling breeze, offering a convenient and eco-friendly solution for finding shade on a hot day.",
    "Cloud-Mimicking Fabric: Develop a lightweight, breathable fabric that mimics the properties of clouds. This fabric would be able to reflect sunlight and absorb heat, providing natural shade without the need for any additional infrastructure. It could be used for clothing, tents, or even entire buildings, making it a versatile solution for hot weather protection.",
    "Urban Tree-Inspired Architecture: Draw inspiration from the structure of trees and design buildings that can provide natural shade. For example, a building with a series of interconnected columns and beams could mimic the structure of a tree's trunk and branches, providing a natural canopy for occupants. This approach could also incorporate green roofs and walls to further enhance energy efficiency and provide additional shade.",
    "Solar-Powered Parasols: Create a parasol with a built-in solar panel that can charge a battery during the day. When the battery is fully charged, the parasol can be opened to provide a canopy of shade. As an added feature, the parasol could have a built-in fan that uses the stored energy to circulate air and provide a cooling breeze."
