    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Design a wheelchair with an advanced adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts to different terrains. This would involve sensors that detect surface conditions (like bumps, gravel, or stairs) and adjust the wheel suspension accordingly, providing a smoother ride and enhancing user comfort and stability.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular wheelchair that allows users to easily swap out components based on their needs. For example, users could change the seat for additional comfort, switch wheels for different terrains, or add accessories like a storage compartment or a tray. This would allow for a personalized experience and better accommodate individual preferences.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Equip wheelchairs with a built-in health monitoring system that tracks vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be displayed on a screen or sent to a connected app for caregivers or medical professionals. Alerts could be triggered for any abnormalities, promoting proactive health management.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Source**: Develop a wheelchair that uses solar panels or kinetic energy to charge its battery. Solar panels could be integrated into the frame or seat, while kinetic energy could be harnessed from the userâ€™s movements (like pushing the wheels). This would reduce reliance on traditional charging methods and promote sustainability.",
    "**Enhanced Safety Features**: Implement safety features such as automatic braking systems that engage when the wheelchair detects a steep incline or potential collisions. Additionally, add reflective materials or lights for better visibility at night, as well as a panic button that alerts emergency services if the user is in distress."
