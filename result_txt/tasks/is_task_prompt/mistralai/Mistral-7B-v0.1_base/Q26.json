    "It was the wind that whispered of a forgotten memory, a moment that we could no longer to in the present. It was the wind that reminded us of a time when we were free from the burden of the past, a time when the only thing that mattered was the present.",
    "It was the wind that whispered of a lost love, a love that had passed us by in a moment of time. It was the wind that reminded us of a time when we didnd have the ability to clen the wind and let it go.",
    "It was the wind that whispered of a lost home, a home that we had left behind in a time of our own making. It was the wind that reminded us of a time when we had the capacity to forgive, even if it meant forgetting.",
    "It was the wind that whispered of a lost hope, a hope that had been left behind in a moment of our own making. It was the wind that reminded us of a time when we had the capacity to believe, even if it meant forgetting.",
    "It was the wind that whispered of a lost future, a future that had been left behind in a moment of our own making. It was the wind that reminded us of a time when we had the capacity to fear, even if it meant forgetting."
