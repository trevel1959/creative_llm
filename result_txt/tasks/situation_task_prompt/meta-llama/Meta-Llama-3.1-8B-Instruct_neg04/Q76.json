    "**Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) Alternative**: Utilize a combination of radio broadcasting, ham radios, and social media to disseminate critical information. For instance, governments could establish a dedicated EBS channel for emergency announcements, while also leveraging social media platforms to reach a broader audience. Ham radios could serve as a backup for those without access to the internet or traditional broadcasting.",
    "**Community-Based Signaling Systems**: Implement a network of community-based signaling systems, such as mirror signals, smoke signals, or even a system of colored flags. This would allow people to communicate over short to medium distances, and could be particularly effective in areas with limited access to technology.",
    "**Morse Code Revival**: Revive the use of Morse code as a means of long-distance communication. With the help of radio operators, people could use Morse code to transmit messages over vast distances. This would require a network of trained operators and a system for decoding messages, but could be an effective means of communication in a world without phones.",
    "**Physical Letter Carriers**: Establish a network of physical letter carriers who would travel between communities, carrying handwritten messages and updates. This would be a slow but reliable method of communication, and could be particularly effective for conveying important information over long distances.",
    "**Drone-Based Messaging**: Utilize drones equipped with small messaging devices or even simple cameras to transmit images and messages over long distances. This could be particularly effective in areas with limited access to traditional communication methods, and could be used to convey critical information in emergency situations."
