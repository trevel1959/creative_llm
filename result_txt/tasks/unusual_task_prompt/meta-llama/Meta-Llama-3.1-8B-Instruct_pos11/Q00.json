The gallery would also feature a \"memory lane\" where visitors can record and share their own memories, creating a collective and ever-evolving art piece.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Floating City**: Design a sustainable floating city that can accommodate a population of 50,000 people. The city would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and would feature cutting-edge green technologies, like vertical farming and advanced water management systems. The city would also include a \"waste-to-resource\" system, where waste is converted into energy and nutrients for the city's inhabitants.",

Guests could explore the surrounding marine life, interact with marine biologists, and enjoy fine dining with a focus on sustainable seafood. The hotel would also feature a \"dive-in\" cinema, where guests could watch movies while surrounded by the sights and sounds of the ocean.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Develop an AI assistant that learns and adapts to an individual's habits, preferences, and goals. The AI would use machine learning algorithms to anticipate and respond to the user's needs, providing personalized recommendations and suggestions. The AI would also have a \"mood-tracking\" feature, allowing it to detect and respond to the user's emotional state. The AI would be integrated into a variety of devices, including smartphones, smart home systems, and wearables.
