    "**The Global \"Thank You\" Rule**: Establish a worldwide norm where every person must express gratitude to someone they appreciate or have helped them in the past. This could be a daily ritual, such as writing a thank-you note or saying a kind word to someone. The goal is to foster a culture of appreciation and empathy, encouraging people to acknowledge the positive impact others have had on their lives. By doing so, it would create a ripple effect of kindness and strengthen social bonds.",
    "**The Environmental Sustainability Standard**: Introduce a universal standard for sustainable living, requiring every individual to contribute to reducing waste, conserving resources, and promoting eco-friendly practices. This could involve implementing a global recycling system, encouraging the use of renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices. By working together, we could mitigate the effects of climate change and preserve the planet for future generations.",
    "**The Universal Language of Music**: Establish a global language of music, where every person can understand and communicate through melodies, rhythms, and harmonies. This would break down cultural and linguistic barriers, allowing people to connect and express themselves in a universal language. Music has the power to evoke emotions and bring people together, making it an ideal tool for fostering global understanding and cooperation.",
    "**The Time-Traveling Mentorship Program**: Create a program that allows individuals to travel through time and meet their past or future selves. This would provide a unique opportunity for people to learn from their experiences, gain valuable insights, and make informed decisions about their lives. By doing so, it would empower individuals to take control of their destinies and make positive changes in their lives.",
    "**The Global \"Pay-It-Forward\" Economy**: Introduce a worldwide economy where every transaction involves a \"pay-it-forward\" component. For every purchase or service rendered, a portion of the value would be allocated to a community fund or a charitable cause. This would create a culture of generosity and reciprocity, encouraging people to contribute to the greater good while also benefiting from the kindness of others. By doing so, it would promote a sense of community and social responsibility. [/INST] "
