    "Invent a new beach activity: If all sand disappeared, we could invent new beach activities to enjoy. For example, we could create a water park with wave pools, water slides, and other water features. This would allow us to still enjoy the beach and have fun in the water.",
    "Build a beach house: If all sand disappeared, we could build a beach house to enjoy the view. This could be a small cabin or a large mansion, depending on our budget and preferences. We could also add a pool or hot tub to the backyard to enjoy the water.",
    "Take a beach walk: If all sand disappeared, we could still enjoy the beach by taking a walk along the shore. This would allow us to appreciate the beauty of the ocean and the beach surroundings.",
    "Visit a different beach: If all sand disappeared, we could visit a different beach that has different features. For example, we could visit a beach with rock formations or a beach with a boardwalk.",
    "Go on a beach vacation: If all sand disappeared, we could still enjoy the beach by going on a beach vacation. We could visit a different country or state that has a beautiful beach. This would allow us to explore new places and cultures while still enjoying the beach."
