    "Use a sundial: A sundial is a device that uses the shadow cast by a central object, usually a vertical stick or post, to indicate the time of day. If all clocks and watches disappeared, a sundial could be a useful alternative for telling time.",
    "Use the natural cycles of the body: The human body has its own internal clock, which is regulated by the circadian rhythm. By paying attention to your own body's natural cycles, such as feeling hungry or tired, you could estimate the time of day.",
    "Use the sound of nature: Many animals have their own internal clocks that regulate their behavior, such as the calls of birds or the chirping of crickets. By listening to the sounds of nature, you could estimate the time of day.",
    "Use the position of the moon: The position of the moon in the sky can be used to estimate the time of day. By observing the moon's position relative to the stars or the sun, you could estimate the time of day with reasonable accuracy.",
    "Use the position of the shadows: If all clocks and watches disappeared, you could use the position of shadows cast by objects to estimate the time of day. By observing the angle at which shadows are cast, you could estimate the time of day with reasonable accuracy."
