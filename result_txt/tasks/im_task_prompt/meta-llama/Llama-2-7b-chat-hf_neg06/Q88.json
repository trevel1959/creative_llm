    "Smart Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with built-in sensors and GPS technology to track speed, distance, and altitude. These poles could also include a heart rate monitor, temperature gauge, and UV exposure sensor for a more comprehensive skiing experience. The data collected could be synced to a smartphone app for post-ski analysis and comparison with other skiers.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Ski Poles: Create ski poles with a glow-in-the-dark coating, making them easier to spot in low-light conditions. This feature would be particularly useful for early morning or late evening skiers when visibility is limited. The glowing effect could be achieved through the use of phosphorescent materials or LED lights.",
    "Personalized Ski Poles: Design ski poles with interchangeable grips and basket attachments, allowing skiers to customize their poles to suit their preferred skiing style. For example, a skier who prefers a more aggressive stance could use a larger grip and longer basket, while a more conservative skier could opt for a smaller grip and shorter basket. This customization feature would cater to individual preferences and enhance overall skiing performance.",
    "Snow-Sensing Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with sensors that detect snow conditions, such as hardness, moisture content, and temperature. These sensors could provide real-time feedback to skiers, helping them adjust their technique and improve their skiing experience. For instance, if the sensors detect hard snow, the poles could vibrate to alert the skier to use more force, while soft snow would trigger a softer vibration to encourage a more gentle touch.",
    "Heated Ski Poles: Create ski poles with built-in heating elements, such as carbon fiber or thermoelectric materials, to keep hands warm during long skiing sessions. The heating elements could be powered by rechargeable batteries or even harnessed energy from the skier's movement, making them more eco-friendly and convenient. This feature would be particularly appealing for skiers in colder climates or at high altitudes where temperatures drop quickly."
