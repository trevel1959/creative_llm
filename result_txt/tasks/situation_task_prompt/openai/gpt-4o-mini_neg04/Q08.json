    "**Mobile Water Purification Units**: Create mobile purification units that can be deployed to communities in need. These units would utilize a combination of reverse osmosis, UV light, and activated carbon filters to clean contaminated water. They could be powered by solar panels and equipped with a user-friendly interface, allowing locals to purify their water on-site without requiring extensive technical knowledge.",
    "**Desalination and Rainwater Harvesting Hybrid**: Implement a hybrid system that combines desalination of seawater with rainwater harvesting. In coastal areas, rainwater can be collected and stored in large cisterns, while desalination plants could convert seawater into potable water. This dual approach would provide a more resilient water supply, especially during droughts or periods of low rainfall.",
    "**Biomimetic Water Filtration**: Research and develop filtration systems inspired by natural processes, such as how certain plants and animals filter water. For example, creating filters based on the structure of lotus leaves or certain types of algae could enhance filtration efficiency and remove pollutants effectively. These systems could be scalable, from small household units to larger community-based solutions.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification Pods**: Design portable, solar-powered purification pods that individuals or families can use. These pods would use solar energy to heat water, killing pathogens and breaking down contaminants. The design could incorporate a compact, foldable structure, making it easy to transport and set up in remote areas. Users could fill the pod with contaminated water, and within a few hours, they would have clean drinking water.",
    "**Community Water Gardens**: Establish community water gardens that utilize phytoremediationâ€”using plants to absorb and break down pollutants in water. These gardens would be designed to filter and clean water through natural processes. Community members could participate in maintaining the gardens, which would not only provide clean water but also serve as a green space for relaxation and education about sustainability."
