    "**Stapler-Shaped 3D Printer**: Design a stapler that doubles as a 3D printer. The stapler's body would be a 3D printing chamber, allowing users to print small objects while stapling documents. The printer would be connected to a small computer or smartphone, enabling users to design and print objects on the go. This innovative stapler would appeal to both office workers and makers, offering a unique blend of functionality and creativity.",
    "**Smart Stapler with AI-powered Stapling**: Develop a stapler that uses AI to optimize stapling performance. The stapler would be equipped with sensors that detect the thickness and type of paper, automatically adjusting the stapling pressure and speed for the best results. The AI would also learn the user's stapling habits and preferences, adapting to their needs over time. This intelligent stapler would revolutionize the way people staple documents, making it faster, more efficient, and accurate.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Biodegradable Staples**: Design a stapler that uses biodegradable staples made from plant-based materials. The stapler would be made from recycled plastic or sustainable materials, reducing waste and minimizing its environmental impact. This eco-friendly stapler would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, offering a guilt-free stapling experience.",
    "**Stapler with Integrated Document Scanning**: Create a stapler that includes a built-in document scanner, allowing users to scan and digitize their documents while stapling. The scanner would be connected to a smartphone or computer, enabling users to access and share their documents digitally. This stapler would streamline office workflows, saving time and increasing productivity.",
    "**Stapler with Haptic Feedback and Tactile Interface**: Design a stapler that provides haptic feedback and a tactile interface, allowing users to feel the stapling process. The stapler would be equipped with vibrating motors and textured surfaces, providing a sensory experience that enhances the stapling experience. This innovative stapler would appeal to users who value tactile feedback and sensory engagement."
