    "Cultivate Urban Forests: One solution is to cultivate urban forests in cities. Urban forests are small-scale forests that can be planted in urban areas, such as rooftops, walls, and streets. Urban forests can help to reduce air pollution, mitigate urban heat island effects, and provide shade and cooling. Urban forests can also provide natural resources such as timber, fruits, and nuts.",
    "Implement Sustainable Agriculture: Another solution is to implement sustainable agriculture practices. Sustainable agriculture focuses on producing food in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way. This can involve practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, and conservation tillage. Sustainable agriculture can help to maintain soil health, reduce erosion, and provide natural resources such as timber, fruits, and nuts.",
    "Develop Aquaculture: Aquaculture is the practice of raising fish and other aquatic organisms in controlled environments. Aquaculture can help to provide natural resources such as fish, seaweed, and shellfish. Aquaculture can also help to reduce the environmental impact of traditional fishing practices.",
