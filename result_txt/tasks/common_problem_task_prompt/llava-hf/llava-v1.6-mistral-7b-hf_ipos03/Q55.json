    "**Funding Challenges**: Establishing a nature conservation park can be expensive, and securing adequate funding for ongoing maintenance and conservation efforts can be a challenge. This might limit the park's ability to effectively protect the environment and support the local ecosystem.",
    "**Public Education and Awareness**: A nature conservation park may not be able to attract visitors unless there is sufficient public awareness and education about the park and its importance. This could lead to low visitor numbers, making it difficult for the park to generate revenue to sustain itself.",
    "**Conservation Conflicts**: There may be conflicts between the park's conservation goals and the needs of local communities, such as land use conflicts or conflicts over access to resources like water.",
    "**Climate Change**: The changing climate can lead to changes in the local ecosystem, making it difficult to maintain the park's natural environment. This could result in the loss of plant and animal species, and affect the park's ability to serve as a conservation area.",
    "**Economic Impact**: The establishment of a nature conservation park could lead to economic benefits for the local community, such as increased tourism and job creation. However, this could also lead to negative impacts, such as increased pressure on local resources and the potential for over-commercialization."
