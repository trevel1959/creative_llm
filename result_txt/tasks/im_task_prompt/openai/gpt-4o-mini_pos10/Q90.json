    "**Adjustable Neck Tension Mechanism**: Introduce a guitar with an adjustable neck tension system that allows players to modify the neck's curvature (relief) easily. This feature would enable musicians to optimize the action and playability based on their preferences and playing style, helping to reduce fret buzz and improve comfort during play.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Construction**: Design a guitar made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or reclaimed wood. This guitar would not only sound great but also appeal to environmentally conscious musicians. Additionally, using biodegradable finishes would further enhance its eco-friendliness.",
    "**Wireless Soundboard Technology**: Create a guitar that incorporates wireless soundboard technology, allowing it to transmit sound directly to headphones or an amplifier without the need for traditional pickups. This would reduce feedback issues in live settings and give players more freedom to experiment with sound without being tethered to cables.",
    "**Customizable LED Fretboard**: Integrate a customizable LED system into the fretboard that can light up to indicate chord shapes, scales, or notes. Players could program the LEDs for different songs or learning exercises, making it easier for beginners to visualize their finger placements and for advanced players to explore complex solos.",
    "**Multi-Function Bridge System**: Develop a bridge that allows for multiple tuning options and string configurations. This could include a quick-change mechanism for swapping between standard, open, and alternate tunings with a simple lever. Additionally, the bridge could house a built-in capo function, allowing for seamless transitions during performances."
