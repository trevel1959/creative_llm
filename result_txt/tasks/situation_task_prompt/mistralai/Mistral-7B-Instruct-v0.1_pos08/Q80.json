    "Use alternative forms of exchange: There are many alternative forms of exchange that could be used in the absence of paper money and coins. For example, people could use coupons, loyalty points, or bartering vouchers to make purchases. This would require the development of new systems for exchange and the adoption of these systems by businesses and consumers."
