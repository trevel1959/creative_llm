    "In a lush jungle, there lived a fierce tiger named Tigris, known for his powerful roar and majestic stripes. But Tigris harbored a secret: he was terrified of mice. Every time he spotted one scurrying through the grass, he would leap into the nearest tree, trembling. One day, a wise old mouse named Minu approached him. “Why fear the smallest creature?” she asked. Tigris pondered and realized that true courage isn't about size. From that day on, Tigris befriended Minu and learned to embrace his fears, proving that even the mightiest can find strength in vulnerability. ",
