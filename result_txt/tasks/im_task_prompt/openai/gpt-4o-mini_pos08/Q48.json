    "**Adaptive Key Sensitivity**:    - Design a piano with adjustable key sensitivity that can be modified depending on the playerâ€™s preference or skill level. For beginners, the keys could be set to require less pressure, making it easier to produce sound. For advanced players, the sensitivity could be increased to allow for nuanced dynamics. This feature could be controlled via a mobile app, allowing players to customize their experience based on their practice needs.",
    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR) Display**:    - Create a piano that includes an AR display on the music stand. This display could project sheet music, tutorials, and visual aids directly onto the sheet music. Players could see finger placements, dynamic markings, and even animations that demonstrate how to play specific passages. This immersive experience could help players learn more effectively and enjoyably.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**:    - Develop a line of pianos made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled wood. These pianos could feature a modular design that allows for easy repairs and upgrades, extending the lifespan of the instrument. The eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious musicians and promote sustainability in the music industry.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Built-In Recording Studio**:    - Innovate a piano that doubles as a recording studio. With built-in microphones and sound editing software, musicians could record their practice sessions, compositions, or performances directly from the piano. This would eliminate the need for additional recording equipment, making it easier for musicians to capture their work and share it online.",
    "**Portable and Foldable Design**:    - Create a portable, foldable piano that retains the full 88-key experience but can be easily transported. This design could use lightweight materials and a collapsible structure, making it ideal for traveling musicians or those with limited space. The piano could also feature Bluetooth connectivity, allowing it to connect to devices for additional sound options and apps."
