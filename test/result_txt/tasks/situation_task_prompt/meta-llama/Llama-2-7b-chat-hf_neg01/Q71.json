    "Use a drone to aerate the soil: In this scenario, the ground has become too hard to dig into, but that doesn't mean you can't plant a garden. Utilize a drone to aerate the soil by creating small holes and tunnels in the ground. This will help to loosen the soil and create a better environment for planting. The drone can be equipped with a specialized tool that breaks up the soil and mixes it with organic matter, creating a nutrient-rich soil that is perfect for planting.",
    "Build a trellis system: If the ground is too hard to dig into, you can still create a garden by building a trellis system. This involves creating a series of vertical structures that plants can climb on, providing a surface for them to grow on. You can use materials such as wood, metal, or bamboo to build the trellis, and then plant climbing plants such as beans, peas, or cucumbers. This will create a productive garden without the need for digging into the ground.",
    "Create a hydroponic system: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water rather than soil. This can be a great option if the ground is too hard to dig into, as it eliminates the need for soil altogether. You can create a hydroponic system using a container or a greenhouse, and then add the necessary nutrients and water to create a nutrient-rich environment for the plants to grow in. This method can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs.",
    "Use a geodesic dome: A geodesic dome is a unique and innovative way to create a garden. This involves building a dome-shaped structure using materials such as plastic, metal, or wood. The dome provides a protected environment for plants to grow in, and can be equipped with a hydroponic system or other growing medium. This is a great option for creating a garden in areas where the ground is too hard to dig into, as it eliminates the need for soil altogether.",
    "Create a green roof: A green roof is a type of roof that is covered in plants, rather than traditional roofing materials. This can be a great"
