    "Idea: Develop a navigation system using advanced technology such as GPS, radar, and satellite imagery. The system would provide real-time information on the boat's location, course, and weather conditions, and would also allow the crew to plan and adjust their route as needed.",
    "Idea: Use traditional navigation methods such as celestial navigation and triangulation. The crew would use a sextant to measure the position of the stars and the sun, and would also use dead reckoning to determine their speed and direction.",
    "Idea: Hire a professional navigator or join a crew that has experience in crossing the Atlantic. The crew would have access to specialized knowledge and equipment, and would be able to make informed decisions about their course and safety.",
    "Idea: Use a combination of traditional and modern navigation methods. The crew would use a sextant and dead reckoning for position and direction, and would also use GPS and satellite imagery for real-time information on weather and other conditions.",
