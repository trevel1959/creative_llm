    "**Auto-Stapling Stapler**: Design a stapler that automatically staples paper once it's inserted correctly. The user wouldn't have to press down on the stapler; it would do so with the appropriate force for the number of sheets being stapled. This reduces the physical strain on users, making it ideal for those with repetitive motion injuries.",
    "**Sustainable Stapler**: Develop a stapler made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites. It would also use rechargeable batteries powered by kinetic energy (e.g., a small wheel at the base that turns when the stapler is lifted). This would appeal to environmentally-conscious consumers looking for sustainable office solutions.",
    "**Wireless Charging Stand Stapler**: Incorporate wireless charging capabilities into the stapler. Users could place their smartphone or other compatible devices on the stapler's stand while working, eliminating the need for cords. This could also include a built-in speaker for receiving calls or playing music through Bluetooth.",
    "**Voice-Activated Stapler**: Implement voice recognition technology in the stapler, allowing users to dictate commands like \"staple these papers\" or \"open my document.\" This would be particularly useful for individuals with disabilities or those who prefer hands-free operation.",
    "**Customizable Stapler Colors and Designs**: Offer a customizable stapler where users can choose the color, material, and even design patterns. This personalization would make the stapler more appealing to creative professionals, enhancing their workspace and potentially improving productivity."
