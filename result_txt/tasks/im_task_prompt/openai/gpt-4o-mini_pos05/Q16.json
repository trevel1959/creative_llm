    "**Smart Hair Analysis**: Incorporate sensors within the brush that analyze hair and scalp health while brushing. The brush could connect to a smartphone app to provide insights on hair type, moisture levels, and product buildup, offering personalized care tips and product recommendations based on the user’s unique hair needs.",
    "**Detangling Mechanism**: Design a hairbrush with flexible bristles that can adjust their stiffness based on the hair type being brushed. For instance, softer bristles could be used for fine hair, while firmer bristles could be deployed for thicker hair. This feature would minimize breakage and make the brushing experience more comfortable.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Adjustment**: Create a brush with an adjustable ergonomic handle that can be customized for comfort. Users could change the shape and grip texture based on their hand size and brushing style, ensuring a more comfortable and effective brushing experience.",
    "**Built-in Hair Product Dispenser**: Design a hairbrush with a small compartment that holds hair serums or conditioners. As the user brushes, a controlled amount of product is dispensed onto the hair. This feature allows for even distribution of hair care products, reducing waste and enhancing the hair’s shine and health.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**: Develop a brush with bristles that change color based on hair health indicators, such as moisture levels or damage. For example, bristles could turn blue when the hair is hydrated and green when it’s healthy. This visual feedback would encourage users to maintain their hair health and adapt their care routine accordingly."
