    "**Sustainable Catering**: Sourcing catering that emphasizes local, organic, and seasonal ingredients can be problematic. Many catering companies may not have access to local produce or may rely on mass-produced items that lack sustainability. Couples should consider partnering with local farms or catering services that specialize in farm-to-table options to ensure a minimal carbon footprint.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Finding wedding attire that is both stylish and sustainable can be a significant challenge. Traditional wedding dresses and suits are often made from non-biodegradable materials. Couples can explore options such as renting attire, purchasing from eco-conscious designers, or even opting for second-hand clothing to reduce waste and promote sustainability.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Guests traveling to the wedding can contribute significantly to carbon emissions, especially if they are flying or driving long distances. To address this, couples can provide information on carpooling options, encourage the use of public transportation, or even arrange shuttle services that minimize the environmental impact of travel.",
    "**Decor and Floral Arrangements**: Many wedding decorations and floral arrangements are not eco-friendly, often involving imported flowers or non-recyclable materials. Couples can focus on using locally sourced flowers, potted plants that guests can take home, or even dried arrangements that can be reused or composted after the event.",
    "**Waste Management**: Weddings often generate a considerable amount of waste, from food scraps to decorations. Couples should implement a comprehensive waste management plan that includes recycling, composting, and minimizing single-use plastics. Providing clearly labeled bins and working with the venue to ensure proper waste disposal can help reduce the event's environmental impact."
