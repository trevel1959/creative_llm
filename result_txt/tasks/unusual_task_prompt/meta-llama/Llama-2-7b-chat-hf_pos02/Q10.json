    "Pen-based virtual reality: Create a pen that allows users to interact with virtual objects and environments. The pen would use sensors and cameras to track the user's hand movements and project the virtual objects onto a screen or in front of the user. This would allow for a more immersive and interactive experience compared to traditional virtual reality headsets.",
    "Smart pen for note-taking: Develop a pen that can digitize handwritten notes and transfer them directly to a computer or smart device. The pen would have a small microchip and sensors that would capture the user's handwriting and convert it into digital text. This would save time and make note-taking more efficient, as users could easily organize and search their notes.",
    "Customizable pen colors: Create a pen that allows users to change the color of the ink with a simple twist. The pen would have a unique mechanism that allows the user to select from a range of colors, providing endless possibilities for creative expression.",
    "Pen-powered projector: Develop a pen that doubles as a portable projector. The pen would have a small projector built into the tip, allowing users to project images and videos from their devices onto any surface. This would be ideal for presentations, movies, and other visual displays.",
    "Pen-based gaming controller: Create a pen that can be used as a controller for video games. The pen would have sensors and buttons that allow users to control game characters and actions, providing a more immersive and interactive gaming experience. This would be especially useful for mobile gaming, as it would allow players to control games on their phones or tablets without the need for a separate controller."
