    "**Biometric Security Features**: Enhance the alarm system with biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition. This would allow only authorized users to deactivate the alarm. Additionally, the system could send real-time alerts to the homeowner’s phone if someone attempts to access the system without proper authorization, providing an added layer of security.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Compatibility**: Design the alarm system to seamlessly integrate with other smart home devices, such as smart lights, thermostats, and door locks. For instance, if the alarm is triggered, the system could automatically turn on all the lights in the house to deter intruders and lock all doors to prevent entry, creating a unified response to potential threats.",
    "**Mobile Surveillance Drones**: Introduce a feature where the alarm system can deploy small, indoor surveillance drones when a breach is detected. These drones could fly around the house to provide real-time video feeds to the homeowner’s smartphone, allowing them to assess the situation and determine whether to contact authorities.",
    "**Community Alert System**: Create a neighborhood network where alarm systems can communicate with each other. If one alarm is triggered, it could send alerts to nearby systems and registered users in the vicinity, creating a community watch effect. This could also include a local police integration that automatically notifies law enforcement in the event of a serious threat.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Expand the capabilities of the alarm system to include environmental sensors that monitor for fire, carbon monoxide, or flooding. By integrating these features, the alarm system would not only serve as a security measure but also as a comprehensive safety system, alerting homeowners to multiple types of emergencies."
