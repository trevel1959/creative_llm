    "Scent-sory Travel: Design a perfume bottle that takes users on a sensory journey through different destinations around the world.

When the user twists the cap, they are transported to a different location, such as a bustling street market in Marrakech or a tranquil Japanese garden.",
    "Fragrance Fusion: Create a perfume bottle that allows users to blend their own unique fragrance combinations. The bottle could feature a series of colorful caps, each containing a different fragrance note, such as citrus, floral, or woody. Users can mix and match the caps to create their perfect scent, and the bottle could come with a set of instructions on how to combine the notes for the best results.",
    "Olfactory Storytelling: Design a perfume bottle that tells a story through its fragrance notes.

As they solve the puzzle, users are rewarded with a unique fragrance experience that is both satisfying and enjoyable."
