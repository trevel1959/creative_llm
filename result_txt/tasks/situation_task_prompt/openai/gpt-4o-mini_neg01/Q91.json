    "**Smart Clothing with Feedback Mechanisms**: Design clothing embedded with sensors that detect environmental conditions and potential injuries. For instance, the fabric could have temperature sensors that alert you when you're near extreme heat or cold. Additionally, pressure sensors could identify when you're applying too much force to a particular area of your body, preventing injuries like sprains or fractures. The clothing could vibrate or emit sounds to warn you of these risks.",
    "**Environmental Awareness Training**: Develop a comprehensive training program focused on enhancing spatial awareness and cognitive mapping skills. This program would teach individuals to mentally visualize their surroundings and anticipate risks. It would include exercises in various environments (home, workplace, outdoor) to build familiarity and instinctual responses to potential hazards, allowing individuals to navigate safely despite the lack of physical sensation.",
    "**Personal Safety Companion Robot**: Create a small, mobile robot that acts as a personal safety companion. Equipped with sensors and cameras, this robot would follow you around and detect hazards in real-time. It could use artificial intelligence to learn your typical movements and preferences, providing tailored alerts and assistance. For example, if you’re about to walk into a wall, the robot could gently guide you away from it.",
    "**Customizable Alert System**: Develop a smartphone app that connects to various smart home devices and wearable tech. This app could use a combination of notifications, vibrations, and lights to alert you of potential dangers in your environment. For example, if you’re near a hot stove, the app could send a visual cue to your smart glasses and vibrate your wristband, prompting you to move away from the danger.",
    "**Virtual Reality Hazard Training**: Utilize virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate various environments and scenarios where injuries might occur. This training program would immerse individuals in realistic situations, allowing them to practice navigating safely without the ability to feel physical sensations. By repeatedly encountering and responding to potential hazards in a controlled setting, individuals would develop the mental acuity needed to avoid real-life injuries."
