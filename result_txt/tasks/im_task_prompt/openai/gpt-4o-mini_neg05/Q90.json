    "**Smart Guitar Picks**: Create guitar picks embedded with sensors that track the player's technique, speed, and pressure. These picks could sync with an app to analyze playing style, offering personalized tips for improvement. They could also feature customizable settings, allowing users to choose the tone or effect based on their preferences.",
    "**Guitar with Adjustable Neck Tension**: Design a guitar with an adjustable neck tension mechanism that allows players to easily modify the action and neck relief. This would cater to different playing styles and preferences, making it easier for musicians to switch between fingerstyle and strumming techniques without needing to take the guitar to a luthier.",
    "**Integrated LED Fretboard**: Incorporate LED lights into the fretboard that illuminate to indicate chord shapes, scales, or song progressions. This feature would be especially beneficial for beginners, as it visually guides them through songs and helps them learn finger placements in an interactive way. Advanced users could customize the lighting patterns for their practice routines.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Learning Tool**: Develop AR glasses or an app that overlays instructional graphics onto the real-world view of the guitar. As the player practices, the AR system could highlight the correct finger positions and strumming techniques, offering a hands-on learning experience without needing a physical instructor.",
    "**Self-Tuning Guitar**: Create a guitar with built-in self-tuning technology that automatically adjusts the strings to the correct pitch at the push of a button. This feature would save time and frustration for musicians, especially during live performances or rehearsals. Additionally, the guitar could include alternate tuning presets that users can switch between easily."
