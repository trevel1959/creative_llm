    "Impact on Habitat: Larger animals would require more resources, such as food, water, and shelter. This could lead to competition for resources and potentially force smaller species to relocate. The impact on habitat could also be severe, as larger animals would require larger territories to live in.",
    "Impact on Predators: If the prey animals grew larger, the predators that feed on them would also need to adjust. Smaller predators would need to find new prey or adapt to hunting larger prey. Larger predators would need to find food in larger quantities or adapt to a different diet.",
    "Impact on Ecosystem Services: Large animals play important roles in maintaining ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. If they disappeared, these services could be disrupted, leading to negative impacts on human health and well-being.",
    "Impact on Human Activities: The growth of animals could have significant impacts on human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting. For example, larger fish could make fishing more difficult, and larger livestock could increase the risk of disease transmission.",
    "Impact on Conservation: The growth of animals could make conservation efforts more difficult. If animals become endangered due to habitat loss or other factors, larger animals would be more difficult to rehabilitate. This could make it more challenging to restore balance to ecosystems."
