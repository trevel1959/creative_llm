    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and the increase in tourism can have significant environmental consequences, including habitat destruction, increased pollution, and waste management challenges. To address this, the host city could implement sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials for construction, promoting green transportation options, and establishing a comprehensive recycling program during the games to minimize waste.",
    "**Security Concerns**: With a large number of international visitors and high-profile athletes, security becomes a paramount concern. The potential for terrorist threats or large-scale protests can create safety issues. To combat this, the host city could collaborate with international security agencies to develop a robust security plan that includes surveillance, crowd management strategies, and emergency response training for staff and volunteers.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can boost the local economy, it can also exacerbate economic disparities within the host city. The focus on tourist areas may lead to neglect in less affluent neighborhoods. To counteract this, the city could implement community investment programs that ensure benefits from the Olympics reach all residents, including job creation initiatives and infrastructure improvements in underserved areas.",
    "**Athlete Well-Being**: The intense pressure of competition can lead to mental health issues among athletes, exacerbated by the scrutiny they face. A potential problem could arise if proper mental health support is not provided. To address this, the organizing committee could establish a comprehensive mental health program that includes access to counselors, workshops on stress management, and peer support groups to help athletes cope with the pressures of the games.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics brings together diverse cultures, and misunderstandings or insensitivity can lead to conflicts. Issues may arise from cultural appropriation, misrepresentation, or lack of respect for local customs. To promote cultural harmony, the host city could create an educational campaign that highlights the importance of cultural awareness, encouraging athletes and visitors to engage respectfully with the local community and traditions."
