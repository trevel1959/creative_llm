    "**The Ice-Cream Rain**",
    "One summer afternoon, the sky turned a peculiar shade of pink, and children gathered in the streets, eyes wide with wonder. Suddenly, soft, creamy scoops began to fall from the heavens, raining chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Laughter erupted as they held out their hands, catching the colorful deluge. In a frenzy, they danced and twirled, their worries melting away with each delicious scoop. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, the clouds turned dark, and the sweet rain transformed into a sticky, gooey mess. The children learned that joy could be fleeting, but the memory of that day would forever linger, sweet as ice cream.",
