    "**Exfoliating Powders**: Create a line of exfoliating powders made from natural ingredients like sugar, salt, and coffee grounds. These powders could be used to gently remove dead skin cells and clean the skin, providing a similar sensation to soap without the need for a liquid soap.",
    "**Bamboo Brush Cleaning**: Develop a line of bamboo brushes that can be used to clean the skin, using the natural fibers of the bamboo to remove dirt and grime. This could be particularly effective for cleaning hard-to-reach areas or for individuals with sensitive skin.",
