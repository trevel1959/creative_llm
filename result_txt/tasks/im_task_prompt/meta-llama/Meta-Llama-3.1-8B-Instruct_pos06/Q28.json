    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Air Quality Monitoring**: Design a bicycle helmet that incorporates a built-in air quality sensor, which detects pollutants and toxins in the air. The sensor would provide real-time data to the rider, alerting them to potential health risks and suggesting alternative routes to avoid polluted areas. This feature would be particularly useful in urban environments, where air quality is often a concern.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Solar-Powered Lights**: Develop a bicycle helmet with built-in solar panels that charge a battery, powering a set of LED lights. These lights would provide increased visibility for the rider, especially in low-light conditions, and could also be used to create a unique light show or pattern, making the rider more noticeable to others on the road.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Virtual Reality Display**: Design a helmet with a small, high-resolution display that provides virtual reality experiences, such as augmented reality navigation, interactive games, or even virtual tours of nearby attractions. This feature would keep riders engaged and entertained during their commute, while also providing valuable information about their surroundings.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Bio-Metric Feedback**: Create a helmet that tracks the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, providing real-time feedback to help them optimize their physical performance. This feature would be particularly useful for professional cyclists or athletes who need to fine-tune their training regimens.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet with Integrated 3D-Printed Customization**: Develop a helmet that uses 3D printing technology to create customized components, such as ear cups, cheek pads, or even the entire helmet shell, tailored to the individual rider's preferences and needs. This feature would provide a high level of comfort and fit, while also allowing riders to personalize their helmets with unique designs or logos."
