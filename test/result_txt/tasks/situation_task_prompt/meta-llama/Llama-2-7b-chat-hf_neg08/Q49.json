    "Build a fire-resistant shelter: Construct a safe room or bunker in your home using fire-resistant materials like brick, stone, or concrete. This will provide a secure place to escape to in case of a fire.",
    "Install a fire-fighting water tank: Dig a well or pool near your home and install a water tank to store water for fighting fires. This will provide a reliable source of water for fighting fires, even if the main water supply is cut off.",
    "Use a fire-resistant plant: Plant fire-resistant plants like succulents or cacti around your home to create a natural barrier against fires. These plants are less likely to catch fire and can help slow the spread of a fire.",
    "Create a firebreak: Clear a wide area around your home of flammable materials like woodpiles, debris, and vegetation. This will create a firebreak that will help stop a fire from spreading to your home.",
    "Use a fire-fighting drone: Develop a drone that can detect and extinguish fires. This drone could be equipped with a water tank, a fire-fighting agent, or a laser that can cut off the oxygen supply to the fire, making it impossible to spread."
