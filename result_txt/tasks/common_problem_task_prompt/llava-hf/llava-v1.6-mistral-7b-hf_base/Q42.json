    "Funding: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment can be expensive, and researchers may struggle to secure the necessary funding. This may involve seeking grants or other forms of financial support, and researchers may need to navigate complex bureaucratic processes to obtain funding.",
    "Time constraints: Large-scale scientific experiments can take a long time to complete, and researchers may face time constraints that limit their ability to conduct the experiment. This may involve finding ways to expedite the experiment, such as using advanced technology or streamlining procedures.",
    "Data management: Large-scale scientific experiments generate a lot of data, and researchers must find ways to manage and analyze this data effectively. This may involve developing new data management tools and techniques, as well as hiring data analysts or other experts to help with data analysis.",
    "Collaboration: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment often requires collaboration among multiple researchers, institutions, or organizations. This may involve coordinating with other researchers, sharing data and resources, and navigating conflicts or disagreements that may arise during the collaboration.",
    "Communication: Effective communication is essential for conducting a large-scale scientific experiment. Researchers must communicate with participants, collaborators, and other stakeholders throughout the experiment, and they must be able to explain complex scientific concepts to non-experts."
