    "Invent a new mode of transportation: I would use my engineering skills to design and build a new, efficient mode of transportation that can replace bicycles. It could be a small, electric vehicle that can be easily carried and stored, or perhaps a hoverboard that can be used to glide over short distances.",
    "Use public transportation: If bicycles disappeared, I would rely on public transportation to get around. This could include buses, trains, and subways, which are already in place in many cities.",
    "Walk or bike: If all bicycles disappeared, I would rely on walking or using a hand-cranked bike to get around. While this may not be the most efficient mode of transportation, it is still a viable option and can provide a good workout.",
    "Carpool: If all bicycles disappeared, I would look for carpooling options to get around. This could involve sharing a ride with friends or coworkers, or using a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft.",
    "Use a scooter: If bicycles disappeared, I would consider using a scooter as an alternative mode of transportation. Scooters are becoming increasingly popular in many cities and can be a convenient way to get around short distances."
