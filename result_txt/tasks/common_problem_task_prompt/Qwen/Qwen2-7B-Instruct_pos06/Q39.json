    "**Skill-based Basic Income**: Instead of providing a fixed amount of money to all citizens, this system allocates funds based on skills and potential needs. For example, people who have no formal education or are in fields with high unemployment rates receive higher amounts. This approach aims to reduce inequality while promoting skill development and job creation.",
    "**Progressive Universal Basic Income**: This concept combines elements of a traditional UBI with progressive taxation. High-income earners pay a larger percentage of their income towards the UBI fund, ensuring that wealthier individuals contribute more to support those in need. This model aims to create a more equitable distribution of resources.",
    "**Geographic Universal Basic Income**: This system provides a UBI based on the geographic location of recipients. Areas with higher living costs receive a larger amount, ensuring that basic needs can be met across different regions. This helps in reducing regional disparities and promotes equal opportunities for all citizens regardless of where they live.",
    "**Eco-centric Universal Basic Income**: With increasing environmental concerns, this idea focuses on sustainability by integrating UBI into eco-friendly practices. For instance, recipients must participate in community clean-up drives or renewable energy projects to receive their monthly allocation. This encourages environmental responsibility and sustainable living among the population.",
    "**Health-based Universal Basic Income**: Recognizing the impact of health on economic stability, this model provides additional funding to individuals based on their health status. Those with chronic conditions or disabilities receive higher amounts to cover medical expenses and maintain their quality of life. This ensures that healthcare needs do not become a barrier to financial security."
