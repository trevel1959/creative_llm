    "**Enhanced Voice-Activated Navigation System**: This idea involves creating an advanced voice-activated navigation system that incorporates machine learning algorithms to provide real-time guidance and information. The system would learn from the user's preferences, history, and surroundings, making it highly personalized. For example, if a visually impaired person frequently walks down a specific street, the system could learn the layout, landmarks, and any obstacles to provide more accurate directions.",
    "**Interactive Braille Displays**: Develop a new type of Braille display that not only translates text but also incorporates haptic feedback. This could include vibrations or other tactile cues to help users better understand the context of the text they are reading. Additionally, the device could be integrated with speech synthesis, allowing users to hear the text alongside feeling it in Braille, enhancing comprehension.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training for Daily Living Skills**: Create a VR application that simulates various daily living scenarios, such as grocery shopping, cooking, or using public transportation. Users can practice these skills in a controlled environment, receive immediate feedback, and learn at their own pace. This can significantly boost confidence and independence for those who are visually impaired.",
    "**Smart Home Integration with Voice Commands**: Design a smart home system that is fully accessible through voice commands. This includes integrating devices like lights, thermostats, security systems, and appliances with a robust AI assistant. This would allow visually impaired individuals to control their environment more easily, improving both safety and convenience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Wayfinding Solution**: Develop an AR app that overlays visual cues onto the userâ€™s environment, guiding them through spaces. The app could use GPS, motion sensors, and visual recognition to provide turn-by-turn directions, highlight important locations, and avoid obstacles. It could also include features like audio descriptions and haptic feedback for better spatial understanding."
