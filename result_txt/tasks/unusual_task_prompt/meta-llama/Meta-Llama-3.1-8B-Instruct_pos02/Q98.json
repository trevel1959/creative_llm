    "Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Automation: Design a smart power strip that not only provides surge protection but also monitors energy consumption in real-time. The strip would have built-in sensors to track the power usage of each outlet, allowing users to identify which devices are the most energy-intensive. This data can be accessed through a mobile app, enabling users to make informed decisions about their energy usage. The strip could also be programmed to automatically turn off or reduce power to certain outlets when not in use, promoting energy efficiency and reducing waste.",
    "Modular Power Strip with Swappable Outlet Modules: Create a modular power strip that allows users to swap out outlet modules as needed. Each module could be designed for specific types of devices, such as USB ports for charging smartphones, or high-power outlets for heavy-duty equipment. This design would enable users to customize their power strip to meet their specific needs, reducing clutter and making it easier to manage their devices. The modular design would also make it simple to upgrade or replace individual outlets as technology advances.",
    "Power Strip with Built-in Wireless Charging: Develop a power strip with built-in wireless charging capabilities, allowing users to charge their devices without the need for cables. This would be particularly useful for devices that don't have traditional charging ports, such as wireless earbuds or smartwatches. The power strip could also include multiple wireless charging pads, enabling users to charge multiple devices at once.",
    "Power Strip with Integrated Cable Management: Design a power strip with built-in cable management features, such as cable ties or a retractable cord system. This would help keep cords organized and reduce clutter, making it easier to manage devices and cables. The power strip could also include a built-in cord organizer or cable wrap, allowing users to neatly store excess cord length.",
    "Power Strip with Integrated USB Hub and Storage: Create a power strip with an integrated USB hub and storage compartment. The USB hub would provide additional ports for charging devices, while the storage compartment would offer a secure place to store small items like cables, adapters, or batteries. This design would be particularly useful for users who need to charge multiple devices at once and also need a convenient place to store their accessories."
