    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When assembling a computer, static electricity can pose a significant threat to sensitive components like the CPU and RAM. A sudden discharge of static can damage these parts irreparably. To mitigate this risk, builders should work on an anti-static mat, wear an anti-static wrist strap, and ensure they frequently ground themselves by touching a metal object.",
    "**Cooling Solutions**: Overheating can lead to performance throttling or permanent damage to computer components. Many builders underestimate the importance of cooling solutions. If the case lacks adequate airflow or if the CPU cooler is insufficient, it can lead to system instability. To address this, builders should plan for sufficient airflow with strategically placed fans and consider aftermarket cooling solutions for high-performance builds.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: Selecting an inadequate power supply unit (PSU) can lead to a variety of problems, including system instability, crashes, or even hardware damage. If the PSU does not provide enough wattage or lacks the necessary connectors for the components, the build will fail. Itâ€™s crucial to calculate the total power requirements of all components and choose a PSU that exceeds that requirement for safety.",
    "**Cable Management**: Poor cable management can hinder airflow and make future upgrades or repairs more difficult. Messy cables can also create a cluttered look, making it harder to identify issues if they arise. To prevent this, builders should plan cable routing in advance, use zip ties or Velcro straps to bundle cables, and utilize modular or semi-modular PSUs that allow for more efficient cable management.",
    "**Software Installation Challenges**: After the hardware is assembled, installing the operating system and drivers can present its own set of challenges. Builders may encounter issues like BIOS settings that need to be adjusted for booting from a USB drive or drivers that are not automatically recognized. To avoid these pitfalls, users should familiarize themselves with the installation process, prepare bootable USB drives in advance, and ensure they have all necessary drivers downloaded beforehand."
