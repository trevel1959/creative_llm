    "**Inflatable Pillow Alternative**: Design a wearable, inflatable pillow that can be inflated or deflated as needed. This can be worn like a vest or a cape, and can provide support to the neck and head while sleeping. The pillow can be made of soft, breathable materials and could have adjustable straps for a customized fit.",
    "**Headrest Pillow Stand**: Create a portable stand that holds up a flat surface, such as a laptop screen or a small board, at an appropriate height for resting the head. This stand could be made of sturdy material and have adjustable settings to accommodate different heights and sleeping positions.",
    "**Wearable Memory Foam Collar**: Develop a collar made of memory foam that can be worn around the neck. It would gently hug the neck and provide support for the head, eliminating the need for a traditional pillow. This collar could be made with a soft, breathable fabric on the inside and adjustable velcro closures on the outside.",
    "**Gravity-Responsive Pillow**: Design a pillow that adjusts its shape based on the weight and position of the sleeper. Using sensors and responsive materials, the pillow would mold itself to provide optimal support for the head and neck. This could be particularly beneficial for those who frequently change positions during sleep.",
    "**Air-Powered Adjustable Pillow**: Create a pillow that inflates and deflates through air pressure controlled by a small pump or electronic device. This would allow the user to adjust the firmness and shape of the pillow according to their comfort preference. The pillow could be made from durable, lightweight material and equipped with a comfortable cover for direct contact with the skin."
