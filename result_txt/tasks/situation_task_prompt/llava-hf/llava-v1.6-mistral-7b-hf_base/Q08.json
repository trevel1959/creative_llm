    "Desalination of Seawater: While it's energy-intensive and requires capital investment, desalination plants can be built to convert oceanside saltwater into fresh drinking water. This technology can be expensive and requires significant energy inputs, but it could provide a reliable source of clean drinking water if all other options are exhausted.",
    "Solar Still: Solar stills rely on the sun's heat to evaporate water and condense it into drinking water. This can be a simple, low-cost technology that can be built locally to create drinking water from contaminated water sources.",
    "Water Purification Tablets: These tablets can be taken in water to purify it and make it safe to drink. They can be a quick and easy solution for people in need and can be stored for long periods of time.",
    "Membrane Filters: These can be used to filter out impurities from water sources, providing a safe drinking water method. Membrane filters can be expensive but can be a long-term solution for a community or a business.",
    "Groundwater Extraction: If the ground beneath is not contaminated, groundwater can be extracted and treated for drinking purposes. This technology requires significant investment in drilling equipment and treatment systems but can be a reliable source of clean drinking water if the subterranean water sources are clean."
