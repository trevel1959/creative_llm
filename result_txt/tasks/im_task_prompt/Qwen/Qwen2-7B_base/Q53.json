    "Smartboard Notes: This idea involves creating Post-It Notes that are compatible with an existing smartboard. An electric circuit would be on one sticky side of the Post-It, and the circuit's output pins would connect to the smartboard. The post-it would be similar to what is currently on a smartboard, but users would be able to take actual notes on the Post-It Notes and then bring them to the digital smartboard instantly with the click of a button. The smartboard would then use any notes and images the users created with the Post-It Notes.",
    "Smart Notes, Smart Camera: These Post-It Notes would have an integrated camera allowing users to take photos of handwritten notes right on the Post-It. The photo can then be stored and uploaded to the user's digital journal or any cloud-based application. The note would be available in a digital form, allowing users to access past notes that their handwriting may have made difficult to read.",
    "Self-Adapting Notes: Create an intelligent Post-It that would automatically change to the user's handwriting style. These smart Post-Its would have sensors on top of them, able to recognize someone's handwriting style, or in some cases, the color of the pen used to write them. The Post-It would change its color to match the pen, and automatically save notes to a digital form, making it easier for users to remember and access past notes.",
    "Smart Notes, Smart Pen: Create an intelligent app that would record notes via the smartpen and automatically send them to a virtual assistant, such as Apple's Siri or Google Assistant, to store the notes as text, audio, and images. This smart pen will also have the ability to identify handwritten information, and through the app, transfer it to a digital form for faster accessibility.",
    "Smart Digital Notes: These Post-It Notes would have an interface in which users could write notes down digitally. The process would involve writing on the notes, then scanning them into the interface. The notes could then be transferred into a digital format and automatically sent to the user's email, digital journal, or any cloud application, allowing them faster access to their notes and making them more efficient."
