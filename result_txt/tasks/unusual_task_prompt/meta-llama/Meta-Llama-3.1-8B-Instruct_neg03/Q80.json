    "\"Dreamscaper\": A wearable device that uses EEG and AI to translate brain waves into a lucid dreaming experience. Users can design and control their own dreamscapes, complete with immersive visuals, sounds, and emotions. The device would be a sleek, futuristic headset with a built-in neural interface and a companion app for customizing and exploring the dream world.",
    "\"EcoCycle\": A modular, AI-powered recycling system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify and sort recyclables from waste. The system would consist of a network of compact, IoT-enabled recycling units that can be placed in homes, offices, or public spaces. Each unit would have a touchscreen interface for users to input their recyclables, and the AI would learn their habits and preferences over time to optimize the recycling process.",
    "\"Symphony of the Senses\": An immersive, multi-sensory experience that combines music, art, and scent to create an unforgettable event. The installation would feature a series of interconnected pods, each with its own unique scent and sound profile. Users would wear special headphones and wristbands that detect their brain activity and adjust the sensory experience in real-time, creating a truly personalized and emotional journey.",
    "\"Urban Oasis\": A smart, modular gardening system that uses AI and IoT sensors to optimize plant growth and air quality in urban environments. The system would consist of a series of interconnected, self-watering planters that can be placed on rooftops, balconies, or in public spaces. The AI would monitor temperature, humidity, and light levels to ensure optimal growing conditions, and would also detect air quality and adjust the plant selection accordingly.",
    "\"MindMeld\": A social platform that uses AI and brain-computer interfaces to facilitate deep, meaningful connections between people. Users would wear special headbands with EEG sensors that detect their brain activity, and would be matched with others who share similar interests, values, and emotional profiles. The platform would use machine learning to optimize the matching process and create a safe, supportive community for users to explore their thoughts and feelings.
