    "Submersible Transportation: Transportation would require innovative submersible vehicles designed for efficient and comfortable travel through the water. These vehicles would need to be capable of navigating both the surface and the deep sea, and could be powered by advanced battery technology or fusion reactors for extended range.",
    "Aquatic Agriculture: Underwater farming would become a major industry, utilizing hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a variety of crops. This would allow for sustainable food production in areas where traditional farming is not feasible due to the lack of arable land.",
    "Marine Wildlife Preservation: With life underwater, humans would have a unique perspective on marine ecosystems. The preservation of these ecosystems would become a top priority, leading to the establishment of marine sanctuaries and conservation efforts to protect the delicate balance of underwater life.",
    "Underwater Exploration: The discovery of new species, underwater ruins, and the exploration of deep-sea trenches would become a popular pursuit. This would drive technological advancements in underwater exploration and could lead to new discoveries in the fields of marine biology, geology, and history.",
    "Submarine Habitats: Submarine habitats would be developed for both research and living purposes. These habitats would provide scientists with the opportunity to study the ocean up close and could serve as a place for astronauts to acclimate to life in space."
