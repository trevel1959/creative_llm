    "**Genius Overload**: With the sudden surge in intelligence, the world would face an unprecedented shortage of resources and infrastructure to accommodate the new cognitive abilities. This could lead to a crisis of overthinking, as people would struggle to manage their newfound capacity for complex problem-solving. The result might be a global paralysis, as individuals become overwhelmed by the sheer scope of possibilities and limitations.",
    "**Intelligence Inequality**: The overnight transformation would create a significant divide between those who were born with average intelligence and those who became geniuses. The latter group would possess unparalleled knowledge and abilities, potentially leading to a new form of social hierarchy. This could result in a dystopian society where the intelligent elite wield power and control, while the less gifted are relegated to secondary roles.",
    "**Creative Explosion**: The sudden influx of genius-level thinking could lead to an unprecedented explosion of creativity, as people would be able to approach problems from novel angles and develop innovative solutions. This could result in breakthroughs in fields like science, art, and technology, leading to a new era of human progress. However, it might also lead to an information overload, as the sheer volume of new ideas and discoveries becomes difficult to manage.",
    "**Existential Crisis**: With the ability to think at genius-level, people would be confronted with the harsh realities of the world, including issues like climate change, poverty, and inequality. This could lead to an existential crisis, as individuals grapple with the weight of their newfound knowledge and the moral implications of their actions. Some might become overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and lose their sense of purpose, while others might become more determined to make a positive impact.",
    "**Neurological Overload**: The rapid increase in intelligence could put a strain on the human brain, leading to a condition known as \"genius-induced neurological overload.\" This could result in a range of symptoms, including headaches, memory loss, and decreased cognitive function. In extreme cases, it might even lead to a form of cognitive burnout, where individuals become unable to think critically or make decisions due to the sheer pressure of their own intellect.
