    "**Modular Lens System**: Develop a modular lens system that allows photographers to easily swap out different elements (like filters, focal lengths, or even specialized lens coatings) without needing to change the entire lens. This could be achieved through a simple twist-and-lock mechanism, allowing for rapid adjustments based on shooting conditions.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Create a viewfinder that utilizes augmented reality to provide additional information and visual guides. For instance, it could overlay grid lines, suggest exposure settings, or even simulate the final image with different settings, helping photographers visualize their shots before taking them.",
    "**Smart Environment Recognition**: Implement a feature that uses machine learning to recognize different environments (like landscapes, portraits, or low-light settings) and automatically adjusts camera settings accordingly. This would make it easier for users to capture the best possible images without needing extensive knowledge of camera settings.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Solar Power**: Incorporate a dual charging system that allows the camera to be charged wirelessly or via solar power. This would be especially beneficial for outdoor photographers, ensuring that they can keep shooting without worrying about battery life, even in remote locations.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional buttons with a customizable touchscreen interface that allows users to drag and drop settings or features they use most frequently. This could also include gesture controls for common functions (like zooming or changing settings) to make the camera more intuitive and user-friendly."
