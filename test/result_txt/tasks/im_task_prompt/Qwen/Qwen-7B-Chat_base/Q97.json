    "A leash that doubles as a fitness tracker: The leash would have sensors embedded in it that can track the distance walked, heart rate, and other metrics related to physical activity. This would encourage owners to take their dogs for more walks and exercise, making both the dog and owner healthier.",
    "A leash that changes color based on the dog's mood: The leash would be made of a material that changes color based on the dog's body temperature or other factors that indicate its emotional state. For example, if the dog is happy and excited, the leash might turn bright green; if the dog is stressed or anxious, the leash might turn blue.",
    "A leash that connects multiple dogs: The leash would be designed to connect multiple dogs together, allowing them to explore the world safely and together. This would be particularly useful for dog owners who have multiple dogs or who want to bring along friends' dogs on walks.",
    "A leash that provides entertainment for dogs: The leash would be equipped with small toys or treats that dispense when the dog pulls on it. This would provide an extra incentive for the dog to walk and play, making the experience more enjoyable for both the dog and owner.",
    "A leash that allows owners to communicate with their dogs: The leash would have built-in speakers and microphones that allow owners to give commands or speak to their dogs while they are walking. This could be especially helpful for deaf or hard-of-hearing owners who want to communicate with their dogs without using hand signals."
