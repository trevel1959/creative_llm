    "Increased Investment in Infrastructure: With the burden of debt lifted, governments and businesses would have more resources to invest in infrastructure projects, such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. This would lead to improved quality of life, increased productivity, and job creation.",
    "Shift in Global Power Dynamics: The erasure of world debt would likely lead to a shift in global power dynamics, as countries with lower debt levels would gain more influence and leverage in international relations. This could result in a more multipolar world order, with multiple centers of power and influence.",
    "Unintended Consequences: While erasing world debt would have numerous benefits, there could also be unintended consequences. For example, without debt, governments and businesses may struggle to fund critical public services and investments, leading to a decline in living standards and economic growth.
