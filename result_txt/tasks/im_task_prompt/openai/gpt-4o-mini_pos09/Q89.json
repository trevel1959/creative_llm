    "**Smart Waffle Iron with App Integration**: Develop a smart waffle iron that connects to a mobile app. The app can provide users with recipes, cooking times, and temperature settings tailored to different types of batters (gluten-free, vegan, etc.). Additionally, it could allow users to control the cooking process remotely, receive notifications when the waffles are ready, and even share their creations on social media directly from the app.",
    "**Built-in Flavor Infuser**: Design a waffle iron that includes a built-in flavor infuser. Users can add ingredients like vanilla, chocolate, or fruit extracts to a small chamber that releases flavor into the batter while cooking. This would allow for customized flavors without altering the basic waffle recipe, enabling unique and delicious combinations.",
    "**Dual-Sided Waffle Iron with Griddle Feature**: Create a dual-sided waffle iron that features a griddle on one side. This would allow users to cook waffles on one side while preparing other breakfast items (like eggs or bacon) on the griddle side simultaneously. This multi-functionality would save time and streamline breakfast preparation.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Temperature Control and Timer**: Introduce a waffle iron with precise temperature control and a built-in timer. Users could select their desired level of crispiness (light, medium, or dark) and set a timer for the perfect cooking duration. This feature would cater to individual preferences and ensure consistent results every time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Waffle Iron with Recyclable Materials**: Develop a waffle iron made from sustainable, recyclable materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. The design could include energy-efficient heating elements that reduce power consumption. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in kitchen appliances."
