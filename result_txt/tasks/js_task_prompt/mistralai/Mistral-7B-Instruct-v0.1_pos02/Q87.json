    "Gravity would be the only force in the universe, but it would be much stronger than in our own universe. This would result in massive celestial bodies and a very different distribution of matter.",
    "The universe would have no light or darkness, only a constant state of grey. This would make it impossible for any form of life to exist.",
    "The laws of physics would be completely different, and there would be no laws of thermodynamics. This would allow for the creation of perpetual motion machines and the possibility of infinite energy.",
    "The universe would have no time, and all events would occur simultaneously. This would make it impossible for any cause and effect relationships to exist.",
    "The universe would be composed entirely of matter, and there would be no empty space. This would result in a universe that is infinitely dense and would have no room for anything to exist."
