    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that allows the vacuum to clean its own brushes and filters. This could be achieved through a built-in UV light and brush system that removes hair and debris after each use. This would not only enhance the performance of the vacuum but also reduce maintenance time for the user.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptability**: Design a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable heads that automatically adjust based on the surface being cleaned. For example, it could have a head that detects carpet pile height and adjusts suction power accordingly, while another head could be designed specifically for hardwood floors to prevent scratching. This adaptability would ensure optimal cleaning on various surfaces.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Disposal**: Create a vacuum cleaner that utilizes biodegradable dust bags or a self-sealing container made from sustainable materials. This would not only reduce plastic waste but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the vacuum could have a composting feature that allows for the organic matter collected to be composted safely.",
    "**Health Monitoring System**: Equip the vacuum with air quality sensors that monitor dust, allergens, and particulate matter in the home while it cleans. The vacuum could provide real-time feedback to the user through a connected app, alerting them to high allergen levels and suggesting cleaning schedules or methods to improve indoor air quality.",
    "**Personalized Cleaning Profiles**: Implement a feature that allows users to create personalized cleaning profiles based on their preferences and home environments. For example, families with pets could set a profile that emphasizes pet hair removal, while those with allergies could prioritize HEPA filtration. The vacuum could then adjust its cleaning modes and schedules accordingly."
