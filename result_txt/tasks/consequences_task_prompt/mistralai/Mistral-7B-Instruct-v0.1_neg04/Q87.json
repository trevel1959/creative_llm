    "Ecological Disruption: Cloning extinct animals could disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems, as these animals may not have evolved to fit in with the current environment. This could lead to competition with other species and potentially cause harm to native wildlife.",
    "Endangered Species: Cloning extinct animals could lead to the creation of new populations, which could potentially help endangered species. However, this could also lead to overpopulation and the need for culling, which could be harmful to the species.",
    "Ethical Concerns: Cloning extinct animals raises ethical concerns about playing God and interfering with the natural order of things. There is also the possibility that cloning could lead to the creation of animals with genetic disorders or other health issues.",
    "Economic Benef: Cloning extinct animals could have economic benefits, such as creating new sources of meat, fur, or other animal products. However, this could also lead to the exploitation of animals and the destruction of natural habitats.",
    "Scientific Advancements: Cloning extinct animals could lead to scientific advancements in genetics and biotechnology. However, this could also lead to the creation of new forms of life that we don't fully understand and could have unintended consequences."
