    "**Redefining Wellness**: A universal cure would prompt a reevaluation of what it means to be \"well.\" Mental health would no longer be seen as merely the absence of illness but as a holistic state that encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being. This shift could lead to the development of new wellness paradigms, emphasizing preventive measures, emotional intelligence, and the cultivation of resilience, creating a more balanced approach to health that includes physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions.",
    "**Impact on Healthcare Systems**: The healthcare landscape would undergo significant changes. With the eradication of mental illnesses, mental health facilities could pivot their focus toward preventive care, education, and wellness programs. Resources currently allocated to managing mental health crises could be redirected to improving physical health, addressing social determinants of health, and investing in community-building initiatives. This could also reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, as society recognizes the importance of mental wellness as part of overall health.",
    "**Cultural Shifts in Expression**: The arts and media industries would likely evolve in response to a world without mental illness. Stories, films, and music that explore mental health struggles might diminish, giving way to narratives focused on growth, resilience, and the celebration of human potential. This cultural shift could encourage new forms of expression that highlight collaboration, empathy, and shared human experiences, fostering a more inclusive and understanding society.",
    "**Economic Transformation**: The workforce could see a remarkable transformation as productivity increases. With a healthier population, absenteeism and presenteeism could decrease significantly, leading to enhanced economic output. Companies might invest more in employee well-being programs, creating environments that promote mental wellness, work-life balance, and professional development. This could ultimately lead to a more innovative and agile economy, as individuals feel empowered to contribute their best selves to their work.",
    "**Global Mental Health Initiatives**: The global perspective on mental health would shift dramatically. Countries might collaborate on mental health initiatives that focus on emotional and psychological well-being, creating a unified front against the stigma surrounding mental health. This could lead to the establishment of international policies and frameworks aimed at promoting mental wellness, sharing best practices, and ensuring access to mental health resources worldwide, thereby fostering a sense of global solidarity."
