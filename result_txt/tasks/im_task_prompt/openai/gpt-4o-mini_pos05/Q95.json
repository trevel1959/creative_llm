    "**Multi-Compartment Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket with multiple compartments that are removable and labeled for different clothing types (e.g., whites, colors, delicates, etc.). Each compartment can be pulled out separately, making it easier to sort laundry directly into the washing machine without having to transfer clothes from one basket to another. This feature would save time and reduce the hassle of sorting after collection.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Folding Mechanism**: Create a laundry basket that has a folding mechanism at the bottom. Once the laundry is washed and dried, the basket can be inverted to form a flat surface, allowing users to fold clothes neatly right in the basket. This design minimizes the need for an additional folding area and makes the process more efficient.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket that incorporates UV-C light technology or an antimicrobial coating that can sanitize the basketâ€™s interior. This feature would help eliminate odors and bacteria from dirty clothes, ensuring that the basket itself remains clean and hygienic. Users could activate the self-cleaning function with a button or timer.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Smart Sorting Technology**: Introduce a laundry basket that uses AI to sort clothes based on fabric type, color, and care instructions. Users could simply place their laundry in the basket, and built-in cameras and sensors would analyze the items and suggest the best washing settings. This could help avoid color bleeding and fabric damage, making laundry day more efficient.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket made from recycled materials and incorporate a biodegradable liner that can be removed and composted. This eco-conscious design would appeal to environmentally-minded consumers and promote sustainable practices in laundry routines. Additionally, the basket could have a section for laundry pods made from plant-based ingredients, encouraging users to choose eco-friendly detergents."
