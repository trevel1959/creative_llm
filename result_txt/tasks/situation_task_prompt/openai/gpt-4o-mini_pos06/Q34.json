    "**Solar-Powered Desalination**: In coastal areas, you can set up a solar-powered desalination system that uses solar energy to convert seawater into freshwater. This method involves evaporation and condensation, making it an eco-friendly solution to provide water for your plants while addressing water scarcity.",
    "**Greywater Recycling System**: Implement a greywater recycling system that collects water from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This system can be designed to filter and store the water for irrigation purposes. By reusing water that would otherwise go to waste, you can maintain healthy plants without relying on rainfall.",
    "**Hydroponic Vertical Gardens**: Transition to hydroponic systems where plants are grown in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. Vertical gardens can be set up indoors or outdoors, maximizing space and minimizing water usage. This method allows for precise control over water and nutrient delivery, ensuring plants thrive even in dry conditions.",
    "**Moisture-Retaining Mulch**: Use organic materials such as wood chips, straw, or coconut coir as mulch around your plants. This not only helps retain soil moisture but also reduces evaporation. Additionally, you can mix in water-absorbing crystals that swell when watered, providing a slow release of moisture to the plants over time.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Install rainwater harvesting systems with large cisterns to collect and store rainwater during the rainy season. Even if rain has stopped, you can utilize this stored water efficiently. Incorporate drip irrigation systems to ensure that the water is delivered directly to the roots of the plants, minimizing waste."
