    "Integrating smart sensors: Adding smart sensors to the vacuum cleaner would enable it to automatically adjust its cleaning mode based on the type of flooring it encounters, such as hardwood, carpet, or tiles. This would improve the overall cleaning efficiency and reduce the risk of damage to the flooring.",
    "Developing a modular design: Creating a modular design for the vacuum cleaner would allow users to customize their cleaning experience by swapping out different attachments and accessories as needed. This could include tools for cleaning upholstery, hard-to-reach areas, or specialized features for pet hair.",
    "Enhancing suction power: Improving the vacuum cleaner's suction power would make it more effective at removing dirt, debris, and allergens from various surfaces. This could be achieved through the use of more powerful motors or innovative filtration systems.",
    "Incorporating voice control: Adding voice control capabilities to the vacuum cleaner would allow users to operate it hands-free, using natural language commands to start, stop, and adjust the cleaning process. This would make the vacuum cleaner more user-friendly and convenient to use.",
    "Designing a portable charging station: Creating a portable charging station for the vacuum cleaner would allow users to recharge it on-the-go, without the need for a power outlet. This would be particularly useful for those who frequently clean large areas or need to move the vacuum cleaner between different rooms."
