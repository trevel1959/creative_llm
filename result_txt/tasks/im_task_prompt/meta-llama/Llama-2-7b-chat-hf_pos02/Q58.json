    "Smart Hair Dryer: Create a hair dryer that can detect the user's hair type, temperature, and humidity levels to provide personalized drying experiences. The smart hair dryer could also include features like adjustable heat and speed settings, a cool shot button, and a diffuser attachment for different styling options. Additionally, it could be equipped with Bluetooth connectivity for remote control and smartphone app integration, allowing users to customize their drying experience and track their styling habits.",
    "Air-Puff Hair Dryer: Design a hair dryer that uses air-puff technology to dry hair more efficiently and gently. The air-puff system would use a series of small air vents to blow air onto the hair, rather than a traditional hot air nozzle. This would reduce the risk of damage to the hair and scalp, while also providing a more comfortable and convenient drying experience. The air-puff technology could also be adjusted to provide different airflow patterns, such as a gentle pulse for delicate hair or a more intense stream for faster drying.",
    "360-Degree Hair Dryer: Create a hair dryer that has a rotating nozzle, allowing users to dry their hair from all angles. This would provide a more even and efficient drying experience, as well as reduce the risk of hot spots and damage to the hair. The rotating nozzle could be powered by a motor or through the use of a magnetic field, depending on the design. Additionally, the 360-degree hair dryer could include features like a built-in diffuser and cool shot button, as well as adjustable heat and speed settings.",
    "Portable Hair Dryer: Design a compact and lightweight hair dryer that can be easily taken on the go. The portable hair dryer could be powered by a rechargeable battery, making it perfect for use at home, in the salon, or while traveling. The design could include a foldable handle and a compact body, allowing it to be easily stored in a bag or carry-on luggage. Additionally, the portable hair dryer could include features like a built-in diffuser and cool shot button, as well as adjustable heat and speed settings.",
