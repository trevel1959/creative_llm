    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam or ultrasonic technology to clean the juicer's components after use. This would minimize the hassle of manual cleaning, making the juicer more user-friendly and encouraging more frequent use. Users could simply add water and a cleaning solution, press a button, and let the juicer do the work.",
    "**Modular Design for Versatility**: Create a modular juicer system where users can swap out different components for various juicing methods. For example, users could easily switch between a cold press juicer, a citrus juicer, or a blender attachment, depending on their needs. This would save space and money, allowing for a more versatile kitchen appliance.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide and Display**: Incorporate a touchscreen display that provides step-by-step juicing guides and recipes directly on the juicer. Users can select the type of juice they want to make, and the juicer will automatically adjust its settings for optimal extraction. This feature could also include videos or animations for visual learners.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Technology**: Design the juicer with energy-efficient components, such as a low-power motor and eco-friendly materials. Include a solar-powered option or a rechargeable battery feature for users who want to juice on the go, making it an environmentally friendly choice that aligns with sustainable living practices.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Attachment**: Add an attachment that allows users to infuse their juices with herbs, spices, or other flavors while juicing. This could involve a separate chamber where ingredients like mint, ginger, or citrus peels can be added, enhancing the flavor profile of the juice without the need for additional blending or steeping."
