    "**Integrated Measuring Guide**: Incorporate a measuring guide along the blade or handle of the scissors. This guide could feature both metric and imperial measurements, allowing users to easily measure and cut materials to specific lengths without needing a separate ruler. This feature would be especially useful for crafters, seamstresses, and DIY enthusiasts.",
    "**Safety Lock and Blade Guard**: Develop a safety mechanism that includes a lock feature to keep the scissors closed when not in use, preventing accidental cuts. Additionally, a retractable blade guard could be integrated that covers the blades when the scissors are not in use, making them safer to store and handle, especially around children.",
    "**Multi-functional Scissors**: Create a pair of scissors that can switch between different cutting modes. For instance, one mode could be for cutting paper, while another could be for fabric, and a third for tougher materials like cardboard. This could be achieved through interchangeable blades or adjustable tension settings that adapt to the material being cut.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Digital Display**: Incorporate a small digital display on the scissors that provides useful information, such as the angle of the cut, the type of material being cut, and even a timer for tasks that require precision cutting. This smart feature could also connect to an app that tracks cutting patterns and suggests optimal cutting techniques for different projects.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Recyclable Design**: Focus on creating scissors from sustainable materials, such as recycled metals and biodegradable plastics. Additionally, design the scissors to be easily disassembled for recycling purposes. This would not only reduce environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers looking for sustainable office and craft supplies."
