    "**Illuminated Mural**: I would create a large-scale, interactive mural on the exterior of my house using fiber optics, LED lights, and projection mapping technology. The mural would be a constantly evolving, immersive experience that changes colors, patterns, and shapes based on the time of day, weather, and even the viewer's emotions. The lights would be programmed to respond to sound waves, creating a dynamic, three-dimensional effect that engages the senses.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Patterns**: Without paint, I would focus on using natural materials to create intricate patterns and designs on my house's facade. I would collect and arrange various textures like wood, stone, and woven fibers to create a visually striking, organic appearance. The patterns would be inspired by nature, with elements like leaves, flowers, and branches incorporated into the design.",
    "**Kinetic Sculpture**: I would design a kinetic sculpture that incorporates moving parts, mirrors, and prisms to create a dynamic, ever-changing visual effect. The sculpture would be mounted on the exterior of my house, using a combination of motors, gears, and sensors to create a mesmerizing display of light, color, and movement.",
    "**Living Wall**: I would create a living wall on the exterior of my house using a combination of plants, vines, and other organic materials. The wall would be designed to be self-sustaining, with a built-in irrigation system and nutrient-rich soil. As the plants grow and change, the wall would become a constantly evolving work of art that responds to the natural environment.",
    "**Shadow Play**: I would design a system that uses carefully placed objects, such as mirrors, prisms, and reflective surfaces, to create a dynamic display of shadows on the exterior of my house. The shadows would be manipulated to create intricate patterns, shapes, and designs that change as the sun moves across the sky. The effect would be both ephemeral and captivating, inviting viewers to engage with the ever-changing display."
