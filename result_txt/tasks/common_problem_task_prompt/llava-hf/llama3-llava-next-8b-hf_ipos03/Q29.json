    "Limited Visibility: The water at great depths can be murky and dark, making it difficult to see and navigate. The team must use specialized equipment, such as underwater lights and sonar, to navigate and explore the deep sea.",
    "Oxygen Supply: Diving to great depths requires a lot of oxygen. The team must have a reliable supply of oxygen and be able to manage it efficiently to avoid running out.",
    "Communication: Communication can be difficult underwater due to the pressure on the ears and the lack of sound waves. The team must use specialized equipment, such as underwater communication devices, to maintain communication.",
    "Health Risks: Diving to great depths can cause decompression sickness, also known as \"the bends,\" which can be painful and potentially life-threatening. The team must be aware of the risks and take precautions, such as slowly returning to the surface.",
    "Environmental Impact: Deep-sea exploration can have a negative impact on the environment, such as disturbing marine life and damaging underwater habitats. The team must be mindful of their actions and take steps to minimize their impact."
