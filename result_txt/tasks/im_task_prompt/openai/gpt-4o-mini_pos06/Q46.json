    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handles**: Create scissors with adjustable handles that can adapt to the user's grip size. The handles could be made of a flexible material that molds to the user's hand shape, reducing strain and improving comfort during extended use. This would be especially beneficial for individuals with arthritis or other hand mobility issues.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade Tips for Material Types**: Develop scissors with interchangeable blade tips that are color-coded for different materials (e.g., fabric, paper, plastic). Each blade tip could be designed to optimize cutting efficiency for specific materials, helping users select the right tool for the job quickly.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Innovate scissors with a self-sharpening mechanism that utilizes a small grinding stone or ceramic blade embedded in the handle. Each time the scissors are closed, the blades would sharpen themselves, ensuring they remain effective without the need for manual sharpening, which is often neglected.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors with Attachments**: Design a modular scissor system that allows users to attach different tools, such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, or ruler, to the handle. This would transform the scissors into a versatile multi-tool, making them ideal for outdoor activities, DIY projects, or crafting.",
    "**Safety Scissors with Smart Locking Mechanism**: Create a pair of scissors that automatically locks the blades when not in use, preventing accidental cuts. The lock could be disengaged with a simple button press, and the scissors would also feature a safety guard that protects the userâ€™s fingers during storage."
