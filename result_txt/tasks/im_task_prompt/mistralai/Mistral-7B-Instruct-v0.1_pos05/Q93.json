    "\"You could create a smart bowling ball that tracks the speed, spin, and trajectory of each roll to provide real-time feedback to the bowler. This could help them improve their technique and increase their chances of getting a strike.\"",
    "\"Another idea is to design a bowling ball that changes color or texture based on the lane conditions. This could provide a visual cue to the bowler, helping them adjust their approach and make better decisions about their roll.\"",
    "\"You could also develop a bowling ball that has built-in sensors that track the weight and speed of the ball as it is thrown. This information could be used to create a personalized training program for the bowler, helping them improve their technique and increase their overall performance.\"",
    "\"Another interesting idea is to design a bowling ball that has a built-in GPS tracker. This could allow the bowler to track their progress over time, see how far they've come, and identify areas where they need to improve.\"",
    "\"Finally, you could create a bowling ball that is designed to be environmentally friendly. This could be made from recycled materials and have a special coating that reduces friction and makes it easier to roll. This would not only be good for the environment, but it could also help the bowler improve their technique and get more strikes.\""
