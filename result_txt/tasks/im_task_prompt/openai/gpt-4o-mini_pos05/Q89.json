    "**Interchangeable Plates for Diverse Cooking**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create various types of waffles, such as Belgian, American, or even dessert-style (like brownie waffles). The plates could also include shapes like hearts, stars, or seasonal themes (pumpkins for Halloween), encouraging creativity and making it more fun for families.",
    "**Built-in Topping Dispenser**: Integrate a topping dispenser into the waffle iron that allows users to add ingredients like chocolate chips, fruits, or nuts directly into the batter while it cooks. This would create deliciously infused waffles without the mess of adding toppings afterward. The dispenser could have multiple compartments for different toppings and allow for customization.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism using steam technology. After use, the waffle iron could generate steam to loosen any stuck batter, followed by a gentle cleaning cycle that would make maintenance easier. This would save time and effort for users, ensuring that the appliance remains hygienic and ready for the next use.",
    "**Temperature Control and Customization**: Implement a digital display that allows users to set specific temperature levels for different types of batters, ensuring perfect cooking results every time. A dial or touch interface could allow for adjustments, catering to personal preferences for crispiness and browning.",
    "**Portable and Compact Design**: Create a compact, portable waffle iron that can be easily stored or taken on trips. This could include a collapsible design or a foldable handle for easy transport. The portability would appeal to college students, campers, or anyone with limited kitchen space who still wants to enjoy homemade waffles."
