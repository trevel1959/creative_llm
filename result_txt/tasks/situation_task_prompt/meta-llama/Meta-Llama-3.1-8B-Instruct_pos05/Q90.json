    "**Cloud Harvester**: Develop a network of drones that can fly into clouds and collect water vapor. The drones would be equipped with a specialized membrane that can condense the water vapor into liquid water, which would then be stored in a container for collection.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG)**: Create a large, dome-shaped structure that can be placed in a dry area. The AWG would use a combination of heat, humidity, and air flow to extract water from the air, which would then be collected and stored in a reservoir.",
    "**Rainwater Collection System with AI-powered Sensors**: Design a network of sensors that can detect even the slightest hint of precipitation. These sensors would trigger a system of tubes and channels that would collect and store rainwater in a large reservoir. The AI-powered sensors would also help to predict when and where rain is most likely to occur, allowing for more efficient collection.",
    "**Water-attracting Membrane**: Develop a membrane that can attract and collect water molecules from the air, even in dry conditions. This membrane would be placed in a large container and would use a combination of heat and electricity to attract the water molecules, which would then be collected and stored.",
    "**Fog Collector**: Create a system of vertical surfaces or mesh panels that can collect fog droplets from the air. The droplets would be funneled into a collection system, where they would be stored in a reservoir for later use. This system could be used in coastal areas where fog is a regular occurrence.
