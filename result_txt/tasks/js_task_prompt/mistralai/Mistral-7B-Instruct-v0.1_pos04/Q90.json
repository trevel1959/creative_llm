    "Increase the lifespan: One of the most significant changes I would make is to increase the human lifespan. I would redesign the body to be able to function optimally for much longer periods. This could be achieved by creating a more efficient immune system, improving cellular regeneration, and enhancing overall metabolism.",
    "Improve cognitive abilities: I would redesign the brain to be more efficient and effective in processing information. This could include increasing the number of neurons, improving the connections between them, and enhancing the brain's ability to retain and recall information.",
    "Create superhuman strength: I would redesign the muscular system to be much stronger and more durable. This could be achieved by increasing the size and density of muscle fibers, as well as enhancing the nervous system's ability to control and coordinate muscle movements.",
    "Enhance sensory abilities: I would redesign the sensory system to be more sensitive and responsive. This could include improving the number and sensitivity of sensory receptors, as well as enhancing the brain's ability to interpret and process sensory information.",
    "Create a more efficient respiratory system: I would redesign the respiratory system to be more efficient and effective at extracting oxygen from the air. This could be achieved by increasing the surface area of the lungs, improving the flow of air through the bronchi and alveoli, and enhancing the ability of the lungs to exchange gases with the bloodstream."
