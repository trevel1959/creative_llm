    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: One of the most significant environmental impacts of a wedding is the transportation of guests to the venue. To minimize this impact, consider organizing shuttle services powered by renewable energy sources such as electric or biodiesel buses. Alternatively, encourage guests to carpool, bike, or walk by providing incentives like discounts on tickets or offering a valet service for those who arrive by car. ",
    "**Local and Seasonal Sourcing**: The food served at your wedding can have a considerable carbon footprint due to the transportation of ingredients. Opt for local, seasonal produce that requires less travel. Partner with local farmers and caterers who specialize in sustainable practices. This also supports the local economy and provides fresher, often more flavorful food.",
    "**Sustainable Decorations**: Instead of using single-use items like balloons or plastic tableware, opt for decorations made from natural materials like bamboo, wood, or recycled paper. You could even use flowers and plants sourced from a local greenhouse. For example, consider creating a floral archway or a backdrop using sustainably grown trees or reclaimed wood.",
    "**Digital Invitations and Signage**: Traditional paper invitations and printed signs can contribute significantly to waste. Send out digital invitations via email or a dedicated wedding website. For signage, consider using chalkboards or repurposed wood that can be reused or recycled after the event.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Lighting and Power**: Use LED lights for your lighting needs as they consume much less energy than traditional bulbs. Consider incorporating solar-powered lights or lanterns. Additionally, you can arrange for a solar-powered generator to provide electricity for your event, reducing reliance on fossil fuels."
