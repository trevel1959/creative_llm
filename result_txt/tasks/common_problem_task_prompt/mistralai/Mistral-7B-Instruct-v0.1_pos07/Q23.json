    "Creating a virtual town hall: To get the public's opinion on the new government policy, we can create a virtual town hall where people can share their thoughts, ask questions, and provide feedback. This will help build trust and transparency in the government's decision-making process.",
    "Gamifying the policy implementation: We can create a game that educates people about the new policy and encourages them to participate in its implementation. The game can have rewards and challenges that motivate people to take action and contribute to the policy's success.",
