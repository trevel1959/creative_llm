    "The Day Children Ruled the World: In a world where children rule, what would a typical day be like for a child? How might they structure their schooling and learning? How would they balance play and leisure time with more serious pursuits? Furthermore, how would the power structure of society change under the rule of children, and what impact might that have on relationships between adults and children?",
    "The Day Children Ruled the World: Children may not be the first person individuals picture when they imagine the people in power. Still, this prompt encourages readers to consider what a world in which children rule might look like. You may envision a world in which they are in charge of major political and social decision-making. Alternatively, you could imagine a world where children have more of a voice than they currently do, but are not strictly in charge. Some challenges that could arise in such a world might include children being too young to make certain types of decisions or being unaccustomed to having to make them at all. But childrenâ€™s ability to think differently than adults could also lead to creative solutions to challenges and a more inclusive perspective on decision-making.",
