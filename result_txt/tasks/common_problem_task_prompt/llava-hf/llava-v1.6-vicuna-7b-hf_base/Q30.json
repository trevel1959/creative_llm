    "Technical limitations: Another potential problem is the technical limitations of the platform or devices that the app will be running on. This could include limited processing power, memory, or screen size, which could limit the app's functionality or user experience.",
    "Competition: A third potential problem is competition. There are many other mobile apps already on the market, and it can be difficult to stand out and gain users. Additionally, there may be competition from other apps that offer similar features or services.",
    "User feedback: Another potential problem is user feedback. It is important to gather feedback from users to improve the app, but it can be difficult to get people to download and use the app in the first place. Additionally, users may provide negative feedback or complaints that could be difficult to address.",
    "Privacy and security: A fifth potential problem is privacy and security. Mobile apps handle a lot of sensitive user data, and it is important to ensure that this data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse. However, it can be difficult to implement strong security measures while also making the app user-friendly.",
    "Maintenance and updates: A sixth potential problem is maintenance and updates. Once the app is released, it will need to be maintained and updated over time to fix bugs, add new features, or respond to changes in the market. This can be time-consuming and expensive, and it can be difficult to balance the need for ongoing maintenance with the need to release new features."
