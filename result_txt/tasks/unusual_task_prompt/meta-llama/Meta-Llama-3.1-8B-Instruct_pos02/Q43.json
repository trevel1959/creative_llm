    "**Smart Bike Helmet with Integrated Navigation and Safety Features**: Design a smart bike helmet that incorporates a GPS navigation system, crash detection, and emergency alert features. The helmet would have a built-in microphone and speaker, allowing riders to communicate with emergency services or loved ones in case of an accident. The navigation system would provide turn-by-turn directions, and the crash detection feature would automatically alert emergency services if the rider is involved in a collision.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bike-Sharing System with AI-Powered Bike Matching**: Develop a bike-sharing system that uses AI to match riders with available bikes based on their preferences, riding style, and bike availability. The system would also incorporate an electric assist feature, allowing riders to easily navigate hilly or long routes. To promote sustainability, the bikes would be designed with eco-friendly materials and would have a built-in recycling program for old bikes.",
    "**Bike-Based Adventure Platform with Social Sharing and Rewards**: Create a platform that connects riders with local bike tour operators and allows them to book guided tours and share their experiences on social media. The platform would also offer rewards and badges for completing specific routes, achieving certain milestones, or participating in bike-related challenges. This would encourage riders to explore new areas, try new routes, and engage with the local cycling community.",
    "**Accessible Bike Design for People with Disabilities**: Design a line of accessible bikes that cater to riders with disabilities, such as wheelchair users, amputees, or individuals with mobility impairments. The bikes would feature adjustable seating, adaptive handlebars, and custom pedals to accommodate different abilities. The design would prioritize comfort, safety, and ease of use, making cycling more inclusive and accessible for everyone.",
    "**Bike-Based Food Delivery System with Integrated Meal Planning**: Develop a bike-based food delivery system that integrates with meal planning and grocery shopping apps. Riders would use specially designed bikes with insulated compartments to transport meals, and the app would suggest recipes, ingredients, and meal planning based on the rider's dietary preferences and schedule. This would promote healthy eating, reduce food waste, and support local restaurants and food vendors. "
