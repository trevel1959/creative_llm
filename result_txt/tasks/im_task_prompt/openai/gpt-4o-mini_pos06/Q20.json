    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Design a detachable flavor infusion chamber that allows users to add spices, herbs, or flavor extracts directly into the brewing process. This chamber would steep the added ingredients along with the coffee grounds, creating unique flavors. For instance, users could add cinnamon sticks, vanilla beans, or even citrus peels for a custom brew.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high-temperature water to sanitize the internal components of the coffee maker. This could be activated through a button or scheduled to run automatically after a certain number of brews. The self-cleaning process would help maintain the machine's longevity and ensure the best flavor without manual scrubbing.",
    "**Adjustable Brew Temperature and Time**: Create a coffee maker with a digital interface that allows users to adjust the brewing temperature and time based on their coffee type. Different beans and roast levels can benefit from specific brewing temperatures and times, so this feature would enable users to achieve the optimal flavor profile for their favorite coffee.",
    "**Integrated Grinder with Grind Settings**: Design a coffee maker that includes a built-in grinder with adjustable grind settings. Users could choose from coarse to fine grinds, depending on their brewing method (e.g., French press, espresso, drip). This all-in-one solution would ensure that users have fresh coffee grounds and eliminate the need for a separate grinder.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Capsule System**: For single-serve coffee makers, develop a system that uses biodegradable or reusable coffee capsules. Users could fill these capsules with their favorite ground coffee and brew without generating plastic waste. Additionally, a composting feature could be integrated to allow users to dispose of used grounds sustainably."
