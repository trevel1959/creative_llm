    "Improved Respiratory System: I would redesign the human respiratory system to be more efficient and adaptable to different environments. I would increase the number of alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs to allow for more efficient gas exchange, and add tiny hair-like structures called cilia to help remove dust and other particles from the lungs. I would also create a system of internal fans to help move air through the lungs, improving oxygenation and reducing the risk of respiratory infections. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: I would redesign the human sensory system to provide a wider range of sensory experiences. I would add more sensitive sensory receptors to the skin, eyes, ears, and nose, allowing for greater sensitivity to touch, sight, sound, and smell. I would also create a system of internal sensors that could detect changes in the body's internal environment, such as changes in blood sugar levels or hormone levels. This would allow for more accurate and timely detection of health problems. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Advanced Circulatory System: I would redesign the human circulatory system to be more efficient and adaptable to different environments. I would create a system of internal pumps that could adjust blood pressure and flow rate based on the body's needs, improving oxygenation and nutrient delivery to cells throughout the body. I would also add additional blood vessels to the brain and other vital organs to ensure that these areas receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Improved Immune System: I would redesign the human immune system to be more effective at detecting and eliminating pathogens. I would add more sophisticated sensors to the immune system, such as RNA and DNA sensors, to detect and respond to a wider range of pathogens. I would also create a system of immune cells that could target and destroy specific types of pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without harming healthy cells. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Advanced Musculoskeletal System: I would redesign the human musculoske"
