    "**Eco-Friendly City**: Design a futuristic city that utilizes sustainable energy sources, green architecture, and innovative waste management systems. The city would be powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power. Buildings would be designed with green roofs, walls, and windows to minimize energy consumption and maximize natural light. The city would also have a closed-loop waste management system, where waste is converted into energy, compost, or recycled materials.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop a pair of smart contact lenses that can monitor vital signs, track glucose levels, and provide augmented reality displays. The lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors that can detect changes in blood sugar levels, heart rate, and blood pressure. They would also have a micro-projector that can display virtual information, such as text messages, emails, or navigation directions, directly onto the wearer's field of vision.",
    "**Virtual Reality Travel Experience**: Create a VR travel experience that allows users to explore exotic destinations from the comfort of their own homes. The VR system would use advanced algorithms to generate realistic environments, complete with detailed textures, lighting, and sound effects. Users could explore ancient ruins, visit distant planets, or experience the thrill of skydiving without ever leaving their living room.",
    "**Personalized Nutrition**: Develop a system that uses AI-powered analysis of an individual's genetic profile, dietary preferences, and lifestyle to create personalized nutrition plans. The system would take into account factors such as food allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities, as well as the user's nutritional goals and preferences. It would then provide a tailored diet plan, complete with recipes, meal suggestions, and shopping lists.",
    "**Intelligent Home Automation**: Design a smart home system that can learn and adapt to the user's habits and preferences over time. The system would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's behavior, preferences, and environmental conditions to optimize energy consumption, lighting, temperature, and security settings. It would also integrate with various smart devices, such as thermostats, lights, and security cameras, to create a seamless and automated home experience."
