    "**The Galactic Solar System**: Imagine the Sun at the center of an expansive galactic system, with planets orbiting in spiral arms, akin to the Milky Way's structure. The Earth-like planets would have unique atmospheres, with varying levels of oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases, allowing for diverse ecosystems. Smaller, rocky worlds would be abundant, while larger gas giants would be found near the outer reaches, providing protection from cosmic radiation. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**The Time Travel Solar System**: Each planet represents a different era in time, starting from the dawn of life on Earth up to the future where humans have colonized space. This system would allow for interplanetary \"travels\" through time, enabling exploration of historical events or future advancements. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**The Multiverse Solar System**: Each planet represents a parallel universe with its own set of physical laws and realities. For example, one planet might follow the rules of quantum mechanics, while another operates under the principles of general relativity. This would provide a vast playground for exploring different physics theories. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**The Digital Solar System**: Instead of traditional celestial bodies, this system consists of interconnected digital nodes that represent data points, algorithms, and information flows. Each node would interact with others based on complex mathematical functions, creating a dynamic, self-evolving network that mirrors the digital world we live in. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**The Retrograde Solar System**: In this system, all planets orbit the Sun in reverse, creating a visually stunning and scientifically intriguing configuration. This would challenge our current understanding of celestial mechanics and open up new possibilities for theoretical physics research. Confidence Score: 0.8"
