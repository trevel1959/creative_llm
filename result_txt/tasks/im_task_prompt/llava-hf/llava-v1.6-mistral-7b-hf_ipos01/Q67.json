    "**Color Palette Integration**: The paintbrush could be connected to a digital color palette that allows the artist to mix and test colors on the screen before applying them to the canvas. This would streamline the painting process and reduce the need for physical palettes.",
    "**Motion Tracking**: The paintbrush could be fitted with motion tracking technology that records the artist's brush strokes and movements. This data could be used to create digital artworks or to enhance the painting experience by providing instant feedback on the artist's technique.",
    "**Interactive Canvas**: The paintbrush could be used in conjunction with an interactive canvas that responds to the artist's touch. The canvas could display virtual paint strokes and allow the artist to layer colors and experiment with different brush types.",
    "**Augmented Reality Painting**: The paintbrush could be integrated with augmented reality technology, allowing the artist to paint on a digital canvas that overlays the physical canvas. This would enable the artist to see their work in progress and make adjustments in real-time.",
    "**Smart Cleaning**: The paintbrush could be designed with self-cleaning bristles that remove paint residue and maintain the brush's performance. This would save time and effort for the artist, allowing them to focus on their work."
