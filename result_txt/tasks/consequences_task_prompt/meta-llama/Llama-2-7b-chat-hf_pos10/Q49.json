    "A new form of communication would emerge: With no shared memories, people would have to find new ways to communicate and connect with each other. A new language, based on emotions and sensations, would emerge, allowing people to express themselves in a more primal and intuitive way.",
    "A new form of governance would emerge: Without the ability to recall past events or decisions, a new form of governance based on instinct and intuition would emerge. Decisions would be made based on gut feelings and immediate impulses, leading to a more spontaneous and unpredictable form of leadership.",
    "A new form of art would emerge: Without memories, people would have to find new ways to express themselves creatively. A new form of art, based on emotions and sensations, would emerge, using colors, sounds, and textures to evoke feelings and experiences rather than representing memories or events."
