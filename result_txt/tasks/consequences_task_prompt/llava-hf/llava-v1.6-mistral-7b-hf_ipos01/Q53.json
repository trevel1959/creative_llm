    "Economic Impact: The plastics industry would be forced to adapt, leading to the development of new biodegradable materials that could be more sustainable and environmentally friendly. This could create new jobs in research, development, and production of these materials.",
    "Consumer Behavior: With the knowledge that plastic would biodegrade quickly, consumers would be more likely to use disposable products without fear of contributing to pollution. This could lead to a shift in consumer behavior towards more sustainable products.",
    "Public Health: The reduction of plastic waste would also have positive effects on public health, as plastic pollution can lead to the spread of harmful chemicals and toxins in the environment.",
    "Infrastructure: The shift to biodegradable plastics would require changes in waste management systems, as current systems are not designed to handle the rapid breakdown of plastic. This could lead to investments in new infrastructure and technologies.",
    "Innovation: The challenge of creating biodegradable plastics would spur innovation in materials science and engineering, leading to the development of new technologies and products that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly."
