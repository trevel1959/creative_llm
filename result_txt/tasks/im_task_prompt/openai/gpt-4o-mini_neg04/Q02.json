    "**Adaptive Gear System**: Develop a bicycle with an adaptive gear system that automatically adjusts the gear ratio based on the rider's speed, terrain, and pedaling efficiency. This could be achieved using sensors and AI algorithms that learn the rider's habits and optimize performance, making it easier to climb hills and maintain speed on flat surfaces without manual gear shifting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Hub**: Create a bicycle that features a built-in energy hub capable of harnessing kinetic energy generated during pedaling and braking. This energy could be stored in a battery and used to power accessories such as lights, GPS, and even charge a smartphone. Additionally, the bike could be equipped with solar panels on the frame to further enhance energy efficiency.",
    "**Modular Design**: Introduce a modular bicycle design that allows riders to easily swap out components like wheels, handlebars, and frames based on their preferences or riding conditions. For example, a rider could quickly switch to off-road tires for a mountain trail or change to a more aerodynamic frame for road racing. This customization would appeal to diverse cycling enthusiasts and enhance the bike's versatility.",
    "**Interactive Safety Lights**: Design a set of smart LED lights that attach to the front and rear of the bicycle and communicate with each other. These lights could flash or change colors based on the rider's speed, direction, and braking. For instance, if the cyclist slows down or stops, the lights could emit a bright warning signal to alert nearby vehicles. The lights could also sync with a smartphone app to provide alerts for potential hazards or accidents.",
    "**Integrated Weather Protection**: Develop a bicycle with an integrated weather protection system that deploys a lightweight, waterproof cover when it detects rain or adverse weather conditions. This cover could be stored within the frame and automatically unfurl to shield the rider and key components from the elements, ensuring a comfortable ride regardless of weather."
