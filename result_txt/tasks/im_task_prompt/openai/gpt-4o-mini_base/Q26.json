    "**Companion App for Waste Management**: Create a companion app that connects to the smart trash can. The app could track waste disposal habits, provide reminders for waste collection days, suggest ways to reduce waste, and offer tips for composting or recycling. Users could earn rewards for recycling correctly, gamifying the experience and encouraging better habits.",
    "**Odor Neutralization System**: Incorporate a built-in odor neutralization system that uses natural enzymes or activated charcoal filters to eliminate unpleasant smells from the trash can. This feature could include a scent diffuser that releases pleasant fragrances when the lid is opened, making it more appealing to use in kitchens and living spaces.",
    "**Compactable Trash Can**: Design a trash can that has a built-in compactor mechanism. Users can compress the waste down with a foot pedal, increasing the capacity of the can and reducing the frequency of emptying. This feature would be especially useful for households with limited space or those that generate a lot of waste.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags Dispenser**: Integrate a dispenser for biodegradable trash bags into the trash can design. This would encourage users to opt for environmentally friendly options rather than traditional plastic bags. The dispenser could be refilled with eco-friendly bags made from materials like cornstarch or recycled paper, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Display with Waste Facts**: Add an interactive touchscreen display to the trash can that educates users about waste statistics, the importance of recycling, and fun facts about waste management. Users could engage with the display to learn about the impact of their waste habits, with the potential for quizzes or challenges that promote eco-friendly practices."
