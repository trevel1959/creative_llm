    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Generation**: Equip bicycles with a small generator that harnesses energy from pedaling. This generator could charge a battery that powers integrated lights, GPS systems, and even a small USB port for charging devices. This feature not only enhances safety during night rides but also promotes sustainability by using human power to generate electricity.",
    "**Modular Storage System**: Design a bicycle with a modular storage system that allows riders to easily attach and detach different types of cargo containers based on their needs. These containers could include a grocery basket, a backpack, or even a small cooler for picnics. The containers could be lightweight, weatherproof, and designed to blend seamlessly with the bike's aesthetics.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Develop an adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts to different terrains. Using sensors to detect the surface type (pavement, gravel, mud), the bike could alter the stiffness and responsiveness of the suspension in real-time. This would enhance comfort and stability, making it easier to ride over varied surfaces without sacrificing performance.",
    "**Personalized Ergonomic Design**: Create a bicycle that can be customized to fit the rider's body perfectly. Using a 3D scanning app, users could scan their body measurements, and the bike would adjust its frame size, saddle height, and handlebar position accordingly. This would improve comfort and reduce the risk of injuries associated with poor posture during cycling.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker**: Incorporate a fitness tracking system into the bicycle that monitors metrics such as speed, distance, heart rate, and calories burned. This system could sync with a mobile app to provide detailed analytics, allowing riders to set goals, track their progress, and even compete with friends in challenges. The bike could also provide audio feedback to motivate users during their rides."
