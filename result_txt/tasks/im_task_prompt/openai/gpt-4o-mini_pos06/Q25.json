    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler**: Designed with sustainability in mind, this stapler would use biodegradable materials and be compatible with plant-based staples. It could also incorporate a mechanism to recycle used staples back into the system, reducing waste. An educational component could be included, teaching users about the importance of eco-friendly practices in the workplace.",
    "**Adjustable Stapling Pressure**: This innovative stapler would feature an adjustable pressure mechanism, allowing users to select how firmly the stapler should staple papers together. This would be particularly useful for delicate materials or for users who want to avoid damaging thinner sheets. The adjustable pressure could be indicated by a simple dial or slider on the side of the stapler.",
    "**Magnetic Stapler**: Incorporating magnets into the design, this stapler would allow users to attach it to metal surfaces like filing cabinets or whiteboards. This would eliminate the need for a dedicated workspace and make it easy to access the stapler when needed. The stapler could also have a built-in magnet to pick up dropped staples, preventing them from scattering across the floor.",
    "**Stapler with Built-in Paper Cutter**: This multifunctional stapler would include a small, retractable paper cutter on the side. Users could easily trim papers to the desired size before stapling them together. This would streamline the process of preparing documents, making it more efficient for users who often need to cut and staple materials.",
    "**Color-Coding Stapler**: To help with organization, this stapler could come with interchangeable colored covers or stickers that allow users to color-code their stapling tasks. For instance, blue for important documents, red for urgent matters, and green for drafts. This visual cue would make it easier to identify the purpose of stapled documents at a glance, improving workflow and organization."
