    "Vertical Farming: In a world without farming, vertical farming could be a sustainable solution for food production. This method involves growing crops on vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment, such as indoor greenhouses or tower gardens. By stacking crops vertically, more crops can be grown in a smaller area, maximizing space and minimizing land use. This method also allows for year-round production, as the controlled environment can be regulated for optimal growing conditions.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a method of food production that combines aquaculture (raising fish and other aquatic animals) with hydroponics (growing plants in water). In a world without farming, aquaponics could provide a sustainable source of protein and vegetables. By raising fish and other aquatic animals in tanks, the waste produced by these animals can be used as fertilizer for hydroponic plants, creating a closed-loop system that requires minimal land and water.",
    "Urban Foraging: In a world without farming, urban foraging could become a vital means of obtaining food. By foraging for wild edibles in urban areas, such as wild berries, herbs, and mushrooms, individuals can supplement their diet with a variety of nutritious foods. This method also helps to reduce waste and support local ecosystems by utilizing resources that would otherwise go unused.",
    "Community Gardens: Community gardens could become a central hub for food production in a world without farming. These gardens can be established in urban areas, providing a shared space for individuals to grow their own food. By pooling resources and knowledge, community members can work together to create a sustainable and productive food system. This method also promotes social connection and community building, as individuals work together towards a common goal.",
    "Solar Oven Cooking: In a world without farming, solar oven cooking could become a primary means of cooking food. By using the sun's energy to heat up food, individuals can cook a variety of meals without the need for electricity or gas. Solar ovens can be built using simple materials, such as cardboard boxes and aluminum foil, making them a sustainable and accessible option for food prepar"
