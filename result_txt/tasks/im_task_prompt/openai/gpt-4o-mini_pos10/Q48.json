    "**Piano with Built-in Augmented Reality (AR)**: Develop a piano that comes with an accompanying AR app. When a player looks at the piano keys through a smartphone or AR glasses, the app can overlay visual guides, such as finger positions and notes, directly onto the keys. This interactive learning tool could enhance practice sessions and make learning more engaging, especially for younger players.",
    "**Sustainable Piano Design**: Create a line of pianos made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled woods, along with eco-friendly finishes. This would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional piano manufacturing. The pianos could also incorporate solar panels to power built-in digital features.",
    "**Modular Piano System**: Design a modular piano that allows users to customize the instrument according to their preferences. Players could choose different types of keys (weighted, synth, etc.), add or remove octaves, and even select the sound profile (acoustic, electric, or digital). This flexibility would cater to a wider range of musical styles and personal preferences.",
    "**Piano with Integrated Composition Tools**: Equip the piano with built-in composition software that allows musicians to record, edit, and arrange their music directly on the instrument. The piano could feature a touchscreen interface that displays a digital sheet music editor, allowing players to compose in real-time, experiment with different arrangements, and save their work for future reference.",
    "**Interactive LED Key Lighting**: Introduce a piano with LED lights embedded in the keys that illuminate based on the notes being played or the songs being practiced. This feature could help beginners learn to play by visually guiding them through songs, while also providing a visually stunning performance element for advanced players during live shows."
