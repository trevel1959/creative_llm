    "The sun could provide a natural wake-up call: Without birds chirping, the sun's rays could be used to signal the start of a new day. People could set their schedules according to the sun's position in the sky, and the brightness of the sun could gradually increase to signal the time for waking up.",
    "Morning light therapy: In the absence of birds, light therapy could be used to simulate the natural light-dark cycle. Special lamps could be designed to mimic the sun's rays, providing a gentle and gradual increase in light intensity to signal the start of the day.",
    "Wind chimes: Wind chimes could be used as a substitute for birdsong. Different chimes could be tuned to different times of the day, providing a soothing and predictable wake-up call. The sound of the wind chimes could also be used to signal different times of the day, such as breakfast time or bedtime.",
    "Sonic wake-up calls: AI-generated sounds could be used to mimic the sounds of birds chirping. These sounds could be programmed to play at different times of the day, providing a personalized wake-up call. The AI could be trained on a dataset of bird sounds, allowing it to generate a wide range of chirping patterns and melodies.",
    "Artificial dawn: A new technology could be developed that simulates the natural process of dawn. This technology could use LED lights or other display screens to gradually brighten the room, mimicking the way the sky lightens in the morning. The display could also include animations or visual effects that mimic the movement of clouds, sunrises, or other natural phenomena. This technology could provide a more immersive and natural wake-up experience than traditional alarm clocks."
