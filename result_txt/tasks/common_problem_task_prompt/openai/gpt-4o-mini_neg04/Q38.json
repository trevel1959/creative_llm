    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster films often come with large budgets, but costs can quickly spiral out of control due to unforeseen circumstances, such as location changes, special effects adjustments, or extended shooting schedules. To combat this, the director should work closely with the production team to create a detailed budget and timeline, and include a contingency fund for unexpected expenses. Regular budget reviews can help keep spending in check.",
    "**Creative Differences**: The director may have a specific vision for the film, but producers, writers, and other stakeholders may have differing opinions. This can lead to tension on set and impact the overall quality of the film. To address this, the director should foster an environment of collaboration, encouraging everyone to share their ideas while remaining focused on the core vision of the project. Regular meetings can help align everyone’s expectations.",
    "**Weather and Location Issues**: Filming on location can be unpredictable, especially if weather conditions change suddenly. This can lead to delays and additional costs. To prepare for this, the director could create a flexible shooting schedule that allows for adjustments based on weather conditions. Additionally, having backup indoor locations or alternative shooting days can help minimize disruptions.",
    "**Health and Safety Concerns**: Ensuring the safety of the cast and crew is paramount, especially during stunts or complex scenes. Accidents can lead to injuries and halt production. The director should prioritize health and safety by hiring qualified stunt coordinators, conducting thorough safety briefings, and ensuring that all equipment is properly maintained. Regular health checks and adherence to safety protocols can further mitigate risks.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: With a blockbuster film, there is often immense pressure to meet audience expectations, especially if it’s part of a beloved franchise. This can lead to anxiety and creative compromises. To manage this, the director should focus on telling a compelling story that resonates with the audience while remaining true to their artistic vision. Engaging with test audiences during the editing process can provide valuable feedback without compromising the integrity of the film."
