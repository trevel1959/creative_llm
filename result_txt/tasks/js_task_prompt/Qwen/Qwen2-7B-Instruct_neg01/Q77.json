    "**The Galactic Serpent**: This new constellation could be shaped like a long, sinuous serpent that winds across the night sky, crossing various celestial zones from the southern to the northern hemisphere. The snake could be made up of stars of varying brightness and colors, creating a stunning visual effect. The snake could have a mythological theme, embodying creatures from different cultures and legends, such as dragons or serpents in different forms.",
    "**The Cosmic Tree of Life**: This constellation could resemble a massive tree with roots extending deep into the dark voids of space and branches reaching up to the heavens. The trunk would be a dense cluster of stars, while the branches would be thinner and more spread out, with leaves made up of smaller star systems. This constellation would symbolize growth, interconnectedness, and the eternal cycle of life and death.",
    "**The Celestial Clockwork**: Imagine a constellation that represents a complex mechanical clock, with gears, cogs, and springs intertwined. Each gear would be a star, while the cogs would represent planets orbiting around their suns. The springs could symbolize galaxies, and the entire structure could be rotating around a central hub representing the Big Bang. This design would emphasize the interconnected nature of the universe and its intricate workings.",
    "**The Stellar Symphony**: This constellation would be composed of stars arranged in a way that visually represents musical notes. Different notes could correspond to different types of stars, with higher-pitched tones for hotter stars and lower-pitched tones for cooler ones. The arrangement could depict a musical score, with stars acting as notes and constellations forming instruments or sections of an orchestra. This constellation would celebrate the harmony and beauty found within the cosmos.",
    "**The Galactic Map**: This constellation would be a map-like representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with stars symbolizing various celestial objects such as stars, nebulae, and black holes. The map could include a grid system to show distances and directions, with key landmarks marked as prominent stars or star clusters. This constellation would serve as a navigational tool for astronomers and stargazers, highlighting the structure and diversity of our own galaxy."
