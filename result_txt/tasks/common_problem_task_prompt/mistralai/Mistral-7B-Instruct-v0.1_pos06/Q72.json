    "Solar-powered farmhouse: A renewable energy power plant can be built on a farmhouse by installing solar panels on the roof. This can provide electricity to the farmhouse and any other buildings on the property. The excess energy generated can be fed back into the grid.",
    "Wind turbines: A wind farm can be built to generate renewable energy. This can consist of multiple wind turbines that are strategically placed to maximize the amount of wind energy that can be captured.",
    "Geothermal energy: A geothermal power plant can be built to harness the heat from the earth's core. This can be used to generate electricity by either using steam turbines or binary cycle power plants.",
    "Biomass energy: A biomass power plant can be built to convert organic matter such as wood, agricultural waste, and municipal waste into electricity. This can be done through a process called combustion or gasification.",
    "Hydroelectric power: A hydroelectric power plant can be built to generate electricity by harnessing the energy of moving water. This can be done through a dam or a run-of-river system."
