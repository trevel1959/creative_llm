    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular accessory system that allows users to customize their wheelchairs with various attachments based on their lifestyle needs. For example, users could add storage compartments, cup holders, or even a small solar panel for charging devices. This would enhance functionality while allowing for personal expression and adaptability to different environments.",
    "**Dynamic Suspension System**: Develop a dynamic suspension system that adjusts to the terrain in real-time. This would provide a smoother ride over bumps and uneven surfaces, reducing strain on the user and improving overall comfort. The system could utilize sensors to detect changes in terrain and adjust the suspension accordingly.",
    "**Wearable Health Monitoring**: Integrate wearable health monitoring technology into the wheelchair that tracks vital signs, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and posture. This data could be synced with a mobile app that alerts caregivers or medical professionals in case of any abnormalities. This feature would provide an added layer of safety and health management for users.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the wheelchair's design using sustainable and eco-friendly materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing wheelchairs but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the design could include energy-efficient components, such as LED lights and regenerative braking systems.",
    "**Interactive Entertainment Hub**: Transform the wheelchair into an interactive entertainment hub with a built-in touchscreen interface. This could provide access to games, streaming services, educational content, and social media. The interface could be voice-activated for ease of use, allowing users to stay connected and entertained while on the go."
