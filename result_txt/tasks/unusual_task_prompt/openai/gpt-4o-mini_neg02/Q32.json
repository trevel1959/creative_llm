    "**Pet Grooming Tool**: Beyond its intended use for human hair, a hairbrush can be an excellent grooming tool for pets. Its bristles can help detangle fur, remove loose hair, and distribute natural oils in a pet's coat. This is especially useful for long-haired breeds that require regular grooming to prevent mats.",
    "**Dusting Brush**: A hairbrush can serve as a makeshift duster for delicate items around the house. The soft bristles are perfect for dusting off knick-knacks, picture frames, and electronic devices without scratching or damaging surfaces. It can easily reach into crevices where dust tends to accumulate.",
    "**Art Tool**: Artists can use a hairbrush to create unique textures and patterns in their artwork. The bristles can be dipped in paint or ink and used to create abstract designs, or they can be employed for applying paint in a stippling technique. The varying thickness of the bristles allows for diverse artistic effects.",
    "**Sound Maker**: A hairbrush can be transformed into a percussion instrument. By tapping the handle against a hard surface or using the bristles to create rhythmic sounds, it can add an interesting layer to musical performances or even be used in casual jam sessions. This could be particularly fun for children or in a creative workshop.",
    "**Bookmark**: If you find yourself frequently losing bookmarks, a hairbrush can serve as a unique alternative. By placing the brush between the pages of a book, it can hold your place while adding a quirky touch to your reading experience. Plus, itâ€™s a great conversation starter!"
