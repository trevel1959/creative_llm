    "Use a traditional library system: In the absence of digital data, the most logical solution would be to use a traditional library system to store information. Books, manuscripts, and other physical documents could be used to store information. This method has been used for centuries and has proven to be effective in storing and preserving information.",
    "Use a DNA-based storage system: Another solution would be to use a DNA-based storage system. This system involves encoding digital data into DNA sequences, which can then be stored in test tubes or other containers. This method has the potential to store vast amounts of data in a small space, making it an ideal solution for storing information in the long term.",
    "Use a blockchain-based system: A blockchain-based system could also be used to store information. This system involves creating a decentralized database that is secured using cryptography. This method would provide a secure and reliable way to store information, even in the absence of digital data.",
    "Use a quantum computing system: A quantum computing system could be used to store information. This system uses quantum bits, or qubits, to store and process information. This method has the potential to store and process vast amounts of information at, making it an ideal solution for storing information in the future.",
    "Use a 3D printing-based system: A 3D printing-based system could be used to store information. This system involves creating physical objects using 3D printing technology. These objects could be used to store information, with each object representing a specific piece of data. This method would provide a unique and creative way to store information, making it an ideal solution for storing information in the future."
