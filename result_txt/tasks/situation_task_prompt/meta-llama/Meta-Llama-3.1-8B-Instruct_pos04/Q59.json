    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that extracts water vapor from the atmosphere and condenses it into liquid water, which can then be used to generate electricity through hydroelectric power or fuel cells. This process would provide a reliable source of energy while also addressing the issue of water scarcity.",
    "**Solar Windows**: Design and manufacture windows that can harness sunlight even on cloudy days. These windows would be coated with a special material that absorbs and converts sunlight into electricity, providing a sustainable source of energy for buildings.",
    "**Cloud-Hacking**: Develop a technology that can manipulate cloud formations to create clear patches or windows, allowing sunlight to pass through and reach the Earth's surface. This could be achieved through the use of advanced drones or satellite systems that can disperse cloud-seeding agents or alter atmospheric conditions.",
    "**Underwater Solar Farms**: Construct solar farms underwater, where sunlight can still penetrate the water surface. This would provide a constant source of energy, even on cloudy days, and could be connected to the global energy grid.",
    "**Artificial Skies**: Create a network of inflatable, transparent domes that can be deployed above cities or regions, providing a clear sky and allowing sunlight to reach the ground. These domes would be made of a durable, lightweight material and could be powered by wind or solar energy. </s>[INST] "
