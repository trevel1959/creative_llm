    "**Underwater Travel**: If planes are no longer an option, one could explore the use of submarines or high-tech underwater vehicles. These would enable travel across oceans by diving below the surface and using ocean currents for propulsion. Advanced navigation systems and life support equipment would be necessary for long-distance travel.",
    "**Human-Powered Airships**: Develop airships that could be manually steered, powered by human effort such as rowing or paddling, along with some wind assistance. These could potentially cross large bodies of water if combined with strategic planning around prevailing winds. They would also serve as a unique, eco-friendly mode of transport.",
    "**Space Elevator**: Imagine building a massive space elevator reaching from Earth's surface to geostationary orbit. Passengers could ride elevators up and down this structure, providing a fast and efficient way to travel between continents without the need for aircraft. This would require significant technological advancements in materials and construction methods.",
    "**Hyperloop Systems**: Utilize high-speed vacuum-sealed tubes to create a hyperloop system where pods could travel at supersonic speeds, bypassing the need for traditional air travel. This technology would revolutionize transportation, making it possible to travel across continents in a matter of hours.",
    "**Biological Transportation**: Develop a form of transportation based on biological principles, such as a giant, genetically engineered organism capable of moving across continents. For example, a large, energy-efficient plant or a bio-engineered insect could potentially carry humans over long distances, though this idea would face numerous ethical and practical challenges. "
