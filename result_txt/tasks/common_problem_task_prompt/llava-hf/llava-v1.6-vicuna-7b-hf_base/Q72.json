    "Environmental impact: Construction of the power plant may have negative impacts on local flora and fauna, and the power plant itself may emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Ensuring that proper mitigation measures are in place to minimize these environmental impacts is essential.",
    "Location: Finding an appropriate location for the power plant is critical for access to the resources needed to generate power. Factors like wind speed, solar irradiance, and terrain may play a role in the selection of a suitable site.",
    "Grid stability: Interconnecting the power plant to the existing electrical grid may pose challenges. Ensuring that the grid can handle the power generated and the additional demand the power plant may create is essential to avoid power outages or disruptions to the local power grid.",
    "Maintenance and operational costs: The cost of maintaining and operating the power plant will be a long-term concern. Ensuring that the power plant is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective to operate is crucial to its success.",
    "Security: Ensuring that the power plant and its infrastructure are secure from theft, vandalism, or other forms of unauthorized access is critical to the project's success and public safety."
