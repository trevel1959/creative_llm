    "**Impact on Earth's Climate:** The disappearance of the sun would immediately cause an extreme drop in global temperatures due to the absence of solar radiation. This could lead to significant climate changes, including ice ages in certain regions. However, as the Earth has stored heat from previous months' sunlight, there might still be some warmth available for several weeks before temperatures plummet.",
    "**Astronomical Changes:** Without the sun, Earth's orbit around it would cease, causing the planet to slow down or stop revolving around its axis. This could result in extreme seasonal variations and affect the distribution of daylight hours globally. The lack of gravitational pull from the sun could also alter Earth's rotational speed, potentially leading to tidal changes and impacts on ocean currents.",
    "**Life Support Systems Failure:** Most forms of life on Earth rely on solar energy for photosynthesis and thermal regulation. The sudden loss of sunlight would disrupt these processes, causing widespread crop failures and potential extinction of many plant and animal species. Humans would struggle without power generation methods that don't rely on solar energy, such as nuclear reactors or fossil fuels.",
    "**Psychological Impact:** The disappearance of the sun would have profound psychological effects on human society. It could lead to a global depression due to the lack of light, which is linked to mood and mental health. This could result in increased isolation, social unrest, and mental health issues across populations.",
    "**Technological Adaptations:** In response to the lack of sunlight, humanity might develop new technologies to maintain life support systems and attempt to restore sunlight. These could include large-scale artificial suns powered by fusion reactions, or the creation of mirrors in space to reflect sunlight back to Earth. This would require immense resources and advanced engineering capabilities."
