    "**Inadequate Sensory Input:** The ability to interpret different forms of sensory input is crucial for individuals with visual impairments. Developing an array of input methods—such as tactile, auditory, or even olfactory cues—can enhance the user experience by providing additional and complementary information.",
    "**Integration with Existing Devices:** To ensure seamless integration with other devices that the user might already own or use regularly, the assistive technology should support open protocols and be compatible with both mainstream and specialized devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, screen readers, canes with ultrasonic sensors).",
    "**Privacy and Security Concerns:** Ensuring that the personal data and information collected and processed by the assistive technology is secure and used responsibly is paramount. Implementing strong encryption, regular security updates, and providing clear information to users about how their data is protected can alleviate these concerns.",
    "**Technology Obsolescence:** As technology advances rapidly, the assistive technology should be designed with the potential for updates and upgrades to keep pace with advancements. This extends to compatibility with different operating systems, ensuring that the technology is future-proof and remains effective over time.",
    "**Ease of Use:** A cluttered or complicated interface can be intimidating for users, regardless of their level of experience. Simplifying the user interface through intuitive design and easy-to-understand instructions will make the technology more accessible to a broader range of individuals."
