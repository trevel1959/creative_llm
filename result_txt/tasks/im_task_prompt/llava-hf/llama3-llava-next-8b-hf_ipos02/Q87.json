    "Inflatable life-saving device: Develop an inflatable life-saving device that can be attached to the pool float, which would provide additional buoyancy and safety in case of an emergency.",
    "Energy-harvesting system: Equip the pool float with an energy-harvesting system that captures the kinetic energy generated by swimming and converts it into electricity. This can be used to power small electronic devices or to charge a battery.",
    "Floating yoga platform: Modify the pool float to include a non-slip surface for practicing yoga, providing a stable and buoyant platform for people to enjoy the benefits of yoga while being immersed in water.",
    "Underwater lighting system: Add an underwater lighting system to the pool float, allowing people to enjoy swimming and other water activities at night. The lighting system can be powered by solar or battery.",
    "Water quality monitoring system: Develop a water quality monitoring system that can be attached to the pool float, which would test the water for contaminants and provide real-time information about the water quality."
