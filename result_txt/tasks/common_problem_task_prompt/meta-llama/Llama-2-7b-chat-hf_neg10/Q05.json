    "Poor planning: Without a clear plan and design, the treehouse may not be built to code or meet safety standards, leading to potential hazards for the children using it.",
    "Inadequate materials: Using low-quality or unsuitable materials for the treehouse can result in a structure that is prone to decay or collapse, putting the children and the tree at risk.",
    "Structural instability: If the tree is not sturdy enough to support the weight of the treehouse, or if the structure is not properly secured, it may collapse, causing injury or damage.",
    "Unsafe conditions: If the treehouse is built too high or too close to power lines, it may pose a risk to the children playing in it.",
    "Inadequate ventilation: A treehouse without proper ventilation can lead to a stuffy and uncomfortable environment for the children, and may also create a fire hazard."
