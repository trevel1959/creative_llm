    "Develop a \"Virtual Reality Sensory Substitute\": Create a virtual reality headset that simulates the sensations of touch, sight, sound, taste, and smell. By immersing oneself in this virtual world, one could experience a range of sensations without actually feeling them physically. For example, the headset could generate a virtual sensation of touch by vibrating or tickling the user's skin, or it could create a virtual taste by spraying a specific scent into their mouth.",
    "\"Sensory Deprivation Tank\" for the Home: Design a portable, at-home sensory deprivation tank that blocks out all external stimuli, including light, sound, and touch. This tank would be equipped with a specialized filtration system that removes all sensory inputs, allowing the user to fully disconnect from the physical world. The user could then immerse themselves in a virtual world of their choice, such as a peaceful beach or a vibrant cityscape.",
    "\"Neural Interface Suit\": Develop a specialized suit that interfaces directly with the user's nervous system, allowing them to control their virtual environment with their thoughts. By using advanced brain-computer interfaces, the suit could translate the user's neural signals into digital commands, allowing them to manipulate objects and environments in a virtual world. This would allow the user to experience a range of sensations without actually feeling them physically.",
    "\"Sensory Substitution Gloves\": Create a pair of gloves that translate tactile sensations into visual or auditory cues. For example, the gloves could use tiny cameras and sensors to capture visual information from the user's fingertips, and then display this information on a virtual screen in front of the user. Similarly, the gloves could use bone-conducting speakers to transmit auditory cues to the user's fingertips, allowing them to \"feel\" sounds without actually hearing them.",
    "\"Augmented Reality Sensory Mask\": Develop a mask that overlays virtual sensations onto the user's real-world perceptions. The mask would use advanced augmented reality technology to superimpose virtual objects, textures, and sensations onto the user's field of view, allowing them to experience a range"
