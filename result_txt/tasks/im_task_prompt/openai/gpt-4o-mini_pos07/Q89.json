    "**Interchangeable Plates for Versatile Cooking**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable cooking plates that allow users to make not just waffles, but also pancakes, grilled sandwiches, and even brownies. These plates could be easily swapped out, and each would have its own unique design to create different shapes and textures. For instance, a plate with a heart-shaped design for romantic breakfasts or a plate with deep pockets for holding syrup better.",
    "**Built-in Flavor Infuser**: Introduce a built-in flavor infuser that allows users to add flavors directly into the batter as it cooks. This could work through a compartment that holds various flavor extracts (like vanilla, almond, or even fruit purees) which can be injected into the batter at the perfect moment during cooking. This would enable the creation of unique flavored waffles without needing to modify the batter recipe significantly.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Innovate a waffle iron that features self-cleaning technology, similar to self-cleaning ovens. After use, users could simply activate the self-cleaning mode, which would heat the plates to a high temperature to burn off any leftover batter or residue. This would save time and effort in cleaning, making the waffle-making experience more enjoyable.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Adjustable Thickness Settings**: Create a waffle iron that allows users to adjust the thickness of the waffles. This could be achieved through a simple dial or slider that raises or lowers the cooking plates. Users could choose between thin, crispy waffles or thick, fluffy ones depending on their preference, allowing for greater customization.",
    "**Multi-Functional Waffle Iron with Cooking Modes**: Design a waffle iron that features multiple cooking modes, such as \"crispy,\" \"fluffy,\" and \"savory.\" Each mode would adjust the temperature and cooking time accordingly. Additionally, the waffle iron could have a “keep warm” function that maintains the perfect temperature for serving without overcooking the waffles."
