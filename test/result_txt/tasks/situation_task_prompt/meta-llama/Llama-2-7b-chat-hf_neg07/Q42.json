    "Create a shelter: To start, I would use my resourcefulness and creativity to build a shelter using the materials available on the island. I would look for sturdy branches, leaves, and vines to construct a lean-to or a hut. I would also use rocks and sand to create a solid foundation and walls to protect me from the elements. Additionally, I would use coconuts or other natural materials to create a roof to keep out the rain and sun.",
    "Find food and water: To sustain myself, I would search for edible plants and fruits on the island. I would look for coconuts, breadfruit, and other tropical fruits that are abundant in the area. I would also search for fish and other seafood in the nearby waters. To purify water, I would use coconut husks or other natural materials to create a filter. I would also collect rainwater and store it in a safe place to drink.",
    "Start a fire: To keep warm and cook my food, I would use the resources available on the island to start a fire. I would gather dry leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials to create a fire pit. I would then use a magnifying glass or other reflective surface to focus the sun's rays and start a fire. Once the fire is lit, I would use it to cook my food and keep warm.",
    "Signal for help: To attract attention and signal for help, I would use the resources available on the island to create a signal fire or smoke signal during the day. I would also use a mirror or other reflective surface to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or boats. I would also use any available materials to create a makeshift flag or signal flag to wave on the beach or on a nearby hill.",
    "Create a fishing net: To catch fish and other seafood, I would use the resources available on the island to create a fishing net. I would gather vines, branches, and other materials to create a net that can be used to catch fish in the nearby waters. I would also use shells or other materials to create a weighted line to sink the net to the bottom of the ocean. With this net, I would be able to catch fish and other seafood to sustain myself while on the island."
