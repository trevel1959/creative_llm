    "**Incorporate Local and Seasonal Elements**: Instead of sourcing exotic flowers or exotic foods from afar, focus on using locally grown and seasonally available items. This not only supports local businesses but also reduces carbon emissions from transportation. You could hire a local farmer for your produce, use seasonal flowers that are native to your area, and serve dishes that utilize ingredients commonly found in your region.",
    "**Reduce Paper Usage**: Most weddings involve a lot of paper usage - invitations, menus, thank you cards, etc. Instead, you can create digital versions of these documents. For example, use an online platform to create personalized e-invitations. For the menu and other information, consider using digital tablets instead of paper cards at the venue.",
    "**Use Renewable Energy Sources**: If possible, choose a venue that runs on renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. Alternatively, you could arrange for a mobile solar power station to be used during the event. This helps reduce the carbon footprint significantly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Encourage guests to use public transport, carpool, or even cycle to the venue. Provide bike racks or designated areas for bicycles at the venue. For those who need to drive, offer incentives like discounted rates at green-certified hotels or car rental services that promote eco-friendly vehicles.",
    "**Zero-Waste Policy**: Implement a zero-waste policy by providing recycling bins, composting facilities, and reusable items like plates, cups, and cutlery. Use biodegradable or compostable materials where necessary. Consider having a food waste reduction program, where leftovers are donated to local charities or composted. This ensures minimal waste ends up in landfills."
