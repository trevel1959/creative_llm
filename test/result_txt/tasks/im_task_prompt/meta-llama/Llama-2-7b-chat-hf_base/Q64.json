    "Smartwatch Alarm System: Create a smartwatch that can detect when a person is in danger and alert their emergency contacts. The smartwatch can detect various signs of distress, such as a fall, an abnormal heart rate, or a sudden change in activity level. If an emergency occurs, the smartwatch can automatically send an alert to the person's emergency contacts, along with their location. This can be especially useful for seniors or people with mobility issues who may be more susceptible to accidents or injuries.",
    "Motion-Activated Alarm System: Design a motion-activated alarm system that can detect movement in a room or area and alert the occupants. The system can use a combination of sensors, such as infrared, microwave, or ultrasonic, to detect movement and trigger the alarm. This can be useful in homes, offices, or public spaces to provide an additional layer of security. The system can also be integrated with other safety features, such as cameras or emergency response systems, to provide a comprehensive security solution.",
    "Environmental Alarm System: Develop an environmental alarm system that can detect changes in temperature, humidity, or air quality and alert the occupants. The system can use sensors to monitor the environment and trigger an alarm if the conditions become hazardous. This can be useful in homes, offices, or industrial settings where environmental conditions can pose a risk to occupants' health and safety. The system can also be integrated with other safety features, such as ventilation systems or emergency response systems, to provide a comprehensive safety solution.",
    "Wearable Alarm System: Create a wearable alarm system that can be worn on the body, such as a bracelet or pendant. The system can detect when the wearer is in danger and alert their emergency contacts. The system can use a combination of sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer, or heart rate monitor, to detect signs of distress or danger. This can be useful for people who are at risk of injury or attack, such as joggers, hikers, or people who work in high-risk industries.",
    "Voice-Activated Alarm System: Design a voice-activated alarm system that can be controlled using voice commands. The system can detect voice commands and trigger an alarm in response."
