    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Instead of using a standard tennis ball as a pet toy, you can enhance it by cutting a small slit and inserting treats inside. This creates a puzzle for your pet, stimulating their mind and encouraging them to play and engage in problem-solving as they try to get the treats out.",
    "**Shoe Deodorizer**: Tennis balls can absorb moisture and odors, making them a great addition to your shoes. Simply place a couple of tennis balls inside your shoes overnight to help eliminate unpleasant smells and keep them fresh. The felt material of the ball also helps to absorb moisture that can lead to odor.",
    "**Wall Protector**: If you have a door that swings open and hits the wall, a tennis ball can serve as an effective wall protector. Cut a slit in the ball and attach it to the wall at the point where the door hits. This will cushion the impact and prevent damage to both the wall and the door.",
    "**Stress Relief Ball**: Instead of purchasing expensive stress balls, you can use a tennis ball as a stress-relief tool. Squeezing the ball can help release tension and anxiety. You can also place it in the freezer for a few minutes for a cool sensation that can provide additional relief.",
    "**Garden Plant Holder**: Tennis balls can be used in gardening to help stabilize young plants. Cut a slit in the tennis ball and place it around the base of the plant, burying it slightly in the soil. This will help hold the plant upright while it establishes roots, and as the plant grows, the ball will decompose and enrich the soil."
