    "Use clocks: While clocks and watches may be physical devices that measure time, there are other objects that can be used to keep track of time. For example, you could use the position of the sun or the stars to determine the time of day. You could also use the phases of the moon or the movement of the planets to determine the time of year.",
    "Use your senses: You could use your senses to determine the time of day. For example, you could use the position of the sun in the sky to determine the time of day. You could also use the position of the stars to determine the time of year.",
    "Use a calendar: You could use a calendar to keep track of time. You could use the position of the sun or the phases of the moon to determine the time of year, and then use the days and months on the calendar to determine the time of day.",
    "Use a sundial: You could use a sundial to keep track of time. Sundials are devices that use the position of the sun to determine the time of day. You could use a simple sundial or a more complex sundial to keep track of time.",
    "Use a chronometer: You could use a chronometer to keep track of time. Chronometers are devices that measure time intervals. You could use a simple chronometer or a more complex chronometer to keep track of time."
