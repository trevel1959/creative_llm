    "**Customizable Pillowcase Printing Service**: Offer a service where customers can upload their own designs or choose from a wide variety of patterns to print on a standard pillowcase. This would allow people to personalize their bedding according to their style or mood. You could partner with local artists to feature their work on these pillowcases as well, promoting creativity and local talent.",
    "**Pillowcase Reading Lamp**: Create a pillowcase that includes a built-in reading lamp, which would be powered by a USB port (for charging from a phone charger or laptop). This idea would be particularly useful for those who prefer reading in bed or for kids who need extra light without disturbing others in the room.",
    "**Hygiene-Promoting Pillowcase Liner**: Develop a pillowcase liner made of antimicrobial fabric that helps keep germs at bay. This product would be especially beneficial for those living in shared accommodations or dormitories, where cleanliness might be a concern.

    "**Interactive Pillowcase for Children**: Design a series of pillowcases with built-in sensors that can trigger interactive games when a child presses different areas of the pillowcase. For example, the pillowcase could tell a bedtime story, play soothing music, or guide a child through a mindfulness exercise when they touch specific spots. This would be ideal for helping children relax and fall asleep more easily."
