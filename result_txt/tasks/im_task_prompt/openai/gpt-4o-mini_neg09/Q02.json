    "**Modular Accessory System**: Design a modular accessory system that allows cyclists to easily attach or detach various components such as lights, speakers, or even a small cargo rack. Each accessory could be designed to click into place on a standardized mounting system, making it easy to customize the bike for different rides, whether it's commuting, touring, or off-road adventures.",
    "**Self-Inflating Tires**: Develop tires that have a built-in self-inflation mechanism that uses a small pump activated by the rotation of the wheel. This technology would keep tires at optimal pressure, enhancing performance and safety while reducing the risk of flats. Additionally, a pressure sensor could alert the rider if the tire pressure drops significantly, prompting maintenance before a ride.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging System**: Incorporate a solar panel system into the bike's frame or fenders to harness solar energy while riding. This energy could charge a battery that powers the bike's lights, GPS, or even small devices like a smartphone. This sustainable feature would appeal to eco-conscious riders and enhance the bike's functionality during long rides.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Create a smart suspension system that adjusts in real-time based on terrain and rider weight. Using sensors to detect bumps, inclines, and declines, the system could automatically soften or stiffen the suspension to provide a smoother ride. This would improve comfort and control, especially for mountain bikers or those navigating uneven city streets.",
    "**Anti-Theft Technology**: Develop a bicycle with built-in anti-theft features, such as a GPS tracker, alarm system, and immobilizer. The bike could be equipped with a lock that can only be unlocked via a smartphone app. In case of theft, the GPS could help locate the bike, while the alarm would deter potential thieves with loud sounds when tampered with."
