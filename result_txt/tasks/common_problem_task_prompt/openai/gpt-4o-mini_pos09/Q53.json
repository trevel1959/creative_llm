    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay unfolds, it's easy to introduce plot holes or inconsistencies that can confuse viewers. For example, if a character’s actions contradict their established personality or the timeline of events doesn’t add up, it can undermine the story. To avoid this, create a detailed outline before writing and ensure that each plot point logically follows from the previous one. Regularly revisit earlier scenes to maintain continuity.",
    "**Pacing Problems**: A screenplay can suffer from pacing issues, where scenes either drag on too long or rush through important moments. This can lead to a disjointed viewing experience. To address pacing, analyze each scene’s purpose and emotional weight. Use techniques such as building tension through shorter scenes leading up to climactic moments or allowing quieter scenes to breathe and develop character relationships.",
    "**Dialogue Realism**: Writing dialogue that feels authentic and natural can be challenging. Characters might sound too formal, unrealistic, or similar to one another, making it hard for audiences to connect. To enhance dialogue, listen to real conversations and take notes on speech patterns, slang, and interruptions. Aim for each character to have a unique voice that reflects their background, personality, and current emotional state.",
    "**Theme Clarity**: A screenplay may struggle with conveying its central theme, leading to an unclear message or conflicting ideas. This can confuse the audience about what the story is truly about. To solidify your theme, identify the core message you want to communicate and ensure that each scene and character decision aligns with this theme. Use motifs and symbols throughout the screenplay to reinforce the message subtly.",
    "**Audience Engagement**: Capturing and maintaining audience interest is crucial for a successful screenplay. If the story lacks stakes or emotional investment, viewers may lose interest. To keep the audience engaged, introduce compelling conflicts and challenges for the characters, and create moments of tension and release. Incorporate cliffhangers or surprising twists that keep viewers guessing and wanting to see what happens next."
