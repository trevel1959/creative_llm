    "Time constraints: Documentary filmmaking can be a time-consuming process, especially when working with multiple subjects or locations. Filmmakers may have to work within tight deadlines, which can be challenging and stressful.",
    "Access to subjects: Depending on the subject matter of the documentary, filmmakers may have difficulty gaining access to the people or places they need to film. This can be especially true if the subject is controversial or sensitive.",
    "Ethical considerations: Filmmakers must be aware of ethical considerations when making a documentary film. This includes obtaining informed consent from subjects, avoiding manipulation or deception, and respecting privacy and confidentiality.",
    "Distribution and marketing: Once the documentary is complete, filmmakers must find a way to distribute and market it to an audience. This can be difficult, especially if the film is not picked up by a traditional distributor or if it is not widely known."
