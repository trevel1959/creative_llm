    "**Art Installation**: You can create an art installation in a public space or gallery where people are invited to participate. The installation consists of a large tree with leaves that have been designed to never fall off. These leaves are made from materials like wood, metal, or durable plastics that don't decompose easily. As people interact with the installation, they can write their thoughts, wishes, or fears on pieces of paper and attach them to the leaves. This creates a living piece of art that grows with the community's contributions.",
