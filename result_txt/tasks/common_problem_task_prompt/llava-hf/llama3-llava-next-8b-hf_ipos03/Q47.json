    "Inexperience: Building a computer from scratch requires a certain level of technical knowledge and expertise. If the person building the computer is inexperienced or lacks the necessary skills, they may encounter problems such as incorrectly installing components, damaging parts, or not correctly configuring the system.",
    "Warranty and Support: When building a computer from scratch, it is important to ensure that all the components are under warranty and that there is support available in case of any issues. If a component fails or needs to be replaced, it is crucial to have a reliable source for support and warranty information.",
    "Overheating: One of the main concerns when building a computer is to prevent overheating. Overheating can cause damage to components, reduce performance, and even lead to a complete system failure. It is important to ensure that the computer has proper cooling mechanisms in place, such as a good quality CPU cooler, a well-ventilated case, and adequate airflow.",
    "Cable Management: Cable management is an important aspect of building a computer from scratch. Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered and messy appearance, but more importantly, it can also lead to overheating issues if cables are obstructing airflow. It is important to have a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing cable management system.",
    "Upgradability: When building a computer, it is important to consider how easily the system can be upgraded in the future. This includes the ability to replace or upgrade components such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage. A well-designed system should allow for easy upgrades to keep up with the latest technology and to extend the life of the computer."
