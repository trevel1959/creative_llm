    "**Themed Music Festival:** Create a unique theme for each year's festival that changes annually. For example, \"The Decade Showdown\" where bands perform songs from a specific decade. This not only keeps the lineup fresh but also provides a nostalgic experience for attendees, making each year's event distinct and exciting.",
    "**Virtual Reality Experience:** Integrate VR technology to offer an immersive concert experience for those who can't attend in person. Participants could wear VR headsets and interact with the virtual environment, feeling like they're at the festival stage. This adds a new dimension to the traditional music festival, appealing to tech-savvy audiences.",
    "**Interactive Stage Design:** Collaborate with artists to create interactive stage designs that respond to the music or audience input. For example, light shows that change color based on the song being played or even incorporating elements that physically move in response to the crowd's energy.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Festival:** Focus on sustainability by promoting eco-friendly practices throughout the event. This could include using solar-powered stages, offering recycling and composting facilities, and encouraging vendors to use sustainable materials. Not only does this attract environmentally conscious attendees but also sets a positive example for other events.",
    "**Crowdsourced Lineup:** Allow fans to suggest and vote on which artists should perform. This not only increases engagement but also ensures that the lineup reflects the tastes and preferences of the audience. You could also introduce a wildcard category where lesser-known or up-and-coming artists are selected based on fan suggestions, giving them exposure and a platform to showcase their talent."
