    "Use natural light: Instead of relying on watches and clocks, we could use natural light to schedule our day. For example, we could wake up when the sun rises and go to bed when it sets. This would allow us to align our natural rhythms with the sun and the environment.",
    "Use the stars: We could use the stars to schedule our day. For example, we could use the position of the stars to determine the time of day. This would require a bit of knowledge and research, but it would be a unique and interesting way to schedule our day.",
    "Use technology: While watches and clocks may disappear, technology may still be available. We could use apps or other digital tools to schedule our day. For example, we could set reminders for important tasks or events throughout the day.",
    "Use nature: We could use nature to schedule our day. For example, we could use the rising and setting of the tides to determine the time of day. This would require us to be in a location near the ocean, but it would be a unique and interesting way to schedule our day.",
    "Use music: We could use music to schedule our day. For example, we could listen to a specific song or playlist at different times of the day to signal when it's time to wake up, eat, or go to bed. This would be a creative and personal way to schedule our day."
