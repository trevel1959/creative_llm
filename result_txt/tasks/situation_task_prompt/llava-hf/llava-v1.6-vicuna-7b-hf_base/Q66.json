    "Modular construction: Modular construction involves building a house off-site in a controlled factory environment and then transporting it to the building site. This method can be highly efficient and cost-effective, as it allows for the use of prefabricated components and streamlined construction processes.",
    "3D printing: 3D printing is a process that uses a specialized printer to create physical objects by depositing material layer by layer. This technology could be used to construct the walls of a house, allowing for highly customizable and efficient designs.",
    "Tension structures: Tension structures are lightweight, yet strong structures that are created by stretching a fabric or membrane over a framework. This method could be used to create the walls of a house, providing a highly flexible and adaptable design.",
    "Earth-sheltered homes: Earth-sheltered homes are built into the ground, with the walls and roof made of earth materials. This design can provide excellent insulation and energy efficiency, as well as a unique and sustainable living experience.",
    "Recycled materials: Repurposing and recycling materials can be a sustainable and cost-effective way to build a house. This could include using reclaimed wood, metal, and other materials in the construction process, as well as repurposing old materials and objects for unique design elements."
