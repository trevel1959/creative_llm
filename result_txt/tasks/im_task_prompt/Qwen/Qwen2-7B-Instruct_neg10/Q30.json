    "Personalized Climate Zones: Create an air conditioner that divides the room into multiple climate zones, enabling different temperatures for different areas. For example, one zone could be set at a cooler temperature for sleeping, while another zone can maintain a warmer temperature for a cozy living area. This feature would cater to personal preferences and comfort levels.",
    "Self-Cleaning Filter: Introduce an air conditioner with a self-cleaning filter that automatically cleans itself, reducing the need for frequent maintenance and cleaning. This would save time and effort for users and ensure that the air quality remains high.",
    "Noise Reduction Technology: Develop an air conditioning unit that utilizes noise reduction technology, such as sound-absorbing materials and advanced fan designs, to minimize the noise produced during operation. This would create a quieter environment, especially in bedrooms or other areas where noise sensitivity is crucial.",
    "Humidity Control: Incorporate humidity control capabilities into the air conditioner, allowing users to adjust the humidity level according to their needs. This would be particularly beneficial for people who suffer from allergies or those who prefer a specific level of moisture in the air.",
    "Air Purification System: Combine the air conditioning functionality with a built-in air purification system that removes pollutants, allergens, and other contaminants from the air. This would not only provide comfortable temperatures but also ensure that the air quality in the room is clean and healthy."
