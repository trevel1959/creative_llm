    "Smart Trash Can: Create a smart trash can that can recognize and sort different types of waste, such as plastic, glass, and paper. It can then compact the waste and provide real-time data on the amount of waste generated in a particular area or building. This can help facilities managers to optimize waste management and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.",
    "Automated Trash Collection: Develop an automated trash collection system that uses drones or small robots to collect trash from homes, offices, and public spaces. The system can navigate through the environment using sensors and cameras, and can deposit the collected trash in a central location for disposal. This can help reduce the amount of time and effort required for manual trash collection, and can also help reduce the amount of waste generated in the first place.",
    "Trash-to-Energy Plant: Build a trash-to-energy plant that can convert non-recyclable waste into electricity or heat. The plant can use advanced technologies such as gasification or pyrolysis to break down the waste and produce energy. This can help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, and can provide a sustainable source of energy for homes and businesses.",
    "Personalized Trash Bins: Design personalized trash bins that can recognize and sort different types of waste based on their composition. The bins can use sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize the sorting process and reduce the amount of contamination. This can help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and improve the overall efficiency of waste management.",
    "Trash-Based Art: Create a trash-based art project that uses discarded materials to create beautiful and thought-provoking sculptures, installations, or murals. The project can raise awareness about the impact of waste on the environment and inspire people to reduce their waste generation and recycle more. It can also provide a platform for artists to showcase their creativity and talent while promoting sustainability."
