You can use different colored magnets to categorize tasks, such as work, personal, or leisure activities.",
    "Turn repetition into a game: Incorporate games or puzzles into your daily routine to make repetitive tasks more engaging. For example, you could play a game of Sudoku during your morning commute or do a crossword puzzle during your lunch break. This will help you stay mentally stimulated and make the time pass more quickly.",
    "Take a \"creativity break\": Schedule a daily break where you do something creative, such as drawing, painting, writing, or playing music.

You could also try a new creative hobby or activity during this time to keep things interesting.",
    "\"Mindfulness\" meditation: Practice mindfulness meditation to help you stay present and focused during repetitive tasks.
