    "**Budget Overruns**: The financial aspect of producing a Broadway musical can be a double-edged sword. Unexpected costs may arise from set design, costumes, or special effects, which can lead to budget overruns. This could necessitate cutting corners elsewhere or seeking additional funding, which can strain relationships with investors or lead to compromises in the production quality.",
    "**Creative Differences**: A Broadway musical is a collaborative effort involving directors, choreographers, composers, and writers. Creative differences can surface regarding the vision for the show, leading to conflicts that may stall progress. If not managed effectively, these disagreements could result in a disjointed production or even the departure of key team members.",
    "**Rehearsal Scheduling Issues**: Coordinating rehearsal times for a large cast and crew can be complex. Conflicts in availability, especially with ensemble members who may have other commitments, can lead to inconsistent rehearsals. This inconsistency can hinder the development of chemistry among cast members and impact the overall quality of the performance.",
    "**Technical Challenges**: A Broadway musical often relies on intricate lighting, sound, and set design. Technical challenges can arise during rehearsals or previews, leading to malfunctions that affect performances. If these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, it could result in negative audience feedback or even affect ticket sales.",
    "**Audience Reception**: Even with the best creative efforts, there is no guarantee that the audience will embrace the musical. Negative reviews or poor audience turnout can be detrimental, leading to financial losses and potentially forcing the production to close prematurely. This pressure can also affect the morale of the cast and crew, leading to performance anxiety."
