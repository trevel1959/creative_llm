    "Personalized Bicycle Bells: Create customized bicycle bells with unique designs and colors that reflect the rider's personality. These bells could be made with engraving or printing technology, allowing riders to express their individuality.",
    "Smart Bicycle Bells: Develop bells with built-in sensors that detect the rider's proximity to other cyclists, pedestrians, or vehicles. When the sensor detects an approaching entity, the bell sounds automatically, alerting the rider of potential danger. This feature would enhance safety by reducing the need for manual bell-ringing.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Safety Lights: Create bells with integrated safety lights that illuminate when the bell is rung. This feature would provide additional visibility for the rider, especially during low-light conditions, improving safety for both the rider and other road users.",
    "Multi-Tone Bicycle Bells: Develop bells that emit different tones depending on the rider's preference or the situation. For example, a high-pitched tone could be used for approaching pedestrians, while a low-pitched tone could be used for approaching vehicles. This feature would provide more nuanced communication between road users.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Integrated Navigation: Incorporate GPS technology into bells to provide turn-by-turn navigation for cyclists. When the bell is rung, the GPS system would provide voice prompts or visual cues, guiding the rider through their route. This feature would enhance safety by reducing the need for the rider to look away from the road or consult a separate navigation device."
