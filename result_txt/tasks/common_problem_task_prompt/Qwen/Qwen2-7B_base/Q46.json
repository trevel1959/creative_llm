    "2. Lack of public support: Another potential problem is a lack of public support for the overhaul. The public may not be convinced of the benefits of the overhaul, or they may be resistant to changes in their daily routine that come with the overhaul.",
    "3. Resistance from stakeholders: There may be resistance from stakeholders who have a vested interest in the current state of the public transportation system. For example, bus drivers or taxi companies may be resistant to changes that impact their livelihoods.",
    "4. Coordination issues: Coordinating the overhaul of the public transportation system with existing infrastructure can be a significant challenge. This may include coordinating with transportation departments, utility companies, and other stakeholders to ensure that the overhaul is completed smoothly and without major disruptions.",
    "5. Safety concerns: The overhaul may involve new technologies or infrastructure that are not currently in use in the city. This could pose new safety concerns and require increased oversight to ensure that the overhaul is done safely.",
    "6. Environmental impacts: The overhaul may have significant environmental impacts, such as increased emissions from new vehicles or infrastructure changes that affect air quality. These impacts must be carefully considered and managed to minimize any negative consequences."
