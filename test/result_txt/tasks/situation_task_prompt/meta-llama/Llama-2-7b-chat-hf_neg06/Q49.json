    "Create a fire-resistant shelter: Build a structure around your home using fire-resistant materials like brick, stone, or concrete. This shelter can provide a safe place for you and your family to escape to in case of a fire. You can also line the inside of the shelter with fire-resistant materials like fireproof blankets or tarps to protect against direct flame exposure.",
    "Use water-based fire suppression methods: Instead of relying on traditional fire extinguishers that use chemicals, create a water-based fire suppression system. This can include installing a water sprinkler system in your home or setting up a large water tank with a pump and hoses. When a fire breaks out, the water-based system can be used to douse the flames and prevent them from spreading.",
    "Create a fire-resistant barrier: Use a fire-resistant material like a fireproof blanket or a layer of sand to create a barrier between your home and the fire. This can help to slow the spread of the fire and give you more time to escape or call for help. You can also use a fire-resistant spray to coat surfaces around your home to create an additional barrier.",
    "Use a fire-resistant plant: Certain plants, like the \"fire-resistant\" eucalyptus tree, have natural oils that can help to repel or extinguish fires. Plant these trees around your home to create a natural barrier against fires. You can also use other fire-resistant plants like lavender or rosemary to help repel fires.",
    "Create a fire-resistant roof: Install a fire-resistant roof on your home, such as a metal or ceramic roof, which can withstand high temperatures and help to prevent fires from spreading to your home. You can also use a fire-resistant coating on your existing roof to make it more fire-resistant."
