    "Use candles: One of the simplest and most effective ways to light up a room at night would be to use candles. You can place candles on the tables, shelves, and any other flat surfaces in the room. This will create a warm and cozy atmosphere, and the flickering of the candles will add a touch of magic to the room.",
    "Use solar panels: If you have access to sunlight during the day, you can install solar panels on the roof of your house or building. These panels will collect solar energy and store it in batteries, which you can use to power your lighting fixtures at night.",
    "Use LED lights: LED lights are energy-efficient and long-lasting, making them an excellent choice for lighting up a room at night. You can install LED lights on the walls, ceiling, or under the furniture in the room.",
    "Use glow-in-the-dark paint: Glow-in-the-dark paint is a fun and creative way to light up a room at night. You can paint the walls, furniture, or any other surfaces in the room with glow-in-the-dark paint, and it will emit a soft, ambient light that will make the room feel magical.",
    "Use fireflies: If you have access to a garden or yard, you can capture fireflies and release them in the room at night. Fireflies emit a soft, warm light that will create a whimsical atmosphere in the room. Just be sure to handle the fireflies with care and release them in a safe and humane way."
