    "**Innovative Scent Diffuser**: Create a perfume bottle that doubles as an air purifier or scent diffuser. This idea combines functionality and aesthetics by incorporating ultrasonic technology inside the bottle to release the scent into the air when the perfume is sprayed. The bottle itself could be designed with a sleek, modern look, featuring touch controls for adjusting the scent intensity and a built-in filter to ensure a clean and pleasant environment.",
    "**Personalized Scent Library**: Develop a system where customers can create their own custom scents using various fragrance oils included in the perfume bottle. The user can mix different oils to create a unique aroma, making each bottle a personalized creation. The design of the bottle could include compartments for storing the oils, along with a digital guide providing scent blending tips and tutorials.",
    "**Sustainable Refillable Perfume Bottle**: Introduce an eco-friendly perfume bottle made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled glass. The bottle would feature a modular design, allowing users to easily swap out the fragrance cartridge for refills. The packaging could emphasize the environmental benefits, appealing to consumers who prioritize sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Perfume Experience**: Create a perfume bottle that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the shopping experience. When a customer scans the bottle with their smartphone, they are presented with a virtual reality experience showcasing how the scent might look on different skin tones and in various settings. This interactive element could make the purchase decision more engaging and fun.",
    "**Smart Perfume Suggester**: Develop a perfume bottle equipped with a microchip that analyzes the wearer's daily activities, mood, and personal preferences to suggest the most suitable fragrance. The bottle could sync with a smartphone app, tracking user data and offering personalized scent recommendations throughout the day. The design could incorporate a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on simplicity and ease of use."
