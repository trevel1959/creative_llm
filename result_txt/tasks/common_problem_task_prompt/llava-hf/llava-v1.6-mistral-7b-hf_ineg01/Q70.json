    "Discomfort: People from different cultural backgrounds may feel uncomfortable speaking their native languages in a workplace setting, as English is commonly considered the global business language. This can lead to them feeling excluded, reluctant to share ideas or feedback, and ultimately not being able to fully contribute to the workplace. One potential solution to this problem could be promoting a workplace culture that celebrates diversity and encourages employees to express themselves in their preferred language whenever possible.",
    "Cultural Sensitivity: Communicating across cultures can also require a heightened level of sensitivity and awareness. This involves understanding and respecting cultural differences, including nuances in communication styles, nonverbal cues, and body language. One potential solution to this problem could be providing training on cultural sensitivity and communication, so that all employees can better understand and navigate differences in communication styles.",
    "Lack of Standardization: Without a common language, it can be challenging to establish standardized processes and procedures across a multicultural team. This can lead to confusion and inefficiency, as well as a higher likelihood of errors or misunderstandings. One potential solution to this problem could be using visual aids or tools, such as diagrams or flowcharts, to communicate processes and procedures in a universally comprehensible way.",
    "Language Learning Challenges: Learning a new language can be difficult and time-consuming, especially when balancing work and family responsibilities. One potential solution to this problem could be offering flexible language learning options, such as online courses or lunch and learn sessions, so that employees can learn at their own pace and convenience.",
    "Cultural Differences in Vocabulary: Even when people speak the same language, there may be differences in vocabulary or terminology that can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. One potential solution to this problem could be creating a shared glossary of commonly used terms and vocabulary, which can be referenced and updated over time."
