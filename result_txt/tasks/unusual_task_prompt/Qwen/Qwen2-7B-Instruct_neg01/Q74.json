    "**Innovative Wheel Design for Improved Comfort**: Create a steering wheel with a contoured grip that adjusts to different temperatures. The wheel would cool down in hot weather and heat up in cold conditions to provide a comfortable driving experience throughout the year.",
    "**Interactive Steering Wheel for Enhanced Entertainment**: Develop a steering wheel with built-in haptic feedback technology. Users can feel vibrations and other sensations while driving, making it an immersive experience. Additionally, it could be integrated with gaming platforms or multimedia systems for entertainment during long drives.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Built-In Health Monitoring**: Integrate sensors into the steering wheel to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs. This feature could alert the driver to potential health issues, especially for long-distance drivers who might not notice symptoms until later.",
    "**Adaptive Steering Wheel for Accessibility**: Design a steering wheel that adjusts its size and shape based on the user's physical needs. It could expand or contract, as well as adjust the position of the controls, making it easier for individuals with disabilities to operate a vehicle safely.",
    "**Intelligent Steering Wheel for Autonomous Driving**: Incorporate advanced AI capabilities into the steering wheel, allowing it to communicate directly with autonomous driving systems. The wheel could adjust its sensitivity, force feedback, and even control certain aspects of the car's interior environment (like lighting and climate) based on the autonomous system's decisions, providing a seamless transition between manual and autonomous modes."
