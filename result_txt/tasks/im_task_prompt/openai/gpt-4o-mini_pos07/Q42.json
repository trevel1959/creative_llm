    "**Modular Suitcase Design**: Create a suitcase that can be broken down into smaller, modular compartments. Each compartment can be used separately for day trips or short excursions, allowing travelers to carry only what they need. The compartments could easily snap together or be carried individually, providing flexibility for different travel scenarios.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Suitcase with Recycled Materials**: Develop a suitcase made entirely from recycled materials, such as ocean plastics or discarded fabrics. This suitcase would not only be lightweight and durable but also promote sustainability in travel. To enhance its eco-friendliness, the suitcase could feature solar panels to charge devices while on the go.",
    "**Self-Weighting Suitcase**: Introduce a suitcase with a built-in scale that weighs itself and provides a digital readout on the handle. This feature would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees. Additionally, the suitcase could have a warning system that alerts the user if the weight exceeds airline limits, preventing last-minute repacking at the check-in counter.",
    "**Integrated Charging Station**: Design a suitcase with a built-in charging station that includes multiple USB ports and wireless charging pads. This would allow travelers to charge their devices on the go without needing to search for an outlet. The suitcase could also feature a power bank that can be charged while traveling, ensuring that devices remain powered throughout the journey.",
    "**Customizable Exterior**: Create a suitcase with a customizable exterior that allows travelers to change its appearance according to their preferences. This could include interchangeable covers with different designs, colors, or patterns. Additionally, travelers could upload their own designs or photos to be printed on the suitcase, making it uniquely theirs and easily identifiable on the baggage carousel."
