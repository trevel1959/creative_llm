    "**Dental Robotics**: I'd use a robotic dentist, equipped with advanced AI-powered diagnostic tools and precision instruments. This robot would perform routine cleanings, fillings, and even complex procedures like implants and crowns. Its accuracy and efficiency would minimize the risk of human error, ensuring optimal oral health.",
    "**Tooth Whitening Kits**: I'd rely on at-home tooth whitening kits, using advanced LED light technology and customized whitening gel. These kits would be designed to achieve professional-grade results, with built-in sensors to monitor progress and prevent over-whitening.",
    "**Advanced Water Flossers**: I'd use high-tech water flossers that utilize advanced sonic technology, coupled with antibacterial properties and real-time monitoring of plaque and bacteria levels. These devices would be programmed to adjust water pressure and temperature for optimal cleaning.",
    "**3D-Printed Dental Prosthetics**: I'd opt for 3D-printed dental prosthetics, such as crowns, bridges, and dentures, which would be tailored to my specific needs and designed for optimal comfort and functionality. These prosthetics would be made from advanced materials like ceramic, titanium, or bioplastics.",
    "**Personalized Oral Care AI**: I'd use an AI-powered oral care assistant that would analyze my oral health data, provide personalized recommendations, and even detect early signs of oral health issues. This AI would be integrated with my wearable devices and dental records, ensuring a proactive approach to oral care."
