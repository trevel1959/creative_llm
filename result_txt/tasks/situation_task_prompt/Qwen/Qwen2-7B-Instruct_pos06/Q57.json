    "**Underwater City:** Design an underwater city that could float or remain submerged depending on ocean levels. The city would have self-sustaining features like renewable energy sources, water purification systems, and vertical farms. People could live in apartments, hotels, and even have recreational areas. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Floating Communities:** Create modular, eco-friendly floating homes that can move with changing ocean levels. These homes are made from recycled materials and use solar power, rainwater harvesting, and biodegradable waste management systems. They can connect via bridges or boats, forming sustainable communities. Confidence Score: 0.90",
    "**Terraced Mountain Homes:** Build homes on mountain slopes, creating terraces that can expand or contract based on the height of the water. These homes would use gravity to their advantage for water collection and have green roofs for insulation and agriculture. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Subterranean Living Pods:** Develop large, underground living spaces that could house entire communities. These pods would be built into hillsides or beneath the earth's surface, providing protection from both rising waters and extreme weather. They would feature advanced air filtration systems and have access to natural light through skylights. Confidence Score: 0.92",
    "**Cloud Cities:** Design floating cities in the clouds that can adjust altitude based on ocean levels. These cities would be self-sufficient, using solar power, rainwater collection, and possibly hydroponics for food production. They could also potentially utilize wind energy and have a sophisticated system for recycling and waste management. Confidence Score: 0.88"
