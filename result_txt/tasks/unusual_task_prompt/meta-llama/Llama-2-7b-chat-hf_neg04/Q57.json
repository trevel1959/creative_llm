    "Perfume bottle with a built-in scent diffuser: Create a perfume bottle with a built-in scent diffuser that can be set to release a specific fragrance at a user-controlled interval. This could be achieved through the use of small, hidden fans or vents that circulate the fragrance within the bottle. Users could set the desired scent and duration of release through a small touchscreen or voice assistant interface.",
    "Interactive Perfume Bottle: Design a perfume bottle that doubles as a digital display screen. The bottle could have a built-in camera and sensors that detect the user's emotions and environment, and adjust the fragrance accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the bottle could release a calming scent, while a more energizing scent could be released if the user is feeling energized. This interactive perfume bottle could also display personalized messages or images based on the user's preferences or mood.",
    "Scent-Controlled Perfume Bottle: Create a perfume bottle that allows users to control the strength and duration of the fragrance using a smartphone app. The bottle could have a small Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled chip that connects to the app, allowing users to adjust the fragrance level and duration remotely. This could be useful for users who want to change their fragrance throughout the day or for those who want to share their perfume with others.",
    "Personalized Perfume Bottle: Design a perfume bottle that can be customized with the user's name or initials. The bottle could have a 3D printed or laser-engraved design that creates a unique and personalized look. Users could also have the option to customize the fragrance itself, choosing from a range of scents that are tailored to their preferences.",
    "Perfume Bottle with Built-in Air Purifier: Create a perfume bottle that also functions as an air purifier. The bottle could have a built-in fan or filter that circulates clean air within the bottle, creating a fresher and more pleasant environment for the user. This could be especially useful for those who live in areas with poor air"
