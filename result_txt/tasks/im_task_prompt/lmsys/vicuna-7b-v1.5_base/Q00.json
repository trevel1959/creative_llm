    "Advanced Sharpener: Another way to enhance a pencil is to integrate an advanced sharpener into the design. This can be a retractable sharpener that extends from the eraser end or a rotating sharpener that allows for multiple sharpening angles. This would save time and effort in sharpening the pencil, making it more convenient for users.",
    "Dual-Purpose Mechanism: A unique feature of a pencil is its ability to write and erase. To improve this functionality, a dual-purpose mechanism can be incorporated. For example, a button or lever on the side of the pencil can be designed to lock the point when pressed, allowing the user to erase with the same motion as writing. This would save space and simplify the design.",
    "Automatic Lead Replenishment: To enhance the writing experience, a pencil can be designed with an automatic lead replenishment system. This can be achieved by incorporating a small mechanism that detects when the lead is running low and automatically ejects a new lead when needed. This would eliminate the need for frequent lead replacements and ensure a continuous writing experience.",
    "Interchangeable Erasers: Another way to improve a pencil is to offer interchangeable erasers. This would allow users to choose the eraser type that best suits their needs, whether it be a traditional rubber eraser, a soft eraser for delicate surfaces, or a magnetic eraser for removing stubborn markers. This would provide greater flexibility and convenience for users.",
    "Integrated Lighting: For users who work in low-light environments, an integrated lighting system can be added to a pencil. This can be achieved by incorporating a small LED light on the end of the pencil, which can be activated by a button or a motion sensor. This would provide a convenient and hands-free lighting solution for users."
