    "**Holographic Display Glasses**: Another possible solution is the development of holographic display glasses that can project images directly onto the user's retina. These glasses could be worn over the eyes and would use advanced technology to display clear, high-resolution images, effectively correcting the user's vision.",
    "**Neural Implant Technology**: People with poor vision could benefit from neural implant technology that directly interfaces with the brain. This technology would involve implanting a small device into the brain that could process visual information and send it directly to the user's brain, bypassing the need for the eyes.",
    "**Virtual Reality Headsets**: A virtual reality (VR) headset that can create a 360-degree immersive environment could be another solution. The VR headset could be used to simulate the user's surroundings and display images with high resolution, effectively correcting the user's vision.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Another option could be the development of smart contact lenses that could be programmed to adjust the user's vision in real-time. These lenses could use sensors and microprocessors to detect the user's vision needs and adjust the lens's prescription accordingly.",
    "**Retinal Prosthetics**: Retinal prosthetics could be used to restore vision in cases of severe vision loss. These devices, implanted into the eye, use an array of electrodes to stimulate the retina and produce visual perception."
