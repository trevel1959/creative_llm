    "**Security Analysis for Public Spaces**: Imagine a scenario where you are tasked with ensuring safety in public places like airports, stadiums, or large shopping malls. With your ability to see through walls, you can conduct an invisible inspection of the premises without disturbing anyone's privacy. This would help identify any potential threats hidden behind walls or concealed spaces, such as suspicious packages or contraband items, thus enhancing security measures.",
    "**Architecture and Urban Planning**: As a designer or urban planner, you could visualize how buildings interact with their surroundings without physically being present. By seeing through walls, you could easily assess the structural integrity of existing buildings, plan for optimal space utilization, or even design future structures that seamlessly integrate with their environment. This could lead to more efficient and harmonious city layouts.",
    "**Historical Research**: Historians and archaeologists could benefit immensely from this power. By scanning through walls, they could uncover hidden artifacts, rooms, or underground structures without causing damage or disturbance. This could accelerate the discovery process of historical sites, provide insights into past civilizations, and aid in the preservation of cultural heritage.",
    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: Law enforcement agencies could utilize this ability to solve crimes faster and more effectively. Detectives could look for evidence in locations inaccessible to traditional means, such as inside locked rooms or behind walls in abandoned buildings. This could help in solving cases quicker, leading to quicker apprehension of criminals and prevention of further crimes.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: In the medical field, doctors could diagnose and treat patients more accurately by seeing through their bodies without invasive procedures. This could be particularly useful for assessing internal injuries, tumors, or other health conditions that are difficult to detect with current methods. It could also allow for non-invasive surgery, reducing risks and recovery times for patients."
