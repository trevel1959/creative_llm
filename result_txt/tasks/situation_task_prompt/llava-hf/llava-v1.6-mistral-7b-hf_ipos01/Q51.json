    "**River-Crossing Vehicle**: A modified vehicle, such as a truck or a jeep, could be equipped with large, inflatable tires to create a makeshift raft. This would allow for safe and dry transportation across the river.",
    "**Human-Powered Bridge**: In a post-apocalyptic scenario, a human-powered bridge could be built using a series of interconnected platforms or rafts. This bridge would require multiple people to work together to push and pull it across the river.",
    "**Zipline System**: A zipline system could be set up across the river, allowing people to glide from one side to the other. This would require a secure anchor point on both sides of the river.",
    "**Ferry Service**: If the river is wide but not too deep, a ferry service could be established to transport people across the river. This would require a boat capable of carrying multiple passengers.",
    "**Submerged Tunnel**: If the river is deep and crossing it by surface means is not feasible, a submerged tunnel could be constructed under the river. This would require specialized equipment and expertise to build and maintain."
