    "**Hydroponic Garden**: Create a hydroponic garden where plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This method allows for efficient water usage and can be used in areas with hard ground. The garden can be set up in a controlled environment, such as a greenhouse or indoor space, where the temperature and humidity can be regulated to optimize plant growth.",
    "**Aeroponic Garden**: Develop an aeroponic garden where plants are suspended in the air and their roots are sprayed with a nutrient-rich mist. This method reduces water usage and allows for faster growth rates. The aeroponic system can be designed to be self-sustaining, using a recirculating system to conserve water and reduce waste.",
    "**Geodesic Dome Garden**: Design a geodesic dome-shaped garden that can be placed on top of hard ground. The dome's shape allows for maximum space utilization and can be made of a durable, weather-resistant material. The dome can be equipped with a self-watering system, where water is stored in the dome's base and slowly released to the plants as needed.",
    "**Vertical Garden**: Create a vertical garden using a trellis or a wall-mounted system. This method makes use of space and can be used in areas with hard ground. The vertical garden can be designed to be modular, allowing for easy expansion or reconfiguration as needed.",
    "**Aquaponic Garden**: Develop an aquaponic garden that combines a fish tank with a hydroponic system. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, which in turn help to purify the water for the fish. This closed-loop system can be used in areas with hard ground and can provide a sustainable source of both food and water."
