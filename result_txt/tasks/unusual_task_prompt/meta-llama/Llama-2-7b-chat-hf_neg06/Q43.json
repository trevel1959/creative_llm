    "Bicycle-Powered Generator: Create a bicycle that generates electricity as you pedal. This could be achieved through a combination of mechanical and electrical engineering. The bicycle would have a set of gears that connect to a dynamo, which generates electricity as the pedals turn. This could be used as a portable and sustainable source of energy for camping trips or for communities without access to electricity.",
    "Bicycle-Shaped Water Purifier: Design a bicycle that can purify water as you pedal. The bicycle would have a set of filters attached to the frame, which would use the motion of the pedals to push water through a filtration system. This could be used in areas where access to clean drinking water is limited, providing a sustainable and portable solution.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Food Processor: Create a bicycle that can be used to process food. The bicycle would have a set of blades attached to the frame, which would be powered by the pedals. This could be used to chop, grind, or puree food, making it easier to prepare meals in remote areas or during camping trips.",
    "Bicycle-Shaped Greenhouse: Design a bicycle that doubles as a greenhouse. The frame of the bicycle would be made of a transparent material, such as plastic or glass, and would have a set of solar panels attached to the top. This would allow for the growth of plants and herbs, even in areas with limited sunlight.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Aquaponic System: Create a bicycle that can be used to power an aquaponic system. The bicycle would have a set of pumps and filters attached to the frame, which would use the motion of the pedals to pump water through a system of tubes and tanks. This would allow for the growth of fish and plants in a sustainable and portable way, providing a source of food and fresh produce in areas where access to these resources is limited."
