    "**Satellite Disruptions**: Satellites in orbit around the Earth would be affected by the change in gravity. They might start to drift away from their orbits, which could lead to communication disruptions and other issues.",
    "**Structural Damage**: Buildings and other structures that are not designed to withstand changes in gravity would be at risk of structural damage. The difference in weight distribution could cause cracks or even collapse.",
    "**New Forms of Life**: If the Earth's gravity were halved, new forms of life could evolve to adapt to the new conditions. For example, organisms that can swim or fly more easily in a lower-gravity environment might become more dominant.",
    "**Earthquakes and Volcanic Activity**: Changes in gravity can affect the movement of tectonic plates, which could lead to increased earthquakes and volcanic activity. This could have devastating consequences for life on Earth.",
    "**Changes in the Atmosphere**: The decrease in gravity could cause changes in the Earth's atmosphere. For example, the air might become thinner and less dense, which could affect weather patterns and climate."
