    "Nuclear Power: One option for powering vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to switch to nuclear power. This could involve using nuclear reactors to generate electricity, which could then be used to power electric vehicles or to charge batteries for hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.",
    "Solar Power: Another option would be to harness the power of the sun to generate electricity. This could involve installing solar panels on roads, buildings, or other structures to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This electricity could then be used to power electric vehicles or charge batteries for hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.",
    "Wind Power: Wind power could also be used to generate electricity if oil were to disappear. This could involve installing wind turbines in strategic locations to capture wind energy and convert it into electricity. This electricity could then be used to power electric vehicles or charge batteries for hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option for powering vehicles if oil were to disappear would be to switch to hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by reacting hydrogen with oxygen, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This technology is already being used in some vehicles today, and could potentially be scaled up to power larger vehicles like cars and trucks.",
    "Advanced Battery Technologies: Finally, advances in battery technology could also help to power vehicles if oil were to disappear. This could involve developing more efficient and powerful batteries that could be used to power electric vehicles or charge hybrid vehicles. For example, solid-state batteries are being developed that could potentially offer greater range and faster charging times than traditional lithium-ion batteries."
