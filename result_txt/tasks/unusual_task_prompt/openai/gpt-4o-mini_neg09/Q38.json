    "**Pet Toy**: Tie a few handkerchiefs together and create a soft, colorful tug-of-war toy for your dog or cat. The fabric is gentle on their teeth and can be a fun, interactive way to play with your pets. You can also soak it in water and freeze it for a cool chew toy during hot weather.",
    "**Travel Pillow**: Roll up a handkerchief and tuck it inside a larger scarf or wrap it in a sweater to create a portable travel pillow. This makes for a comfortable headrest during long flights or car rides without taking up much space in your luggage.",
    "**Bookmark**: Use a handkerchief as a stylish bookmark. Its fabric can hold your place in a book without damaging the pages. You can even tie a knot or a small decorative bow at the end to make it easier to find when you pick the book back up.",
    "**Plant Tie**: In gardening, handkerchiefs can be repurposed as soft ties to support young plants or seedlings. The fabric is gentle enough not to damage the stems while providing the necessary support for growth. Simply cut the handkerchief into strips and use them to secure the plants to stakes or trellises.",
    "**Scented Sachet**: Fill a handkerchief with dried herbs, flowers, or potpourri, and tie it closed to create a scented sachet. Place it in your drawers, closet, or car to infuse a pleasant fragrance. You can customize the scent according to your preference, such as lavender for relaxation or citrus for a refreshing aroma."
