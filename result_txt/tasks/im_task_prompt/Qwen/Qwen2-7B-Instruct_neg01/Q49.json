    "**Intelligent Oral Health Advisor**: Create an electric toothbrush that comes with an AI-powered health assistant. The toothbrush would monitor brushing habits and provide real-time feedback on the effectiveness of brushing. It could also suggest personalized brushing techniques based on dental history or preferences, such as recommending a gentler approach for sensitive teeth.",
    "**Dance-Along Electric Toothbrush**: Design an electric toothbrush that syncs with popular music or dance routines. The toothbrush would vibrate in time to the beat of the music, encouraging users to brush in rhythm. This not only makes brushing more enjoyable but can also subtly encourage better brushing duration.",
    "**Sustainable Toothbrush**: Develop an electric toothbrush made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. This would include a rechargeable battery, reducing the need for disposable batteries. The toothbrush could come with a subscription service where users return used heads, which are then recycled or repurposed.",
    "**Oral Care Tracker**: Create an electric toothbrush with built-in sensors that track not just brushing habits but also gum health. The toothbrush would detect areas of the mouth that require more attention, such as plaque buildup or gum recession, and provide recommendations for improvement. It could also connect to a smartphone app to track progress over time.",
    "**Customizable Brushing Experience**: Offer a line of electric toothbrushes that allow users to swap out different types of brush heads. For example, one head could be designed for gentle cleaning, while another might focus on whitening. Users could customize their brushing experience based on their specific oral care needs or preferences. Additionally, these brush heads could be designed with different colors and textures to make the brushing routine more engaging."
