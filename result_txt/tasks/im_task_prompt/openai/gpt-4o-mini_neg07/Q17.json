    "**Built-in Stain Recognition**: Incorporate a camera and image recognition software that identifies common stains (like wine, grass, or grease) on clothes before the wash begins. The washing machine would then suggest or automatically select the best wash cycle and detergent type to effectively treat the stains, ensuring that clothes come out cleaner and prolonging their lifespan.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that utilizes UV light or steam to sanitize the drum and eliminate mold, bacteria, and odors. This would ensure that the washing machine remains hygienic and that clothes smell fresh, reducing the need for manual cleaning and maintenance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Design a built-in compartment that allows for the use of eco-friendly detergent pods or sheets. The machine would automatically dispense the right amount of detergent based on the load size and soil level. This not only minimizes waste but also encourages users to switch to more sustainable washing solutions.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional knobs and buttons with a large, interactive touchscreen that provides an engaging user experience. The interface could include tutorials, personalized washing tips, and reminders for maintenance tasks. Users could also control the machine remotely via a smartphone app, allowing for more convenience and flexibility.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-canceling technology to significantly reduce the sound produced during operation. This could involve using specialized materials and design techniques that absorb vibrations and sound waves. Such a feature would make the washing machine more suitable for open-plan living spaces and nighttime washing without disturbing the household."
