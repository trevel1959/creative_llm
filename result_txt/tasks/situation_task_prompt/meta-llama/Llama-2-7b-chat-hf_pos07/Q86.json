    "Utilize Nature's Cleaning Power: Embrace the natural cleansing properties of plants and minerals to keep clean. For instance, clay can be used as a gentle exfoliator, while charcoal can help absorb impurities. Mix these ingredients with water to create a soothing face mask or body scrub.",
    "Innovative Water Filtration Systems: Develop portable water filtration devices that can purify any water source, making it safe for personal hygiene. These devices could use advanced technologies like UV light, activated carbon, or nanomaterials to remove contaminants and bacteria.",
    "Solar-Powered Showers: Design showerheads that harness the power of the sun to heat water. These showerheads would use solar panels to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, which would then heat the water. This eco-friendly solution would eliminate the need for traditional hot water systems, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Air-Powered Cleaning Tools: Create handheld cleaning devices that use compressed air to remove dirt and grime. These tools could be powered by a small, portable air compressor or even a manual pump, making them easy to use and maintain. They would be perfect for quick cleanups and small messes, eliminating the need for water or chemicals.",
    "Magnetic Cleaning Surfaces: Develop magnetic cleaning surfaces that can attract and hold dirt and grime. These surfaces could be applied to various areas, such as countertops, floors, or walls, providing a quick and easy way to clean and maintain a space. The magnetic properties would allow for easy removal of dirt and stains without the need for chemicals or water."
