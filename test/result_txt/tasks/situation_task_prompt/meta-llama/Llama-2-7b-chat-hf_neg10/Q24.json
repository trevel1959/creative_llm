    "Virtual Vision Aids: Developing virtual vision aids that project a digital display in front of the user's eyes could help individuals with poor vision. These aids could use augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR) technology to enhance the user's visual experience. The digital display could display text, images, or even entire documents, making it easier for individuals with poor vision to read and perform daily tasks.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Bionic eye implants, also known as retinal implants, could be a solution for individuals with severe vision loss. These implants use electrical impulses to stimulate the retina and restore some vision. The implants could be controlled using a remote control or even brain signals, allowing individuals to control their vision with their thoughts.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Smart contact lenses are contact lenses with built-in sensors that can monitor the wearer's glucose levels, blood pressure, or even detect certain health conditions. These lenses could be a game-changer for individuals with poor vision, as they could provide additional health benefits and make it easier to monitor vital signs.",
    "Personalized Vision Training: Developing personalized vision training programs that are tailored to the individual's specific needs could help individuals with poor vision improve their visual acuity. These programs could use a combination of computer-based training and in-person therapy sessions to help individuals strengthen their visual muscles and improve their overall vision.",
    "Visualization Techniques: Teaching individuals with poor vision various visualization techniques, such as visualizing objects in their mind's eye, could help them better navigate their surroundings. These techniques could also help individuals with poor vision to better remember important details, such as faces or objects, which could be useful in everyday life."
