    "**ECHO**: An AI-powered, wearable device that uses 3D audio and vibrations to create a mental map of the surroundings, allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate through spaces with ease. ECHO would be equipped with advanced sensors to detect obstacles, people, and other environmental factors, and provide real-time feedback through a combination of sound and tactile cues.",
    "**Lumina**: A smart cane that incorporates a high-resolution, 3D scanning camera and a LED display to provide real-time visual information about the environment. Lumina would use machine learning algorithms to identify objects, people, and obstacles, and display relevant information on the LED screen, allowing users to make informed decisions about their surroundings.",
    "**SonicScape**: A wearable device that uses advanced audio processing and spatial audio technology to create a 3D audio map of the surroundings. SonicScape would allow users to \"hear\" their environment in a way that simulates their visual experience, enabling them to navigate through spaces with greater ease and confidence.",
    "**TactiGuide**: A smart guide dog harness that incorporates advanced sensors and AI-powered navigation. TactiGuide would provide real-time feedback to the guide dog, enabling it to make more informed decisions about navigation and obstacle avoidance, and allowing visually impaired individuals to move through spaces with greater ease and confidence.",
    "**Vista**: An augmented reality (AR) platform that uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and spatial audio to create a virtual representation of the environment. Vista would provide visually impaired individuals with a virtual \"sight\" of their surroundings, allowing them to navigate through spaces with greater ease and confidence, and enabling them to interact with their environment in new and innovative ways."
