    "**Interactive Storytelling Candles**: Each candle comes with a unique QR code that, when scanned, plays a short audio clip or video of a story related to the candle's scent. The story could be a historical event, a fictional narrative, or even a personal anecdote related to the scent. This way, lighting the candle becomes an engaging experience that combines olfactory pleasure with auditory storytelling.",
    "**DIY Customizable Candles**: Offer a range of scented wax bases along with different color dyes, wick types, and decorative materials like glitter, sand, or small objects (e.g., seashells, dried flowers). Customers can create their own candles, which allows for personalized gifts and unique home decor pieces. Provide instructions and online tutorials for those who need guidance.",
    "**Therapeutic Aromatherapy Candles**: Develop a line of candles that emit specific scents known for their therapeutic benefits, such as lavender for relaxation, peppermint for energy, or eucalyptus for respiratory relief. Include information about the benefits of each scent on the packaging, and perhaps partner with health professionals to endorse the products.",
    "**Scent-Activated Candles**: Utilize smart technology to develop candles that respond to sound or motion. For example, the candle could release a stronger scent during quiet moments or in response to specific frequencies. This innovation could appeal to those looking for a more interactive and customizable sensory experience.",
    "**Seasonal Scent Collections**: Create a series of limited-edition candles for each season, with scents that reflect the atmosphere and aesthetics of that time of year. For instance, summer might feature fruity and floral scents, while winter could include spicy and woody aromas. This approach encourages customers to purchase new candles regularly and adds excitement to the product line."
