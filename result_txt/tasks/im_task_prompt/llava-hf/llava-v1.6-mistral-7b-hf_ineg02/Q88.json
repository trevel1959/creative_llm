    "Smart Ski Poles: Develop ski poles with built-in sensors that can track the skier's performance and provide real-time feedback on their technique, speed, and balance. This could include GPS tracking for navigating the slopes or a pressure-sensitive grip for measuring the amount of force applied.",
    "Multi-Functional Ski Poles: Create ski poles that have multiple functions, such as a built-in water bottle holder, a compass for navigation, or a built-in whistle for emergency situations.",
    "Eco-Friendly Materials: Use sustainable and environmentally-friendly materials in the construction of the ski poles, such as recycled aluminum or biodegradable plastics. This could help reduce the environmental impact of skiing equipment.",
    "Customizable Design: Offer ski poles with customizable designs, allowing skiers to personalize their poles with different colors, patterns, or designs to reflect their individual style.",
    "Aerodynamic Shaft: Design the shaft of the ski poles to be more aerodynamic, reducing air resistance and making it easier for skiers to move through the air. This could be achieved through the use of lightweight materials or by incorporating vents or ridges on the shaft."
