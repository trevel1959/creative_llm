    "**Seasonless Solstice**: Instead of marking the traditional solstices, people could celebrate the solstices of the Earth's orbit around the sun. Activities could include astronomical observations, solar energy fairs, and workshops on sustainable solar technologies.",
    "**Interseasonal Calendar**: Develop a calendar with 13 months, each representing a unique interseasonal period. This would allow for a variety of activities throughout the year, such as the Awakening Season (spring-like), the Harvest Season (autumn-like), and the Equinox Season (a mix of spring and autumn).",
    "**Global Climate Exchange**: Create an annual event where different regions around the world share their climate-specific knowledge and innovations. This would foster global collaboration on sustainable practices and climate resilience.",
    "**The Evergreen Gathering**: Celebrate the evergreen trees that thrive in various climates and seasons. This event could include evergreen-themed art installations, workshops on evergreen care, and sustainable forestry practices.",
    "**The Timeless Tour**: Organize a tour that takes participants through different climates and seasons around the world. This would allow people to experience the diversity of Earth's natural cycles and inspire environmental stewardship."
