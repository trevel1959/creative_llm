    "**Personal Hoverboard with Support**: A personal hoverboard designed for those with mobility challenges could be developed. This device would use gyroscopic technology to balance the user, allowing them to glide smoothly across surfaces. It would have built-in support handles that could adjust in height and position, providing stability while still allowing for a sense of freedom and movement.",
    "**Robotic Exoskeleton Suit**: A wearable robotic exoskeleton could assist individuals in moving around. This suit would be lightweight and designed to enhance mobility by providing support to the legs and torso. Users could control the suit's movements with their upper body, allowing them to stand, walk, or even climb stairs with the help of advanced sensors and motors that respond to their intentions.",
    "**Interactive Mobility Pod**: A compact, pod-like device that combines elements of a personal vehicle and a mobility aid. The pod would be controlled through a touchscreen interface and would allow users to travel short distances within buildings or urban environments. It could include features like climate control, entertainment systems, and charging stations for personal devices, making it a versatile option for daily movement.",
    "**Dynamic Floor Tiles**: Envision a system of smart floor tiles that can assist in mobility. These tiles would have the capability to move and shift in response to a user's position. For example, if a person is seated in a specific area, the tiles could gently elevate or create a smooth path to guide them to another location, reducing the need for manual mobility aids.",
    "**Mobile Robot Assistant**: A small, friendly robot designed to assist with mobility. This robot could carry items, help navigate through spaces, and provide companionship. It would be equipped with voice recognition and smart technology, allowing it to understand commands and assist the user in moving around by either pushing them in a wheelchair or guiding them on foot."
