    "**Integrated Solar Charging Panels**: Design a bicycle frame that incorporates lightweight, flexible solar panels. These panels could charge a built-in battery that powers lights, GPS, and even a small USB port for charging devices on the go. This eco-friendly solution would provide cyclists with a sustainable energy source while enhancing their safety and convenience during long rides.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Create a bicycle with an adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts based on terrain. Utilizing sensors to detect bumps, inclines, and declines, the system would provide a smoother ride by adjusting the shock absorbers in real-time. This would enhance comfort and performance, especially for mountain biking or commuting on uneven surfaces.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**: Introduce a modular accessory system that allows cyclists to easily attach and detach various components, such as baskets, lights, or even small trailers. Using a universal mounting system, users could customize their bikes for different activities—whether it's commuting, grocery shopping, or recreational riding—making it a versatile solution for diverse needs.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation Glasses**: Develop AR glasses specifically for cyclists that provide real-time navigation and performance metrics. These glasses could display turn-by-turn directions, speed, distance traveled, and even health stats like heart rate. By integrating voice commands, cyclists can keep their hands on the handlebars while accessing essential information, enhancing safety and focus on the road.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Tires**: Create a line of biodegradable bicycle tires made from sustainable materials that can break down naturally after their lifespan. These tires would reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance and durability. Additionally, they could incorporate puncture-resistant technology, ensuring cyclists enjoy a worry-free ride without compromising on eco-friendliness."
