    "**Modular Hanger System**: Create a modular clothes hanger system where users can customize their hangers with interchangeable components. For instance, users could add clips for pants, hooks for scarves, or specialized attachments for delicate items. This would allow for versatile storage solutions and maximize closet space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hangers**: Design hangers made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, that decompose naturally over time. Each hanger could come with a unique QR code that, when scanned, provides information about its eco-friendly materials and recycling instructions, promoting environmental consciousness.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Folding Mechanism**: Introduce a hanger that features a folding mechanism for easy storage and transport. This hanger could collapse flat when not in use, making it perfect for travel or for those with limited closet space. It could also be designed to hold clothes securely in a folded position, preventing creasing.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated Lighting**: Create a hanger equipped with LED lights that illuminate clothes when the closet door is opened. This feature would make it easier to find specific items in dark closets and add a touch of modern design. The lights could be motion-activated and energy-efficient, powered by small solar panels or batteries.",
    "**Color-Coded Organization System**: Design a set of hangers in various colors that correspond to specific clothing categories (e.g., casual, formal, seasonal). This would not only help users quickly identify the type of clothing but also add a visually appealing element to the closet. The hangers could also have labels or tags that can be customized for additional organization."
