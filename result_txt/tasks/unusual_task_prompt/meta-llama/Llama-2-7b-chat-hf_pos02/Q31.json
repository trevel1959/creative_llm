    "Smart Calculator with AI-Powered Problem-Solving: Create a calculator that utilizes AI to assist with complex calculations and problem-solving. The calculator could use machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns in the user's input and provide suggestions or solutions for difficult problems. This would make the calculator more than just a basic tool for basic arithmetic operations, but a powerful problem-solving aid for students, professionals, and researchers.",
    "Virtual Reality Calculator: Develop a virtual reality calculator that allows users to interact with mathematical concepts in a fully immersive environment. The calculator could use VR technology to create 3D models of geometric shapes, graphs, and other mathematical objects, allowing users to explore and interact with them in a way that is both intuitive and engaging. This would make learning and understanding mathematical concepts more fun and interactive, and could potentially improve retention rates.",
    "Calculator with Personalized Learning: Create a calculator that adapts to the user's skill level and learning style, providing customized lessons and exercises based on their needs. The calculator could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's input and adjust the difficulty level of the exercises accordingly. This would make the calculator more than just a tool for basic arithmetic operations, but a personalized learning platform that helps users improve their math skills.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface Calculator: Develop a calculator that uses brain-computer interface technology to allow users to perform calculations using only their thoughts. The calculator could use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect electrical activity in the brain and translate it into mathematical operations. This would allow users with disabilities or limitations to perform calculations in a more natural and intuitive way, without the need for manual input.",
    "Augmented Reality Calculator: Create an augmented reality calculator that overlays mathematical information onto the real world. The calculator could use AR technology to display virtual objects and interfaces that are superimposed onto real-world objects and surfaces. This would allow users to perform calculations in a more immersive and interactive way, and could potentially make learning and understanding mathematical concepts more engaging and fun."
