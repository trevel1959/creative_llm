    "**Modular Helmet Design**: Create a helmet with detachable components that can be customized based on the rider's needs. For example, users could attach visors for sun protection, ear covers for warmth, or additional padding for comfort. This would allow for year-round use and cater to different cycling environments, from urban commuting to mountain biking.",
    "**Integrated Cooling System**: Design a helmet with a built-in cooling system that uses small fans and moisture-wicking materials. This would keep the rider's head cool during hot weather, making long rides more comfortable. The fans could be powered by a small solar panel or rechargeable battery, ensuring they are eco-friendly.",
    "**Adaptive Fit Technology**: Implement a helmet that automatically adjusts its fit using smart materials or sensors. This could ensure optimal comfort and safety, as the helmet would adapt to the shape of the rider's head and even tighten during an impact to provide better protection.",
    "**Reflective and Color-Changing Material**: Use a special fabric that changes color based on the light conditions. For instance, the helmet could appear bright during the day for visibility but turn darker at night. Additionally, incorporating reflective strips that light up when headlights shine on them would enhance safety during nighttime rides.",
    "**Built-in Communication System**: Equip the helmet with Bluetooth technology and built-in speakers and microphones, allowing cyclists to take calls, listen to music, or communicate with fellow riders without needing to remove their helmets. This could enhance safety by keeping the rider's hands free while also allowing for navigation prompts through the app."
