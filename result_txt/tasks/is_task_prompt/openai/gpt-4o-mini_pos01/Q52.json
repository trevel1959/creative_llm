    "Once upon a time, in a lush green pond, there lived a little frog named Felix. He often gazed at the shimmering moonlight reflecting on the water and dreamed of becoming a prince. One night, a wise old owl perched nearby overheard his wish. The owl offered Felix a chance to be transformed into a prince for a single night. With a wave of its wing, Felix became a dashing young man. He danced under the stars, feeling joy and freedom. As dawn approached, he realized that true happiness lay not in being a prince but in embracing his unique frog self. ",
