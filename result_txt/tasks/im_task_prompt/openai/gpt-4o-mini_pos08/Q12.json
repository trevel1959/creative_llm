    "**Modular Wallet System**: Instead of a single bulky wallet, create a modular system where users can customize their wallets based on their needs. For example, a base wallet could hold cash and essential cards, while detachable modules could include a coin pouch, cardholder, or even a mini phone charger. This would allow users to mix and match components according to their daily requirements.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wallet Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a wallet made entirely from recycled materials, such as ocean plastics or repurposed textiles. This wallet would not only be stylish and functional but also promote sustainability. Users could have the option to personalize their wallet with unique patterns and colors derived from the materials used, creating a one-of-a-kind accessory.",
    "**Integrated RFID Protection with Anti-Theft Features**: Enhance wallet security by incorporating RFID-blocking technology to prevent unauthorized scanning of cards. Additionally, add an anti-theft feature, such as a small alarm that sounds if the wallet is moved or tampered with when the owner is away. This could be paired with a mobile app that alerts the user of potential theft attempts.",
    "**Digital Wallet with Cryptocurrency Support**: Create a hybrid wallet that combines traditional currency storage with a digital interface for managing cryptocurrencies. This wallet could have a built-in screen that displays balances and transaction history for both fiat and crypto assets. Users could also make contactless payments using either form of currency, bridging the gap between physical and digital financial management.",
    "**Health Tracking Wallet**: Integrate health tracking technology into the wallet, such as a small sensor that monitors vital signs (like heart rate) or tracks activity levels. This wallet could sync with a smartphone app, providing users with insights into their health while keeping their cards and cash secure. It could even offer reminders to take breaks or stand up, promoting a healthier lifestyle."
