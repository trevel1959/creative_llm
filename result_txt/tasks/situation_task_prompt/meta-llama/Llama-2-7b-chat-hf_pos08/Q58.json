    "Insect-based food sources: With all other animals gone, insects would become the primary source of protein for human survival. To address this challenge, we could focus on developing sustainable and eco-friendly insect farming practices. This could involve creating insect-based food products like insect protein powder, insect-based snacks, and even insect-based pet food. By leveraging this unique opportunity, we could create a new industry that not only provides a reliable source of protein but also helps to reduce the environmental impact of traditional livestock farming.",
    "Insect-repellent clothing: To deal with the pest problem, we could develop clothing made from natural materials that repel insects. This could involve using natural fibers like cotton, wool, and silk that are resistant to insect bites. Additionally, we could incorporate insect-repelling properties into the fabric through the use of natural oils or plant-based compounds. By creating clothing that keeps insects at bay, we could make outdoor activities more comfortable and enjoyable while also reducing the risk of insect-borne illnesses.",
    "Insect-friendly landscaping: Another approach to dealing with pests like insects would be to create insect-friendly landscapes. This could involve planting native vegetation that provides food and shelter for beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies. By creating a balance between human needs and insect needs, we could reduce the number of pests that pose a problem for humans. For example, bees are essential for pollination, and by providing them with food and shelter, we can encourage their populations to grow, which in turn can help to increase crop yields and reduce the need for pesticides.",
    "Insect-based medicine: Insects have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, and with the loss of other animals, insects could become an even more important source of medicinal compounds. We could focus on developing new drugs and therapies based on insect-derived compounds, such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and painkillers. By leveraging the unique properties of insects, we could create new treatments for a range of diseases and health conditions.",
