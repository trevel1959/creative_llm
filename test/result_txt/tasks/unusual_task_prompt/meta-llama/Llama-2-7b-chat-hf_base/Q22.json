    "Create a smartphone app that utilizes augmented reality to help people find their keys. The app can use the phone's camera to detect the user's surroundings and highlight the location of their keys in real-time. The app can also provide additional features such as a virtual keychain that allows users to keep track of their keys and receive notifications when they are in close proximity.",
    "Design a line of smart keychains that can be controlled using a smartphone app. These keychains can include features such as a built-in flashlight, a GPS tracker, and a remote control for other smart devices in the home. Users can use the app to lock and unlock their keychains, as well as receive notifications when they are in close proximity.",
    "Develop a key-sharing platform that allows users to securely share their keys with others. The platform can use blockchain technology to create a secure and decentralized network for key sharing, allowing users to trustlessly share their keys with others. The platform can also include features such as key verification and revocation, as well as a reputation system to ensure that users are sharing their keys with trustworthy individuals.",
    "Create a smart key that can be programmed to perform various tasks based on the user's preferences. For example, the key can be programmed to unlock the front door when the user is approaching the house, or to turn on the lights in the living room when the user enters the room. The key can also be programmed to perform more complex tasks such as starting a car or controlling a smart home system.",
    "Design a key that can be worn as a piece of jewelry. The key can be made of a durable material such as stainless steel or titanium, and can be designed to resemble a necklace or bracelet. The key can include features such as a built-in flashlight, a GPS tracker, and a panic button that can be used in case of emergency. The key can also be programmed to automatically unlock the user's front door when they are within a certain distance, providing an added layer of convenience and security."
