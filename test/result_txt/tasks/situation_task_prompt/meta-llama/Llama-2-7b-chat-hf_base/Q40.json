    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "Wave Power: Develop a device that harnesses the power of ocean waves to generate electricity. This device could be placed underwater or on the shore and would use the up-and-down motion of the waves to generate electricity, which could then be stored in a specialized battery.",
    "Human Power: Create a new type of battery that uses human energy to generate electricity. This battery would be worn on the body and would use the kinetic energy generated by the user's movements to generate electricity, which could then be stored in a specialized battery.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that uses living organisms to generate electricity. This battery would use microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast to convert organic matter into electricity, which could then be stored in a specialized battery.",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that uses compressed air to generate electricity. This battery would use a specialized valve to release compressed air, which would then expand and generate electricity, which could then be stored in a specialized battery."
