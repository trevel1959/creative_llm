    "Designing an interactive exhibit that showcases the effects of climate change through virtual reality simulations. The exhibit could feature different scenarios such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. Visitors could experience these scenarios firsthand and learn about the impact they have on our planet.",
    "Developing a mobile app that allows users to track their carbon footprint and provides tips for reducing it. The app could also include information on sustainable practices and ways to get involved in local environmental initiatives.",
    "Creating a series of educational videos that highlight the importance of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. These videos could be shared on social media platforms and schools to raise awareness about the benefits of clean energy.",
