    "A complete memory loss would cause chaos and confusion: People would forget everything, including their names, addresses, and even their loved ones. This would lead to a breakdown in social order, as people would be unable to function in their daily lives.",
    "Society would be forced to adapt: Without memory, people would have to rely on their instincts and basic survival skills. This would lead to a new way of life, as people would have to learn to survive without the aid of technology or modern conveniences.",
    "The world would be a blank slate: With no memory, people would have to start anew, building a new society from scratch. This would be a unique opportunity to create a world that is more just and equitable, as people would be able to start with a clean slate.",
    "The loss of memory would lead to a new form of communication: Without the ability to remember names or faces, people would have to find new ways to communicate with each other. This could lead to the development of new forms of language or sign language.",
    "The world would be a more peaceful place: Without memory, people would be unable to hold grudges or remember past wrongs. This would lead to a more peaceful world, as people would be able to move on from past conflicts and focus on building a better future."
