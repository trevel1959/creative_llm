    "**Smart Coat Rack**: This idea combines technology with traditional coat racks. The smart coat rack would be equipped with a touch screen display where users can input their personal preferences for temperature, lighting, and music. It could also include features like USB charging ports for electronic devices, motion sensors that turn on lights when someone approaches, and even a digital calendar or to-do list. This innovative coat rack would not only provide convenience but also enhance the user experience in public spaces such as offices, hotels, or cafes.",
    "**Recycling Coat Rack**: Design a coat rack that incorporates recycling bins into its structure. Users can hang their coats and bags while disposing of waste into designated compartments. This idea promotes environmental responsibility by encouraging people to recycle their waste before entering buildings. It could be particularly useful in areas where recycling facilities are not readily available, making it an attractive solution for eco-conscious individuals and businesses.",
    "**Interactive Art Coats Racks**: Create a coat rack that doubles as a piece of art or interactive installation. Each hook or arm could feature a unique design or artwork, reflecting the theme of the surrounding environment (e.g., nature, urban, abstract). Visitors can engage with the coat rack by interacting with the art pieces, perhaps through touch or augmented reality features that reveal additional information about the artwork. This concept would transform mundane coat-rack usage into a visually engaging and educational experience.",
    "**Customizable Coat Rack System**: Develop a modular coat rack system that allows users to add or remove components based on their specific needs. This system could include various attachments like hooks, shelves, and even small storage compartments. Users could choose from different materials, colors, and designs to match their personal style or office aesthetics. This flexibility would cater to a wide range of customers, from students to business professionals, ensuring the coat rack remains versatile and adaptable.",
    "**Sustainable Coat Rack with Built-in Planters**: Integrate vertical planters into the coat rack's design, allowing users to grow herbs, flowers, or small plants. This eco-friendly option provides a living element to the space, improving air quality and creating a more pleasant atmosphere. Additionally, it encourages a connection between nature and indoor spaces, promoting mindfulness and relaxation. This innovative idea could be especially appealing to those working in high-stress environments or looking for ways to incorporate greenery into their living or working spaces."
