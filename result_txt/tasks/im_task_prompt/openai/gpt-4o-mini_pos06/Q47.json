    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a vacuum cleaner that features a self-cleaning mechanism for its filters and brushes. Utilizing a combination of ultrasonic waves and air pressure, the vacuum could dislodge dust and debris from its components, significantly extending the lifespan of filters and reducing maintenance for the user.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptation**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a smart sensor that automatically adjusts its suction power and brush type based on the surface being cleaned. For example, it could switch between hard floors, carpets, and rugs seamlessly, optimizing cleaning efficiency and minimizing the risk of damage to delicate surfaces.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Disposal**: Create a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a biodegradable dust bag or container made from sustainable materials. After use, users could simply bury the bag in their garden, where it would decompose, returning nutrients to the soil. This would address the waste issue associated with traditional vacuum bags and promote eco-friendliness.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Design a vacuum cleaner that also functions as an air purifier. It could have a dual-mode operation where, while vacuuming, it captures allergens and pollutants in the air, providing a two-in-one solution for cleaner floors and improved indoor air quality. The air purification system could include HEPA filters and UV-C light technology to kill airborne pathogens.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cleaning Guide**: Incorporate AR technology that connects to a smartphone app. When users point their device at a surface, the app could overlay visual guides indicating the most effective cleaning methods, areas that need extra attention, and tips for maintaining different types of flooring. This feature would educate users and enhance their cleaning experience."
