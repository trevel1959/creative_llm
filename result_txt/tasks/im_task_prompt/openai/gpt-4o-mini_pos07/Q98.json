    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a juicer with a built-in self-cleaning system. After juicing, users could simply add water and a cleaning solution, and the juicer would automatically clean its internal components using high-pressure jets and a rotating brush. This feature would save time and encourage more frequent use by eliminating the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Modular Juicing System**: Create a modular juicer that allows users to swap out components based on their juicing needs. For example, users could have different juicing attachments for soft fruits, hard vegetables, and leafy greens. This would enable optimal juicing for various ingredients, improving yield and flavor while reducing waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the juicer using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, the juicer could be designed to minimize energy consumption during operation. An energy-efficient motor and solar charging options could make it appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Juice Infuser**: Incorporate an infusion chamber into the juicer that allows users to infuse their juices with herbs, spices, or superfoods. This feature would enable the creation of unique flavor combinations and enhance the nutritional value of the juice. Users could add items like ginger, turmeric, or mint, and the juicer would blend them into the juice seamlessly.",
    "**Personalized Juice Packs**: Partner with a subscription service to offer pre-packaged, frozen juice packs that contain pre-measured ingredients. Users could simply pop the pack into the juicer, add water, and blend. This would simplify the juicing process, reduce prep time, and ensure that users have a variety of fresh juice options without needing to shop for ingredients regularly."
