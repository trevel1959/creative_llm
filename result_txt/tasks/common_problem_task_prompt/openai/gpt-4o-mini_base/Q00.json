    "**Overstimulation**: Young children can easily become overwhelmed with too much noise, activity, or a large number of guests. This could lead to tantrums or meltdowns. To prevent this, plan a structured schedule with calm periods, such as storytelling or a quiet craft activity, mixed with more energetic games. Additionally, consider limiting the guest list to a manageable number to create a more intimate and comfortable environment.",
    "**Food Allergies**: At age five, children may have food allergies that can be easily overlooked. To avoid potential health issues, send out invitations that include a request for any allergies or dietary restrictions. Offer a variety of snacks that cater to common allergies (gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free) and have clear labeling on all food items. Consider a fun DIY snack station where kids can customize their treats while ensuring safety.",
    "**Weather Uncertainty**: If the party is planned outdoors, inclement weather could pose a significant problem. To address this, have a backup plan in place, such as reserving a space indoors or having tents ready for unexpected rain. Additionally, keep an eye on the weather forecast leading up to the event and communicate any changes to guests promptly.",
    "**Engagement Levels**: Children have varying attention spans, and what entertains one child may bore another. To keep everyone engaged, plan a mix of activities that cater to different interests and energy levels, such as an obstacle course, a craft table, and interactive games. You might also consider hiring an entertainer, like a magician or clown, who can adapt their performance based on the audience’s reactions.",
    "**Gift Overload**: Kids often receive many gifts, which can lead to feelings of jealousy or disappointment if one child feels their gift is less impressive than others. To foster a positive atmosphere, consider a “no gifts” policy or suggest that guests contribute to a group gift. Alternatively, you could organize a “gift-opening party” after the event where children can celebrate each gift and share in the excitement."
