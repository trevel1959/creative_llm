    "Magnifying Glasses with Built-in Camera: Develop a wearable device that incorporates a high-powered magnifying glass with a built-in camera. This device would allow individuals with poor vision to take photos or videos of objects and text, which can then be magnified on a digital screen for easier viewing. The camera would also allow for real-time magnification of the surrounding environment, making it easier for individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Design contact lenses with an integrated microchip that can enhance vision. These lenses would use artificial intelligence to analyze the wearer's surroundings and automatically adjust the level of magnification or contrast to improve visibility. The microchip could also be programmed to recognize and highlight specific objects or text, making it easier for individuals with poor vision to read or recognize faces.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Glasses: Develop a pair of glasses that use a brain-computer interface to enhance vision. The glasses would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect electrical activity in the wearer's brain and use this information to adjust the level of magnification or contrast in real-time. This would allow individuals with poor vision to control the level of magnification and contrast directly from their brain, making it easier to see and interact with their surroundings.",
    "3D Printed Glasses: Create a pair of glasses with lenses that can be 3D printed to match the wearer's unique prescription. These glasses would be customized to the wearer's specific needs, providing the highest level of accuracy and comfort. The 3D printing process would also allow for the creation of lenses with unique features, such as anti-reflective coatings or tinted lenses, to enhance visibility and comfort.",
    "Retinal Implant: Develop a retinal implant that can restore vision to individuals with severe vision loss. This implant would use a microchip to bypass damaged or non-functional retinal cells and directly stimulate the visual pathway in the brain. The implant would be surgically implanted in the eye and could be controlled using a remote control or brain-computer interface. This would allow individuals with severe vision loss to"
