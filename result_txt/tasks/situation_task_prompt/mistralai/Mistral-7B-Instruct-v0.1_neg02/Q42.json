    "Build a shelter using natural resources: I would start by finding a sturdy branch or tree to use as a base, and then gather leaves, grass, and other natural materials to create a makeshift roof. I would also try to find or rocks to use as a fire source, and use that to cook food and boil water.",
    "Find food and water: I would look for edible plants and fruits, and also try to catch fish or small animals for food. I would also look for a source of fresh water, such as a stream or waterfall, and use a container to collect it.",
    "Build a raft: I would try to build a raft using natural materials such as branches, leaves, and vines. I would then use the raft to travel to other islands or to try to find a way off the deserted island.",
    "Signal for help: I would try to build a signal using natural materials such as fire, smoke, and mirrors. I would also try to build a message in the sand or use a natural landmark to attract the attention of passing ships or planes.",
    "Learn survival skills: I would try to learn as much as I can about survival on a deserted island, such as how to start a fire, how to find food and water, and how to build a shelter. I would also try to find a way to communicate with the outside world, such as by building a radio or using a mirror to signal for help."
