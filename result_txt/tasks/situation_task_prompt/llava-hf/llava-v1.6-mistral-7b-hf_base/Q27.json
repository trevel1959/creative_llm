    "Passive Solar Design: Use the sun's energy to regulate indoor temperature. This can be achieved by designing a building with large windows on the south-facing side to let in sunlight during the winter months and shading on the north-facing side to block out the sun during the summer months.",
    "Insulation: Improve the insulation of your home to reduce heat transfer. This can be done by adding insulation to walls, attic, and floors to keep the heat inside during the winter months and out during the summer months.",
    "Natural Ventilation: Use natural ventilation to regulate indoor temperature. This can be achieved by opening windows and doors to let in fresh air during the cooler parts of the day and night.",
    "Ceiling Fans: Use ceiling fans to circulate air and create a more comfortable indoor temperature. This can be done by using the fan to blow cool air down during the summer months and reverse the fan to blow warm air up during the winter months.",
    "Radiant Heating: Use radiant heating to heat your home by installing heating elements in the floor or walls. This can be done by using electric or hydronic heating systems to provide a comfortable indoor temperature."
