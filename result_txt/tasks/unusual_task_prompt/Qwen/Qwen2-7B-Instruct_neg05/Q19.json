    "**Innovative Candle Design**: Design a line of candles that doubles as a creative tool for personal expression. Each candle is shaped like a sketchbook, journal, or art supplies, such as a paintbrush, pencil, or palette. Inside, there are different fragrances representing various moods or artistic emotions (e.g., inspiration, frustration, joy). The scent fills the room as you light the candle, helping to set the atmosphere for your creative work.",
    "**Scented Candle Subscription Service**: Create a subscription service where customers can choose from a variety of candle scents, each inspired by a famous painting, sculpture, or artist. For example, a \"Van Gogh Starry Night\" candle might have a blend of lavender, mint, and a hint of blueberry, evoking feelings of tranquility and the night sky. Customers receive new scents monthly, each accompanied by a brief history of the artwork and its impact on society.",
    "**DIY Candle Workshop**: Host workshops where participants learn to create their own candles using eco-friendly wax and essential oils. They can choose their fragrance based on their preferences, whether it's calming lavender for relaxation, energizing citrus for productivity, or spicy cinnamon for comfort. The workshop also includes tips on how to incorporate crystals or herbs into the candles for additional benefits, like enhancing focus or promoting sleep.",
    "**Candle and Art Therapy**: Develop a program that combines the therapeutic benefits of art-making with the calming effect of candle lighting. Participants engage in guided drawing, painting, or other art forms while enjoying a relaxing candle-lit environment. The session could include discussions on the symbolism of colors and fragrances, helping individuals connect emotionally with their creations.",
    "**Candle-Scented Clothing Line**: Collaborate with fashion designers to create a collection of clothing items infused with candle scents. Each garment would be made with fibers treated with a long-lasting fragrance oil that mimics the scent of a particular candle. This way, wearers can enjoy the aroma of their favorite candles even when they're not lighting them, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort throughout the day."
