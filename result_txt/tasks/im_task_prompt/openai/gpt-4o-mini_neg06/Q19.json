    "**Adjustable Tint Technology**: Create glasses that feature adjustable tint technology, allowing users to change the lens tint based on lighting conditions. Using a small touchpad or voice command, users could switch between clear, tinted, or polarized lenses, providing optimal vision in various environments, such as bright sunlight or dimly lit rooms.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the frame of the glasses. These sensors could track vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and even stress indicators. The data could be synced with a smartphone app, offering users insights into their health and wellness, and potentially alerting them to any concerning changes.",
    "**Personalized Frame Designs**: Introduce a service that allows users to customize their glasses frames using 3D printing technology. Customers could choose materials, colors, patterns, and even engrave their names or meaningful symbols on the frames. This would not only make glasses more personal but also encourage self-expression and creativity.",
    "**Built-in Noise-Cancellation Technology**: Develop glasses with built-in noise-cancellation technology that uses tiny microphones to detect ambient noise and counteract it with sound waves. This would be particularly beneficial for people in noisy environments, such as busy streets or public transportation, allowing them to focus better on their tasks or enjoy music without needing headphones.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a line of glasses made from sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include recycled plastics, bamboo, or even innovative materials derived from natural sources. Promoting eco-conscious eyewear would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and help reduce plastic waste in the eyewear industry."
