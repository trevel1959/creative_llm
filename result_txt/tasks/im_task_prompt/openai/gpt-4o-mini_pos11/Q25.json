    "**Smart Stapler**: Incorporate a small LCD screen and Bluetooth technology into the stapler, allowing it to connect to a smartphone app. The app could track how many staples are used, remind users when theyâ€™re running low on staples, and even suggest optimal stapling techniques for different types of paper. Additionally, it could have a built-in sensor to detect the thickness of the stack and adjust staple size accordingly.",
    "**Modular Stapler**: Create a modular stapler that allows users to customize it with different attachments. For example, users could add a punch attachment for creating holes, a paper trimmer, or even a small storage compartment for extra staples. This would make the stapler a multifunctional tool, ideal for office environments or creative spaces.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Stapler**: Redesign the stapler to focus on ergonomics, making it more comfortable to use for extended periods. Features could include a cushioned grip, adjustable angles for different hand sizes, and a lightweight body. This design would help reduce hand strain and fatigue, making it ideal for professionals who staple frequently.",
    "**Interactive Stapler**: Develop a stapler that provides feedback when used correctly or incorrectly. For instance, it could have an integrated light or sound feature that indicates whether the staple has been applied successfully or if there was an error (like misalignment). This could help users learn proper stapling techniques and reduce the number of jams.",
    "**Artistic Stapler**: Create a line of staplers with customizable, artistic designs. Users could purchase blank staplers and use special markers or paints to decorate them, turning them into personal art pieces. Additionally, limited-edition designs could feature popular art styles or collaborations with local artists, making the stapler not just a tool but also a statement piece."
