    "Digital Note-taking: In a world without paper, the most obvious solution would be to switch to digital note-taking. There are countless apps available that allow users to take notes, make to-do lists, and even draw diagrams on a digital canvas. These apps can be synced across multiple devices, making it easy to access your notes from anywhere.",
    "Voice Recording: Another option would be to use voice recording technology to capture important information. Voice notes can be transcribed into text and saved for later reference. This could be particularly useful for meetings or lectures where taking notes would be difficult or impractical.",
    "Photography: Photographs can be used to capture important information in a visual format. This could be particularly useful for recording events, such as a wedding or a family gathering. Photographs can be easily stored and accessed on a computer or mobile device.",
    "3D Printing: If paper is no longer available, 3D printing could be used to create physical objects that contain important information. For example, a 3D printed model of a product could be used to record its specifications and dimensions.",
    "Augmented Reality: Augmented reality technology could be used to create interactive, digital experiences that overlay information onto the physical world. This could be particularly useful for learning new skills or exploring historical sites."
