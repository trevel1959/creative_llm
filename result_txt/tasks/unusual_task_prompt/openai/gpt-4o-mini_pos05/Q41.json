    "**Confetti Maker**: Instead of just sharpening pencils, use the sharpener to create colorful confetti from old colored pencils or crayons. Simply insert the pencil or crayon and twist. The shavings will fall out in fun, small pieces that can be used for party decorations or craft projects.",
    "**Mini Candle Holder**: If you have small candle stubs left over from larger candles, a pencil sharpener can serve as a unique holder. Place the stub in the larger opening of the sharpener, and it will fit snugly, allowing you to burn the candle safely without it tipping over.",
    "**Nail File**: The fine, abrasive surface of a pencil sharpener can be repurposed as a nail file. Gently run your nails against the sharpener's edges to smooth out rough edges or shape your nails. This is a great travel hack when you forget to pack your nail file.",
    "**Miniature Sculpting Tool**: Artists can use the sharpener's blades for detailed sculpting in clay or other malleable materials. The different sizes of the openings can help create various textures or grooves in the material, providing a unique tool for intricate designs.",
    "**Scented Potpourri Shredder**: For those who enjoy crafting their own potpourri, a pencil sharpener can be used to shred dried flowers and spices into smaller pieces. This allows for a more fragrant and aesthetically pleasing mix that can be used in sachets or decorative bowls."
