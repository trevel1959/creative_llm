    "**Solar Shield Helmet**: Design a lightweight, aerodynamic helmet with a built-in, adjustable solar panel that generates a cooling effect, providing protection from the sun's rays. The helmet would also feature a built-in, detachable parasol that can be easily deployed to provide extra shade. The parasol would be made of a lightweight, water-resistant material with a reflective coating to further reduce heat gain. (Confidence score: 0.95)",
    "**Hair Replacement with UV-Blocking Materials**: Develop a range of UV-blocking materials that can be used to create a hair replacement system. This could include wigs, toupees, or even hair extensions made from materials like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide-infused fibers. These materials would not only provide protection from the sun but also be breathable, comfortable, and easy to maintain. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Sunscreen-Infused Headband**: Design a headband with integrated sunscreen-infused fibers that provide long-lasting protection against UV radiation. The headband would be made of a breathable, moisture-wicking material that keeps the skin cool and dry, while the sunscreen-infused fibers would provide a broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays. (Confidence score: 0.88)",
    "**Personal Sun Umbrella**: Create a compact, portable sun umbrella that can be easily attached to a headband or a hat. The umbrella would feature a sturdy, water-resistant design with a built-in, adjustable sunshade that provides extra protection from the sun's rays. The umbrella would also be equipped with a built-in cooling system that uses evaporation to lower the temperature around the head. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Reflective Headgear with Built-in Cooling System**: Design a headgear system that incorporates a reflective material to deflect UV radiation, while also featuring a built-in cooling system that uses evaporation to lower the temperature around the head. The headgear would be made of a lightweight, breathable material that allows for airflow and moisture transfer, ensuring a comfortable wear experience. (Confidence score: 0.82)"
