    "Gravity-based Solar System: In this redesign, each planet's gravity would be optimized to create a harmonious balance between the planets' orbits and their distances from the sun. This would result in a more stable and efficient solar system, with longer-lasting orbits and reduced gravitational interactions between the planets. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Habitable Exoplanet Chain: The redesigned solar system would consist of a chain of habitable exoplanets, each with its own unique environment and conditions. The planets would be positioned in a specific order, with increasing distance from the sun, to create a gradient of temperature and atmosphere. This would allow for a diverse range of ecosystems and potential for life to thrive on each planet. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Solar-Powered Spiral Galaxy: In this design, the solar system would be reimagined as a spiral galaxy, with the sun at its center. The planets would be arranged in a spiral pattern, with each planet's orbit following a logarithmic spiral path. This would create a visually striking and dynamic solar system, with each planet's distance from the sun determining its climate and environment. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Multi-Dimensional Solar System: The redesigned solar system would exist in multiple dimensions, with each planet occupying a unique dimension. This would create a vast and complex system, with each planet's environment and conditions determined by its dimensional position. This design would also allow for the possibility of interdimensional travel and communication between the planets. Confidence score: 0.98",
    "Solar System Artificial Gravity: In this redesign, the solar system would be entirely artificial, with each planet created through advanced technology and engineering. The planets would be designed to mimic the conditions of natural celestial bodies, with advanced gravity manipulation systems allowing for the creation of stable and habitable environments. This would allow for the creation of a solar system that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Confidence score: 0.99"
