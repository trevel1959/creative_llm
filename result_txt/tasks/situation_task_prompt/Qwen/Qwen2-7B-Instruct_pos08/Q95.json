    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be filled with air or water. This allows it to adjust to different shapes and sizes. It could also be deflated and stored easily when not in use. For sleeping, you could inflate it under your head and neck for support.",
    "**Flexible Pillow Roll**: Create a roll of thin, flexible foam or fabric that can be bent into any shape. This can be used to prop up the head on a bookshelf, table, or even a corner of a couch. The flexibility allows it to adapt to various positions and spaces.",
    "**Heated Pillow Alternative**: Develop a heated neck wrap or scarf that can be worn around the neck while sleeping. This provides warmth and comfort without the bulk of a traditional pillow. It can be heated using a battery pack or a heating pad.",
    "**Gravity-Responsive Pillow**: Design a pillow that adjusts its firmness based on gravity and your body's position. For example, when lying down, the pillow becomes softer to conform to your head and neck, providing better support. When sitting up, it becomes firmer for comfort.",
    "**Water-Infused Pillow**: Inventing a pillow that uses water for support can be an innovative solution. The pillow would have a reservoir of water inside, which can be filled to different levels for varying degrees of firmness. This allows customization of the pillow's hardness according to personal preference."
