    "Scheduling conflicts: With many actors, creative teams, and other production staff involved in the production of a Broadway musical, scheduling conflicts can arise. Coordinating everyone's availability and ensuring that everyone can make it to rehearsals and performances on time can be a logistical challenge.",
    "Technical difficulties: A Broadway musical requires a lot of technical elements, such as lighting, sound, and set design. Ensuring that all of these elements are in place and functioning properly can be a difficult and time-consuming task, and technical difficulties can cause delays and disruptions during performances.",
    "Critical reception: A Broadway musical is only as good as its critical reception. If the show is not well-received by audiences and critics, it can be difficult to recoup the costs of producing the show, and the show may close early."
