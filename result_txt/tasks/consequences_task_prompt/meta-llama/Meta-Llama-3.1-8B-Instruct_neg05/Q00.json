    "**Dream Incubators Become Life-Changing Tools**: In a world where humans can't sleep, dream incubators become a necessity. These devices can manipulate and control dreams, allowing people to enter a simulated sleep state where they can recharge and process information. This technology would revolutionize industries like education, therapy, and entertainment, as people could learn, heal, and experience new things through controlled dreamscapes.",
    "**Caffeine and Stimulant Overload**: Without sleep, people would rely heavily on caffeine and other stimulants to stay awake. However, this would lead to widespread addiction, as the body craves the temporary energy boost. The black market for stimulants would flourish, and the health consequences would be dire, with increased rates of heart problems, anxiety, and depression.",
    "**Neuroplasticity and Brain Reorganization**: In the absence of sleep, the brain would undergo significant changes to adapt to the new reality. Neuroplasticity would allow the brain to reorganize and compensate for the lack of sleep, but this could lead to unintended consequences, such as altered cognitive functions, mood swings, and even changes in personality.",
    "**Economic and Social Collapse**: The loss of sleep would have a devastating impact on the economy and society. Productivity would plummet, and the workforce would struggle to maintain even the most basic tasks. Social structures would break down, and governments would struggle to maintain order, leading to widespread chaos and potential collapse.",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptations and New Species**: In the long term, humans might adapt to the lack of sleep through evolutionary changes. This could lead to the emergence of new species or subspecies that have evolved to thrive in a sleepless world. These beings might have altered physiology, such as larger eyes, more efficient energy production, or even the ability to enter a state of suspended animation. The possibilities for evolution would be endless, and humanity might give rise to a new, sleepless branch of the human family tree. </s> "
