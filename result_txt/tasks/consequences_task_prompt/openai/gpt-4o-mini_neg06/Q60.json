    "**Regulation of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: With internet access deemed a human right, there would be increased scrutiny and regulation of ISPs. Governments might impose strict guidelines to prevent monopolistic practices, ensure fair pricing, and maintain net neutrality. This would empower consumers and foster a competitive market where ISPs must improve service quality and accessibility, ultimately benefiting users.",
    "**Increased Focus on Digital Literacy**: Recognizing the internet as a basic human right would likely lead to a stronger emphasis on digital literacy programs. Schools, community centers, and non-profits would collaborate to provide training on how to effectively use the internet, navigate online resources, and stay safe in the digital space. This would empower individuals to make the most of their online access, fostering a more informed and engaged society.",
    "**Enhanced Privacy Protections**: As internet access becomes a fundamental right, there would likely be a push for stronger privacy protections for users. Governments may enact legislation to safeguard personal data, prevent surveillance, and ensure that individuals have control over their online information. This could lead to a more secure online environment, encouraging more people to participate in the digital world without fear of exploitation or misuse of their data.",
    "**Global Collaboration for Internet Access**: The recognition of internet access as a human right could spark international collaboration to address global connectivity issues. Countries may work together to develop technologies and share resources aimed at providing internet access in remote or impoverished regions. This could also lead to the establishment of international treaties or agreements focused on promoting internet access as a fundamental right, fostering global cooperation.",
    "**Economic Growth and Innovation**: Making internet access a basic human right could stimulate economic growth and innovation. With more people online, there would be a larger market for digital services, e-commerce, and online education. Startups and businesses could thrive in a more connected world, leading to job creation and increased economic opportunities. This would also encourage innovation in technology, as companies seek to develop new solutions to meet the needs of a more digitally inclusive population."
