    "**Smart Mouse with Integrated Gesture Recognition**: Design a computer mouse that can recognize hand gestures, allowing users to control their computer with a wave of their hand. The mouse would feature advanced sensors and AI-powered algorithms to detect and interpret hand movements, enabling users to navigate through menus, scroll through documents, and even interact with virtual objects in 3D space. The mouse could also come with a built-in touchscreen display, allowing users to select options and input data directly on the mouse.",
    "**Ergonomic Mouse with Adaptive Grip**: Develop a computer mouse that adjusts its shape and size to fit the user's hand, providing optimal comfort and support. The mouse would feature a unique, flexible design that can change its shape in response to the user's grip, ensuring a secure and comfortable hold. The adaptive grip technology would also allow the mouse to adjust to different hand sizes and shapes, making it accessible to users with varying hand sizes and abilities.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Mouse with Tactile Display**: Create a computer mouse that provides haptic feedback and tactile sensations, allowing users to feel textures, patterns, and vibrations on their fingertips. The mouse would feature a built-in tactile display that can simulate various sensations, such as rough stone, smooth glass, or even the sensation of typing on a keyboard. This technology would enhance the user experience, making it feel more immersive and engaging.",
    "**Wireless Mouse with Integrated Power Harvesting**: Design a wireless computer mouse that can harness energy from its surroundings, eliminating the need for batteries or charging. The mouse would feature advanced power-harvesting technology that can capture energy from ambient light, radio waves, or even vibrations, allowing it to operate indefinitely. This innovative design would make the mouse a sustainable and eco-friendly option for users.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Mouse with Neurofeedback**: Develop a computer mouse that can read brain signals and translate them into computer commands, allowing users to control their computer with their thoughts. The mouse would feature advanced BCI technology that can detect neural activity, enabling users to navigate through menus, select options, and even create digital art with their minds. The BCI mouse would also provide users with real-time neurofeedback, helping them monitor and control their brain activity. </s>[/INST] Assistant: These ideas are all creative and original, and they offer innovative solutions to common problems with computer mice.
