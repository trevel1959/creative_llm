    "**Inflatable Insulated Sleeping Bag:** Design a sleeping bag that inflates like a camping mattress but retains the warmth of traditional sleeping bags. The bag would have multiple layers for insulation and a durable fabric exterior. The inflation feature allows for easy setup and packing, making it convenient for outdoor activities. The design could also include an integrated pillow or adjustable headrest for added comfort.",
    "**Solar-Powered Heating Sleeping Bag:** Create a sleeping bag equipped with a small solar panel on one side. The bag would contain a heating element powered by the solar panel, providing warmth in cold environments without relying on batteries or external power sources. This design would be particularly beneficial for eco-conscious campers and hikers.",
    "**Convertible Sleep System:** Develop a sleeping bag that can transform into a blanket or a sleeping mat when not in use as a sleeping bag. This system would be especially useful for space-saving storage in vehicles or for backpacking trips where every inch of space matters. The bag could be made from lightweight, versatile materials and feature a compact roll-up design.",
    "**Hybrid Sleeping Bag:** Combine a sleeping bag with a tent-like structure to create a compact, multi-functional shelter. This design would offer a comfortable sleeping area and provide additional protection against weather conditions, such as rain or wind. It could be designed for easy setup and takedown, making it suitable for both solo adventurers and families.",
    "**Smart Sleeping Bag with Health Monitoring:** Integrate a wearable tech component into the sleeping bag that monitors heart rate, body temperature, and sleep patterns. The bag could wirelessly transmit this data to a companion app or smartwatch, allowing users to track their sleep quality and make necessary adjustments to their environment or routine. This feature would be particularly appealing to health-conscious individuals and athletes who prioritize their sleep."
