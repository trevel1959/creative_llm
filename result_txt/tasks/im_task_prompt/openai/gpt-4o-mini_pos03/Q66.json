    "**Modular Compartments**: Create a picnic basket with modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the type of picnic. For instance, sections for utensils, plates, and food could be designed as stackable containers that can be taken out individually. This would allow users to customize the basket’s layout depending on whether they’re having a beach picnic, a hike, or a romantic dinner in the park.",
    "**Smart Picnic Basket**: Incorporate technology by developing a smart picnic basket equipped with a Bluetooth speaker, a power bank for charging devices, and an app that helps users plan their picnic. The app could suggest recipes based on dietary preferences, provide weather updates, and even track the location of the picnic spot. Additionally, the basket could feature solar panels to charge the power bank while outdoors.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the picnic basket by constructing it from sustainable, biodegradable materials. This could include using recycled plastics or natural fibers such as bamboo or jute. The design could also feature a detachable lining made from compostable materials that can be disposed of after use, promoting an eco-conscious approach to outdoor dining.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Transform the picnic basket into a multi-functional piece of equipment. For example, the basket could have a collapsible design that converts into a picnic table or a set of chairs. This could be achieved by integrating lightweight, foldable components that provide seating or a flat surface for dining, making it perfect for outdoor gatherings without needing to carry extra furniture.",
    "**Built-in Game Compartment**: Add a fun twist to the picnic basket by including a built-in compartment for games and activities. This could feature a foldable board game, a deck of cards, or even a set of travel-sized sports equipment like a frisbee or a mini football. The compartment could be designed to be easily accessible, encouraging social interaction and entertainment during the picnic."
