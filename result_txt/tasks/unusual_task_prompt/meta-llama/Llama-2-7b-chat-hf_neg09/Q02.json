    "Virtual reality experience: Create a virtual reality experience where the user wears a VR headset and is placed in a room with a rubber hand. The user can then interact with the virtual environment and objects around them, while the rubber hand remains stationary. This can help individuals to better understand the concept of embodiment and the relationship between their body and their sense of self.",
    "Interactive art installation: Design an interactive art installation that incorporates a rubber hand into the design. The installation could be a large room with walls covered in mirrors, and a rubber hand placed in the center of the room. As visitors move around the room, their reflections are mirrored onto the rubber hand, creating a surreal and disorienting experience.",
    "Sensory deprivation chamber: Build a sensory deprivation chamber where the user is placed in a dark, soundproof room with only the rubber hand as a visual stimulus. The user is then asked to focus on the rubber hand and visualize their own body, while being deprived of all sensory input. This can help individuals to better understand the role of sensory input in shaping their sense of self.",
    "Augmented reality game: Develop an augmented reality game where the player uses a mobile device to interact with a virtual rubber hand. The player can manipulate the rubber hand in 3D space, and the game will respond accordingly. This can help individuals to better understand the relationship between their body and their sense of self in a virtual environment.",
    "Immersive theater performance: Create an immersive theater performance where the audience is surrounded by a rubber hand on all sides. The performance could involve actors interacting with the rubber hand, and the audience is encouraged to interact with the rubber hand as well. This can help individuals to better understand the role of embodiment in shaping our sense of self and our interactions with others."
