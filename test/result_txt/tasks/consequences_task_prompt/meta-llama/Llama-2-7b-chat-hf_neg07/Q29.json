    "Overwhelming amount of information: If all humans could remember everything they read, the amount of information stored in their minds would be overwhelming. It would be like trying to hold an entire library in your head without any organization or structure. This would make it difficult to process and retain any new information, as the sheer volume of memories would be too much to handle.",
    "Information overload: With the ability to remember everything, people would be constantly bombarded with information from various sources. This could lead to information overload, making it challenging to focus on any one thing. People might find themselves constantly switching between different memories, unable to concentrate on a single task.",
    "Difficulty in learning new things: With the ability to remember everything, there would be little room for new information to be learned. People might struggle to absorb new knowledge, as their minds would be filled with existing memories. This could lead to a lack of innovation and progress in various fields.",
    "Memory clutter: As people accumulated more and more memories, their minds would become cluttered with irrelevant information. This could lead to difficulty in finding specific memories or recalling important details. People might find themselves spending more time organizing and categorizing their memories than actually using them.",
    "Mental health concerns: The constant barrage of memories could take a toll on mental health. People might experience anxiety or depression as they struggle to cope with the sheer volume of information in their minds.
