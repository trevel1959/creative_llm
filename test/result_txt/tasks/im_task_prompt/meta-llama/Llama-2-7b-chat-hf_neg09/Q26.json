    "A Smart Trash Can with AI: Create a trash can that uses AI to sort and compact trash. The can would have a built-in camera and AI software to identify and separate different types of trash, such as plastic, glass, and paper. Once sorted, the can would use a compactor to compress the trash into a smaller volume, making it easier to dispose of. This would not only make the trash can more efficient but also reduce the amount of space needed for waste disposal.",
    "Trash Can with Built-In Composter: Design a trash can that includes a built-in composter. The can would have a special compartment for food waste, which would be broken down by microorganisms in the composter. The resulting compost could then be used as fertilizer for plants, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. This trash can would not only help with food waste management but also promote sustainable gardening practices.",
    "Self-Cleaning Trash Can: Create a trash can with a built-in self-cleaning mechanism. The can would have a special coating or material that could be cleaned with water or a mild detergent. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and reduce the amount of bacteria and odors associated with trash cans. The self-cleaning mechanism would also help to keep the trash can smelling fresh and clean.",
    "Trash Can with Air Purifying Technology: Design a trash can that incorporates air purifying technology. The can would have a special filter that could remove pollutants and allergens from the air, making it a healthier environment for people and pets. This trash can would not only help to reduce air pollution but also provide a healthier living space.",
    "Trash Can with Integrated Recycling System: Create a trash can that includes an integrated recycling system. The can would have separate compartments for different types of recyclables, such as plastic, glass, and paper. The can would also have a built-in system for separating the recyclables from the trash, making it easier for people to recycle more effectively. This trash can would not only reduce waste but also promote recycling and sustainability"
