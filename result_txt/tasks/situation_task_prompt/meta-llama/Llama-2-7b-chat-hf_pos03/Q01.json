    "Carrier Pigeons: Carrier pigeons are trained birds that can be used to send messages over long distances. They could be trained to fly between countries, carrying letters or small messages with them. This method would be reliable and relatively fast, as pigeons can fly at speeds of up to 80 km/h.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location. They could be used to send messages between countries by releasing them at the border and having them fly back to their home location, where the message could be retrieved.",
    "Signal Fires: In the past, signal fires were used to communicate over long distances. A series of fires could be lit along a designated route, with each fire representing a letter of the alphabet. The fires could be used to spell out messages, allowing communication between countries.",
    "Mirror Signals: This method involves using mirrors to reflect sunlight and create a signal that can be seen from a distance. A message could be written on a piece of paper and placed in a mirror, then angled so that the reflection of the sun's light would spell out the message. This method would be most effective at midday when the sun is highest in the sky.",
    "Smoke Signals: Smoke signals have been used for centuries to communicate over long distances. By burning a piece of cloth or other material, a message could be conveyed through smoke. This method would be most effective in areas with clear visibility and good air quality."
