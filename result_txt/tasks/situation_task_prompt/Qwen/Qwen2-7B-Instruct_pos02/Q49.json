    "**Water-filled Containers:** One creative idea could be to create your own fire-extinguishing containers by filling large, durable plastic or metal containers with water. Place these strategically around your house. In case of a fire, these can be used as a quick source of water to extinguish flames. You might also consider installing a water sprinkler system if possible.",
    "**Portable Fire Extinguishers:** Invest in multiple portable fire extinguishers of different types (Class A, B, C, and K) for different kinds of fires. Keep them easily accessible throughout your home. This ensures you have immediate access to the appropriate tool for any type of fire that might occur.",

This should include meeting points outside the house, clear routes to exit the property, and instructions on what items to grab before leaving. Practicing this plan regularly ensures everyone knows what to do during an emergency.",
    "**Smoke Detectors and Carbon Monoxide Alarms:** Install high-quality smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms in critical areas of your home. Ensure they are checked and maintained regularly to function properly. These devices can provide early warning, giving you time to react before the situation escalates.",
