    "**Eco-Friendly Sponge Manufacturing**: Develop a biodegradable sponge made from natural materials like coconut coir, bamboo fibers, or mushroom mycelium. This eco-friendly sponge can be composted at the end of its life cycle, reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable living.",
    "**Smart Sponge with Integrated Sensors**: Create a sponge that incorporates sensors to detect and track water quality, temperature, and pH levels. This smart sponge can alert users to potential water contamination, helping to prevent waterborne illnesses and ensuring a safer drinking experience.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Sponge for Multi-Purpose Use**: Design a sponge that can change its shape and texture in response to different liquids or temperatures. For example, the sponge could become firmer and more absorbent when exposed to cold water, making it ideal for cleaning delicate surfaces, or softer and more pliable when exposed to warm water, allowing for gentle scrubbing.",
    "**Sponge with Built-In Sanitizing Properties**: Develop a sponge infused with antimicrobial agents or UV light-emitting materials that can kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. This sanitizing sponge can be used in hospitals, kitchens, or other high-traffic areas to reduce the spread of germs and maintain a clean environment.",
    "**Modular Sponge System for Customization**: Create a modular sponge system consisting of interchangeable modules with different textures, sizes, and materials. Users can mix and match modules to create a customized sponge that suits their specific cleaning needs, such as a sponge with a soft scrubbing surface for delicate areas or a sponge with a coarse texture for heavy-duty cleaning."
