    "**Financial Costs**: Launching a satellite into space can be extremely expensive, requiring significant financial resources. There are costs associated with developing the satellite, launching it, maintaining it in orbit, and eventually disposing of it. This high cost barrier can limit the ability of smaller organizations or countries to participate in space exploration.",
    "**Technological Limitations**: The technology required to launch a satellite and maintain its functionality in space is complex and constantly evolving. Ensuring the satellite has enough power, communication capabilities, and durability for its mission can present significant technological challenges.",
    "**Communication Delays**: Given the vast distances involved in space travel, there can be significant delays in communication between the satellite and ground control. This delay can pose issues in real-time operations and decision-making processes.",
    "**Space Weather**: Space weather, including solar storms and radiation levels, can affect the operation of satellites. This includes disruptions to satellite communications, data transmission, and the overall performance of the satellite itself.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: As space becomes more commercialized, ethical considerations around space exploration and resource utilization arise. Issues such as who owns space resources, privacy concerns related to space surveillance, and the environmental impact of space activities must be addressed."
