    "**Hardware Accessibility**: Not all potential users may have access to high-end VR equipment, which could limit the reach of the training program. This creates a disparity where only those with the means to afford advanced technology can benefit from the training. To address this, consider developing a version of the program that is compatible with lower-end VR systems or even mobile devices, ensuring wider accessibility.",
    "**Motion Sickness**: One common issue with VR experiences is motion sickness, which can occur when users feel disoriented or nauseous due to the disconnect between their physical movements and the VR environment. This can hinder the effectiveness of the training. To mitigate this, developers can implement comfort settings, such as reducing the speed of movements or providing options for stationary experiences that minimize motion-related discomfort.",
    "**Content Relevance and Engagement**: The training content must be engaging and relevant to the users' needs. If the material is outdated or not aligned with real-world applications, users may find it uninteresting and ineffective. Collaborating with industry experts to develop current and practical training scenarios can help ensure that the content resonates with users and enhances their learning experience.",
    "**Technical Issues and Support**: Users may encounter technical problems while using the VR training program, such as software glitches, connectivity issues, or hardware malfunctions. This can lead to frustration and a negative perception of the training. Establishing a robust technical support system, including tutorials, FAQs, and live assistance, can help users troubleshoot problems and maintain a positive experience.",
    "**Learning Curve**: New users may face a steep learning curve when first engaging with VR technology, which could deter them from fully participating in the training program. To combat this, introductory modules or guided tours can be incorporated to familiarize users with the VR environment and its functionalities before diving into more complex training scenarios."
