    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Securing adequate funding for the park's establishment and ongoing maintenance can be a significant challenge. Initial costs may include land acquisition, habitat restoration, and infrastructure development (like visitor centers and trails). Long-term sustainability is also a concern, as continuous funding will be needed for conservation efforts, staffing, and community engagement programs. Developing partnerships with local businesses, NGOs, and government grants will be essential.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Engaging the local community is crucial for the park's success, but there may be resistance or apathy from residents. Local stakeholders may have conflicting interests, such as land use for agriculture or development. To address this, it's vital to create educational programs that highlight the benefits of conservation, involve community members in decision-making processes, and demonstrate how the park can enhance local quality of life and economy through ecotourism.",
    "**Infrastructure Development and Environmental Impact**: Building necessary infrastructure (like roads, trails, and facilities) can lead to environmental degradation if not carefully planned. Construction activities may disrupt local habitats, introduce pollutants, or lead to soil erosion. To mitigate these issues, a thorough environmental impact assessment should be conducted, and sustainable building practices should be implemented to minimize the ecological footprint.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Establishing a conservation park may involve navigating complex legal frameworks, including land ownership rights, zoning laws, and environmental regulations. There may be existing claims on the land or opposition from landowners who may not agree with the park's establishment. Engaging legal experts and conducting thorough research on land rights and regulations will be necessary to avoid potential legal disputes.",
    "**Visitor Management and Conservation Balance**: While public access is essential for education and appreciation of nature, it can lead to overuse and degradation of sensitive habitats. Managing visitor numbers, establishing guidelines for behavior, and creating designated paths can help minimize human impact. Additionally, developing educational programs that promote responsible visitation practices can foster a culture of conservation among park visitors."
