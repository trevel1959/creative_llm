    "**Ecological Imbalance**: Cloning extinct animals could disrupt the delicate balance of modern ecosystems. For example, if we were to clone the passenger pigeon, it could lead to an overpopulation of birds, causing them to compete with other bird species for resources, potentially driving them to extinction. This could have a ripple effect throughout the food chain, leading to unforeseen consequences.",
    "**Invasive Species**: Cloned animals could become invasive species, outcompeting native species for resources and habitat. This could lead to the decline or extinction of native species, altering the composition of ecosystems. For instance, cloning the woolly mammoth could lead to an overpopulation of these massive herbivores, causing them to compete with modern elephants for resources and potentially driving them to extinction.",
    "**Disease Transmission**: Cloned animals could potentially carry diseases that were eradicated or not present in modern populations. For example, if we were to clone the Tasmanian tiger, it could carry diseases that were present in the species before its extinction, which could be transmitted to modern animals, leading to outbreaks and potentially even extinctions.",
    "**Genetic Drift**: Cloning extinct animals could lead to genetic drift, where the cloned population becomes genetically distinct from the original species. This could lead to the loss of genetic diversity, making the cloned population more vulnerable to disease and environmental changes.",
    "**Unintended Consequences**: Cloning extinct animals could have unintended consequences, such as altering the behavior or physiology of the cloned species. For example, cloning the saber-toothed tiger could lead to a species that is more aggressive or has a different diet, which could have unforeseen consequences for modern ecosystems."
