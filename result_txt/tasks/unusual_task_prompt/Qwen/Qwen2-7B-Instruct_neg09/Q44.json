    "**Ice Cream Molds**: Transform your ice cube tray into a mold for making unique, custom ice cream flavors. Use it to make small portions of different ice cream flavors that you can enjoy throughout the day or share with friends. You could create combinations like chocolate chip cookie dough with strawberry, mint chocolate chip with vanilla, or coffee with caramel swirls. This allows for experimentation with various flavors and ingredients without having to commit to large batches.",
    "**Custom Jewelry Making**: Each compartment in an ice cube tray can be filled with a small amount of clay, wire, beads, or other materials. Once hardened, these can serve as the base for creating personalized pieces of jewelry such as earrings, pendants, or bracelets. This could be a fun activity for crafting personalized gifts or just for your own use.",
    "**Seed Starting Kit**: If you're interested in gardening, fill each section of the tray with a small amount of potting soil and plant seeds. This is particularly useful for starting small plants like herbs or flowers indoors before transplanting them outside. Label each section to keep track of what's growing where.",
    "**DIY Cosmetics**: Use the compartments to make small batches of homemade cosmetics like lip balms, bath salts, or facial scrubs. You can customize these products by choosing different oils, butters, colors, and fragrances based on your preferences or skin needs. This way, you'll have a personalized collection of beauty products at home.",
    "**Candle Making**: Melt wax (preferably soy or beeswax) and pour it into the ice cube tray, then add in scented oils, dried flowers, or essential oils for fragrance. Allow the candles to harden, and you'll end up with a set of small, decorative candles that you can use around your home. These candles are great for adding a cozy atmosphere during cooler months or for giving as thoughtful gifts."
