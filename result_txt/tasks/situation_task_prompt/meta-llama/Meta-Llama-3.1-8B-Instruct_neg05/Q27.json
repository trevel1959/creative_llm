    "**Smart Glass Windows**: I'd invest in smart glass windows that can change from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. During the day, they'd allow sunlight to warm up the interior, and at night, they'd block out cold air. The glass would be treated with a special coating that can adjust its thermal conductivity, ensuring a consistent temperature inside. ",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: I'd incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into the building's insulation. PCMs absorb and release heat as they change phases, maintaining a stable indoor temperature. These materials would be strategically placed in walls, floors, and ceilings to optimize thermal performance.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling**: I'd implement an evaporative cooling system, which uses water to cool the air through evaporation. This method is energy-efficient and can be powered by solar panels or a wind turbine. The system would be designed to capture and reuse rainwater or condensate to minimize water waste.",
    "**Thermal Mass**: I'd utilize thermal mass elements like concrete or brick to absorb and release heat. These materials have high thermal mass, allowing them to absorb heat during the day and release it at night, maintaining a consistent indoor temperature. The thermal mass would be strategically placed in the building's design to maximize its effectiveness.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: I'd install an atmospheric water harvesting system, which collects and condenses water vapor from the air. This water would then be used to cool the building through evaporation or to power a cooling system. The system would be designed to capture water during the cooler parts of the day, ensuring a consistent supply of cooling water. "
