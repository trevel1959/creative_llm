    "**Sustainability Concerns**: In today's fashion industry, sustainability is a major concern for consumers. If the new fashion line does not prioritize eco-friendly materials or ethical manufacturing practices, it could face backlash from environmentally conscious consumers. This could not only harm the brand's reputation but also lead to decreased sales and difficulty in establishing a loyal customer base.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The fashion industry heavily relies on a complex supply chain for materials, production, and distribution. Issues such as delays in material sourcing, manufacturing errors, or transportation disruptions can significantly impact the launch timeline and availability of products. This could lead to missed opportunities in the market and financial losses.",
    "**Brand Identity Confusion**: Creating a new fashion line involves establishing a strong brand identity. If the branding is inconsistent or unclear, it may confuse potential customers about what the line represents. This can dilute the brand’s message and make it difficult to attract a dedicated audience. A lack of a clear vision can also hinder effective marketing strategies.",
    "**Overextension of Resources**: Many new fashion lines may struggle with the temptation to launch too many products at once, leading to overextension of financial and human resources. This can result in a lack of focus on quality control and customer service, which are crucial for building a positive brand reputation. An overwhelming product range can also confuse consumers and dilute the brand’s core message.",
    "**Pricing Strategy Misalignment**: Establishing the right pricing strategy is critical for a new fashion line. If prices are set too high, the line may become inaccessible to the target market; if set too low, it may not convey the desired quality or brand image. Misalignment in pricing can lead to poor sales performance and damage the perceived value of the brand."
