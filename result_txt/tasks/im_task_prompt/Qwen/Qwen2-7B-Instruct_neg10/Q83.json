    "**Smart Shopping Cart Navigation System**: Incorporate GPS or augmented reality (AR) technology that guides customers through the store based on their shopping list, pointing out where products are located. This would make the shopping experience more efficient, particularly for those who find it challenging to navigate large stores or forget items on their list.",
    "**Sustainable Shopping Carts**: Create shopping carts made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled plastic, or biodegradable composites. These carts could have features such as solar panels to charge mobile devices or LED lights for nighttime visibility, promoting sustainability while enhancing customer convenience.",
    "**Personalized Shopping Cart Recommendations**: Utilize AI algorithms to suggest products based on a customer's past purchases or browsing history. The cart could display personalized deals, product recommendations, or related items that complement what's already in the cart, making the shopping experience more tailored and enjoyable.",
    "**Collaborative Shopping Carts**: Develop a feature that allows multiple shoppers to add items to a single cart before proceeding to checkout together. This would streamline the process for families, friends, or groups shopping together, eliminating the need for multiple carts and reducing wait times at the checkout.",
    "**Health Monitoring Cart**: Integrate health sensors into the shopping cart to monitor customers' vital signs, offering immediate alerts if necessary. This could be particularly useful in supermarkets where elderly or health-conscious individuals might benefit from additional support during their shopping trips."
