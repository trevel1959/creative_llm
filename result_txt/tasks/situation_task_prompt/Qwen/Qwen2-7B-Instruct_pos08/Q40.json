    "**Human-Powered Gadgets**: Design gadgets that harness human energy to operate. For instance, a smartphone that can be powered by pedaling on a bike or a wearable device that generates electricity from body heat. The idea would be to create a system where users can recharge their devices by engaging in physical activities.",
    "**Solar-Driven Portable Power Stations**: Develop portable power stations that can be recharged through solar panels. These could be compact and easily carried, making them ideal for outdoor events, emergency situations, or when traditional power sources are unavailable. This concept would involve lightweight, efficient solar cells that can be integrated into backpacks or briefcases.",
    "**Wearable Power Converters**: Create a line of wearable accessories that convert kinetic energy (from walking, running, or even typing) into electrical energy. These could include shoes with built-in generators, wristbands that charge your watch, or belts that power your phone. This would not only reduce dependency on batteries but also encourage healthier lifestyles.",
    "**Biodegradable Batteries**: Innovate battery technology that is both environmentally friendly and sustainable. Biodegradable batteries could decompose naturally after use, reducing pollution and waste. This could involve materials like starch, cellulose, or natural oils, which break down under normal environmental conditions without causing harm.",
    "**Smart Grid Integration**: Propose an alternative method of powering devices by integrating smart grids with home or office systems. Smart grids can dynamically manage energy usage, allowing for better allocation of resources during peak demand times. This system could also incorporate renewable energy sources like wind or solar power, ensuring a continuous and sustainable supply of electricity for devices. Additionally, it could allow for the sharing of excess energy between different devices and users, promoting efficiency and self-sufficiency."
