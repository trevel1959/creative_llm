    "**Eco-Friendly Cereal Box**: Design a cereal box made from a combination of recycled materials and bioplastics. The box could be made from a mixture of recycled paper and biodegradable materials like cornstarch or sugarcane. The bioplastic coating could be made from renewable resources, such as plant-based oils or algae. This innovative design would reduce the environmental impact of cereal packaging while maintaining the durability and functionality of traditional cardboard boxes.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Box**: Create a cereal box that doubles as an interactive storytelling device. The box could include a hidden compartment containing a mini-comic book or a short story related to the cereal's theme. The box could also include a QR code that, when scanned, unlocks a digital version of the story or a fun game. This immersive experience would engage consumers and create a memorable brand experience.",
    "**Smart Box with Nutritional Insights**: Develop a cereal box that includes a built-in sensor to track the consumer's nutritional intake. The sensor could monitor the amount of cereal consumed and provide personalized recommendations for a balanced diet. The box could also include a digital display that shows the nutritional information of the cereal, allowing consumers to make informed choices.",
    "**Customizable Box Art**: Design a cereal box that allows consumers to create their own artwork using a unique, patented technology. The box could include a special paper or foil that can be scratched or drawn upon, revealing a hidden design or message. This interactive feature would encourage creativity and engagement with the brand.",
    "**Sustainable Packaging with Built-in Garden**: Create a cereal box that doubles as a mini-garden. The box could be made from a biodegradable material that can be planted in soil, and the packaging could include a packet of seeds that grow into a small herb or flower. This innovative design would not only reduce waste but also provide a fun and educational experience for consumers. The box could also include a small LED light or a moisture-sensing system to help the plant grow. [/INST] Assistant: I'm glad you're excited about the assignment!
