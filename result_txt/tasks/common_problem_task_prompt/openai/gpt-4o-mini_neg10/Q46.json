    "**Public Resistance to Change**: Residents may be resistant to changes in their transportation options, especially if they have grown accustomed to the existing system. This resistance can manifest in protests, negative media coverage, or vocal opposition at city council meetings. Engaging the community early in the planning process through workshops and feedback sessions can help alleviate concerns and create a sense of ownership among residents.",
    "**Logistical Challenges During Construction**: The physical act of overhauling the transportation system can lead to significant logistical issues, including traffic disruptions, detours, and construction delays. These challenges can frustrate commuters and local businesses, potentially leading to decreased patronage. A well-structured communication plan that keeps the public informed about timelines and alternative routes will be essential to mitigate these disruptions.",
    "**Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: Ensuring that the new transportation system integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure, such as roads, bike lanes, and pedestrian pathways, can be complex. Poor integration may lead to confusion for users and reduced efficiency. Conducting thorough assessments of current infrastructure and involving urban planners and engineers in the design process will be critical to achieving a cohesive system.",
    "**Technology Implementation Issues**: Incorporating advanced technology into the public transportation system, such as real-time tracking, mobile payment options, and smart traffic management systems, can pose significant challenges. Issues such as software malfunctions, data privacy concerns, and the need for ongoing maintenance and updates can arise. A phased implementation plan, with pilot programs to test new technologies, can help address these concerns before a full rollout.",
    "**Equity and Accessibility Concerns**: An overhaul of the public transportation system must prioritize equity and accessibility for all residents, including those with disabilities, low-income individuals, and marginalized communities. Failing to do so could exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to public criticism. Engaging with community organizations and conducting accessibility audits will help ensure that the new system serves all populations effectively."
