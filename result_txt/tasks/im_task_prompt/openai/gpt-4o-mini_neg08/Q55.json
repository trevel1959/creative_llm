    "**Customizable Nib Settings**: Design a fountain pen with interchangeable nibs that can be easily swapped out to adjust the line thickness or style (e.g., fine, medium, broad, italic). Additionally, a digital setting could allow users to adjust the nib's pressure sensitivity, offering a personalized writing experience that caters to different writing styles and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Writing Assistant App**: Develop a companion app that connects to the fountain pen via Bluetooth. The app could offer features like real-time handwriting recognition, note organization, and reminders for tasks. It could also suggest writing prompts based on the userâ€™s previous notes, enhancing creativity and productivity.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip and Weight Adjustment**: Create a fountain pen with an ergonomic design that can be adjusted for comfort. Users could add or remove small weights from the pen to find their ideal balance, making it easier to write for extended periods without discomfort. This would cater to different writing styles and preferences, improving the overall writing experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Ink Cartridges**: Introduce a line of sustainable, refillable ink cartridges made from biodegradable materials. These cartridges could be designed to be easily refilled with a variety of ink colors, promoting eco-friendliness while allowing users to express their creativity through color choices without contributing to plastic waste.",
    "**Built-in UV Light for Ink Drying**: Integrate a small UV light at the tip of the fountain pen that activates when the pen is lifted off the paper. This feature would help dry the ink instantly, preventing smudging and allowing users to handle their notes right away. It would be particularly useful for left-handed writers or anyone who tends to smudge their writing."
