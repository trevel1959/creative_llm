    "**Modular Backpack with Interchangeable Compartments**: Create a modular backpack system where users can swap out compartments based on their needs. For instance, a user might want a compartment for gym gear one day and a laptop sleeve the next. The compartments could be secured with Velcro or magnetic clasps, allowing for easy customization.",
    "**Built-in Hydration System**: Incorporate a hydration reservoir and a tube that can be accessed from the shoulder strap. This design would allow users to stay hydrated without having to stop and dig through their backpack. The reservoir could be insulated to keep water cool, and the backpack could feature a dedicated pocket for easy cleaning and refilling.",
    "**Anti-Theft Features**: Enhance the backpack with anti-theft technology such as lockable zippers, cut-resistant straps, and a hidden compartment for valuables. Additionally, integrate a Bluetooth tracking device that connects to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their backpack's location in case it gets lost or stolen.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a backpack made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or discarded fishing nets. The design could also include a modular repair system where users can replace worn-out parts instead of discarding the entire bag. This approach promotes sustainability and reduces waste.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Integrate AR technology into the backpack with a small screen or a transparent display that connects to a smartphone. Users could access navigation, notifications, or even educational content while on the move. This feature would be particularly useful for travelers or students who need to stay organized and informed without constantly checking their phones."
