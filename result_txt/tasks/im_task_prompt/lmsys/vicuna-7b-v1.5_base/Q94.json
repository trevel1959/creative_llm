    "Improved Fragrance Delivery: To improve the fragrance delivery of candles, you could add essential oils or fragrance oils to the wax formulation. This will allow the scent to be released more evenly and for a longer period of time. Another option is to use a wick that is impregnated with fragrance oil, which will also improve the scent throw of the candle.",
    "Improved Safety: To improve the safety of candles, you could create a wax formulation that is less flammable. This can be achieved by using a lower melting point wax or by adding a flame retardant to the wax. Another option is to use a wick that is made of a material that is less flammable, such as silk or paper.",
    "Improved Design: To improve the design of candles, you could create a variety of shapes and sizes. This will allow consumers to choose a candle that fits their specific needs, whether it be for ambiance, decoration, or practical purposes. Another option is to create candles with unique features, such as built-in color-changing technology or a self-extinguishing mechanism.",
    "Improved Sustainability: To improve the sustainability of candles, you could use a wax formulation that is made from renewable resources, such as soy or beeswax. Another option is to use a wick that is made from natural fibers, such as cotton or paper, which are biodegradable and do not contribute to environmental pollution.",
    "Improved Burn Quality: To improve the burn quality of candles, you could create a wax formulation that has a higher melting point, which will result in a cleaner and more even burn. Another option is to use a wick that is made of a material that resists melting, such as cotton or paper, which will also improve the burn quality of the candle."
