    "**Mood-Based Scheduling**: Introduce a mood-tracking feature that allows users to input their current emotional state. The calendar assistant could then recommend activities or breaks based on this mood. For example, if a user reports feeling stressed, the assistant might suggest a short meditation or a light walk, whereas if they feel energized, it could propose a challenging project or social engagement.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Planning**: Develop an AR feature that allows users to visualize their schedule in a 3D space. By using their smartphone or AR glasses, users could see their upcoming events displayed in their physical environment, allowing them to better plan their day. For instance, they could project their weekly schedule onto their living room wall, making it easier to visualize free time and commitments.",
    "**Collaborative Event Planning**: Create a feature that allows multiple users to collaborate on scheduling events in real-time. Users could vote on potential times, locations, and activities, making it easier to coordinate group events. This feature could also integrate with social media to suggest friends who might be interested in joining based on mutual availability and interests.",
    "**Personalized Themes and Visuals**: Allow users to customize the visual interface of their calendar assistant with personalized themes, colors, and graphics that reflect their personality or interests. This could include seasonal themes, favorite colors, or even artwork from local artists. Such personalization would make the experience more enjoyable and engaging for users.",
    "**Wellness Integration**: Incorporate a wellness tracker that syncs with health apps to suggest breaks, hydration reminders, or exercise intervals based on the user's calendar. For example, if a user has back-to-back meetings scheduled, the assistant could prompt them to take a quick stretch or drink water after each meeting, promoting a healthier work-life balance."
