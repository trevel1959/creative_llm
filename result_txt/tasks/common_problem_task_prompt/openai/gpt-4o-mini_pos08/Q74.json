    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds, lightning, or thick cloud cover, can delay or cancel a launch. To tackle this, meteorological teams should closely monitor weather patterns and have contingency plans in place, including backup launch windows and alternative launch sites.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex web of regulations from various governing bodies, including space agencies and international treaties. Failing to comply with these regulations can lead to legal issues or launch delays. A dedicated compliance team should be established to ensure all necessary permits and documentation are in order well before the launch date.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The cost of launching a satellite can quickly escalate due to unforeseen expenses, such as additional testing, delays, or redesigns. To address this, a robust budgeting process should be implemented, including a contingency fund for unexpected costs and regular financial reviews throughout the project.",
    "**Launch Site Issues**: Problems at the launch site, such as infrastructure failures, safety breaches, or logistical challenges in transporting the satellite and rocket components, can hinder the launch process. To minimize risks, a thorough site assessment and regular maintenance checks should be conducted, along with a detailed logistical plan for transporting and assembling the launch vehicle.",
    "**Post-Launch Communication Failures**: Once the satellite is launched, maintaining communication with it is crucial for monitoring its systems and ensuring it reaches its intended orbit. Communication failures could result from interference, hardware malfunctions, or incorrect orbital insertion. To prevent this, backup communication systems and protocols should be established, along with extensive pre-launch testing of all communication channels."
