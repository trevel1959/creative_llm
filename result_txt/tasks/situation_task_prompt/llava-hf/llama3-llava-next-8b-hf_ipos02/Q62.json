    "Create a seasonal rotation where each month is assigned a specific activity or theme. For example, January could be \"New Year's resolution month,\" where people set personal goals and work on self-improvement. February could be \"Valentine's Day month,\" with events centered around love and romance. This would create a sense of purpose and focus throughout the year.",
    "Organize a \"Year-Round Challenge\" where people set a goal to do one new thing each month. The goal could be something as simple as trying a new food or visiting a new place. This would encourage people to be adventurous and try new things.",
    "Create a \"Seasonal Bucket List\" where people set a list of activities they want to do each month. The list could include things like attending a concert, going on a weekend getaway, or trying a new hobby. This would create a sense of anticipation and excitement for the year.",
    "Develop a \"Year-Round Adventure\" program where people set a goal to visit a new place each month. The places could be local or international, and the goal could be to explore new cultures and experiences.",
    "Create a \"Year-Round Skill Swap\" where people exchange skills and knowledge with each other. For example, someone could teach a language or a musical instrument, while someone else could teach a sport or a craft. This would create a sense of community and shared learning."
