    "**Creating a reflective wall:** Use mirrors to create a reflective wall in a room, which can help make the space feel larger and more open. This can be particularly useful in smaller rooms where space is limited, and the use of mirrors can create the illusion of depth and width.",
    "**Interactive art installation:** Create an interactive art installation using mirrors that respond to touch or movement. For example, when someone touches a specific area on the mirror, a video or image appears, and disappears when the touch is removed. This can be used in public spaces, museums, or galleries to engage visitors and create a unique experience.",
    "**Reflective clothing for fashion:** Design clothing items, such as dresses, jackets, or accessories, with strategically placed mirrors sewn into them. This would allow wearers to reflect their surroundings or catch the light in interesting ways, creating a visually striking and unconventional fashion statement.",
    "**Portable vanity mirror for makeup artists:** Develop a compact, lightweight mirror that can be easily attached to a belt loop, backpack, or camera strap. This would enable makeup artists to have a handy, always-accessible mirror without carrying a bulky makeup kit, making it perfect for travel or on-the-go touch-ups.",
    "**Augmented reality mirror for online shopping:** Combine mirrors with augmented reality technology to provide a virtual try-on experience for clothing and accessories. Shoppers could see how a garment looks on them instantly by simply standing in front of the mirror, which would display a digital model wearing the item. This would save time and reduce returns, enhancing the online shopping experience."
