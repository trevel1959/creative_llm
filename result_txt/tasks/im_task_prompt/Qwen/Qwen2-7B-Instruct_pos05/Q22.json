    "**Innovative Emergency Communication Tool**: Design a flashlight that doubles as an emergency communication device. The flashlight has an integrated LED screen that can display pre-programmed messages or Morse code sequences to signal for help in areas without cellular reception. It also includes a solar panel for charging the flashlight and a built-in radio receiver to listen for rescue teams' frequencies.",
    "**Bioluminescent Outdoor Adventure Light**: Create a flashlight that incorporates bioluminescent materials, which emit light without needing any external power source. This type of flashlight could be particularly useful during outdoor adventures where traditional batteries may not be available or practical. Bioluminescence would make it an eco-friendly option as well.",
    "**Tactile Feedback Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that uses haptic feedback technology to alert users of low battery levels, different modes, or proximity detection. For instance, when approaching an obstacle, the flashlight would vibrate based on its distance from the object, enhancing safety and navigation in low-light conditions.",
    "**Therapeutic Sleep Aid**: Design a flashlight that emits red light, known for its ability to promote sleep, relaxation, and reduce eye strain. The flashlight could have a timer feature that gradually fades the light out over time, mimicking natural sunset, helping users prepare for sleep.",
    "**Smart Home Integration Flashlight**: Integrate smart home capabilities into a flashlight so it can connect to your home's Wi-Fi network. This would allow the flashlight to act as a hub for other smart devices, like controlling smart lights or checking the status of security systems while you're away from your house."
