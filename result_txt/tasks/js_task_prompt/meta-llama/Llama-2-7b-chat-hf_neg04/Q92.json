    "Fluidic Solar System: In this redesign, the planets and other celestial bodies are replaced with interconnected, fluidic structures that flow and change shape in response to gravitational forces. Mercury becomes a swirling vortex of glowing plasma, Venus a pulsating sphere of water, Earth a crystal lattice of diamond, Mars a spinning vortex of magnetized gas, Jupiter a giant, rotating torus of compressed plasma, Saturn a series of nested, interconnected rings, and Uranus a shimmering, iridescent sphere of energy.",
    "Bioluminescent Solar System: In this redesign, the planets and moons are replaced with living organisms that emit light through bioluminescence. Mercury becomes a glowing, iridescent jellyfish, Venus a shimmering, iridescent butterfly, Earth a glowing, iridescent coral reef, Mars a shimmering, iridescent mushroom, Jupiter a giant, glowing squid, Saturn a shimmering, iridescent spider, and Uranus a shimmering, iridescent sea anemone.",
    "Musical Solar System: In this redesign, the planets and moons are replaced with musical instruments. Mercury becomes a resonant, gong-like sphere, Venus a singing, bell-like sphere, Earth a drum-like sphere, Mars a trumpet-like sphere, Jupiter a grand piano-like sphere, Saturn a harp-like sphere, and Uranus a xylophone-like sphere.",
    "Fractal Solar System: In this redesign, the planets and other celestial bodies are replaced with fractals, self-similar patterns that repeat at different scales. Mercury becomes a Mandelbrot set-like structure, Venus a Julia set-like structure, Earth a Sierpinski triangle-like structure, Mars a Koch curve-like structure, Jupiter a fractal snowflake-like structure, Saturn a fractal flower-like structure, and Uranus a fractal butterfly-like structure.",
