    "Create a self-watering pot: Develop a special pot with a built-in water reservoir that automatically waters the plants as needed. This innovative solution could be powered by a small solar panel or a low-voltage battery, ensuring a sustainable and eco-friendly way to water plants.",
    "Utilize fog collectors: Develop a fog collection system that harnesses the moisture in the air to provide a steady supply of water for plants. This system could be particularly useful in areas with high humidity, reducing the need for rainfall.",
    "Build a rainwater harvesting system: Design a rainwater collection system that captures and stores rainwater for use in watering plants. This could involve constructing a roof-based system with gutters and downspouts, or a ground-based system with a collection tank and piping.",
    "Develop a hydroponic system: Create a hydroponic system that uses nutrient-rich water rather than soil to grow plants. This method would eliminate the need for rainfall or irrigation, as the water would be recirculated and reused, providing a sustainable and efficient way to grow plants.",
    "Create a drought-resistant plant nursery: Develop a nursery that specializes in growing drought-resistant plant species. This could involve selecting and breeding plants that are naturally adapted to survive in low-water environments, or using specialized greenhouses and irrigation systems to create the ideal conditions for these plants to thrive."
