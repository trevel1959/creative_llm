    "A smart carpet that changes color to indicate the level of foot traffic in a given area. This carpet could be especially useful in high-traffic public spaces, such as airports, train stations, or shopping malls. The color change could be triggered by a sensor that detects the number of people walking over it, and could be designed to change color in a gradient or in a specific pattern. For example, a green color could indicate low traffic, while a red color could indicate high traffic. This could help facilities managers to better understand how people are using the space and make informed decisions about how to optimize the layout or schedule cleaning and maintenance.",
    "A carpet that can absorb and clean spills on its own. This carpet could be equipped with microcapsules that contain cleaning agents, which are released when a spill occurs. The microcapsules could be triggered by a sensor that detects the presence of a liquid, and could be designed to release the cleaning agents in a specific pattern or amount. This could be especially useful in high-traffic areas, such as restaurants or bars, where spills are common and can be difficult to clean.",
    "A carpet that provides a unique sensory experience for users. This carpet could be designed to emit a specific scent or fragrance when walked upon, or could have a textured surface that provides a unique tactile experience. For example, a carpet with a soft, velvety texture could be designed to evoke a sense of calm and relaxation, while a carpet with a rough, bumpy texture could be designed to stimulate the senses and increase alertness. This could be especially useful in spaces such as spas, yoga studios, or meditation rooms.",
    "A carpet that can monitor and report on air quality in a given area. This carpet could be equipped with sensors that detect pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, or volatile organic compounds, and could be designed to provide real-time data on air quality. This could be especially useful in spaces such as offices or homes, where indoor air quality can be a concern.",
    "A carpet that can generate electricity through the movement of footsteps. This carpet could be equipped with piezoelectric materials that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, and could be designed to power small devices such as lights or charging stations. This could be especially useful in spaces such as gyms or public areas, where energy-harvesting technology could be used to power equipment or provide a convenient charging station for users.
