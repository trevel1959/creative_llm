    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard**: Create a surfboard made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic, to reduce the environmental impact of surfboard production. This could also include solar panels to harness energy from the sun while surfing.",
    "**Surfboard with Adjustable Floats**: Design a surfboard with adjustable floats on the sides, allowing surfers to customize the buoyancy and stability of the board based on their skill level and the type of waves they're surfing.",
    "**Surfboard with Integrated Fins**: Incorporate fins into the design of the surfboard itself, eliminating the need for separate fin attachments. This could improve maneuverability and control while surfing.",
    "**Surfboard with Biometric Tracking**: Develop a surfboard with biometric tracking capabilities, such as heart rate and temperature sensors, to monitor the surfer's physical condition during the session. This could help prevent overexertion and injuries.",
    "**Surfboard with Hydrophobic Coating**: Create a surfboard with a hydrophobic coating that repels water, reducing drag and making it easier for surfers to paddle out to the waves. This could also include a built-in drainage system to help rinse off the board after a session."
