    "**Interactive QR Code Tag**: Each luggage tag could feature a unique QR code that travelers can scan with their smartphones. This code would link to a personalized webpage containing the owner's contact information, travel itinerary, and emergency contacts. If the luggage is lost, anyone who finds it can easily access the information and contact the owner.",
    "**Self-Printing Tags**: Imagine a luggage tag that allows travelers to print their information directly from their smartphones. Using Bluetooth technology, users could connect to a small, portable printer that produces a durable, waterproof tag with their details. This would eliminate the need for pre-printed tags and allow for quick updates in case of last-minute travel changes.",
    "**Customizable Digital Display Tags**: These tags would feature a small, e-ink display that can be updated with the owner's information, destination, or even a personal message. Users could change the displayed information through an app, making it easy to adapt the tag for different trips. The display would be energy-efficient and only activate when the tag is in motion.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tag with Built-in Charger**: This luggage tag could double as a portable charger for smartphones and other devices. Equipped with a small battery, the tag would have USB ports that allow travelers to charge their devices on the go. The tag could also feature a small LED light for visibility in dark environments, making it a practical travel companion.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Tags**: In response to growing environmental concerns, luggage tags could be made from biodegradable materials that break down over time. These tags would still be durable and functional but would minimize waste. Additionally, they could be designed to incorporate seeds, allowing travelers to plant the tag after their trip, contributing to environmental sustainability."
