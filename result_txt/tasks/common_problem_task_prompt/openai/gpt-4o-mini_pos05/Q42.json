    "**Resource Allocation**: Large-scale experiments often require significant resources, including funding, personnel, and materials. A common issue can arise if the allocation of these resources is not managed effectively. For instance, if one aspect of the experiment is overfunded while another critical area is underfunded, it could lead to imbalances that compromise the integrity of the study.",
    "**Data Management and Analysis**: With large amounts of data generated from extensive experiments, there can be challenges in data management and analysis. Issues may include data storage limitations, difficulties in ensuring data accuracy, and the need for advanced analytical tools and techniques. Without proper data management, valuable insights could be lost or misinterpreted.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Many large-scale scientific experiments require collaboration across different fields of study. Problems can arise if communication and coordination between disciplines are poor. Misunderstandings about methodologies, objectives, or terminologies can lead to conflicts, delays, or even failures in the experiment.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Conducting large-scale experiments, especially those involving human subjects or sensitive data, raises ethical concerns. Issues may include obtaining informed consent, ensuring participant privacy, and addressing potential biases. Failure to adequately address these ethical considerations can result in legal repercussions and damage to the reputation of the researchers involved.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: The logistics of conducting a large-scale experiment can be daunting. Problems may include coordinating schedules among multiple teams, managing transportation and storage of materials, and ensuring that all equipment is functioning properly. Delays or mishaps in logistics can derail the timeline of the experiment and lead to increased costs."
