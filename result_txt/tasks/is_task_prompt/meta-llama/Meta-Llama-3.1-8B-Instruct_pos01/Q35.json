    "**Reflection Reversal**: The mirror displays a reflection of the user, but with a twist. Every time they make a gesture or expression, their reflection does the opposite. For example, if the user raises their arm, their reflection lowers its arm. This creates a sense of disorientation and challenges the user's perception of their own identity. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Dreamscapes**: The mirror serves as a portal to a shared dreamscape, where users can enter and explore surreal landscapes. Each user's reflection in the mirror becomes a character in the dreamscape, interacting with each other in unpredictable ways. The mirror's surface becomes a gateway to the collective unconscious. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Echo Chamber**: The mirror creates an echo of the user's voice, repeating their words back to them in a distorted, eerie tone. However, the echo starts to develop its own personality, responding to the user's statements and creating a sense of conversation. The user begins to question whether they're talking to themselves or something else. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Shadow Self**: The mirror reveals the user's shadow self, a dark reflection of their personality, desires, and fears. As the user interacts with their shadow, they begin to confront and reconcile with their repressed aspects, leading to a deeper understanding of themselves. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Temporal Tapestry**: The mirror displays a tapestry of time, weaving together threads of past, present, and future.
