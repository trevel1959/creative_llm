    "**Wealth Redistribution**: The cancellation of debt would disproportionately benefit those who are heavily indebted, such as lower-income households and struggling businesses. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth as these groups would have the opportunity to invest in education, healthcare, and home ownership. However, it might also upset wealthier individuals and institutions that rely on interest income from loans.",
    "**Financial System Shock**: The global financial system is intricately linked to debt. Erasing all debt could lead to significant instability in banks and financial institutions that rely on interest from loans for their operations. This could result in a loss of trust in financial systems, potentially leading to a banking crisis as institutions scramble to find new revenue models.",
    "**Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: Countries that are heavily indebted, especially developing nations, might find themselves in a position of newfound strength, as they would no longer be beholden to foreign creditors. This could shift global power dynamics, leading to new alliances and potentially altering geopolitical landscapes, as countries leverage their new financial independence.",
    "**Moral Hazard**: The act of erasing all debt could create a moral hazard where individuals and corporations might take on excessive risk, believing that they would not be held accountable for future debts. This could lead to reckless financial behavior and a lack of accountability, potentially setting the stage for future economic crises.",
    "**Impact on Credit Markets**: With the removal of debt, credit markets would undergo a fundamental transformation. The traditional credit scoring systems would need to be re-evaluated, as the basis for creditworthiness would change. Lenders might become more cautious, leading to stricter lending criteria and possibly stifling innovation and entrepreneurship."
