    "**Augmented Reality Coaching**: Develop a bowling ball that connects to augmented reality (AR) glasses or a smartphone app. As the bowler prepares to throw, the app can overlay visual guides, such as ideal angles, target lines, and spin techniques. This real-time feedback would help bowlers refine their technique and improve their accuracy.",
    "**Weighted Adjustable Inserts**: Create a bowling ball with adjustable weight inserts that allow bowlers to customize the ball's weight distribution. This would enable bowlers to experiment with different configurations to find their ideal balance for both speed and control, accommodating varying skill levels and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Motion Sensors**: Embed motion sensors within the bowling ball to track its speed, rotation, and trajectory. This data could be synced with a mobile app that provides detailed analytics after each roll, helping bowlers understand their performance trends and make informed adjustments to their technique.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Core**: Design a bowling ball with a temperature-controlled core that can maintain optimal performance conditions. This feature would allow bowlers to adjust the ball's temperature before a game, enhancing grip and performance in varying lane conditions, especially in extreme weather scenarios.",
    "**Personalized Visual Design**: Introduce a customizable surface for bowling balls that allows bowlers to design their own graphics or patterns. Using a simple app, bowlers could choose colors, images, and text that represent their personality or achievements, making the bowling experience more personal and enjoyable."
