    "Space Travel: With no more planes, space travel would become the primary mode of intercontinental transportation. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are already working on commercial spacecraft that can take passengers to the moon and beyond. Imagine boarding a spacecraft, blasting off into the cosmos, and arriving at your destination in a matter of hours instead of days.",
    "High-Speed Trains: While high-speed trains already exist, they could be significantly upgraded to reach even higher speeds. For example, the Hyperloop, a vacuum-sealed tube through which a pod can travel at up to 700 mph, could revolutionize intercontinental travel. This would reduce travel time between continents to mere hours, making it a viable alternative to air travel.",
    "Submarine Tunnels: Building submarine tunnels that connect continents would allow for a unique and exciting travel experience. Imagine traveling through a tunnel beneath the ocean, watching the marine life and ocean currents go by through large windows. This mode of transportation would be perfect for long-distance travel and could be powered by renewable energy sources.",
    "Personal Flying Devices: With advancements in technology, personal flying devices could become a reality. Imagine having your own personal flying device that you can use to travel between continents. These devices could be powered by electricity or even by your own body, making them environmentally friendly and convenient.",
    "Teleportation: Finally, teleportation technology could be developed to allow for instant transportation between continents. Imagine being able to step into a teleportation device and instantly appear at your destination, no matter how far away it is. This technology would revolutionize the way we travel and open up new possibilities for exploration and adventure."
