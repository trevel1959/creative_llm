    "Utilize reusable and biodegradable decorations: Instead of using disposable decorations, opt for reusable items like vases, centerpieces, and table runners made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled paper. These items can be used year after year, reducing waste and minimizing the carbon footprint of the wedding.",
    "Choose eco-friendly wedding favors: Replace traditional favors like candles or chocolates with eco-friendly options like seed bombs, tree planting kits, or reusable water bottles. These favors promote sustainability and give guests a tangible reminder of the eco-friendly theme of the wedding.",
    "Power the wedding with renewable energy: Consider using solar panels or wind turbines to generate electricity for the wedding. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the event but also serves as a unique and memorable touch for guests.",
    "Implement a \"green\" wedding cake: Instead of using traditional cake, opt for a vegan and gluten-free cake made from natural ingredients like fruit, nuts, and seeds. This not only eliminates the use of harmful chemicals and preservatives but also offers a delicious and healthy alternative for guests with dietary restrictions.",
    "Create an eco-friendly wedding invitation: Design the wedding invitations using recycled paper or cardstock, and include a digital version for guests who prefer to RSVP online. This not only reduces the amount of paper used but also reduces the carbon footprint of the wedding invitations."
