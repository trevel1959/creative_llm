    "Solar thermal energy - Using solar panels to capture the sun's heat and transfer it to water or air, which can then be used for heating. This could involve installing a solar hot water system or a solar-powered air conditioning unit.",
    "Geothermal energy - Utilizing the natural heat from the earth to warm your home. This could involve drilling deep into the ground to access underground pipes that are already heated by the earth's core.",
    "Biomass energy - Burning organic matter, such as wood chips or agricultural waste, to produce heat. This could involve building a biomass stove or boiler to use in your home.",
    "Renewable electricity - Generating heat using renewable energy sources, such as wind or hydro power. This could involve installing a small-scale renewable energy system, such as a wind turbine or hydroelectric generator, to provide heat for your home.",
    "Insulation and energy-efficient design - Improving the insulation of your home and designing it to be more energy-efficient. This could involve adding additional layers of insulation to walls and ceilings, using energy-efficient windows and doors, and upgrading to energy-efficient appliances and lighting. By reducing the amount of energy needed to heat your home, you can reduce your reliance on non-renewable fuels."
