    "**Garden Plant Support**: Use an old belt to support plants in your garden. The belt can be cut into strips and used to tie up floppy stems or branches, providing stability to growing plants like tomatoes or sunflowers. The adjustable nature of the belt allows for flexibility as the plant grows.",
    "**Belt Art or Wall Hanging**: Get creative and turn old belts into unique wall art. You can weave or braid them together to create an eye-catching tapestry or geometric design. This not only recycles old belts but also adds a rustic or bohemian touch to your home decor.",
    "**Emergency Tourniquet**: In a medical emergency, a belt can serve as a tourniquet. If someone is bleeding heavily from a limb, you can wrap the belt around the affected area and tighten it to slow blood flow until professional help arrives. This should only be done if no other medical supplies are available.",
    "**Travel Bag Organizer**: Use a belt to keep your travel bags organized. Loop the belt through the handles of multiple bags and buckle it, creating a single, easy-to-carry unit. This is particularly useful when navigating airports or train stations with multiple bags.",
