    "**Smart Dog Leash with GPS Tracking**: Design a leash that includes an integrated GPS tracker to keep track of your dog's location at all times. The leash could connect to a smartphone app where you can monitor your dog's movements, set boundaries, and receive alerts if they stray outside these areas. This product would be ideal for pet owners who frequently take their dogs on hikes or walks in unfamiliar areas.",
    "**Reflective and LED Lighted Dog Leash**: Create a leash made from highly reflective materials and equipped with LED lights. This leash would enhance visibility during night walks, especially in low-light conditions. The leash could also have motion-activated lights that turn on automatically when your dog starts moving, making it safer for both the pet and the owner.",
    "**Adjustable and Ergonomic Dog Leash**: Develop a leash that is adjustable in length and has an ergonomic handle designed to fit comfortably in various hand sizes. This design ensures that the leash can accommodate different walking styles and dog sizes. The handle could also feature non-slip grips to provide better control over the dog, particularly during sudden movements or tugs.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash Material**: Produce a dog leash made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. This environmentally-friendly leash would appeal to pet owners concerned about reducing their carbon footprint. It would also offer a more sustainable alternative to traditional leashes made from synthetic materials, which can take hundreds of years to decompose.",
    "**Treat Dispensing Dog Leash**: Introduce a leash with a built-in compartment for storing treats. As the dog pulls gently on the leash, small compartments release treats, encouraging good behavior and providing mental stimulation. This innovative leash would not only make walks more enjoyable for the dog but also help in training and reinforcing positive behaviors."
