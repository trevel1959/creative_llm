    "\"Handkerchief\" is a term that refers to a small square or rectangular piece of fabric that is typically used as a handkerchief or napkin. It can be made from various materials such as cotton, linen, silk, or even synthetic fabrics.",
    "One creative way to make a handkerchief is to use a combination of different fabrics. For example, you could use a linen square for the center and surround it with a ring of cotton or silk. This would create a unique and interesting texture and color combination.",
