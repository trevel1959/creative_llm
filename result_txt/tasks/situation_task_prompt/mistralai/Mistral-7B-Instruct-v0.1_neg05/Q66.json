    "Use recycled materials: If natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, we could still build a house using recycled materials. This could include using recycled metal, glass, and plastic. We could also use repurposed materials such as old tires, shipping containers, and scrap metal. These materials can be used to create a unique and sustainable home that is both functional and stylish.",
    "Use 3D printing: 3D printing technology has come a long way in recent years, and it could be used to create a house from scratch. We could design the house on a computer and then use a 3D printer to create the walls, roof, and other structures. This would allow us to create a house that is customized to our needs and preferences.",
    "Use living materials: Living materials such as grass, vines, and other plants can be used to create a sustainable and eco-friendly home. For example, we could use grass as a roofing material, or use vines to create a greenhouse where we can grow our own food. This would allow us to live in harmony with nature and reduce our carbon footprint.",
    "Use renewable energy: If natural materials disappear, we would need to find alternative sources of energy to power our homes. This could include using solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources. We could also use energy-efficient appliances and lighting to reduce our energy consumption.",
    "Use prefabricated panels: Prefabricated panels can be used to create a house quickly and efficiently. These panels can be made from a variety of materials, including recycled materials, and can be assembled on-site. This would allow us to build a house without the need for natural materials, and would also reduce the amount of time and resources required to construct the house."
