    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology into the water bottleâ€™s lid or body that activates with a button press or when the bottle is closed. This self-cleaning feature would eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring that the water remains pure and the bottle is odor-free. This is particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts or gym-goers who may not have easy access to cleaning supplies.",
    "**Modular Design with Attachments**: Create a modular water bottle that allows users to customize their bottle with different attachments. These could include a filter for purifying water from natural sources, a compartment for storing vitamins or supplements, or even a small blender attachment for making smoothies on the go. This versatility would cater to a variety of lifestyles, from fitness enthusiasts to travelers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a water bottle made entirely from biodegradable or recycled materials, featuring a design that encourages users to recycle or compost it at the end of its life cycle. Additionally, include a system where users can send back their old bottles for a discount on their next purchase, promoting a circular economy and reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Integrated Infuser Chamber**: Design a water bottle with a built-in infuser chamber that allows users to easily add fruits, herbs, or tea leaves to their water. The chamber could be adjustable, allowing users to control the strength of the infusion, and could be easily removed for cleaning. This would encourage healthier hydration habits by making water more flavorful and enjoyable.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Introduce a water bottle with double-walled vacuum insulation and an integrated temperature control system that allows users to set their desired water temperature via a touchscreen on the bottle. The bottle could keep beverages cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours, making it perfect for all-day use, whether at work, the gym, or on outdoor adventures."
