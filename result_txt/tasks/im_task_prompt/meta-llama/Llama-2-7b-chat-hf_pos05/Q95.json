This basket can be equipped with sensors that can detect the weight, texture, and moisture content of the clothes. It can then use this information to sort the clothes into different compartments, such as delicates, heavier items, and lighter items. This would save time and effort when doing laundry, as the user wouldn't have to manually sort the clothes before washing.",
