    "**Incorporating Eco-Tourism with Education**: Develop an interactive educational program that teaches visitors about the park's biodiversity, conservation efforts, and sustainable practices. This could include guided tours led by local ecologists, workshops on plant and animal identification, and eco-friendly activities like bird watching or tree planting. The idea is to not only attract tourists but also educate them about the importance of environmental conservation.",
    "**Virtual Reality Experience**: Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors who can't physically visit the park to explore it in detail. This could include 360-degree videos, interactive narratives, and even virtual reality headsets for a more immersive experience. This would help reach a wider audience, especially those living far away or unable to travel due to various reasons.",
    "**Wildlife Rehabilitation Center**: Establish a center within the park where injured or orphaned wildlife can receive care and rehabilitation. Once they recover, these animals can either be released back into the wild or serve as ambassadors in the park for educational purposes. This initiative would enhance the park's reputation for conservation and education.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Accommodation**: Develop eco-friendly accommodations within the park that utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and are constructed using sustainable materials. This would provide visitors with a unique experience while promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Community Engagement Program**: Initiate a program that encourages local communities to participate in the management and preservation of the park. This could involve training locals in park management skills, offering employment opportunities, and integrating traditional knowledge into conservation strategies. This not only strengthens community ties but also enhances the overall sustainability of the park."
