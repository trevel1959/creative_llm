    "Network Infrastructure: A secure cyber security solution must also address the complexity of network infrastructure. Dealing with diverse networks, firewalls, and potential weak points in each country can make it harder to maintain security. Implementing a unified network infrastructure and standardizing security protocols and procedures would be crucial.",
    "Language and Cultural Barriers: In a multinational company, employees who report security issues or need assistance may come from different language backgrounds. Ensuring that security tools and alerts are in a language that all employees can understand can make a big difference. Additionally, the solution must be culturally sensitive and considerate to overcome any prejudices or misperceptions that may relate to cyber security.",
    "Threat Awareness and Training: A cyber security solution should include adequate training programs for all employees to increase awareness of security risks, understand the company's security policies, and prevent potential attacks. The training should be region-specific to cater to the different cultural and business contexts.",
    "Legal and Regulatory Compliance: It is crucial to ensure that the cyber security solution can help the company maintain compliance with various regulations and cybersecurity-related laws. This includes regulations such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and industry-specific compliance requirements.",
    "Risk Management and Incident Response: A potential problem is managing risks associated with cyberattacks, data breaches, or security incidents. The solution must have a robust incident response plan that accounts for the company's global footprint. The incident response plan should be tailored to each country's incident response laws, regulatory requirements, and cultural context."
