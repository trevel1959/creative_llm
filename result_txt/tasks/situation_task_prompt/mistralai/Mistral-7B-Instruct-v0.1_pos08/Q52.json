    "Inventive Cooking: If all cooking equipment disappeared, it would be time to get creative and think outside the box. You could use unconventional cooking methods like using a pressure cooker to steam vegetables or a slow cooker to cook meat. You could also experiment with grilling or baking food over an open flame or in a cast iron skillet.",
    "DIY Cooking Tools: You could make your own cooking tools by repurposing household items. For example, you could use a muffin tin to make mini pizzas or a baking sheet to roast vegetables. You could also use a blender to make smoothies or a food processor to make pesto.",
    "Community Cooking: You could join a community cooking group or find a cooking class to learn new techniques and recipes. You could also reach out to friends and family to share recipes and cooking tips.",
    "Sustainable Cooking: You could focus on cooking with sustainable and locally sourced ingredients. You could also use alternative cooking methods like solar cooking or using a wood-fired stove.",
