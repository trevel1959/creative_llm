    "**Personalized Sleep Masks with Soundscapes**: In a world without night, personalized sleep masks equipped with noise-canceling technology and customizable soundscapes could become essential. Users could choose from a variety of sounds—like gentle rain, ocean waves, or soothing music—that would play softly as they drift off to sleep. The masks would also have adjustable darkness levels, allowing users to find their ideal level of light reduction, creating a personal sleep sanctuary regardless of the surrounding environment.",
    "**Circadian Rhythm Light Therapy**: Instead of traditional night-time, people could use specialized light therapy devices that emit varying wavelengths of light throughout the day. These devices would be programmed to mimic the natural progression of sunlight, providing bright, energizing light during the day and gradually transitioning to softer, cooler tones in the evening. This would help regulate sleep cycles and promote better sleep quality, allowing individuals to rest effectively despite the absence of night.",
    "**Community Sleep Zones**: In a world without night, communities could create designated sleep zones equipped with calming environments, such as soft lighting, gentle sounds, and comfortable sleeping arrangements. These zones could be located in parks or community centers, allowing people to gather and rest together. The communal aspect would not only provide a tranquil space for sleep but also foster social connections, making the experience more enjoyable and less isolating.",
    "**Dream-Inducing Aromatherapy**: A new trend in sleep aids could involve dream-inducing aromatherapy. Devices would disperse specific scents known to promote relaxation and sleep, such as lavender or chamomile, in conjunction with the sleep pods or masks. These scents would help signal to the brain that it’s time to wind down, creating an atmosphere conducive to sleep even in a bright environment.",
    "**Virtual Reality Sleep Experiences**: To escape the constant brightness of day, individuals could use virtual reality (VR) headsets to immerse themselves in calming, nighttime environments. These VR experiences could simulate starry skies, moonlit beaches, or peaceful forests at night, allowing users to escape into a dreamlike state while their bodies relax. The VR system could also include guided meditations or sleep stories to help users unwind and prepare for sleep."
