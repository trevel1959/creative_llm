    "Bamboo-based structures: Bamboo is one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, and it's incredibly strong and durable. Bamboo can be used to create a variety of structures, from simple dwellings to complex buildings. Bamboo can also be grown and harvested sustainably, making it a highly renewable resource.",
    "Shape-memory alloy structures: Shape-memory alloys are a type of metal that can change shape in response to temperature changes. These alloys can be used to create structures that are lightweight, flexible, and can adapt to different environments. For example, a shape-memory alloy structure could change shape to accommodate different weather conditions, or it could change shape to provide natural ventilation and insulation.",
    "Cellular structures: Cellular structures are made up of a network of interconnected cells that can be filled with air, water, or other materials. These structures can provide excellent insulation and energy efficiency, and they can also be created using a variety of materials, including recycled plastics. Cellular structures could be used to create houses that are both sustainable and comfortable to live in.",
    "Self-healing materials: Self-healing materials are made up of tiny capsules that can repair themselves when they are damaged. These materials could be used to create structures that are highly durable and require minimal maintenance. For example, a self-healing material could be used to create a house that can repair cracks and damage on its own, reducing the need for costly repairs and replacements.",
    "Living walls: Living walls are structures that are covered in plants and other organisms. These walls can provide insulation, air filtration, and even food. Living walls can also be used to create a more natural and peaceful living environment, and they can help to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool a house. Living walls could be used to create houses that are both sustainable and aesthetically pleasing."
