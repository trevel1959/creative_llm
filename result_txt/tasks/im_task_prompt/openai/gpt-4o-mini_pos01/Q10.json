The keyboard could also feature an e-ink display that allows users to change the symbols or languages on the keys.",
    "**Integrated Virtual Assistant**: Instead of relying on external software, embed a sophisticated virtual assistant directly into the laptop's hardware. This assistant could use advanced AI to help with tasks, schedule meetings, manage emails, and even provide context-aware suggestions based on the user's habits and preferences. It could also feature voice recognition that allows for hands-free control.",
    "**Multi-Screen Capability**: Design a laptop with the ability to expand its screen real estate by connecting to additional screens wirelessly. This could be achieved through a built-in feature that allows the laptop to communicate with compatible tablets or monitors, effectively creating a multi-screen workstation without the need for cumbersome cables.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Incorporate sensors into the laptop to monitor the user's health and posture. This could include a heart rate monitor, reminders to take breaks, and alerts when the user is slouching.
