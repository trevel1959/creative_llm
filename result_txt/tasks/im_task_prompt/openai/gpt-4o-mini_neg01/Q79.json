    "**Adjustable Multi-Use Hanger**: This innovative hanger would feature adjustable arms that can be expanded or contracted based on the type of clothing being hung. For instance, it could transform from a standard hanger for shirts to a wider one for dresses or suits. Additionally, it could have detachable clips for hanging skirts or pants, making it versatile for different clothing types and saving space in the closet.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Hanger**: Utilizing advanced technology, this hanger would be coated with a special antimicrobial material that helps prevent bacteria and odors from transferring to clothing. It could also feature a built-in UV light that activates when the closet is closed for a certain period, killing germs and ensuring clothes stay fresh between wears. This would be especially beneficial for activewear or delicate fabrics that are worn multiple times.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Dryer Functionality**: This hanger would include a gentle drying feature that utilizes low-heat air circulation to help dry clothes quickly after washing. Ideal for small apartments or during rainy seasons, the hanger could be plugged in and used to dry delicate items without the need for a full dryer. The design would be sleek and energy-efficient, allowing users to dry clothes without taking up additional space.",
    "**Color-Coding and Tagging System**: This concept involves hangers that come with an integrated color-coding and tagging system. Users could assign different colors or tags to hangers based on clothing types, seasons, or occasions. For example, red for winter wear, blue for summer outfits, or green for formal attire. This would not only make organizing easier but also help users quickly locate specific items in their wardrobe.",
    "**Interactive Hanger with QR Code Labels**: Each hanger would have a small QR code that, when scanned, provides information about the clothing item it holds, such as care instructions, purchase history, and styling tips. This could be linked to an app where users can keep track of their wardrobe, plan outfits, and receive reminders for when to wash or repair items. It adds a digital twist to traditional organization methods."
