    "**Innovative Wheel Design for Accessibility**: Design a steering wheel that incorporates tactile feedback technology. The wheel would have embedded sensors that respond to different driving situations, providing users with haptic feedback through vibrations or pressure changes. This would help drivers with visual impairments navigate more effectively, enhancing safety and confidence on the road.",
    "**Smart Steering Wheel for Autonomous Vehicles**: Develop a steering wheel that acts as a secondary interface between the driver and autonomous vehicle systems. The wheel would display real-time data about the vehicle's surroundings, speed, and navigation decisions, allowing drivers to maintain control in unexpected situations or when necessary to take over from the AI.",
    "**Customizable Performance Steering Wheel**: Create a steering wheel that adapts its grip and shape based on the type of driving (e.g., sport, economy, off-road). Sensors would monitor driving conditions and user preferences, adjusting the wheel's texture, size, and weight to optimize comfort and control during various activities.",
    "**Environmental Awareness Steering Wheel**: Implement a steering wheel that integrates with a car's energy management system. The wheel could change color or texture based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency, encouraging eco-friendly driving habits. For example, a more textured grip might be provided when accelerating gently, while smoother textures might indicate optimal coasting or regenerative braking.",
    "**Health Monitoring Steering Wheel**: Design a steering wheel that monitors the driver's health parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, and even alertness levels. This information could be used to adjust the vehicle's settings, such as changing the music playlist to boost mood or suggesting rest stops to prevent fatigue. The wheel could also integrate with smartwatches or fitness trackers to provide comprehensive health insights."
