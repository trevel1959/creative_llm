    "Solar panels: Install solar panels on your roof or in your backyard to harness the power of the sun and generate electricity to power your home and devices. This will provide you with a sustainable source of light during the day, even if the sun doesn't rise.",
    "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs): Replace traditional light bulbs with LED lights in your home and office. LED lights are energy-efficient and can be powered by a battery or a solar panel.",
    "Natural light: Make sure your home is designed to maximize natural light. Use large windows and skylights to let in as much light as possible. You can also paint your walls in light colors to reflect the light.",
    "Artificial light: Use artificial light sources such as lamps, candles, or even fireflies to provide light during the day. These sources may not be as bright as the sun, but they can still provide enough light for basic tasks.",
    "Emergency preparedness: Keep a supply of flashlights, batteries, and other emergency lighting equipment on hand. This will ensure you have a backup source of light in case the sun doesn't rise."
