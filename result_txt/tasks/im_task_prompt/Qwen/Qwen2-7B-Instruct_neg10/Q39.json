    "**Smart Garden Hose with Temperature Sensing**: Develop a garden hose that has temperature sensors built-in. This would allow the user to monitor the water temperature as it comes out of the hose, useful for watering plants that are sensitive to temperature changes. The hose could also have a companion app that provides recommendations on the best time to water based on the weather forecast and soil moisture levels.",
    "**Garden Hose with Built-in LED Lights**: Integrate LED lights into the garden hose itself, which can be activated when the hose is in use. These lights can help illuminate dark areas during night-time watering or even double as a security feature by lighting up paths and walkways around the garden.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Garden Hose**: Create a hose that can clean itself after each use. This might involve a mechanism that flushes out any debris or sediment left inside the hose. It could also have an antimicrobial coating to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi, keeping the hose clean and hygienic.",
    "**Expandable Garden Hose with Adjustable Flow**: Design a hose that starts off compact and expands to its full length upon use. The flow rate could be adjusted using a dial or button, providing users with precise control over how much water they need for different gardening tasks.",
    "**Solar-Powered Garden Hose with Integrated Battery**: Introduce a garden hose equipped with solar panels and a rechargeable battery. This setup allows the hose to charge itself while in sunlight, providing a continuous water supply without the need for an electrical outlet nearby. The battery could also power other features, such as the aforementioned smart functions or lights."
