    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Design a wristband or belt that provides haptic feedback to convey information about the surroundings. The device could use vibrations to indicate the proximity of obstacles, the direction of sounds, or even the layout of a room. For example, if a user is walking toward a wall, the device would vibrate more intensely as they get closer, helping them to avoid collisions and enhancing their spatial awareness.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Cane**: Develop a high-tech cane that not only aids in walking but also incorporates voice recognition and smart technology. Users could ask the cane for information about their environment, such as nearby landmarks, weather conditions, or public transportation options. The cane could also have a built-in emergency feature that allows users to send their location to a designated contact with a simple voice command.",
    "**Interactive Learning App for Orientation and Mobility**: Create a mobile application that provides visually impaired users with interactive lessons on orientation and mobility skills. The app could include gamified scenarios where users practice navigating through virtual environments using audio cues and voice commands. It could also connect users with certified orientation and mobility specialists for personalized guidance, making learning more accessible and engaging.",
    "**Sensory-enhanced Home Automation System**: Design a smart home system that integrates with various devices to provide visually impaired users with enhanced sensory feedback. For example, smart lights could change colors or emit specific sounds when a door is opened, while appliances could provide audio alerts when they are in use. This system would help users navigate their homes more easily and independently, fostering a greater sense of autonomy.",
    "**Braille-Enabled Smart Display**: Develop a tactile display that converts digital information into braille in real-time. This device could be used to read emails, texts, or web pages, providing a more interactive experience for visually impaired users. By incorporating a refreshable braille display, users could feel the text as it appears, allowing for a seamless reading experience that keeps pace with modern communication methods."
