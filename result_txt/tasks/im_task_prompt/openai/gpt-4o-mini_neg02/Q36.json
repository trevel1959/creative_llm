    "**Ergonomic Multi-Function Handle**: Redesign the handle of the knife to be more ergonomic, with a shape that fits comfortably in the hand. This handle could also include interchangeable grips that can be swapped out for different users or tasks (e.g., a grip for fine slicing versus a grip for chopping). Additionally, the handle could incorporate a built-in scale to weigh ingredients as they are cut.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**: Develop a knife with a self-sharpening mechanism that activates each time the knife is sheathed or unsheathed. This could involve a small grinding stone embedded in the sheath that aligns with the blade, keeping it sharp without the need for manual sharpening. This would ensure that the knife remains effective over time and reduces the maintenance required by the user.",
    "**Color-Coded Safety System**: Create a knife with a color-coded blade that changes color based on the type of food being cut. For example, a red blade for raw meat, green for vegetables, and blue for fish. This visual cue would help prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen, promoting food safety and hygiene.",
    "**Magnetic Knife Holder with Built-in Knife Maintenance**: Design a magnetic knife holder that not only displays knives attractively but also includes a built-in honing rod or sharpening mechanism. Users could easily hone their knives after use by sliding the blade along the holder, ensuring that their knives are always ready for action while keeping them safe and accessible.",
    "**Knife with Adjustable Blade Length**: Innovate a knife that features an adjustable blade length. The user could easily switch between a longer blade for larger tasks and a shorter blade for precision cutting by simply sliding the blade in or out of the handle. This versatility would be especially useful in compact kitchens or for outdoor cooking, where space and tools are limited."
