    "**Insect Decoy Technology**:    Develop high-tech decoys that mimic the appearance and pheromones of insects' natural predators. For example, these decoys could resemble dragonflies or spiders, effectively tricking pests into avoiding areas where they perceive danger. This technology could utilize biodegradable materials and solar power, ensuring minimal environmental impact.",
    "**Microbial Pest Control**:    Harness the power of beneficial microbes to control pest populations. Scientists could isolate specific strains of bacteria or fungi that are harmful to certain pests but harmless to humans and plants. These microbes could be sprayed onto crops or infested areas, targeting pests directly and reducing their numbers through natural biological processes.",
    "**Smart Traps with AI Monitoring**:    Design smart traps equipped with AI that can identify and capture specific pest species. These traps would use visual and olfactory sensors to distinguish between harmful insects and beneficial ones. Once captured, the AI could analyze population trends and provide data for future pest management strategies, creating a feedback loop for more effective control.",
    "**Pest-Specific Habitat Manipulation**:    Create controlled environments that modify habitats to discourage pests. For example, altering humidity levels, temperature, and light exposure in specific areas could make them less attractive to pests while still being suitable for human activities. This method would focus on creating unfavorable conditions for pests without harming the surrounding ecosystem.",
    "**Community-Driven Biocontrol Initiatives**:    Foster community involvement in biocontrol initiatives where residents collaborate to introduce or maintain populations of non-pest insects that naturally compete with or prey on harmful pests. This could involve educational programs to raise awareness about beneficial insects, encouraging local residents to create habitats that support these species."
