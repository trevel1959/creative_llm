    "**The Bartering System 2.0**: In a post-currency world, people would rely on a digital platform to facilitate bartering. This platform, called \"TradeHub,\" would allow individuals to list their skills, services, and goods, and match them with others who need them. For example, a musician could offer music lessons in exchange for a carpenter's services to build a new instrument. TradeHub would use a reputation system to ensure trust and fairness among users. As people trade, the platform would track their transactions, providing a transparent record of their bartering history.",

People would earn \"Time Credits\" by contributing to their community, such as volunteering, mentoring, or participating in local events.

SkillSwap would rely on word-of-mouth referrals and reputation systems to ensure trust and quality.",
    "**The Local Exchange Trading System (LETS)**: Inspired by the LETS system, people would create a network of local exchanges, where individuals trade goods and services within their community. A digital platform, \"LETS Connect,\" would facilitate these exchanges, allowing people to list their offerings and find what they need.
