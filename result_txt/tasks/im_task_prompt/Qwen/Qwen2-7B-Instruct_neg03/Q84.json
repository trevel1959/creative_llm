    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Personalized Storage**: Create a coat rack that not only holds garments but also personalizes each hanger to fit different types of clothing. For example, one end of the hanger could be designed to hold coats, while the other could be for hats or scarves. Each hanger could have a small digital display or LED light that changes color based on the time of day or the user's preference, making it both functional and visually appealing.",
    "**Smart Coat Rack with Climate Control**: Integrate a smart system into the coat rack that can monitor the weather outside and adjust the temperature of the storage area accordingly. It could feature built-in heaters, coolers, or dehumidifiers to ensure that garments are stored in the most optimal conditions, reducing the risk of damage from extreme temperatures or humidity.",
    "**Vertical Space Expander**: Design a wall-mounted coat rack that uses vertical space efficiently. This rack could have multiple levels, each with adjustable shelves or hanging rods, allowing users to store a variety of items, from coats and hats to bags and shoes. The design could include hidden wheels at the base, enabling easy repositioning without the need for furniture disassembly.",
    "**Recycled Material Coat Rack**: Craft a coat rack using recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood or metal pieces, giving old materials a new lease on life. The design could incorporate elements like old bicycle parts, industrial pipes, or salvaged wood from old buildings, creating a unique piece that tells a story and reduces environmental impact.",
    "**DIY Modular Coat Rack System**: Offer a set of customizable components that allow users to build their own coat rack according to their needs and preferences. This could include various lengths of rods, hooks, shelves, and decorative elements. The modular nature of this system would encourage creativity and adaptability, making it suitable for any space and style."
