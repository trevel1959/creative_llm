    "escapes and Fire-Resistant Shelters: Create a series of escape routes from your home, including windows, doors, and alternate routes such as a fire-resistant shelter. This shelter can be a prefabricated structure made of fire-resistant materials, such as a metal or concrete bunker, or a DIY shelter made of non-combustible materials like brick, stone, or metal. Make sure the shelter is easily accessible and has a clear path to safety.",
    "Water-Based Fire Suppression: Gather a collection of large containers, such as buckets, tubs, or even old swimming pools, and fill them with water. Place these containers throughout your home, strategically located near potential fire hazards. In the event of a fire, use a hose or a garden hose to direct water onto the flames. This unconventional method may not be as effective as a fire truck, but it can help contain the fire and slow its spread until professional help arrives.",
    "Smoke Detector and Alarm System: Create a DIY smoke detector and alarm system using a combination of household items.

Place these devices throughout your home, near potential fire hazards, to provide early warning in the event of a fire.",
    "Fire-Resistant Materials: Utilize fire-resistant materials in your home's construction and decor. For example, use fire-resistant roofing materials, such as ceramic or slate tiles, and fire-resistant siding, such as brick or stucco. Additionally, use fire-resistant curtains, blinds, and bedding to help contain flames. This approach may not provide an immediate solution to a fire, but it can help slow the spread of flames and reduce damage to your home.",
    "Community Support Network: In the event of a fire, reach out to your neighbors and local community for help.
