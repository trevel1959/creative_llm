It could also sync with other smart home devices, like turning on lights or adjusting thermostat settings, providing a seamless experience when transitioning between tasks.",
    "**Personal Safety Flashlight Necklace**: Create a personal safety flashlight necklace that emits a high-decibel alarm when activated. This flashlight necklace can be discreetly worn around the neck and has a button or sensor that, when pressed or triggered, activates both the flashlight and the alarm, helping to deter potential attackers or alert others in the vicinity of danger.",
    "**Educational Science Kit Flashlight**: Design an educational science kit flashlight that comes with components and instructions for students to build their own flashlight. This kit would include simple materials like LED bulbs, batteries, conductive tape, and circuit boards. By building the flashlight themselves, students can learn about basic electrical circuits, power sources, and the principles of light emission, making learning fun and engaging."
