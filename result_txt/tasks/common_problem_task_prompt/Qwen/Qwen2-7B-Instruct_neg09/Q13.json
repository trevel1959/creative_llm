    "**Pet Dragon Adoption Agency**: Create an online platform that connects potential owners with trained dragons looking for homes. The agency could provide a comprehensive package including dragon care guides, health check-ups, and legal advice on owning exotic pets. Additionally, the platform could offer matchmaking services based on compatibility tests to ensure each dragon finds a suitable owner.",

These sessions could be conducted both online and in-person, offering a unique and engaging therapy experience that combines the calming presence of dragons with traditional therapeutic techniques.",
    "**Dragons as Educational Tools**: Design a set of interactive educational materials centered around pet dragons, suitable for schools, libraries, and community centers. The materials could include books, videos, and hands-on activities that teach children about different species of dragons, their habitats, diets, and behaviors. By integrating these resources into the curriculum, students would learn while caring for a virtual pet dragon, enhancing their learning experience.",
    "**Dragons in the Culinary Arts**: Organize a cooking competition featuring dishes prepared using ingredients sourced from dragon farms.
