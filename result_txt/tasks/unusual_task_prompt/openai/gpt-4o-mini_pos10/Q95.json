    "**Dusting Cloths**: Instead of using traditional dust cloths, use coffee filters for dusting surfaces. Their lint-free texture makes them perfect for cleaning glass and electronics without leaving any residue or scratches. They can be used dry or slightly dampened for added effectiveness.",
    "**Microwave Splatter Guard**: Place a coffee filter over your food when microwaving to prevent splatters. It allows steam to escape while keeping your microwave clean. This is particularly useful when reheating foods that tend to bubble over, such as sauces or soups.",
    "**Portable Snack Bags**: Use coffee filters as makeshift snack bags for on-the-go munching. They can hold popcorn, nuts, or chips without the mess of crumbs, and they’re easy to dispose of afterward. Simply fold the filter into a cone shape and secure it with a piece of tape or a rubber band.",
    "**Crafting Material**: Coffee filters can be transformed into a variety of craft projects.

This makes them a fun and inexpensive option for kids’ art projects or home decorations.",
