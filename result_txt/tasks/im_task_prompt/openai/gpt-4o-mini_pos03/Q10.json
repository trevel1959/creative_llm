    "**Integrated AI Personal Assistant**:    A built-in AI personal assistant that learns the userâ€™s habits and preferences over time could revolutionize how we interact with laptops. This assistant would manage tasks, suggest applications, automate repetitive processes, and even help prioritize work. It could also provide real-time feedback on productivity and suggest breaks or exercises to enhance well-being during long work sessions.",
    "**Modular Design**:    A modular laptop design would allow users to easily upgrade or replace components like RAM, storage, battery, and even the keyboard or screen. This approach would not only extend the lifespan of the laptop but also cater to users with different needs. For example, a gamer could swap in a high-performance graphics module, while a student might prioritize battery life and portability.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Sources**:    Laptops could be made from biodegradable materials or recycled plastics, reducing their environmental impact. Additionally, integrating solar panels into the laptop design could provide supplementary power for basic tasks, especially for users who are frequently on the go. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in technology.",
    "**Enhanced Haptic Feedback**:    Instead of a traditional touchpad, imagine a laptop that features an advanced haptic feedback system that allows users to feel the texture of virtual objects or different interface elements. This technology could provide tactile responses that enhance the user experience, especially in creative applications like graphic design or music production, making the laptop feel more intuitive and immersive.",
    "**Dynamic Keyboard Layout**:    A laptop with a dynamic keyboard that can change its layout based on the application being used could enhance user efficiency. For instance, when using design software, the keyboard could display shortcuts and relevant tools, while during coding, it could switch to a layout optimized for programming. This feature could be achieved using e-ink technology, allowing for easy reconfiguration without the need for physical alterations."
