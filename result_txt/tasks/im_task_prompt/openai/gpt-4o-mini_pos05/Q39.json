    "**Expandable Hose with Built-in Water Filtration**: Design a hose that expands when filled with water but also includes a built-in filtration system. This would allow users to connect the hose to any water source, including ponds or rain barrels, and filter out debris and contaminants before watering plants. This would promote sustainable gardening practices by making use of non-traditional water sources.",
    "**Multi-Function Hose with Attachments**: Create a garden hose that features interchangeable heads for different tasks. Attachments could include a sprinkler, a pressure washer nozzle, a soaker hose end, and a misting head for delicate plants. This versatility would reduce the need for multiple hoses and tools, making gardening more efficient and enjoyable.",
    "**Color-Changing Hose for Overheating Prevention**: Develop a hose made from thermochromic materials that change color when the temperature of the water inside exceeds a certain threshold. This would alert users to potential overheating, which can damage plants or lead to the hose bursting. The color change could also serve as a fun visual indicator, adding an aesthetic element to gardening.",
    "**Self-Retracting Hose with Reel Mechanism**: Innovate a garden hose with an automatic retractable mechanism that rewinds the hose into a compact reel when not in use. This would prevent tangling and kinking while keeping the garden area tidy. The reel could also be designed to be mounted on a wall or easily portable for convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hose Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a hose using recycled plastics or biodegradable materials that are durable yet environmentally friendly. This hose could promote sustainability in gardening, appealing to eco-conscious consumers. It could also feature a unique design that incorporates plant-based colors and textures, making it visually appealing."
