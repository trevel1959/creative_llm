    "Use drones to carry pollen from one plant to another: Drones can be equipped with small containers that can hold pollen. These drones can be programmed to fly over the plants and release the pollen on the stigma of the flowers. This process can be repeated for each plant that needs pollination.",
    "Use wind to carry pollen: Wind can be harnessed to carry pollen from one plant to another. This can be done by placing a device that captures the wind near the flowers and directing it towards the stigma of the other plant.",
    "Use a hand-held tool to transfer pollen: A hand-held tool can be used to transfer pollen from one flower to another. This can be done by using a small brush or a spoon to scoop up the pollen and transfer it to the stigma of the other plant.",
    "Use water to transport pollen: Water can be used to transport pollen from one plant to another. This can be done by placing a small container of water near the flowers and using a dropper to transfer the water to the stigma of the other plant.",
    "Use a pollinator robot: A pollinator robot can be designed to carry pollen from one plant to another. The robot can be programmed to move around the garden and release pollen on the stigma of the other plants. This can be an efficient and effective way to pollinate plants, especially in large gardens."
