    "Safety Concerns: Robots may pose safety risks to humans if they are not programmed properly or if they malfunction. For example, a robot designed for cleaning might accidentally injure someone with its cleaning equipment.",
    "Technical Challenges: Developing a robot that can perform complex tasks requires advanced engineering and programming. This can be challenging and costly, especially if the robot needs to be able to adapt to changing environments.",
    "Energy Consumption: Robots require power to operate, and this power must be sourced from somewhere. If the robot is designed to be mobile, it may need to carry a battery or other power source, which can add weight and reduce its maneuverability.",
    "Maintenance and Repair: Robots are machines, and like all machines, they will eventually require maintenance and repair. This can be time-consuming and costly, especially if the robot is complex.",
    "User Training: Robots may require training for users to understand how to interact with them and use them effectively. This can be time-consuming and may require specialized training."
