    "Train: Another option would be to take a train journey across the landmass. Depending on the distance and available routes, this could be a viable option for reaching another continent.",
    "Ferry: In some cases, ferries can be used as an alternative to planes for traveling across bodies of water. This might be possible for shorter distances or between nearby continents.",
    "Private Boat: For those with the means, a private boat could be used to travel across the ocean. This would allow for more flexibility in terms of scheduling and destinations.",
    "Overland: In some cases, overland travel might be possible, such as through a tunnel or bridge that spans a large body of water. This would require significant infrastructure and engineering, but it could be a viable option in the future.",
    "Space Travel: While currently not feasible for commercial travel, space travel could potentially be an option for reaching another continent in the future."
