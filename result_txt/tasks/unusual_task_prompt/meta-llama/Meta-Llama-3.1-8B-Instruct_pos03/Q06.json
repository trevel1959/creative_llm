    "**Eco-Friendly Urban Farming Tower**: Design a modular, self-sustaining urban farming tower that integrates green roofs, vertical gardens, and a built-in hydroponic system. The tower would be made from recycled materials and would use rainwater harvesting and solar power to minimize its environmental footprint.",
    "**Smart Bike Lane**: Develop a smart bike lane that incorporates AI-powered sensors and LED lights to create a dynamic, responsive infrastructure for cyclists. The system would detect cyclist speed, traffic volume, and weather conditions to adjust the lighting and traffic flow in real-time, ensuring a safer and more efficient ride.",
    "**Bioluminescent Streetlights**: Create a line of bioluminescent streetlights that harness the power of microorganisms to produce a soft, ethereal glow. These streetlights would not only reduce energy consumption but also create a mesmerizing, otherworldly ambiance in urban environments.",
    "**Water Recycling Pods**: Design a series of compact, modular water recycling pods that can be installed in public spaces, such as parks or plazas. These pods would use advanced filtration systems to collect and recycle rainwater, graywater, and blackwater, reducing urban water waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Sound-Absorbing Urban Canopy**: Develop a modular, deployable urban canopy that uses advanced acoustic materials to absorb and dissipate sound waves, reducing noise pollution in urban areas. The canopy would be designed to be easily installed and removed, making it a flexible solution for addressing noise issues in cities."
