    "**Hydroponic Farming**: I would invest in a hydroponic system, which would allow me to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables indoors, regardless of the external climate. This would not only provide a consistent supply of fresh produce but also reduce water consumption by up to 90%. I would use a combination of LED grow lights and a precise climate control system to optimize plant growth and minimize energy consumption. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Aquaponic System**: I would set up an aquaponic system, which combines fish farming with hydroponic gardening. This would provide a sustainable source of protein (fish) and a variety of fruits and vegetables, all in one closed-loop system. The waste produced by the fish would be converted into nutrients for the plants, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Urban Beekeeping**: I would become an urban beekeeper, maintaining a rooftop apiary to harvest honey and other bee products. This would not only provide a source of natural sweetener but also help pollinate local flora, supporting the growth of wild plants and urban gardens. I would also sell excess honey and beeswax to local markets. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Vertical Farming**: I would invest in a vertical farming setup, using a combination of LED grow lights and aeroponic systems to grow a variety of crops in a vertically stacked manner. This would maximize space usage and minimize land requirements, making it an ideal solution for urban areas. I would focus on growing high-demand crops like leafy greens and herbs. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Foraging and Wildcrafting**: I would focus on foraging and wildcrafting, using my knowledge of local flora to identify and harvest wild edibles. This would require a deep understanding of the local ecosystem and the ability to navigate and identify plants safely. I would also preserve and store excess foraged produce to ensure a steady supply throughout the year. (Confidence score: 0.8) [/INST] "
