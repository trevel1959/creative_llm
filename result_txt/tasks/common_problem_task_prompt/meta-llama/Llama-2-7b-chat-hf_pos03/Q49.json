    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Paralyzed Individuals: Create a revolutionary technology that enables individuals with severe physical disabilities, such as paralysis, to control electronic devices and communicate through thought. By developing a BCI system that reads brain signals and translates them into digital commands, individuals with paralysis can control wheelchairs, smartphones, and other devices with their minds. This technology can improve their quality of life, independence, and overall well-being.",
    "Personalized Cancer Treatment Using Artificial Intelligence (AI): Develop an AI-powered platform that provides personalized cancer treatment recommendations based on a patient's genetic profile, medical history, and treatment responses. This technology can help doctors identify the most effective treatment for each patient, reduce side effects, and improve patient outcomes. By analyzing vast amounts of cancer data, the AI system can identify patterns and connections that human doctors may miss, leading to more accurate diagnoses and better treatment plans.",
    "Self-Healing Materials for Injury Prevention and Treatment: Create a new class of materials that can repair themselves in response to injuries or damage. These materials, inspired by nature's self-healing processes, could be used in a variety of applications, including medical devices, aerospace, and automotive. By incorporating self-healing properties into materials, injuries could be prevented or treated more effectively, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming repairs.",
    "Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy for Mental Health: Develop a VR platform that provides immersive, evidence-based therapy experiences for individuals with mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. By simulating real-world environments and situations, VR therapy can help individuals confront and overcome their fears and anxieties in a safe and controlled environment. This technology can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health treatment and provide a more accessible and effective form of therapy.",
    "Advanced Water Purification Using Nanotechnology: Create a nanotechnology-based water purification system that can remove even the smallest pollutants and contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption. By using nanoparticles to capture and destroy harmful substances, this"
