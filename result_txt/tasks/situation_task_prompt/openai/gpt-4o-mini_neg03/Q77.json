    "**Artificial Mountain Ranges**: Imagine constructing artificial mountains using eco-friendly materials, creating a new kind of recreational area. These man-made mountains could offer climbing walls, zip lines, and hiking paths, complete with integrated ecosystems to promote biodiversity. These areas could be designed to mimic the natural beauty of mountains, with waterfalls, caves, and lookout points, providing outdoor enthusiasts a place to explore, climb, and engage in adventure sports.",
    "**Coastal Adventure Parks**: With mountains out of the picture, coastal areas could be developed into expansive adventure parks. Activities like surfing, paddleboarding, and beach volleyball could be complemented by windsurfing, kiteboarding, and snorkeling. These parks could feature climbing walls made from repurposed materials, beach obstacle courses, and eco-tours that explore marine life, ensuring that outdoor fun is not limited to mountainous terrain.",
    "**Forest Exploration Programs**: The absence of mountains could lead to a greater emphasis on forested areas. Outdoor programs could be designed to explore and learn about local ecosystems, with guided hikes focusing on flora and fauna, foraging for edible plants, and wildlife tracking. Workshops on survival skills, such as shelter building and fire-making, could be offered, promoting a deeper connection with nature in the woods.",
    "**Sky Parks and Elevated Walkways**: Cities could develop sky parks and elevated walkways, transforming urban spaces into high-altitude recreational areas. These could include jogging paths, bike lanes, and picnic spots suspended above the city, offering panoramic views and fresh air. Fitness classes, yoga sessions, and outdoor movie nights could be hosted in these sky parks, turning urban outdoor activities into social experiences.",
    "**Waterway Exploration Adventures**: With mountains gone, rivers and lakes could become the focal points for outdoor activities. Kayaking, canoeing, and paddleboarding could be promoted, with guided tours that explore local wildlife and ecosystems. Community events like river clean-ups and fishing tournaments could foster a sense of stewardship for these waterways, encouraging people to connect with nature in a different way."
