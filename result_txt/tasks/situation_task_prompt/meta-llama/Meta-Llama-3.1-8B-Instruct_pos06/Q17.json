    "**Solar-Powered Haven**: I'd create a self-sustaining shelter using solar panels to generate electricity, a water collection system, and a garden for food. This would provide me with a reliable source of power, clean water, and nutritious food. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Wind-Powered Water Purification**: I'd design a wind turbine to generate electricity, which would power a water purification system. This would allow me to access clean drinking water, even in areas with limited natural resources. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: I'd cultivate bioluminescent organisms to create a sustainable lighting source. This would provide me with a safe and energy-efficient way to navigate and work during the night. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Composting Toilet and Gas Generation**: I'd create a composting toilet that converts human waste into a usable gas, which could be harnessed for cooking and heating. This would minimize waste and provide a reliable energy source. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Hydroelectric Power Generation**: I'd design a small-scale hydroelectric system that harnesses the energy of a nearby stream or river to generate electricity. This would provide a reliable and renewable source of power. (Confidence: 0.95)"
