    "Solar-powered devices: Solar panels can be used to charge devices. Solar panels can be attached to the device or placed near it to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity.",
    "Hand-crank-powered devices: Hand-crank generators can be used to generate electricity to power devices. This is an old-fashioned method but it can still be used in emergencies.",
    "Wind-powered devices: Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity to power devices. This is a more advanced method but it can be used in areas with strong winds.",
    "Kinetic-powered devices: Kinetic energy can be used to power devices. This can be done by using a generator that converts the energy from movement into electricity.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell-powered devices: Hydrogen fuel cells can be used to generate electricity to power devices. This method is more expensive but it is a clean and efficient way to generate electricity."
