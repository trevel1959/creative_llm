    "Oil Earth: If the Earth's oceans were made of oil, the planet would likely become warmer, as oil has a higher heat capacity than water. This could lead to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and global warming. The oil oceans would also be toxic to fish and other aquatic life forms. The impact on weather patterns, however, would be difficult to predict without more information about how oil behaves at such a large scale. On a positive note, the oil layer might dampen waves and reduce the risk of tsunamis and large-scale oceanic phenomena like the El Niño and the La Niña.",
    "Saline Earth: If the Earth's oceans were made of saline solution (a mixture of salt and water), the planet's climate would be significantly altered. Saline water has a higher specific heat capacity than water, meaning it would take more energy to change its temperature. This could lead to more stable climate conditions and help regulate our planet's temperature. The impact on aquatic life would depend on the concentration of salt.",
    "Icy Earth: If the Earth's oceans were made of ice, the planet would be much colder, as ice has a much lower heat capacity than water. In this scenario, the surface of the Earth would be freezing, rendering it uninhabitable for many or even all of the planet's life forms. The impact on the atmosphere would be significant, as ice-covered oceans would have a different interaction with the sun and weather patterns.",
    "Silver Earth: If the Earth's oceans were made of silver liquid, there would be no significant difference from our current oceans. Silver is a good conductor of heat, and its impact on the planet's climate would likely be minimal. The interaction with aquatic life would also be minimal, as silver is toxic to many organisms.",
    "Mercury Earth: If the Earth's oceans were made of mercury, the planet would be significantly warmer, as mercury has a higher specific heat capacity and thermodynamic temperature than water. However, the toxicity of mercury would pose a grave threat to aquatic life and would likely make the atmosphere even more toxic, leading to severe health problems for terrestrial life. On the plus side, mercury is a good conductor of heat and may help regulate the planet's temperature."
