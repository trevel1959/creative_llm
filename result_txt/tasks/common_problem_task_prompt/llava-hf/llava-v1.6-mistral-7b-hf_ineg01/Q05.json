    "**Accessibility**: Once the tree house is completed, it's essential to ensure that it can be safely accessed. Without proper handrails, ladders, or ropes, people, especially children, may have difficulty reaching the tree house or exiting safely, especially in case of an emergency.",
    "**Weather Exposure**: Tree houses are often built high in trees and exposed to the elements. Protecting against rain, wind, and UV exposure can be challenging, requiring the use of moisture-resistant materials and careful attention to weather-proofing details.",
    "**Code Compliance**: Depending on the location, there may be local building codes that must be followed. These can include regulations on tree house construction, height restrictions, and safety requirements.",
    "**Natural Decay**: Prolonged exposure to the elements can cause the wood structure to decay, weakening the tree house over time. Installing regular inspections and maintenance plans can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Wildlife Inhabitation**: Building a tree house could attract wildlife, such as insects or birds. Incorporating screens or netting around openings and installing deterrents, like predator urine, can help reduce the impact of wildlife occupancy."
