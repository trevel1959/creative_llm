    "Shapes and silhouettes: Objects with distinct shapes and silhouettes would still be recognizable even in a black and white world. For instance, a circular object like a ball would still be distinguishable from a rectangular object like a book by its shape alone.",
    "Texture and weight: Different textures and weights would still be perceivable through touch. For example, a smooth, round stone would feel different from a rough, jagged rock. This sensory information could help identify objects even without color.",
    "Sound: Sounds produce unique frequencies and vibrations that could be used to identify objects. For instance, a bell would produce a distinct ringing sound, while a drum would produce a more muffled, resonant sound. By paying attention to the sounds around you, you could identify objects without relying on color.",
    "Smell: The distinct scents of different objects could serve as a means of identification. For example, the pungent aroma of a freshly cut apple would be easy to distinguish from the earthy scent of soil. Even without color, the sense of smell could help you navigate your surroundings.",
    "Reflections and refractions: Objects with unique reflective properties could still be identified through their reflections and refractions of light. For example, a mirror-like surface like a still pond would reflect light in a specific way, while a transparent object like a prism would refract light in a distinct pattern. By paying attention to the way light interacts with objects, you could identify them even in a black and white world."
