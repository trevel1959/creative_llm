    "Solar panel farms on water: Instead of installing solar panels on rooftops, create large solar panel farms on the water bodies like lakes, rivers, or seas. This will increase the total solar energy production capacity of the city and also help in reducing the land usage.",
    "Solar-powered electric vehicles: Encourage the use of electric vehicles (EVs) in the city by providing incentives for buying and using EVs. Install solar panels on the rooftops of homes and businesses to charge the EVs, reducing the city's dependence on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Solar-powered community centers: Set up community centers in the city that run entirely on solar power. These centers can provide a hub for community activities, events, and educational programs, promoting sustainable living practices and raising awareness about the benefits of renewable energy.",
    "Solar-powered streetlights: Replace traditional streetlights with solar-powered LED lights, which can be charged during the day using solar panels installed on nearby buildings or on light poles. This will reduce the city's energy consumption and lower maintenance costs.",
    "Solar-powered water treatment plants: Install solar panels at water treatment plants to power the treatment processes, reducing the energy consumption of the plants and lowering the city's carbon footprint. This will also help in ensuring a clean and safe water supply for the city's residents."
