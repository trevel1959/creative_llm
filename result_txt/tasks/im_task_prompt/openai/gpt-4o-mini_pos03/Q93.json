    "**Customizable Weight Distribution**: Develop a bowling ball with adjustable weight distribution. This could be achieved through a system of interchangeable weights or a liquid-filled core that can be modified. Bowlers could change the ball's dynamics based on their playing style or lane conditions, allowing for a more personalized experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a bowling ball made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that maintain performance standards. This could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the ecological impact of bowling. The ball could also feature a unique design that highlights its eco-friendly attributes.",
    "**Interactive LED Surface**: Design a bowling ball with an embedded LED surface that lights up in different colors based on the type of throw or score achieved. For example, the ball could glow green for strikes and red for gutter balls. This feature could enhance the visual experience of bowling, especially in glow bowling settings.",
    "**Grip-Enhancing Technology**: Introduce a bowling ball with a textured, adaptive grip surface that changes based on the bowler's hand moisture or temperature. This would provide a better hold for the bowler, reducing the risk of slipping and improving accuracy. The grip could also be customizable, allowing bowlers to choose their preferred texture.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Coaching**: Pair the bowling ball with AR glasses that offer real-time coaching feedback while the bowler is on the lane. The glasses could overlay graphics showing the ideal release point, trajectory lines, and target areas on the lane. This would help bowlers visualize their throws and make adjustments instantly."
