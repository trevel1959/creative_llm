    "**The \"Envy Jar\"**: Create a jar where you write down the tasks that make you feel envious of others' completion.

This jar will serve as a reminder of your goals and help you identify patterns in your procrastination.",
    "**The \"Mirror, Mirror\" Technique**: When you feel envious, take a few minutes to reflect on your own strengths and accomplishments.

    "**The \"Task Swap\" Challenge**: Identify a task that makes you feel envious and challenge yourself to swap it with a similar task you've been putting off. This exercise helps you develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for completing tasks, rather than feeling envious of others' progress.",
    "**The \"Envy Map\"**: Create a mind map or a visual representation of the tasks that make you feel envious.
