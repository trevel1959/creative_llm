    "**Themed Garden**: Create a garden with a specific theme such as a \"Secret Fairy Garden\" or a \"Fantasy World Garden\". You could include whimsical elements like fairy houses, gnome statues, or even a small bridge over a pond. Each plant could be chosen to match the theme, whether it's bright colors for a magical feel or lush, dark greens for a mysterious ambiance.",
    "**Vertical Garden**: If space is limited, consider building a vertical garden using trellises, wall planters, or even a DIY pallet wall. This not only maximizes your space but also adds an element of intrigue and height to your backyard. Plants like climbing roses, ivy, or ferns would be perfect for this setup.",
    "**Edible Forest Garden**: Mimic a forest ecosystem by planting trees, shrubs, and ground cover that provide food, shelter, and beauty. Include plants like blueberries, raspberries, nuts, and various herbs. The garden can serve as a sustainable food source and also look aesthetically pleasing with a mix of tall trees and shorter edible plants.",
    "**Pollinator Paradise**: Design a garden that specifically attracts bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. Choose a variety of flowers that bloom throughout the season, providing nectar and pollen year-round. Planting lavender, sunflowers, marigolds, and daisies can help create a haven for these important pollinators.",
    "**Sensory Garden**: Incorporate plants that appeal to multiple senses - sight, touch, smell, and sound. For example, include fragrant herbs like rosemary and lavender, tactile plants like textured succulents or fuzzy echeverias, and sound-producing elements like a water feature or rustling bamboo. This type of garden can offer a multi-sensory experience, making it particularly engaging for children and adults alike."
