    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Integrate an AR viewfinder that overlays real-time information and creative filters directly onto the cameraâ€™s view. This feature could provide users with data such as composition guides, exposure settings, and artistic effects (like virtual lighting) as they frame their shots, enhancing both the creative process and technical accuracy.",
    "**Modular Camera Design**: Create a modular camera system where users can easily swap out components like the sensor, battery, and grip based on their needs. This would allow photographers to customize their camera for specific shoots, whether they need a high-resolution sensor for landscapes or a lightweight body for travel photography.",
    "**Gesture Control Interface**: Introduce a gesture control interface that allows photographers to operate the camera hands-free. Users could set up the camera on a tripod and use hand gestures to zoom in/out, change settings, or take photos, making it ideal for solo shoots or capturing candid moments without disrupting the scene.",
    "**360-Degree Lens Attachment**: Design a compact 360-degree lens attachment that can be easily mounted onto existing cameras. This would allow photographers to capture immersive panoramic shots without needing a dedicated 360-degree camera, expanding their creative possibilities and simplifying their gear.",
    "**AI-Powered Editing Suggestions**: Integrate an AI-powered editing assistant within the camera that analyzes the images taken and suggests editing adjustments in real-time. This feature could provide recommendations for cropping, color grading, and exposure corrections, streamlining the post-processing workflow for photographers."
