    "**Adaptive Clothing and Wearable Technology**: In this idea, clothing would be designed to help people with poor vision navigate their surroundings. For example, a jacket might have haptic feedback that guides users through crowds or terrain. Pants could feature sensors that alert wearers when they are approaching obstacles. Additionally, a smartwatch or other wearable device could provide audio descriptions of the environment around the person.",
    "**Enhanced Hearing Aids**: Without the aid of glasses or contacts, hearing aids become an even more critical tool for those with poor vision. They can be equipped with advanced noise cancellation technology, sound localization features, and possibly even real-time translation capabilities, helping individuals understand speech in noisy environments. ",
    "**Tactile Mapping Systems**: This concept involves creating maps that rely on touch rather than sight. Imagine a Braille-like system that could be used to map out cities, rooms, or even specific objects. People could feel their way through a space, using tactile cues to identify landmarks, stairs, door handles, etc. ",
    "**Smart Cane Innovations**: The traditional white cane could evolve into a smart cane with built-in sensors and AI. It could detect obstacles ahead, guide the user safely across uneven surfaces, and even interact with voice commands to provide directions or read signs aloud.",
    "**Digital Embodiment and Virtual Reality**: With the rise of virtual reality (VR) technology, people with poor vision could experience the world in a new way. By creating avatars that represent them in VR environments, these individuals could \"see\" through their avatar's eyes, potentially providing a clearer visual perspective. They could also use VR to practice daily tasks like reading, navigating public transport, or even shopping, improving their real-world skills."
