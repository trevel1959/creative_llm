    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrushes**: Create toothbrushes that are made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo or cornstarch. The bristles can be made from sustainable sources like recycled plastics or plant-based materials. This not only reduces waste but also appeals to environmentally conscious consumers. ",
    "**Smart Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that integrates technology to enhance dental hygiene. It could include features like Bluetooth connectivity to sync with a smartphone app, providing real-time feedback on brushing technique, duration, and areas missed. The app might also offer personalized brushing routines based on individual oral health needs.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush that combines teeth whitening technology into its design. The bristles might contain micro-diamonds or other abrasives that gently polish teeth while brushing. Alternatively, the toothbrush could have a built-in LED light system that activates a gel for at-home teeth whitening treatments.",
    "**Oral Health Monitoring Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush that includes sensors to monitor various aspects of oral health. For example, it could detect plaque buildup, measure saliva pH levels to indicate acid erosion risk, or even track gum health by analyzing the pressure applied during brushing. Data collected could be sent to a connected device for analysis and advice.",
    "**Portable Dental Care Kit**: Introduce a compact toothbrush that doubles as a complete portable dental care solution. This toothbrush could include built-in flossing and tongue cleaning mechanisms, along with a small reservoir for mouthwash or toothpaste. Its ergonomic design would make it easy to use and carry around, encouraging consistent oral hygiene practices on-the-go."
