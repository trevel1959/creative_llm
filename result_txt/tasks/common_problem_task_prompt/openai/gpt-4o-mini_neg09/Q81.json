    "**Film Selection and Licensing**: Curating a diverse and engaging lineup of films can be challenging. There may be issues related to obtaining the necessary rights and licenses to screen certain films, especially if they are from independent filmmakers or international sources. Failure to secure these licenses can lead to legal complications and the potential need to change the lineup at the last minute.",
    "**Budget Constraints**: Organizing a film festival often involves a significant financial investment. Budgeting for venue rental, marketing, film licensing, equipment rental, and staffing can be tricky. If the festival does not attract enough attendees or sponsorships, it could lead to financial losses. Additionally, unexpected expenses may arise, such as technical failures or higher-than-anticipated catering costs.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the festival to attract attendees is crucial. This includes developing a marketing strategy that reaches the target audience through social media, traditional advertising, and community engagement. A lack of a strong promotional plan could result in low attendance, which may not only impact ticket sales but also the festival's reputation for future events.",
    "**Volunteer and Staff Coordination**: Organizing a film festival typically requires a team of volunteers and staff members to manage various aspects, such as ticket sales, ushering, and technical support. Issues may arise in recruiting, training, and coordinating these individuals, especially if there is a lack of clear communication or if volunteers do not show up on the day of the event.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Creating an engaging experience for attendees is essential for the success of the festival. Problems may arise if there is a lack of activities or discussions that encourage audience interaction, such as Q&A sessions with filmmakers or panel discussions. Additionally, logistical issues like long lines, poor seating arrangements, or inadequate facilities can negatively impact the audience's experience."
