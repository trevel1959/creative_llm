    "Garden Bags: One creative solution to plant a garden when the ground is too hard to dig into is to use garden bags. These bags are specifically designed for growing plants in areas where the soil is poor or non-existent. They are made of a breathable, waterproof material that allows for proper drainage and aeration of the soil. Simply fill the bags with a mixture of soil, compost, and other nutrients, and plant your seeds or seedlings. As the plants grow, the bags can be hung from trees or other structures, or placed on a fence or trellis.",
    "Living Roofs: Another creative solution is to create a living roof. This involves installing a layer of soil and plants on top of a building or structure. The soil and plants provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create a habitat for wildlife. Living roofs can be designed in a variety of ways, including green roofs, where plants are grown in a layer of soil, and sedum roofs, where succulent plants are used to create a thick, stable layer of vegetation.",
    "Vertical Gardens: For small spaces or areas with limited access to sunlight, a vertical garden can be a great solution. A vertical garden is a wall-mounted garden that uses a trellis or other support system to grow plants upwards. This allows for maximum space usage and can be a beautiful addition to any room. You can use a variety of plants in a vertical garden, including herbs, leafy greens, and flowering plants.",
    "Hydroponics: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water rather than soil. This can be a great option when the ground is too hard to dig into, as it eliminates the need for soil altogether. Hydroponics can be done indoors or outdoors, and can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system, providing the plants with everything they need to grow.",
