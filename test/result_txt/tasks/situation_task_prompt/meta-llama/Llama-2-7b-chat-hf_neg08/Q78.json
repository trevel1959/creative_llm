    "Create a virtual toy library: In a world without physical toys, children could access a virtual library of toys through a special app or website. This virtual library could include 3D models of toys, games, and puzzles that children could interact with and play using their devices.",
    "Host toy-free playdates: Instead of meeting up to play with physical toys, children could meet up to engage in creative activities like drawing, storytelling, or role-playing. Parents could organize playdates where children can use their imaginations to create their own games and adventures.",
    "Create a toy-making workshop: Children could learn how to make their own toys using recycled materials like cardboard, fabric, and other eco-friendly materials. This workshop could teach children the value of creativity, resourcefulness, and sustainability.",
    "Host a toy swap: Organize a toy swap where children can bring in their old toys and exchange them for new ones. This could help reduce waste and encourage children to think creatively about how they can reuse and repurpose old toys.",
