    "**Film Selection and Curation**: Selecting the right films can be a daunting task. There may be a lack of submissions that meet the festival's theme or criteria, or a surplus of films that complicates the selection process. Additionally, there may be conflicts over which films to prioritize, leading to potential disagreements among the organizing team or curators. Ensuring a diverse and inclusive lineup that represents various genres and perspectives is also crucial, and failing to do so could lead to criticism.",
    "**Budget Constraints**: Managing the festival's budget is essential, and overspending in one area can lead to financial strain elsewhere. Potential issues include underestimating costs for marketing, venue rental, or hospitality for filmmakers and guests. Fundraising efforts may not yield the expected results, and sponsorship deals can fall through, leading to a shortfall in funding.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the festival to attract attendees can be challenging. Issues may arise in reaching the target audience through the right channels, whether that be social media, traditional advertising, or partnerships with local businesses. Additionally, if marketing materials are not engaging or clear, it may result in low ticket sales and attendance, undermining the festival's success.",
    "**Technical Difficulties**: Film festivals rely heavily on technology, and any technical hiccups can disrupt screenings. Problems such as equipment malfunctions, software issues, or connectivity problems can arise, leading to delays or even cancellations of screenings. Ensuring that there is a technical team on hand to troubleshoot these issues is crucial, but can also add to logistical challenges.",
    "**Guest Management**: Inviting filmmakers, industry professionals, and special guests is an important aspect of a film festival, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Potential problems include scheduling conflicts, travel arrangements, and accommodation issues. If guests are not properly managed or informed, it can lead to dissatisfaction and a negative experience for both guests and attendees."
