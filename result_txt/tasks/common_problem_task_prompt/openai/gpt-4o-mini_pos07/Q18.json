    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is not possible without electricity, leading to food spoilage and waste. To address this, families could be encouraged to use root cellars or invest in solar-powered refrigerators. Community gardens could also be developed to promote local food production, ensuring fresh produce is available without the need for long-term storage.",
    "**Health Risks**: The absence of electricity can hinder access to medical care, particularly for those who rely on electronic devices for monitoring health conditions. To counter this, mobile health clinics powered by renewable energy sources could be deployed, providing essential medical services and support to those in need, regardless of their location.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many modern water supply systems rely on electricity for pumping and purification. Without it, access to clean water becomes a significant concern. Communities could implement rainwater harvesting systems and develop manual filtration methods, ensuring that residents have a sustainable source of clean water.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: The lack of streetlights and security systems can increase the risk of accidents and crime. To improve safety, neighborhoods could organize community watch programs and install solar-powered streetlights. Additionally, training sessions on personal safety and emergency preparedness could empower residents to protect themselves and their property.",
    "**Limited Communication**: Without electricity, traditional communication methods like phones and the internet become unavailable. To enhance communication, communities could establish a network of community bulletin boards and organize regular town meetings. Additionally, investing in ham radios or other low-tech communication tools could help maintain connections in emergencies."
