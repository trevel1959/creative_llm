He became so skillful that a school of dance came to him for inspiration. Chameleon taught the children that it's not the way one moves but the will to dance that's most important.",
    "The Cheetah's Courageous Act: Cheetah, the cheetah, was told she couldn't run due to her missing knee. Undeterred, she used her sharp teeth and speed to hunt. Her friends marveled at her determination, unaware of her disability until one unfortunate chase left Cheetah missing an eye. She continued to hunt with her senses and gained a reputation for her unrelenting fearlessness.",
