    "**Customizable Brushing Modes**:    - Develop a toothbrush that allows users to customize brushing modes based on their specific dental needs. For example, a user could set modes for sensitive gums, plaque removal, or whitening. This could be achieved through an app where users input their dental conditions, and the toothbrush adjusts its vibration speed and pressure accordingly.",
    "**Integrated Mouthwash Dispenser**:    - Design an electric toothbrush with a built-in compartment for mouthwash that releases a small amount during the brushing process. This feature would combine brushing and rinsing in one step, making it more convenient for users and ensuring they don't skip mouthwash as part of their oral hygiene routine.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Brushing Guide**:    - Create an electric toothbrush that pairs with an AR app. Using a smartphone or AR glasses, users can receive real-time feedback on their brushing technique. The app could overlay visual guides on the screen, showing users which areas to focus on and how to improve their brushing habits, making it both educational and engaging.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**:    - Shift towards sustainability by designing the electric toothbrush using biodegradable materials and offering a modular design where users can replace only the electronic components rather than the entire unit. This approach would reduce waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, promoting a greener dental care routine.",
    "**Gamification of Oral Hygiene**:    - Introduce a gamified experience where users earn points for consistent brushing habits, completing challenges, or maintaining streaks of good oral hygiene. The toothbrush could sync with an app that tracks progress and rewards users with discounts on dental products or entries into contests, making brushing more fun and motivating."
