    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: Imagine being a law enforcement officer who can see through walls to gather evidence or spot illegal activities. For instance, if someone is suspected of dealing drugs from their home, they might have hidden compartments that aren't visible on the outside. By using this power, you could uncover these secret areas without needing a warrant or risking your own safety.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: Architects and urban planners could utilize this ability to visualize how buildings and structures interact with the surrounding environment in ways not visible to the naked eye. This could aid in creating more efficient designs, ensuring better lighting, air flow, and even the potential for underground space usage for parking, utilities, or additional living quarters.",
    "**Historical Research**: Historians and archaeologists could benefit greatly by being able to \"see\" into the past. They could explore ancient buildings, buried artifacts, or even understand the layout of structures beneath the ground that are currently obscured. This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries and a deeper understanding of history.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: In the medical field, this ability could revolutionize diagnostics and surgery. Surgeons could visualize blood vessels, organs, and tissues that are currently only visible via invasive procedures or X-rays. This could lead to less invasive surgeries, quicker recovery times, and potentially save lives by allowing for earlier detection and treatment of diseases.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring and Conservation**: Environmental scientists and conservationists could use this power to monitor wildlife habitats and ecosystems. They could track animal movements, understand the impact of human activities on natural environments, and detect pollution sources beneath the surface. This information could be invaluable in creating effective conservation strategies and policies. "
