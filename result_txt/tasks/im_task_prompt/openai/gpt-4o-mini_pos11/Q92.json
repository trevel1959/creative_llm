    "**Electric Wine Opener with Automatic Cork Ejection**:    Innovate an electric wine opener that not only removes the cork but also automatically ejects it into a separate compartment. This feature would eliminate the mess of dealing with corks and ensure that users don't accidentally drop them on the floor. The opener could have a rechargeable battery and a sleek design, making it a stylish addition to any kitchen or bar.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Temperature Sensor**:    Introduce a wine opener that includes a built-in temperature sensor to check the wine's ideal serving temperature. Users can insert the opener into the bottle, and a digital display will indicate whether the wine is too warm or too cold. This feature would educate users on proper wine serving practices and enhance their overall tasting experience.",
    "**Sustainable Wine Opener Made from Recycled Materials**:    Create a wine opener made entirely from recycled materials, such as repurposed metals and plastics. The design could incorporate a sleek, modern aesthetic while promoting sustainability. Additionally, each opener could come with a small booklet that educates users on sustainable wine practices, including eco-friendly storage and disposal of wine bottles."
