    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Threat Detection and Response (TDR) System**: Develop an AI-driven TDR system that can detect and respond to threats in real-time. This system would utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns, identify anomalies, and predict potential threats. The AI system would also be able to adapt to new threats as they emerge, ensuring the company's network remains secure.",
    "**Zero-Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA)**: Implement a ZTNA, which assumes that all users and devices are untrusted by default. This architecture would use micro-segmentation, identity-based access control, and continuous monitoring to ensure that only authorized users and devices have access to sensitive data and resources. This approach would provide an additional layer of security and reduce the attack surface.",
    "**Advanced Endpoint Security (AES)**: Develop an AES solution that combines traditional antivirus software with AI-powered threat detection and response capabilities. This solution would utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze endpoint behavior, detect potential threats, and respond accordingly. The AES solution would also include features such as endpoint isolation, device control, and application control to prevent lateral movement and data exfiltration.",
    "**Cloud Security Gateway (CSG)**: Design a CSG that provides a secure and scalable gateway for cloud-based applications and services. This solution would utilize advanced threat detection and prevention capabilities, such as sandboxing and machine learning-based threat detection, to protect against cloud-based threats. The CSG would also provide features such as data loss prevention, compliance monitoring, and identity and access management to ensure secure access to cloud resources.",
    "**Secure Data Governance (SDG)**: Develop an SDG solution that provides a comprehensive framework for managing sensitive data throughout its lifecycle. This solution would utilize advanced data discovery, classification, and encryption capabilities to identify, classify, and protect sensitive data. The SDG solution would also provide features such as data access controls, data retention policies, and data archiving to ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and in compliance with regulatory requirements."
