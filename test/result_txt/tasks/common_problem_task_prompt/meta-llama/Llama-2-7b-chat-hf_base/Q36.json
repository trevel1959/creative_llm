    "Solar panel rental program: Create a program where individuals can rent solar panels for their homes at an affordable monthly rate. This would make it easier for homeowners to switch to renewable energy without having to purchase the panels upfront. The rental program could be offered in partnership with local energy providers, who would be responsible for installing, maintaining, and replacing the panels as needed.",
    "Solar panel sharing platform: Develop a peer-to-peer sharing platform that connects homeowners with excess solar panel capacity to those who need it. Homeowners could earn a passive income by sharing their panels, while those in need could access affordable clean energy. The platform could be managed through a mobile app or website, with features such as panel availability, pricing, and scheduling.",
    "Solar panel-equipped public transportation: Design and install solar panels on public transportation vehicles such as buses and trains. This would not only provide clean energy for the vehicles but also serve as a mobile advertising platform for renewable energy initiatives. The panels could be mounted on the roofs of the vehicles, with the energy generated being used to power the vehicles' electrical systems and any excess being fed back into the grid.",
    "Solar panel-covered bike lanes: Incorporate solar panels into bike lanes, either by installing them on the road surface or on the sides of bike lanes. This would provide a unique and sustainable way to generate clean energy while also providing a safe and convenient cycling infrastructure. The panels could be designed to be flexible and durable, allowing them to withstand the wear and tear of heavy traffic and harsh weather conditions.",
    "Solar panel-powered community centers: Build community centers in areas with limited access to clean energy sources. These centers could be powered entirely by solar panels, providing a reliable source of energy for community members. The centers could also serve as hubs for renewable energy education and training, helping to promote sustainable practices in the community. The centers could be designed to be energy-efficient, with features such as passive heating and cooling systems, and could also include community gardens and green spaces to promote sustainable living."
