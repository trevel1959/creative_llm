    "**Memory Overload**: With the ability to recall every detail from every text, humans would struggle to process and prioritize information. This could lead to information paralysis, where individuals become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of memories and struggle to make decisions. The constant influx of information would make it difficult to focus on the present moment, leading to anxiety, stress, and decreased productivity.",
    "**Loss of Context**: Remembering every detail from every text would make it challenging to understand the context and nuances of each piece of information. Without the ability to forget and move on, humans would be stuck in a never-ending cycle of recalling irrelevant details, making it difficult to apply knowledge in practical situations.",
    "**Social Isolation**: The inability to forget would make it challenging for humans to form meaningful relationships. Every conversation, every joke, and every inside joke would be remembered, leading to a lack of intimacy and connection. People would struggle to move forward and create new experiences, as the weight of past memories would hold them back.",
    "**Memory Fragmentation**: With the ability to recall every detail, humans would experience memory fragmentation. Memories would become disjointed and disconnected, making it difficult to piece together a coherent narrative. This would lead to confusion, disorientation, and a sense of disconnection from one's own experiences.",
    "**The End of Creativity**: Remembering every detail would stifle creativity. Humans would be bound by the limitations of their memories, unable to imagine new possibilities or explore new ideas. The constant recall of existing knowledge would prevent innovation and progress, as individuals would be unable to think outside the box or challenge conventional wisdom. </s> "
