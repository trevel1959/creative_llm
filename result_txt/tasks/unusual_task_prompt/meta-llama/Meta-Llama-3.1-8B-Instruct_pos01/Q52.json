    "**Space Station Orbital Gardening**: Design a space station with a self-sustaining, rotating section dedicated to hydroponic and aeroponic gardening. The rotating section would simulate a stable gravitational environment, allowing plants to grow in mid-air, while the rest of the space station focuses on solar energy harvesting, water recycling, and life support systems. This would not only provide a reliable source of fresh produce for the astronauts but also serve as a research hub for plant growth in microgravity environments.",
    "**Smart Highway for Autonomous Vehicles**: Develop a network of intelligent highways that integrate advanced sensors, communication systems, and AI-powered traffic management. The highway would be designed to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and travel times, while also providing real-time information to drivers and autonomous vehicles. The highway would be equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles, reducing range anxiety and promoting the adoption of sustainable transportation.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for PTSD**: Create a VR therapy platform that utilizes immersive, interactive experiences to help individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) overcome their symptoms. The platform would be designed in collaboration with mental health professionals and would incorporate personalized, evidence-based treatments, such as exposure therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The VR environment would simulate safe, controlled scenarios, allowing patients to confront and process their traumatic experiences in a controlled manner.",
    "**Ocean Cleanup System**: Design a large-scale, autonomous system to collect and remove plastic waste from the world's oceans. The system would be composed of a network of floating barriers that would corral plastic debris, which would then be collected and processed for recycling. The system would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and would be equipped with advanced sensors to detect and track plastic pollution.",
    "**Personalized Cancer Treatment Platform**: Develop an AI-powered platform that integrates genetic analysis, medical imaging, and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized cancer treatment recommendations. The platform would analyze a patient's genetic profile, tumor characteristics, and medical history to identify the most effective treatment options, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The platform would also provide real-time monitoring and adjust treatment plans as needed, ensuring the most effective and efficient treatment outcomes."
