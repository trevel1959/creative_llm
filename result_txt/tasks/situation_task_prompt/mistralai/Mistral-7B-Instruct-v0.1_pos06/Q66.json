    "Materialize: If all natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, I would build a house using materialized objects. Materialized objects are physical objects that exist in the digital world and can be brought into the physical world using a 3D printer. This technology has the potential to revolutionize construction, allowing for the creation of buildings using a wide variety of materials, including plastics, metals, and even food.",
    "Bioplastics: I would build a house using bioplastics, which are of plastic derived from renewable sources like corn, sugarcane, and potato starch. Bioplastics are biodegradable, meaning they break down naturally in the environment, making them a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastics.",
    "Recycled materials: I would build a house using recycled materials. This could include recycled, recycled metal, and recycled glass. Recycling materials reduces waste and conserves natural resources, making it a more sustainable option.",
    "Geothermal energy: I would build a house that utilizes geothermal energy, which is energy derived from the heat stored in the Earth's crust. Geothermal energy is renewable, meaning it can be harnessed indefinitely, and it has a low carbon footprint, making it a more sustainable option.",
    "Solar power: I would build a house that utilizes solar power, which is energy derived from the sun. Solar power is renewable, meaning it can be harnessed indefinitely, and it has a low carbon footprint, making it a more sustainable option. Solar panels can be installed on the roof of the house to capture the sun's energy and convert it into electricity."
