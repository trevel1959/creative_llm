    "Less contamination of natural resources: Plastic pollution can cause significant harm to natural resources like rivers, lakes, and oceans. When plastics break down slowly, they become tiny microplastics that can be harmful to aquatic life and, ultimately, humans. If they biodegraded quickly like paper, the risk of contamination would be significantly reduced.",
    "Less demand for other materials: Since plastic is non-biodegradable, it's been necessary to replace it with other materials that are more eco-friendly. This transition will be eased with plastic that can quickly biodegrade to replace these materials.",
    "Reusable product market: If plastic biodegrades quickly, we can encourage the use of reusable products. This will lead to less waste and could encourage consumers to purchase and recycle more products made from biodegradable materials.",
    "Shorter production cycles: Plastic production requires an excessive amount of resources and energy. By using plastic that can biodegrade quickly, companies may opt for quicker production cycles and less resource consumption, which would be beneficial to the environment.",
    "Reduction of landfill spaces: Landfills are the only places where plastic is disposed of, and as such, they have become a significant problem in many countries. If plastic could quickly biodegrade, it would require much less space in landfills, leading to less waste management issues."
