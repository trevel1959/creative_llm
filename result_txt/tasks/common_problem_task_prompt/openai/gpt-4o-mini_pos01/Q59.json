    "**Participant Disorientation**: Virtual reality can be disorienting for some users, especially those who are not accustomed to the technology. This could lead to issues such as motion sickness or difficulty navigating the virtual environment. To address this, organizers could provide pre-tournament tutorials and practice sessions, allowing participants to familiarize themselves with the VR setup. Including a short break between rounds could also help alleviate any discomfort.",
    "**Time Zone Conflicts**: In a global tournament, participants may come from various time zones, leading to scheduling conflicts. This could result in some players being unable to compete at their scheduled times. To resolve this, organizers should consider creating a flexible tournament schedule that accommodates different time zones or using a round-robin format that allows players to compete at various times throughout the tournament.",
    "**Cheating and Fair Play**: Ensuring fair play can be challenging in an online gaming environment, where players might attempt to cheat or exploit glitches. Organizers should implement strict rules and monitoring systems, including the use of anti-cheat software and live moderation during matches. Additionally, establishing clear penalties for cheating can help maintain a level playing field.",
    "**Limited Audience Engagement**: Unlike in-person tournaments, virtual reality tournaments may struggle to engage a live audience. To enhance viewer experience, organizers could integrate live streaming with interactive features, such as allowing viewers to vote on certain in-game elements or participate in live chats with players. Creating a dynamic and entertaining broadcast can help maintain audience interest and participation.",
    "**Inadequate Prize Distribution**: The prize distribution process can become complicated, especially if players are from different countries with varying regulations regarding winnings. To avoid potential issues, organizers should clearly outline the prize structure and ensure that all participants are aware of how and when prizes will be distributed. Setting up a transparent system for handling payments or rewards can help build trust among participants."
