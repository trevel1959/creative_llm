    "**Cooking Tool for Grilled Sandwiches**: Turn your clothes iron into a makeshift panini press. Wrap your sandwich in aluminum foil and press it with the hot iron for a few minutes. This method gives you a crispy, grilled sandwich without needing a dedicated appliance, making it perfect for a quick lunch at work or school.",
    "**Removing Sticky Residue**: If you have stickers or labels that leave behind a sticky residue, use the clothes iron to help remove them. Place a piece of parchment paper over the sticky area and apply the hot iron for a few seconds. The heat will soften the adhesive, making it easier to scrape off with a plastic scraper or cloth.",
    "**DIY Candle Maker**: Use the clothes iron to create custom candles. Melt wax in a heat-safe container, then use the iron to heat up molds (like silicone cupcake trays). Pour the melted wax into the molds, using the iron to help smooth out the tops or create designs as it cools. This can be a fun craft project for kids or a unique gift idea.",
    "**Sealing Envelopes and Bags**: Instead of using tape or glue, a clothes iron can seal paper envelopes or plastic bags. Fold the edge of the envelope or bag over, place a piece of parchment paper over it, and press with the iron. The heat will melt the adhesive in the paper or plastic, creating a strong seal.",
    "**Creating Heat Transfers for T-Shirts**: Use a clothes iron to apply heat transfer vinyl (HTV) designs onto T-shirts or other fabric items. Cut your design out of HTV, place it on the fabric, cover it with a pressing cloth, and apply the iron for a few seconds. This method allows for personalizing clothing with custom designs without needing a heat press."
