    "**Environmental Degradation**: Increased visitor numbers can lead to soil erosion, littering, and damage to flora and fauna. Trails can become overused, resulting in widening paths and habitat destruction. To combat this, park managers could introduce a permit system to limit the number of visitors during peak times, create designated trails, and engage in restoration projects to rehabilitate damaged areas.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can outcompete native species, while non-native animals can alter food chains. Park management could establish monitoring programs to identify and control invasive species through physical removal, public awareness campaigns, and collaborations with local conservation organizations.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, which can impact maintenance, staffing, and educational programs. This may lead to reduced visitor services and increased safety hazards. To address funding issues, park management could explore partnerships with local businesses, apply for grants, and develop volunteer programs to support park maintenance and visitor education.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting ecosystems, wildlife migration patterns, and visitor experiences. For instance, rising temperatures can lead to altered plant blooming times and increased wildfire risks. Park management could develop adaptive management strategies that include monitoring climate data, implementing fire management plans, and creating habitats that are resilient to climate change impacts.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Emergency Response**: With increased visitation, the likelihood of accidents or emergencies rises. Issues may include medical emergencies, lost hikers, or wildfires. Park management should develop comprehensive emergency response plans, conduct regular safety drills, and ensure adequate staffing during peak seasons. Additionally, they could invest in technology, such as GPS tracking for hikers and mobile apps for safety tips."
