    "Ergonomic design: Create scissors with ergonomic handles that fit comfortably in the user's hand, reducing fatigue and discomfort during extended use. This could involve contoured grips, angled handles, or other design elements that promote comfort.",
    "Automatic sharpener: Develop scissors with an integrated sharpener that keeps blades sharp and ready to use at all times. This could be a small rotating blade or a spring-loaded mechanism that sharpen the blades with each cut.",
    "Magnetic tip: Add a magnet to the tip of the scissors, allowing users to easily store small items like paper clips, rubber bands, or even small screws. This would be especially useful for people who work with a lot of small parts and need a convenient way to keep them organized.",
    "Tactile feedback: Create scissors with different textures or patterns on the handles to provide tactile feedback to users as they cut. For example, the handles could have a rougher texture for more control or a smoother texture for more precision.",
    "Integrated ruler: Design scissors with an integrated ruler or measuring scale on the handle, allowing users to quickly and easily measure the length of their cuts. This would be especially useful for people who need to make precise cuts in various materials."
