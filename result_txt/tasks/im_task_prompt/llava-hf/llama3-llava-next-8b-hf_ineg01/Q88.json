    "**Lightweight Construction**: Utilize lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber or aluminum, to reduce the overall weight of the ski poles. This would make them easier to carry and maneuver, especially for those with mobility or strength limitations.",
    "**Adjustable Length**: Implement an adjustable length feature to allow users to customize the length of their ski poles based on their height and skiing style. This could be achieved through telescopic sections or an extendable shaft.",
    "**Integrated Navigation Tools**: Incorporate a small compass or GPS device into the handle of the ski pole to help skiers navigate through unfamiliar terrain. This feature would be particularly useful for backcountry skiing or ski touring.",
    "**Impact Protection**: Develop a shock-absorbing mechanism within the ski pole shaft to reduce the impact felt by the skier when they hit unexpected obstacles on the slope. This could be achieved through the use of a spring or cushioned section within the shaft.",
    "**Power Boost**: Design ski poles with a built-in battery-powered motor that provides a power boost to assist skiers with propulsion on flat terrain or uphill sections. This feature could be particularly useful for those with physical limitations or for use in areas with limited natural terrain."
