    "Greywater recycling: Greywater recycling is a process of reusing water that has been used in households and businesses. This water can be collected and treated to remove contaminants, and then used to water plants. This would be a cost-effective and eco-friendly way to water plants without relying on rainfall.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting involves collecting rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces and storing it in tanks or other containers. This water can then be used to water plants. This would be a sustainable and cost-effective solution, as it would allow for the efficient use of rainwater that would otherwise be lost.",
    "Drip irrigation system: A drip irrigation system would be installed in the garden. This would deliver water directly to the roots of the plants, reducing water waste and ensuring that the plants receive the water they need. This would be an efficient and eco-friendly solution, as it would use water more effectively than traditional sprinkler systems.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a system that combines fish farming and hydroponics. Fish waste is used to fertilize the plants, and the water is used to water the plants. This would be a sustainable and efficient solution, as it would allow for the efficient use of water and would also provide a source of protein through the fish.",
    "Artificial rain: Artificial rain could be created using cloud seeding technology. This would involve releasing chemicals into the atmosphere that would stimulate the formation of clouds and cause them to release rain. This would be a temporary solution, but it could provide water for plants until a more sustainable solution can be implemented."
