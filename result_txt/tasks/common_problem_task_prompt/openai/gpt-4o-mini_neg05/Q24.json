    "**Language Barriers**: A significant challenge can arise from language differences, making it difficult for the student to communicate effectively with the host family and vice versa. This could lead to feelings of isolation for the student. To address this, the host family could incorporate language-learning tools such as apps or flashcards, and set aside time for practice conversations to enhance communication and build confidence.",
    "**Homesickness**: The foreign exchange student may experience homesickness, feeling disconnected from their family and friends back home. This can affect their emotional well-being and adjustment to the new environment. To help alleviate this, the host family can create a supportive atmosphere, encourage the student to keep in touch with loved ones through video calls, and engage them in local activities to build new friendships and connections.",
    "**Different Dietary Preferences**: The student may have different dietary restrictions or preferences that the host family is not aware of, leading to discomfort or health issues. For instance, the student may be vegetarian, vegan, or have allergies that need to be accommodated. To navigate this, the host family should have an open conversation about dietary needs upon arrival and involve the student in meal planning and preparation to ensure everyone is comfortable and satisfied.",
    "**Integration into the Family Dynamic**: The presence of a foreign exchange student can disrupt the existing family dynamic, especially if there are already children in the household. This may lead to feelings of jealousy or competition for attention. To address this, the family can establish clear roles and responsibilities for everyone, including the exchange student, and create family bonding activities that promote inclusion and collaboration.",
    "**Academic Adjustment**: The foreign exchange student may struggle to adapt to a different educational system, including teaching styles, grading systems, and social interactions with peers. This could lead to academic stress or frustration. To help ease this transition, the host family can work closely with the student's school to ensure they have access to tutoring or support services, and encourage open communication about academic challenges."
