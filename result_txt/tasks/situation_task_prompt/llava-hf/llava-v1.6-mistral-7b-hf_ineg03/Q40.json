    "Human-powered devices: In a world where batteries are unavailable, devices that harness human energy could become popular. For example, devices like pedal-powered chargers, where users can generate electricity by pedaling, could be used to charge smartphones or other small electronic devices.",
    "Kinetic energy harvesting: Devices that harness the kinetic energy generated by human movement, such as shaking or swinging, could be used to charge devices. This would require users to move their devices vigorously to generate enough energy for charging.",
    "Hydroelectric power: If all batteries stopped working, hydroelectric power could be an alternative. Small hydroelectric power generators could be used to harness the power of flowing water to charge devices. This would require users to find a source of flowing water, such as a river or stream, and set up the generator near it.",
    "Wind-powered devices: Wind-powered chargers could be used to charge devices in the absence of batteries. These devices use wind to generate electricity, which can then be used to charge devices. This would require users to find a windy location and ensure their devices are placed in the wind for optimal charging.",
    "Magnetic induction charging: If all batteries stopped working, magnetic induction charging could be an alternative. This technology uses magnetic fields to transfer energy wirelessly between a charger and a device. Users would need to place their devices near a magnetic induction charger to charge them."
