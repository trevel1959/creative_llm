    "Smart Vacuum Cleaner: Create a vacuum cleaner that can detect and adapt to different types of flooring, such as hardwood, carpet, and tile. The vacuum could use sensors to detect the type of flooring and adjust its suction power and cleaning path accordingly. This would ensure a more thorough and efficient cleaning experience.",
    "Vacuum Cleaner with Built-in Air Purifier: Design a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a built-in air purifier, which would help remove allergens, dust, and other pollutants from the air while cleaning the floors. This would create a healthier indoor environment and reduce the need for separate air purifiers.",
    "Robotic Vacuum Cleaner with AI Navigation: Develop a robotic vacuum cleaner that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate and clean a room. The vacuum could use sensors and cameras to map the room and create a cleaning plan, ensuring that all areas are thoroughly cleaned. This would save time and effort, as the vacuum would be able to navigate and clean without the need for manual guidance.",
    "Solar-Powered Vacuum Cleaner: Create a vacuum cleaner that is powered by solar panels, making it eco-friendly and energy-efficient. This would eliminate the need for traditional electricity sources, reducing the carbon footprint of the vacuum cleaner. Additionally, the solar panels could be detachable, allowing users to take them with them when cleaning outdoor areas.",
    "Vacuum Cleaner with Water Filtration System: Design a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a built-in water filtration system, which would allow users to clean hardwood floors and other surfaces without leaving any residue or streaks. The water filtration system would filter out any impurities and allergens, creating a clean and healthy environment. This would eliminate the need for separate water filtration systems, making the vacuum cleaner more convenient and efficient."
