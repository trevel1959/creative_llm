    "Bio-Energy: A type of energy that is generated from the natural metabolic processes of living organisms, such as bacteria or plants. This energy could be harnessed by developing a way to capture and convert the energy produced by these organisms into usable electricity.",
    "Gravitational Energy: A type of energy that is generated from the movement of objects in space. This energy could be harnessed by using solar panels or other devices to capture the energy produced by the gravitational pull of celestial bodies.",
    "Nuclear Energy: A type of energy that is generated from the nucleus of atoms. This energy could be harnessed by using nuclear reactions to generate heat, which could then be used to produce electricity.",
    "Thermal Energy: A type of energy that is generated from the movement of heat from one object to another. This energy could be harnessed by using heat engines, such as steam turbines, to convert the heat into mechanical energy.",
    "Quantum Energy: A type of energy that is generated from the properties of subatomic particles, such as electrons and photons. This energy could be harnessed by using quantum devices, such as superconducting circuits, to capture and convert the energy into usable electricity."
