    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Utilize UV-C light technology integrated into the lid of the water bottle to automatically sterilize the interior and eliminate bacteria and odors. This feature would activate after a certain period of non-use, ensuring that the bottle remains clean and safe to use without requiring manual washing.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a detachable chamber that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or other flavorings. The chamber would have a built-in strainer to prevent pulp from entering the main bottle, and users could easily switch out different infusions based on their taste preferences, encouraging more frequent hydration.",
    "**Collapsible Design with Insulation**: Create a water bottle that can collapse down to a compact size for easy storage when not in use, but also features double-wall insulation to keep drinks hot or cold for extended periods. This would be ideal for travelers or hikers who need a lightweight, space-saving option without sacrificing temperature control.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Integrate a high-quality water filtration system within the bottle that allows users to fill it from any freshwater source. The filter would remove impurities and contaminants, making it perfect for outdoor adventures or emergency situations where clean water is not readily available.",
    "**Personalized Color and Design Options**: Offer a customizable water bottle where users can choose colors, patterns, and even add personal engravings or stickers. This could be facilitated through an online platform where users can visualize their designs before ordering, making the bottle a reflection of their personality and style."
