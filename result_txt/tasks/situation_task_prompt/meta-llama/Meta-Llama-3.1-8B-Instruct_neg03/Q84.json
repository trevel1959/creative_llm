    "**Gravity-Defying Wheelchair**: I'd invent a wheelchair that uses magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground, allowing me to move around effortlessly. The chair would be equipped with advanced sensors to detect obstacles and adjust its trajectory accordingly, ensuring a smooth ride. The wheelchair would also have a built-in navigation system, using AI to plot the most efficient route to my destination.",
    "**Personal Aerial Assistant (PAA)**: I'd develop a small, hovering drone that follows me wherever I go, providing a stable and comfortable way to move around. The PAA would be equipped with a retractable platform, allowing me to sit or lie down while it hovers above the ground. The drone would use advanced stabilization technology to maintain its position, ensuring a smooth ride even in windy conditions.",
    "**Smart Walker with AI**: I'd design a smart walker that uses AI to assist me in navigating around obstacles. The walker would be equipped with sensors that detect the environment and predict potential hazards, allowing it to adjust its trajectory accordingly. The walker would also have a built-in navigation system, using maps and GPS to guide me to my destination.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: I'd create an exoskeleton suit that provides support and stability, allowing me to move around with ease. The suit would be equipped with advanced sensors that detect my movements and adjust its support accordingly, ensuring a comfortable and natural gait. The suit would also have a built-in navigation system, using AI to plot the most efficient route to my destination.",
    "**Hybrid Robot**: I'd design a hybrid robot that combines the benefits of a wheelchair, walker, and exoskeleton suit. The robot would have a sleek and compact design, with a versatile platform that can be adjusted to suit different mobility needs. The robot would be equipped with advanced sensors and AI, allowing it to navigate around obstacles and adapt to changing environments. The robot would also have a built-in navigation system, using maps and GPS to guide me to my destination. [/INST] "
