    "**Infrastructure and Transportation Issues**: Large animals would take up more space, which could cause issues with infrastructure and transportation. Roads, bridges, and tunnels would need to be expanded to accommodate the larger animals, and there might be an increase in traffic accidents involving these animals.",
    "**Impact on Agriculture**: Larger animals could damage crops and vegetation more easily, leading to a decrease in agricultural productivity. Farmers would need to implement new strategies to protect their crops, such as installing fences or using deterrents.",
    "**Impact on Human Populations**: The presence of large animals could pose a threat to human populations, especially in urban areas. People would need to be cautious when walking or biking, and there could be an increase in the number of accidents involving humans and animals.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increased weight of larger animals could have a significant impact on the environment. The additional weight would put more pressure on the earth's crust, potentially causing more earthquakes and landslides. Additionally, larger animals would require more water to drink, which could lead to water shortages in certain areas.",
    "**Impact on Zoos and Wildlife Sanctuaries**: Zoos and wildlife sanctuaries would need to make significant changes to accommodate the larger animals. Enclosures would need to be expanded, and the animals would require more food and water. This could lead to increased costs for these institutions."
