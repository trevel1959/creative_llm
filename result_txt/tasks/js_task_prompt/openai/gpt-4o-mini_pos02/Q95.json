    "**Aquatic Dome Ecosystem**: A massive dome that encapsulates a multi-layered aquatic environment, featuring saltwater, freshwater, and brackish zones. Each layer would mimic natural aquatic habitats, complete with coral reefs, mangroves, and wetlands. This design would allow for a diverse range of marine life to thrive in one habitat. Interactive elements, like underwater viewing tunnels, would educate visitors about marine ecosystems and the importance of conservation. Additionally, the dome would utilize advanced filtration and recycling systems to maintain water quality and support sustainable fish farming.",
    "**Vertical Cliffside Habitat**: Inspired by the natural nesting sites of birds like cliff swallows and peregrine falcons, this habitat would be a vertical structure resembling a cliff face. It would feature various niches and ledges for different species to inhabit, from small mammals to birds of prey. The design would include climbing plants and artificial rock formations to create a natural feel. This habitat would be particularly beneficial for species that require elevation for nesting and hunting, and it would provide a unique educational experience for visitors, showcasing the adaptations of animals that live in such environments.",
    "**Desert Oasis Complex**: This habitat would replicate a desert ecosystem with an integrated oasis that supports a variety of flora and fauna. The oasis would include a freshwater pond, surrounded by native vegetation, providing a crucial water source for animals like camels, foxes, and various bird species. The habitat would feature shaded areas with palm trees and shrubs, creating microclimates that allow for biodiversity. Solar panels could power the habitat, showcasing sustainable energy practices while providing a natural learning environment about desert ecosystems and their resilience.",
    "**Interactive Urban Jungle**: A habitat designed to integrate wildlife into an urban setting, featuring a blend of natural vegetation and urban architecture. Vertical gardens and green roofs would provide habitats for birds, insects, and small mammals. Interactive installations, such as observation decks and educational kiosks, would allow visitors to learn about urban wildlife and the importance of biodiversity in city environments. The design would encourage community involvement, with local schools and organizations participating in habitat maintenance and species monitoring, fostering a connection between people and nature.",
    "**Fungal Forest Habitat**: A unique ecosystem focused on the role of fungi in biodiversity. This habitat would feature a forest floor rich in various fungal species, with trees that have symbiotic relationships with these fungi. Visitors would learn about the critical role fungi play in nutrient cycling and ecosystem health. The design would include immersive trails that allow people to walk through mushroom gardens and observe mycelium networks. Workshops on sustainable foraging and the ecological importance of fungi would engage the community and promote conservation efforts."
