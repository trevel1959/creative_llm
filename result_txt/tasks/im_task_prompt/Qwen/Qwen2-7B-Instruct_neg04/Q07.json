    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates LED lights to emit blue light, which is scientifically proven to activate hydrogen peroxide in the toothpaste, leading to enhanced teeth whitening results. The toothbrush would have an adjustable timer to ensure proper brushing time and might include a feature that vibrates at different intensities for different areas of the mouth.",
    "**Gentle Exfoliating Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush with soft silicone bristles that can help remove plaque and gently exfoliate the gums, reducing the need for additional oral care tools like dental picks or interdental brushes. This design would be particularly beneficial for those with sensitive teeth or gums.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Oral Health Tracking**: Develop a toothbrush equipped with sensors and Bluetooth technology that connects to a smartphone app. The app could provide real-time feedback on brushing technique, track brushing frequency, and alert users when they are brushing too hard or not long enough. It could also suggest personalized brushing routines based on individual oral health needs.",
    "**Heated Toothbrush for Cold Weather**: For individuals living in colder climates, a heated toothbrush handle could be a game-changer. The toothbrush would have a built-in heating element that warms the handle to a comfortable temperature, making it easier to brush teeth during winter months. This feature could also be useful for those with arthritis or other conditions that make handling cold objects uncomfortable.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bamboo Toothbrush**: Introduce a toothbrush made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, which is both durable and biodegradable. This toothbrush would come with replaceable heads to reduce waste and might include a compostable packaging option.
