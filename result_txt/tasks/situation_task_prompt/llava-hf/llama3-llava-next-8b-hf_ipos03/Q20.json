    "\"Submarine Airways\": Develop a network of high-speed, underwater airships that travel between continents, eliminating the need for planes. These airships would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources and advanced propulsion systems.",
    "\"Maglev Monorails\": Build a high-speed, magnetic levitation monorail system that connects continents, providing a faster and more efficient mode of transportation. The monorail would be elevated and supported by magnetic levitation technology, allowing it to travel at high speeds without the need for planes.",
    "\"Space Elevator\": Construct a space elevator that extends from the Earth's surface into space, allowing for continuous travel to other continents without the need for planes. The elevator would be powered by a combination of solar energy and advanced propulsion systems.",
    "\"Underwater Highway\": Develop a network of underwater highways that connect continents, providing a more sustainable and efficient mode of transportation. The highways would be supported by floating rings and would be powered by renewable energy sources.",
    "\"Quantum Teleportation\": Utilize quantum teleportation technology to instantly transport people between continents. This technology would be based on the principles of quantum mechanics and would eliminate the need for planes."
