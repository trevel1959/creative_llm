    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Accessories**: Design a leash that includes multiple functionalities, such as a collapsible water bowl, a storage compartment for treats, and a flashlight for evening walks. This would provide convenience for dog owners, ensuring they have everything they need in one compact design without carrying additional items.",
    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Create a leash with an adjustable length mechanism that allows pet owners to change the leash length with a simple pull or press of a button. This would provide flexibility, enabling the owner to shorten the leash for busy streets and extend it for open areas, accommodating different walking environments.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Integrate reflective materials and LED lights into the leash to enhance visibility during nighttime walks. This would increase safety for both the dog and the owner, ensuring they are easily seen by passing vehicles and other pedestrians.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a leash made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that are both durable and environmentally friendly. This would appeal to eco-conscious pet owners and contribute to reducing plastic waste, while still providing a strong and reliable leash for their dogs.",
    "**Comfort Grip with Ergonomic Design**: Design a leash with an ergonomic handle that provides comfort during long walks. The handle could feature a soft, cushioned grip that reduces strain on the hands and wrists, especially for larger dogs that tend to pull. Additional features could include a non-slip surface for better control."
