    "Use alternative transportation methods: If bridges were to collapse, people could use alternative transportation methods, such as ferries or barges, to cross the river. These vessels could be deployed to transport large numbers of people and vehicles across the river.",
    "Build a temporary bridge: With the help of engineers and construction equipment, a temporary bridge could be built to span the width of the river. This temporary bridge could be constructed using materials such as steel, concrete, and timber, and it could be built quickly to allow for the safe passage of people and vehicles across the river.",
    "Utilize underwater tunnels: If bridges were to collapse, underwater tunnels could be used as an alternative means of transportation. These tunnels could be constructed using advanced tunnel boring machines, and they could be designed to withstand the weight of vehicles and buildings.",
    "Use ropes and pulleys: In the event of a bridge collapse, individuals could use ropes and pulleys to cross the river. By tying ropes to trees or other sturdy structures on the riverbank, people could use pulleys to pull themselves across the river.",
    "Use hot air balloons: If bridges were to collapse, people could use hot air balloons to cross the river. By heating the air inside the balloon, people could lift off the ground and float across the river."
