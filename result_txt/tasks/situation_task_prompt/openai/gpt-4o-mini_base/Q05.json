    "**Bioluminescent Pathways**: Create pathways lined with bioluminescent plants or materials that glow in the dark. By genetically modifying certain plants or using bioluminescent algae, these pathways would emit a soft, natural glow during the day and night. This would not only provide illumination but also create a stunning visual effect, encouraging outdoor activity and exploration even without sunlight.",
    "**Reflective Urban Structures**: Develop buildings and urban structures with highly reflective surfaces that can bounce and amplify artificial light. These structures would be strategically placed to maximize light distribution across the city. By using advanced materials that reflect light, cities could create bright zones that feel lively and safe, even in the absence of the sun.",
    "**Light-Emitting Drones**: Deploy fleets of drones equipped with powerful LED lights that can hover over urban areas during the day. These drones would be programmed to fly in specific patterns, creating a dynamic light show while providing ample illumination for streets and public spaces. The drones could also be equipped with sensors to adjust their brightness based on the surrounding light levels, ensuring energy efficiency.",
    "**Kinetic Energy-Powered Light Poles**: Install light poles that generate energy through kinetic movement. These poles would harness energy from pedestrians walking by, converting their motion into electricity to power bright LED lights. This would create a self-sustaining lighting system that not only illuminates the area but also encourages physical activity and community engagement.",
    "**Augmented Reality Light Displays**: Utilize augmented reality (AR) technology to create virtual light displays that can be viewed through smartphones or AR glasses. In the absence of natural light, these displays could project vibrant, colorful light patterns over the environment, enhancing the mood and creating an immersive experience for users. This technology could also include educational elements, showcasing constellations or historical events related to light."
