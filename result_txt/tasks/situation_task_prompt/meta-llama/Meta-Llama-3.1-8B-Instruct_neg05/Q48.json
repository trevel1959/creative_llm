    "**Sonic Sunrise**: In a world without birds, the city would develop a unique solution to wake up its inhabitants. The streets would be lined with a network of tiny, wind-powered speakers that produce a gentle, soothing melody. As the sun rises, the speakers would gradually increase the volume and tempo, simulating the natural sounds of birds chirping. The city's residents would wake up to a symphony of sound, creating a sense of community and harmony.",
    "**Dreamcatcher Devices**: With no birds to wake us up, people would turn to technology to start their day. Dreamcatcher devices would be wearable, non-invasive devices that track the wearer's brain waves and detect when they're in a light sleep phase. These devices would gently vibrate or emit a soft, pulsing light to simulate the sensation of a bird's gentle chirping, helping the wearer wake up feeling refreshed and energized.",
    "**Nature Mimicry**: In a world without birds, humans would find ways to mimic the sounds of nature to create a wake-up call. Imagine a city where buildings are designed with built-in, high-fidelity speakers that play a soundscape of gentle waterfalls, rustling leaves, or even the distant hum of a beehive. The residents would wake up to a immersive, 3D audio experience that simulates the natural world, making them feel more connected to the environment.",
    "**Personalized Wake-Up Calls**: Without birds, people would turn to personalized wake-up calls to start their day. AI-powered assistants would learn each individual's preferences and wake them up with a customized soundtrack, tailored to their mood, schedule, and preferences. Imagine waking up to a soothing lullaby one day and a motivational anthem the next, all carefully curated to help you start your day on the right foot.",
    "**Bioluminescent Wake-Up**: In a world without birds, humans would find ways to harness the power of bioluminescence to wake up. Imagine a city where buildings are embedded with microorganisms that produce a soft, ethereal glow as the sun rises. The gentle light would simulate the soft chirping of birds, creating a magical atmosphere that awakens the senses and prepares the body for the day ahead. The bioluminescent wake-up call would be a truly unique and enchanting experience, blurring the lines between technology and nature. [/INST] "
