    "**Bee-Friendly Wedding**: Incorporate a theme that supports biodiversity by creating a wedding venue that's bee-friendly. Plant a variety of flowers and plants in your wedding location that are attractive to bees. This not only supports local ecosystems but also makes for a beautiful and fragrant backdrop. The invitations can be designed with illustrations of bees or flowers, and the favors could include seed packets of native bee-attracting plants.",
    "**DIY Reusable Wedding Favors**: Instead of single-use items, create custom wedding favors that guests can use and reuse. These could be reusable water bottles, bamboo straws, or even handmade soap bars. Each favor could come with instructions on how to properly care for or use it, promoting sustainable practices long after the wedding day.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Work with caterers who specialize in zero-waste meals. This means using all parts of ingredients, composting food scraps, and minimizing waste from packaging. You can also encourage guests to bring their own utensils and plates, reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Sustainable Fashion Choices**: Opt for eco-friendly and ethically made clothing for the wedding party and yourself. This includes renting or borrowing outfits instead of buying new ones, choosing materials like organic cotton, linen, or recycled fabrics, and ensuring fair labor practices. The bride could wear a dress made from repurposed materials or vintage finds, setting a stylish precedent for sustainability.",
    "**Eco-friendly Transportation**: Arrange for shuttle services that run on renewable energy sources, such as electric buses or cars powered by biofuels. Encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation by providing incentives or arranging special deals. Alternatively, consider a unique mode of transportation like bicycles or horse-drawn carriages, which have minimal environmental impact."
