    "If there were no more clouds, we would predict the weather based on the sun's position in the sky. The sun's position can indicate the type of weather we can expect. For example, if the sun is high in the sky, we can expect a sunny day. If the sun is low in the sky, we can expect a cloudy day.",
    "We could also use satellite imagery to predict the weather. Satellites can provide us with information about the clouds and their position in the sky. By analyzing this information, we can predict the weather.",
    "We could use wind patterns to predict the weather. Wind patterns can indicate whether a storm is approaching or not. If the wind is blowing from the west, we can expect a cloudy day. If the wind is blowing from the east, we can expect a sunny day.",
    "We could use temperature and humidity levels to predict the weather. If the temperature is high and the humidity is low, we can expect a dry day. If the temperature is low and the humidity is high, we can expect a rainy day.",
    "We could use historical weather patterns to predict the weather. By analyzing historical weather patterns, we can predict what the weather will be like in the future. For example, if it has rained every Monday for the past month, we can expect it to rain again on Monday."
