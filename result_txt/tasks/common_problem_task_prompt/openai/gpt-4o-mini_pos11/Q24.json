    "**Language Barriers**: The foreign exchange student may have varying levels of proficiency in the host country’s language, which can lead to communication difficulties. This could result in frustration for both the student and the host family, particularly in situations that require clear understanding, such as emergency protocols or social interactions. To address this, the host family can incorporate language learning activities, such as using language apps together or practicing conversational skills during meals, making the experience educational and fun.",
    "**Adjustment Issues**: The student may struggle with homesickness, loneliness, or anxiety as they adjust to a new environment, school, and family. This emotional challenge can affect their academic performance and social interactions. To support the student, the host family can create a welcoming environment by involving them in family activities, encouraging them to share their feelings, and possibly connecting them with local clubs or communities that align with their interests.",
    "**Different Academic Expectations**: The educational system in the host country may differ significantly from that of the student’s home country, leading to confusion about grading systems, classroom behavior, and assignment expectations. The student might feel overwhelmed or underprepared. To help bridge this gap, the host family can assist the student in understanding the academic structure, perhaps by arranging meetings with teachers or school counselors who can provide additional support and resources.",
    "**Social Integration Challenges**: The exchange student may find it difficult to integrate into social circles at school or in the community, leading to feelings of isolation. Host families can facilitate social integration by organizing gatherings with other students, encouraging the exchange student to join clubs or sports teams, and inviting classmates over for dinner to foster friendships.",
    "**Financial Implications**: Hosting a foreign exchange student can lead to unexpected financial costs, such as increased utility bills, food expenses, and activity fees. If not planned for, these expenses can create strain on the host family’s budget. To manage this, the family can set a clear budget before the student arrives, discuss shared costs, and seek sponsorship or support from the exchange program to alleviate financial burdens."
