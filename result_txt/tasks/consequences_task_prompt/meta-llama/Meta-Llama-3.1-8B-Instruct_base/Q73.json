    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: Without animals, ecosystems would collapse, leading to a loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, and reduced water quality. Plants would overgrow, blocking sunlight and preventing new plant growth. This would have a ripple effect, impacting human food production, water sources, and overall ecosystem health.",
    "**Loss of Pollination and Seed Dispersal**: Many plants rely on animals for pollination and seed dispersal. Without these animals, plants would struggle to reproduce, leading to a decline in plant diversity and potentially even extinctions. This would have significant impacts on food production, as many crops rely on these processes.",
    "**Disruption of Nutrient Cycles**: Animals play a crucial role in nutrient cycles, such as decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients. Without animals, these cycles would be disrupted, leading to nutrient deficiencies in soils and waterways. This would impact plant growth, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health.",
    "**Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Without animals to help regulate ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions could increase as plants overgrow and release stored carbon. This would exacerbate climate change, leading to more frequent natural disasters, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.",
    "**Loss of Medicinal Resources**: Many animals provide valuable medicinal resources, such as venom from snakes and frogs used in pain relief, or bile from bears used in cancer treatment. Without these animals, humans may lose access to these life-saving treatments, leading to increased suffering and mortality rates.
