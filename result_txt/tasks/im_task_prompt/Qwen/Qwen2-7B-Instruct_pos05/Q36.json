    "**Creative Culinary Knife**: Design a multi-functional kitchen knife with built-in tools like a peeler, can opener, and bottle opener. The design could feature a sleek handle that easily converts between these tools with just a simple twist or flip. This would not only streamline cooking tasks but also reduce clutter in the kitchen by replacing multiple utensils.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Knife System**: Develop a set of knives that automatically sharpen themselves when they are placed back into their magnetic holder. This system would include a small motor and sharpening mechanism within each holder, which engages upon insertion, ensuring your knives stay sharp without any additional effort from the user.",
    "**Personalized Embossed Knife**: Create a line of custom, engraved knives where users can personalize their names, symbols, or quotes on the blade. This could be done through laser engraving, making each knife unique and a personal keepsake. Ideal for gifting or as a special item for professional chefs.",
    "**Portable Outdoor Survival Knife**: Design a compact, lightweight knife with various attachments and features suitable for outdoor activities. This could include a fire starter, fishing hook, and sawblade all integrated into the same tool. The handle could have an ergonomic design for better grip and comfort during use.",
