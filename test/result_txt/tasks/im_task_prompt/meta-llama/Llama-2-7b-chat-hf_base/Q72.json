    "Surfboard with built-in speakers: Create a surfboard that has speakers embedded into the board, allowing surfers to listen to music or podcasts while they ride the waves. The speakers could be powered by a rechargeable battery, and the board could have a waterproof remote control for adjusting the volume or changing tracks. This would be a great way for surfers to enhance their surfing experience by immersing themselves in their favorite tunes while they ride.",
    "Glow-in-the-dark surfboard: Design a surfboard that emits a soft, glowing light when it hits the water. This would create a mesmerizing visual effect as the surfer glides across the waves, and could also help to attract attention from other surfers or beachgoers. The glowing effect could be powered by a small LED light source, which could be rechargeable and last for several hours.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in water filter: Create a surfboard that has a built-in water filter, allowing surfers to drink fresh, clean water directly from the ocean. This could be especially useful in areas where the water is contaminated or unsafe for drinking. The filter could be made from a durable, food-grade material and could be easily accessible through a flip-top design.",
    "Surfboard with a built-in GoPro mount: Design a surfboard that has a built-in GoPro mount, allowing surfers to capture high-quality footage of their surfing sessions. The mount could be adjustable, allowing surfers to position the GoPro at different angles and heights for optimal footage. This would be a great way for surfers to capture their most impressive tricks and waves, and share them with friends and family.",
    "Surfboard with a healing element: Create a surfboard that incorporates a healing element, such as a built-in heating pad or a detoxifying charcoal patch. This could help to soothe sore muscles and joints after a long surf session, or provide an added layer of protection against infection or irritation. The healing element could be powered by a small battery pack, which could be recharged between sessions."
