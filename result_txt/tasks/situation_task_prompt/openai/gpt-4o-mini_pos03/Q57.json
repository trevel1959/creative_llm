    "**Vertical Ocean Towers**: High-rise buildings constructed on stilts above the water could provide living spaces while allowing for the natural flow of tides. These towers would be designed with multiple levels, each featuring green terraces with plants that help purify the air and provide food. The lower levels could serve as docks for boats, while the upper levels would offer panoramic views of the ocean. Each tower could also include community spaces for gatherings and events, fostering a sense of connection among residents.",
    "**Submarine Habitats**: For the adventurous spirit, living in underwater habitats could be a thrilling option. These transparent domes would be submerged beneath the ocean surface, offering breathtaking views of marine life. Equipped with advanced technology for air circulation and water filtration, these habitats would allow residents to experience the ocean up close while remaining safe from rising waters. The design would incorporate hydroponic gardens to grow food and a communal area for socializing and relaxation.",
    "**Eco-Pod Communities**: Small, self-sustaining eco-pods could be scattered across floating platforms, creating a decentralized living arrangement. Each pod would be designed for a single family or individual, equipped with solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and composting toilets. The community could share resources like tools and gardens, fostering a strong sense of collaboration and environmental stewardship. This setup would allow residents to live off the grid while enjoying the beauty of their surroundings.",
    "**Reclaimed Land Neighborhoods**: Utilizing advanced engineering, cities could be constructed on reclaimed land from the ocean. This would involve creating artificial islands or extending existing coastlines with sustainable materials. These neighborhoods would be designed to withstand flooding, with elevated homes and extensive drainage systems. Green spaces and parks would be integrated into the design, allowing for a balance between urban living and nature. Residents could enjoy beachfront access and recreational activities while being part of a vibrant community.",
    "**Treehouse Villages**: Inspired by the concept of treetop living, these villages would be built in coastal forests, elevated above potential flooding. Homes would be constructed among the trees, connected by rope bridges and walkways. This design would allow residents to live in harmony with nature while providing a unique perspective of the surrounding landscape. Each treehouse could be equipped with solar energy and rainwater collection systems, promoting sustainability and minimizing the ecological footprint."
