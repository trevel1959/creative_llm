    "As a functional bike wheel: With a suitable mount, the steering wheel could serve as a functional part of a bike. An inverted steering wheel could replace a traditional front bike wheel, allowing the rider to keep their front foot on the ground without the need for a traditional pedal assembly. This could prove useful for people without much upper body strength or for elderly or disabled individuals.",
    "As a solar panel: By harnessing power from solar energy, it's possible to cover steering wheels with flexible solar panels, turning them into a sustainable energy source. To increase efficiency, the solar panel could be mounted along the outer perimeter of the steering wheel. This could provide enough electrical energy to power a mobile device, air conditioning, or other electrically powered features in a car.",
    "As an interactive gaming controller: Using the mounting ability of the steering wheel, the vehicle's infotainment screen could integrate a steering wheel, turning it into an interactive gaming device. With the addition of a joystick, it could be used to control games, and since the wheel would be affixed to the car, any crashes or accidents the user causes while gaming wouldn't damage their vehicle.",
    "As an adjustable hand rest: The steering wheel could help alleviate discomfort experienced by drivers who spend long hours on the road. As an adjustable hand rest, the owner could position the steering wheel in a more ergonomically comfortable position, allowing them to keep their hands in a more natural position for extended driving periods.",
    "As a dog bed or carrier: For pet owners with smaller dogs, installing a cushioned seat on top of the steering wheel could create a comfortable bed or small carrier for their pet. This could also provide the pet some degree of security in the car, as it would allow them to keep an eye on their surroundings, which is beneficial especially for shorter dogs."
