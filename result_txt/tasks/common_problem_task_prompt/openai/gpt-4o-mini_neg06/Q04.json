    "**Insufficient Capital**: Many new businesses underestimate the amount of capital required to sustain operations during the initial phases. They may overlook expenses like marketing, salaries, and unexpected costs. This can lead to cash flow issues and, ultimately, business failure. To address this, entrepreneurs should create a detailed financial plan that includes a budget, forecasts, and a contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses.",
    "**Ineffective Branding**: Starting a business without a clear brand identity can confuse potential customers.

    "**Legal Compliance Oversights**: New business owners may overlook the legal requirements necessary to operate their business, such as permits, licenses, and insurance. Failing to comply with regulations can lead to fines, legal issues, or even the closure of the business. To avoid this, entrepreneurs should consult with legal experts to ensure they understand all the necessary legalities before launching.",
    "**Poor Online Presence**: In today's digital age, having a weak online presence can significantly hinder a new business's success.

    "**Ineffective Marketing Strategy**: New businesses often struggle to find the right marketing channels to reach their audience effectively. They may rely solely on traditional marketing methods without exploring digital marketing, social media, or influencer partnerships.
