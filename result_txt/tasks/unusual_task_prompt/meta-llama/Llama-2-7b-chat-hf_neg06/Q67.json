    "Portable Solar-Powered Flashlight: Create a flashlight that uses solar panels to charge during the day and provides a reliable source of light at night. This would be especially useful for campers, hikers, and individuals living in areas without access to electricity. The flashlight could have a built-in battery that stores excess energy for extended use.",
    "Smart Flashlight with AI-Powered Night Vision: Develop a flashlight with an integrated AI-powered night vision system that enhances the light output to improve visibility in low-light environments. The AI would analyze the surroundings and adjust the light output accordingly, allowing users to see objects and details that would otherwise be difficult to perceive.",
    "Multi-Functional Flashlight with Built-In Tools: Design a flashlight that incorporates multiple tools, such as a knife, scissors, or a small drill, into its design. This would provide users with a compact and versatile lighting solution for various tasks, such as camping, DIY projects, or emergency situations.",
    "Bike Mounted Flashlight: Create a flashlight specifically designed for bicycle riders. The flashlight could be mounted on the handlebars or seat post and provide a wide beam of light to illuminate the road ahead. This would increase visibility and safety for cyclists, especially during nighttime rides.",
    "Portable Flashlight with Augmented Reality Display: Develop a flashlight that includes an augmented reality (AR) display, allowing users to see virtual information and images superimposed onto their surroundings. This could include maps, directions, or other relevant information that would be useful for outdoor activities like hiking or camping. The AR display could also provide a fun and interactive experience for users, such as displaying games or animations."
