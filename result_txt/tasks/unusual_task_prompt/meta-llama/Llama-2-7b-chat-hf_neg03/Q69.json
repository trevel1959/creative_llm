    "Smart Hairdryer: Create a hairdryer that can detect the user's hair type and adjust its heat and speed accordingly. This smart hairdryer can also be controlled through a mobile app, allowing users to change settings and customize their drying experience.",
    "Hairdryer with built-in styling tools: Design a hairdryer that incorporates built-in styling tools such as a diffuser, curlers, or a straightening iron. This would eliminate the need for separate styling tools and save space in the bathroom.",
    "Portable Hairdryer: Create a lightweight and compact hairdryer that can be easily taken on the go. This portable hairdryer would be perfect for travel, camping, or for use in small bathrooms.",
    "Hairdryer with air ionizer: Incorporate an air ionizer into the hairdryer to help reduce frizz and add shine to the hair. The air ionizer would release negative ions into the air, which would help to break up water molecules and reduce frizz, resulting in smoother and shinier hair.",
    "Hairdryer with built-in UV light: Design a hairdryer that emits ultraviolet light, which can help to protect the hair from damage caused by heat styling. The UV light can also help to add a subtle glow to the hair, giving it a healthy and radiant appearance."
