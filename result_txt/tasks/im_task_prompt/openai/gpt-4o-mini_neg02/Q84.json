    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Voice Activation**: Create a coat rack equipped with a voice-activated assistant, similar to smart home devices. Users could ask the coat rack for weather updates, reminders, or even to find lost items (like keys or bags) that may have been left hanging. This would add a fun, interactive element to the everyday task of hanging up coats.",
    "**Seasonal Coat Rack with Rotating Display**: Develop a coat rack that can rotate or change its design based on the season. For example, in winter, it could showcase heavier coats and scarves, while in summer, it could highlight lighter jackets and accessories. This could be achieved through a rotating mechanism that allows users to slide different sections into view.",
    "**Multi-functional Coat Rack with Storage Compartment**: Incorporate a storage compartment within the coat rack itself. This could be a drawer or a hidden compartment that allows users to store gloves, hats, or other accessories. The design could feature a lift-top or slide-out drawer that blends seamlessly with the coat rackâ€™s aesthetics.",
    "**Customizable Modular Coat Rack**: Create a modular coat rack system that allows users to add or remove components based on their needs. Users could mix and match hooks, shelves, and even decorative elements to create a personalized coat rack that fits their space and style. This would cater to both small and large entryways, providing flexibility.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coat Rack Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a coat rack that emphasizes sustainability by using recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood or recycled metal. This could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the design could incorporate plant holders or green features, like vertical gardens, to promote a natural aesthetic."
