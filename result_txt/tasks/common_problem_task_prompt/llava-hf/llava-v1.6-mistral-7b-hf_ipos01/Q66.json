    "**Accessibility**: The course should be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is easily accessible to students with disabilities. This can include features such as closed captions for videos, alt text for images, and compatibility with assistive technologies.",
    "**Technical Issues**: Technical problems such as slow loading times, video playback issues, or incompatible software can frustrate students and hinder their learning experience. It is important to thoroughly test the course on different devices and platforms to minimize technical issues.",
    "**Learning Management System (LMS)**: The course should be hosted on a reliable and user-friendly LMS. This includes features such as easy navigation, course tracking, and grading. A poor LMS can negatively impact the student experience and may even discourage them from completing the course.",
    "**Instructor Availability**: The instructor should be available to answer student questions and provide feedback on assignments. This can be a challenge if the instructor has a heavy workload or if the course is large. Providing clear communication channels and setting realistic response times can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Course Pricing**: Pricing the course appropriately is important to ensure that it is accessible to a wide range of students. However, setting the price too low may result in a lack of resources for course development and maintenance, while setting it too high may limit the number of students who can enroll."
