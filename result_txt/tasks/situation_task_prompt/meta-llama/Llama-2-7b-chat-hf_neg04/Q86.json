    "Soap-based tattoos: Create a new form of temporary tattoos that mimic the function of traditional soap. These tattoos would contain a combination of natural oils and antibacterial agents that would help to clean and moisturize the skin. They could be applied directly to the skin and would last for several days, providing a convenient alternative to soap for personal hygiene.",
    "Solar-powered showers: Develop a shower system that harnesses the power of the sun to clean the body. The system would consist of a water-resistant enclosure with built-in solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This electricity would be used to power a water pump that would circulate water through the showerhead, providing a clean and refreshing shower without the need for soap.",
    "Bacteria-fighting clothing: Design a line of clothing that incorporates natural antibacterial agents into the fabric. This could include adding essential oils such as tea tree oil or lavender oil to the fabric, which have antibacterial properties, or using bamboo fibers that have natural antibacterial properties. This clothing would provide an additional layer of protection against dirt and germs, making it easier to keep clean without soap.",
    "Hydrogen peroxide-infused toothpaste: Create a toothpaste that contains hydrogen peroxide as the primary cleaning agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a natural disinfectant that can effectively remove plaque and kill bacteria in the mouth. By incorporating it into a toothpaste, users could brush their teeth without the need for traditional soap-based toothpaste.",
    "Air-purifying masks: Design a mask that can filter out impurities and pollutants from the air, providing an additional layer of cleanliness. The mask could be made with a special filter material that captures particles and bacteria, or it could incorporate a built-in air purifier that can remove pollutants and allergens from the air. This would provide an additional way to keep clean without the need for soap, especially in environments with high levels of air pollution."
