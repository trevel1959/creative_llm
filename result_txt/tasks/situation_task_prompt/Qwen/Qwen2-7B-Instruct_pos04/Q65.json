    "**Bioluminescent Paint**: Paint the walls or ceiling of the room with bioluminescent paint. These paints contain bacteria that glow in the dark when exposed to a source of energy such as sunlight or UV light. The effect would be particularly striking if the room has a window that can capture natural light during the day.",
    "**Infrared Luminous Plants**: Grow plants that are capable of emitting infrared light. This type of light is invisible to the human eye but can be detected by infrared cameras. By strategically placing these plants around the room, they can create an ambient glow that illuminates the space without direct visibility.",
    "**Solar-Powered Fiber Optics**: Install fiber optic cables that run throughout the room. During the day, sunlight can be directed into these cables through strategically placed mirrors or lenses on the roof. At night, the fibers will emit a soft, warm glow, providing light for the room.",
    "**Laser Light Show**: Use laser technology to project patterns onto the walls and ceiling. Lasers can be used to create intricate designs and patterns that change over time, creating a dynamic light show. This would require a laser projector specifically designed for indoor use.",
    "**Interactive LED Mural**: Create a large-scale LED mural on one wall of the room. The LED panels can be programmed to display different colors and patterns, responding to various stimuli such as sound, touch, or movement. This not only lights up the room but also adds an interactive element, making the experience unique and engaging for visitors."
