    "Overwhelming Memory Load: If all humans could remember everything they read, the sheer volume of information would become overwhelming. The human brain has a limited capacity for processing and storing memories, and the constant influx of new information would make it difficult to retain and recall anything with clarity. People would struggle to focus on anything for an extended period, leading to mental fatigue and decreased productivity.",
    "Loss of Personal Identity: With the ability to recall every detail of one's life, people might struggle to form a sense of self. The constant barrage of memories would make it difficult to distinguish between the self and external experiences, leading to confusion and a loss of personal identity. This could result in feelings of disconnection and isolation.",
    "Increased Anxiety and Stress: The burden of retaining every memory would lead to increased anxiety and stress levels. People might feel the need to constantly review and relive past experiences, leading to a sense of being \"stuck\" in the past. This could also lead to difficulty sleeping, as the brain would struggle to shut down and process the constant flow of memories.",
    "Difficulty in Forming New Memories: With the ability to recall every detail of the past, people might struggle to form new memories. The constant flood of information would make it difficult to distinguish between past and present, leading to confusion and difficulties in learning new information. This could result in a stagnation of personal growth and development.",
    "Ethical Concerns: With the ability to recall every detail of a person's life, there would be significant ethical concerns regarding privacy and consent. People might feel vulnerable and exposed, leading to a loss of trust in personal relationships and institutions. Additionally, the ability to recall every detail of a person's past could lead to unethical uses of this information, such as blackmail or manipulation."
