    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Develop a large-scale rainwater harvesting system that captures and purifies rainwater for drinking purposes. This system could be installed in areas with abundant rainfall. The collected water would pass through multiple filtration stages including sand, activated carbon, and UV light treatment to ensure it's safe for consumption.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration Devices**: Design portable, self-contained water purification devices that can be carried by individuals or deployed in remote areas where water sources are contaminated. These devices could use advanced technologies like reverse osmosis, UV disinfection, or electro-dialysis to remove pollutants and contaminants.",
    "**Plants for Water Purification**: Utilize plants known for their water-purifying capabilities, such as water lilies, cattails, and certain species of algae, to create bio-reactors. These plants can absorb toxins and pollutants from water, making it safe for drinking after a set period of growth and maturation.",
    "**Nano-Technology Water Filters**: Create advanced water filters that utilize nanotechnology to filter out impurities at the molecular level. These filters could be integrated into existing water distribution systems, ensuring that all water reaching consumers is clean and safe to drink.",
    "**Biological Water Treatment Plants**: Establish large-scale biological water treatment facilities that use microorganisms to break down pollutants and contaminants in water. This method would mimic natural water purification processes, utilizing bacteria and fungi to detoxify water, making it suitable for human consumption. These plants could be strategically placed near major cities or industrial zones to handle high volumes of contaminated water efficiently."
