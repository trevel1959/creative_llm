    "Overheating: Another potential issue when building a computer from scratch is overheating. If the cooling system is not properly designed or implemented, the computer may overheat, causing performance issues or even hardware damage.",
    "Inadequate power supply: Building a computer from scratch requires a power supply that can provide enough power to all the components. If the power supply is inadequate, it can lead to performance issues or hardware damage.",
    "Inexperience or lack of knowledge: Building a computer from scratch requires knowledge of various components and their compatibility. If the person building the computer is inexperienced or lacks knowledge, they may end up with a system that does not function properly or is not optimized for their needs.",
    "Incorrect cable management: Proper cable management is essential for a clean and efficient build. If cables are not managed correctly, it can lead to clutter, reduced airflow, and even potential hardware damage.",
    "Component failure: Building a computer from scratch means that all components are new. If a component fails during the build process or shortly after, it can lead to significant downtime and costs to repair or replace the component."
