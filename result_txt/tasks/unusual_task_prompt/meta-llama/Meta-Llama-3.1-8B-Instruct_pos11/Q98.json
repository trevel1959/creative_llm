    "**Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Automation**: Design a smart power strip that not only provides surge protection and multiple outlets but also monitors energy consumption in real-time. This strip could be connected to a mobile app, allowing users to track their energy usage, set budgets, and receive alerts when devices are idle or consuming excessive power. The automation feature could be integrated with popular smart home systems, enabling users to schedule power on/off times for specific devices or groups of devices based on their daily routines.",
    "**Portable Power Bank with Built-in Solar Charging and Water Purification**: Develop a portable power bank that not only charges devices on the go but also includes a built-in solar panel for charging and a water purification system. This product would be ideal for outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responders, or individuals living in areas with frequent power outages. The solar panel could charge the power bank, and the water purification system could provide clean drinking water from any source, making it a self-sustaining tool for survival.",
    "**Modular Power System for Electric Vehicles**: Design a modular power system for electric vehicles that allows owners to easily upgrade or replace components as technology advances. This system could include swappable battery packs, advanced power electronics, and high-efficiency motors. The modular design would enable faster charging, longer driving ranges, and reduced maintenance costs, making electric vehicles more appealing to consumers.",
    "**Smart Home Power Outlet with Voice Control and Energy Harvesting**: Create a smart home power outlet that can be controlled using voice commands, smartphone apps, or traditional switches. This outlet could also include energy harvesting technology that captures and converts wasted energy from devices into usable power. This feature would reduce energy consumption and provide a more sustainable way to power devices.",
    "**Modular Power Distribution System for Events and Construction Sites**: Develop a modular power distribution system that is designed for temporary power needs in events, construction sites, or disaster relief efforts. This system would include lightweight, portable components that can be easily assembled and disassembled, reducing setup and teardown times. The system could also include advanced safety features, such as automatic shutdown and ground fault protection, to ensure safe operation. The modular design would enable users to scale up or down as needed, making it a cost-effective solution for temporary power needs. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are just the starting point. How would you like to proceed with developing them? Would you like to refine any of these ideas, combine them, or explore new concepts? [/INST] Assistant: To proceed, I can"
