    "**Customizable Brush Heads**: Create a line of interchangeable brush heads that cater to different dental needs (e.g., sensitive teeth, whitening, gum care). Users could select the brush head based on their specific oral health goals, and the toothbrush would automatically adjust its settings (like pressure and vibration) to match the chosen head, optimizing the brushing experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush Design**: Develop an electric toothbrush made from biodegradable materials and offer a recycling program for used brush heads. This would not only reduce plastic waste but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The toothbrush could also feature a solar-powered charging base, minimizing energy consumption.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience**: Incorporate gamification elements into the brushing routine through an accompanying app. Users can earn points, unlock achievements, and compete with friends or family members in brushing challenges. This could motivate children and adults alike to maintain consistent oral hygiene habits while making the experience more enjoyable.",
    "**Built-in Water Flosser**: Design an electric toothbrush that includes a small, integrated water flosser. This dual-function device would allow users to brush and floss simultaneously, improving oral hygiene efficiency. The water flosser could have adjustable pressure settings to cater to different preferences and sensitivity levels.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Aromatherapy**: Introduce mood lighting that changes colors based on the duration of brushing or the userâ€™s oral health status. Additionally, the toothbrush could release mild, safe essential oils (like peppermint or eucalyptus) during use, enhancing the sensory experience and promoting relaxation, particularly beneficial for users who may feel anxious about dental care."
