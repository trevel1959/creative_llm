    "\"Capture theless\": This idea is to create a camera that captures the emotions and expressions of animals, giving people a glimpse into their lives. This camera could be placed in animal habitats and would use advanced facial recognition technology to detect and capture emotions. This could help people understand and appreciate the emotions of animals, and could even lead to a greater empathy towards them.",
    "\"Virtual reality camera\": This idea is to create a camera that captures a 360-degree view of a scene and allows people to experience it in virtual reality. This could be used for travel, real estate, and even gaming. The camera would use advanced image processing technology to stitch together the images and create a seamless, immersive experience.",
    "\"Smart\": This idea is to create a camera that is designed specifically for selfies. The camera would have a built-in filter that would automatically adjust to the user's skin tone and make them look their best. The camera would also have advanced tracking technology, so that it would always capture the best possible shot of the user.",
    "\"Augmented reality camera\": This idea is to create a camera that overlays digital information onto the real world. The camera would use advanced computer vision technology to detect objects and people in the real world, and then overlay digital information such as names, titles, and other data. This could be used in a variety of applications, such as retail, education, and entertainment.",
    "\"Camera for people with disabilities\": This idea is to create a camera that is designed specifically for people with disabilities. The camera would have features such as voice control, gesture recognition, and large buttons, making it easy for people with disabilities to use. The camera would also have advanced image processing technology, so that it would be able to capture clear, high-quality images even in challenging lighting conditions."
