    "**Dusting Mitten**: Transform an old cotton glove into a dusting mitt by covering it with a mixture of fabric softener and water. Slip it on your hand and use it to dust surfaces around your home. The glove will attract dust and dirt, making cleaning more efficient and eco-friendly.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Repurpose an old glove into a fun pet toy. Fill it with crinkly plastic (like from a snack bag) and tie off the wrist. This creates a noise-making toy that pets can chew and play with, providing them with entertainment and mental stimulation.",
    "**Ice Pack Holder**: Use a glove as a makeshift ice pack holder. Fill the glove with ice cubes and tie it off at the wrist. This will keep your hands warm while providing targeted cold therapy to sore muscles or injuries without direct contact with ice.",
    "**Gardening Aid**: Cut the fingertips off an old glove and use it as a seedling protector. Slip the cut glove over young plants to shield them from harsh weather conditions, pests, or even curious pets, allowing them to grow without interference.",
    "**Creative Costume Accessory**: Use gloves as part of a creative costume or performance piece. For example, paint or decorate them to match a character, or create a puppet show by attaching googly eyes and a mouth to the glove, allowing it to become a fun, interactive character."
