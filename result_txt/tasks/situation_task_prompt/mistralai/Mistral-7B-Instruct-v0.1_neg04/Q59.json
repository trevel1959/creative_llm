    "Solar panels: One solution to getting enough sunlight even if the sky is always cloudy is to install solar panels. Solar panels can capture the energy from the sun, even if it is not visible in the sky. This energy can be used to power homes, businesses, and even cars.",
    "Artificial lighting: Another solution is to use artificial lighting to supplement the natural light that is not available. This can include LED lights, fluorescent lights, or other types of artificial lighting.",
    "Mirrors: A third solution is to use mirrors to reflect sunlight into areas that are not receiving it directly. This can be done by installing mirrors on buildings or other structures, or by using mirrors in the design of windows and other surfaces.",
    "Skylights: A fourth solution is to install skylights in buildings. Skylights are designed to let in natural light, even if the sky is cloudy. They can be installed in areas where natural light is needed, such as workspaces, living rooms, and bedrooms.",
    "Solar water heating: A fifth solution is to use solar water heating systems to heat water for homes and businesses. These systems use the energy from the sun to heat water, which can be used for cooking, cleaning, and other purposes."
