    "Planetary Realignment: In this redesign, the planets are rearranged to form a more aesthetically pleasing and harmonious system. Mercury and Venus are combined into a single planet, \"Vermercia,\" with a unique atmosphere that combines the best qualities of both planets. Mars and Earth are moved closer together, creating a \"Mars-Earth Union\" that fosters interplanetary cooperation and cultural exchange. The outer planets are repositioned to create a more balanced and symmetrical system, with Jupiter and Saturn forming a \"Jupiter-Saturn Axis\" that governs the entire solar system.",
    "Orbital Evolution: In this redesign, the planets are given new orbital paths that allow for more diverse and dynamic interactions. For example, Mercury is given a highly elliptical orbit that brings it closer to the sun during its closest approach, while Venus is given a more circular orbit that allows for longer periods of daylight on its surface. Mars is given a more eccentric orbit that allows for extreme temperature variations, while Jupiter and Saturn are given more circular orbits that create a more stable and predictable system.",
    "Gravity Enhancements: In this redesign, the planets are given new gravitational properties that enhance their potential for supporting life. For example, Mercury is given a stronger gravitational pull to create a more stable and habitable environment, while Venus is given a weaker gravitational pull to create a more Earth-like atmosphere. Mars is given a more variable gravitational field to create a more dynamic and challenging environment, while Jupiter and Saturn are given stronger gravitational fields to create more stable and predictable environments.",
    "Atmospheric Augmentations: In this redesign, the planets are given new atmospheres that enhance their potential for supporting life. For example, Mercury is given a thicker atmosphere to protect its surface from harmful radiation, while Venus is given a thinner atmosphere to create a more Earth-like climate. Mars is given a more varied and dynamic atmosphere that includes both hot and cold zones, while Jupiter and Saturn are given more stable and predictable atmospheres that support a wider range of life forms.",
