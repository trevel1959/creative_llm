    "**Augmented Reality Therapy for Phantom Limb Syndrome**: Develop an AR experience that simulates the sensation of a missing limb, allowing patients to interact with virtual objects and environments in a way that feels intuitive and natural. This could help alleviate the distress and discomfort associated with phantom limb syndrome.",
    "**Mind-Controlled Prosthetic Limb with Haptic Feedback**: Design a prosthetic limb that can be controlled by the user's thoughts, using EEG or other neural interfaces. Integrate haptic feedback to provide a sense of touch and proprioception, allowing users to feel sensations and textures as if they were using their natural limbs.",
    "**Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Phantom Pain**: Create a VR experience that gradually exposes patients to simulated environments and scenarios that trigger phantom pain. The goal is to help patients become desensitized to these triggers and develop coping mechanisms to manage their pain.",
    "**Soft Exosuit for Amputees**: Develop a wearable, soft exosuit that provides support and stability for amputees, allowing them to walk, run, or engage in other activities with greater ease and confidence. The exosuit could be controlled by muscle signals or other sensors to adapt to the user's needs.",
    "**Neurofeedback Training for Phantom Limb Syndrome**: Design a neurofeedback training program that helps patients become aware of and control their brain activity related to phantom limb syndrome. By training the brain to recognize and modify patterns of activity, patients may be able to reduce the intensity and frequency of phantom pain. [/INST] Assistant: 6. **Personalized 3D-Printed Prosthetic Limbs with Advanced Materials**: Develop a system that uses AI and machine learning to create customized prosthetic limbs with advanced materials and features, such as adaptive grips, temperature regulation, or integrated sensors. This could provide users with a more natural and comfortable fit, as well as improved functionality."
