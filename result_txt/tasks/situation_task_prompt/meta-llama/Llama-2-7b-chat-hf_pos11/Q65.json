    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution to light up a room at night without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use solar-powered lanterns. These lanterns use energy from the sun to charge during the day and provide a warm, soft light at night. They can be placed in windows or hung from the ceiling, providing ample light without any electricity.",
    "Glowing Plants: Another option is to use plants that have a natural glow. Certain species of plants, such as glowing mushrooms or luminous plants, can absorb light during the day and release it at night, providing a soft, ambient light. This not only provides light but also adds a touch of nature to the room.",
    "LED Candles: LED candles are a great alternative to traditional candles, which can be a fire hazard without lighting fixtures. These candles use LED lights to mimic the glow of a real candle, providing a warm, cozy light without the risk of fire. They can be placed on tables, shelves, or even hung from the ceiling.",
    "Mirrors with Built-In Lighting: Mirrors can be a great source of light in a room, especially if they have built-in lighting. Mirrors with LED lights or fiber optic lights can provide a bright, even light that can be adjusted to suit the room's needs. This not only provides light but also adds a touch of elegance to the room.",
    "Holographic Projections: For a more futuristic solution, holographic projections can be used to create a bright, 3D light source in a room. These projections use lasers and advanced technology to create a holographic image that can be projected onto a wall or ceiling, providing a bright, immersive light source. This option is more expensive and advanced but can create a truly unique and impressive lighting effect."
