    "**Smart Laundry Sorting Robot**: Design a robot that uses AI and machine learning to automatically sort clothes based on fabric type, color, and washing instructions. The robot could use sensors to detect the type of laundry in the basket, then sort it into separate compartments or bags for washing, drying, and folding. This would save time, reduce errors, and ensure that each item is handled appropriately.",
    "**Interactive Laundry List App**: Create an app that helps users plan their laundry schedule, track what needs to be washed, and remind them when to start. Users can input items by taking photos, scanning barcodes, or manually entering details. The app could also suggest the most efficient wash cycles based on load size and fabric type, reducing water usage and energy costs.",
    "**DIY Laundry Basket Organizer**: Encourage users to create their own custom laundry basket organizers using materials like fabric, cardboard, or plastic bins. These organizers can have different sections for sorting by color, type of clothing, or washing instructions. Adding labels can help maintain organization even as items are added or removed from the basket.",
    "**Smart Detergent Dispenser**: Develop a dispenser that automatically measures and dispenses detergent based on the size of the load. The dispenser could connect to a smartphone app that tracks usage and recommends refills. This not only saves money by avoiding overuse but also ensures consistent cleaning results without the need for manual measurement.",
    "**Wearable Laundry Tracker**: Invent a small, wearable device that can attach to clothing or be integrated into laundry tags. The tracker could monitor wear patterns and suggest optimal washing intervals, preventing damage and extending the life of garments. Additionally, it could provide feedback on how to care for specific fabrics, offering tips on washing, drying, and ironing techniques."
