    "**Use Signal via Satellite:** Utilize a satellite phone or an app like Signal which supports VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) to communicate through satellites. These devices or apps allow you to make voice calls even when there's no terrestrial cellular network available.",
    "**Innovative Morse Code Devices:** Develop wearable devices that can transmit Morse code signals. For example, a smartwatch could have a built-in Morse code transmitter. Users can send messages by tapping their watch in a specific pattern, which can then be received by others using specialized receivers or apps on their devices.",
    "**Infrared Communication Devices:** Create portable devices that use infrared technology to communicate over short distances without needing any infrastructure. They can be used for point-to-point communication between two people, similar to how Bluetooth works but specifically designed for emergency situations.",
    "**High-Frequency Radio Transmitters:** Design and manufacture high-frequency radio transmitters that can operate independently of cellular networks. These could be battery-powered handheld devices or even small drones equipped with high-frequency radios to relay messages across longer distances.",
    "**Emergency-Only Communication Network:** Establish a dedicated, low-bandwidth, and encrypted communication network that operates exclusively during emergencies. This network could utilize unused portions of existing frequency bands or create new ones specifically for this purpose. It would require minimal infrastructure and could be activated remotely, allowing for rapid setup and operation."
