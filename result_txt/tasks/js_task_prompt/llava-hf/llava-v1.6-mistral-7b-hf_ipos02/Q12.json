    "Underwater Farming: Agriculture would also need to adapt to the underwater environment. Aquaponics, a system where fish and plants coexist in a symbiotic relationship, would be a key component of underwater farming. This would allow for the cultivation of both food and oxygen in a sustainable and efficient manner.",
    "Underwater Transportation: Transportation would have to be adapted to function in the water. Submarines, underwater trains, and even underwater cars could become commonplace, with infrastructure designed to accommodate these new modes of transport.",
    "Underwater Sports and Recreation: Water sports like scuba diving and snorkeling would become more accessible and commonplace, with underwater parks and attractions designed to showcase the wonders of the deep.",
    "Underwater Cities: Entire cities could be built underwater, providing a unique and sustainable living environment. These cities would need to be self-sufficient, with recycling systems to manage waste and water.",
    "Underwater Education: Schools and universities could be designed to take advantage of the unique underwater environment, offering courses in marine biology, underwater engineering, and aquatic ecology."
