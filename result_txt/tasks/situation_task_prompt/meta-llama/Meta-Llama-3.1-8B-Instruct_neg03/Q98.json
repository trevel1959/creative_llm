    "**Bloom Botanicals**: Develop a line of scented, edible flowers and herbs that can be used as a natural perfume alternative. These flowers and herbs would be grown in controlled environments, ensuring consistency and quality. Consumers could purchase the flowers and herbs, or pre-made arrangements, to create their own unique scents. For example, a bouquet of rose petals, lavender, and lemon verbena could evoke a soothing, floral aroma.",
    "**Scented Alchemy**: Create a subscription-based service that sends customers a monthly selection of essential oils, extracts, and other natural ingredients. Each month, a new, unique scent would be created using a combination of the ingredients. Customers would receive a recipe and instructions on how to blend the ingredients to create the scent. This would encourage experimentation and creativity, allowing customers to develop their own signature scents.",
    "**Fragrance Foraging**: Develop an app that connects users with local, sustainable fragrance suppliers. The app would allow users to search for and purchase unique, small-batch fragrances created using natural ingredients sourced from local farms and suppliers. This would promote community engagement and support local economies.",
    "**Aromatic Architecture**: Design a line of scented, modular building blocks that can be combined to create unique fragrances. These blocks would contain different essential oils and extracts, which would be released as the blocks are manipulated. This would allow users to create complex, layered scents and experiment with different fragrance combinations.",
    "**Olfactory Library**: Create a digital platform that allows users to upload and share their own scent creations. The platform would include a vast library of user-generated scents, which could be browsed and searched by fragrance type, mood, or occasion. Users could also rate and review scents, creating a community-driven fragrance database. This would democratize fragrance creation and provide a platform for users to discover new, unique scents."
