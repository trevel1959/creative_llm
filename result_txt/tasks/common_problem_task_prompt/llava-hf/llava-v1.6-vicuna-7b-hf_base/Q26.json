    "Altitude Sickness: As climbers ascend Mount Everest, they can experience altitude sickness, which is caused by a rapid decrease in the amount of oxygen available in the air. This can cause symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath. If left untreated, altitude sickness can lead to more severe conditions such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).",
    "Terrain: The terrain on Mount Everest is highly uneven and covered in loose rock, making it difficult for climbers to move quickly or safely. The risk of injury from falling rocks or slipping on icy surfaces increases the potential for accidents.",
    "Accidents: Falling is a common cause of injury on Mount Everest, especially since climbers are often moving at high speeds to reach the summit. Falling into crevasses or slipping on ice can lead to severe injuries or even death.",
    "Equipment Malfunction: High altitude and extreme cold can cause equipment to malfunction. For example, oxygen tanks may freeze, which can render them ineffective when needed. The cold weather can also cause problems with fuel lines or electronic devices, such as GPS devices or communication equipment.",
    "Nutrition and Hydration: Climbing Mount Everest requires a great deal of energy, and it can be difficult to maintain proper nutrition and hydration levels, particularly at high altitude. Dehydration and malnutrition can lead to exhaustion, which can result in accidents or difficulty completing the climb."
