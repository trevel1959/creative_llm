    "Create a series of illustrations that depict the Snoring Sun in different scenarios where it's struggling to stay awake. For example, one illustration could show the sun trying to stay up late by hugging a giant pillow, while another could show it nodding off during a meeting with celestial beings.",
    "Write a children's book about the Snoring Sun and its adventures. The story could be about how the sun learns to control its snoring and becomes a more reliable source of light and warmth for the world.",
    "Develop a board game where players take on the role of different celestial bodies and try to outdo each other in terms of brightness and energy output. The Snoring Sun would be one of the characters, and players would have to figure out ways to wake it up and keep it shining bright.",
    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the solar system and learn about the different planets and their moons. As they move through space, the user would encounter the Snoring Sun and have to find ways to help it wake up and shine its brightest.",
    "Design a wearable device that uses sound waves to help people overcome their own sleep problems. The device could emit soothing sounds that mimic the rhythm of the sun's breathing, helping the wearer fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. The Snoring Sun could serve as the inspiration for the design and branding of the product."
