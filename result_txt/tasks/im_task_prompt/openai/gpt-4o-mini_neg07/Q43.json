    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop an oven with a built-in self-cleaning mechanism that uses high-temperature steam or a special UV light to sanitize the interior. This would eliminate the need for harsh chemicals and make cleaning a breeze. The self-cleaning feature could be activated via a smartphone app, allowing users to set it to clean while they are away from home.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Air Fryer and Sous Vide**: Design an oven that combines multiple cooking methods, such as an air fryer, convection oven, and sous vide capabilities. This would allow users to cook a variety of meals using one appliance, saving space in the kitchen. A digital interface could guide users through each cooking method with pre-programmed settings for optimal results.",
    "**Modular Oven Design**: Create a modular oven system where users can customize their cooking space based on their needs. For example, a user could add additional oven compartments for larger meals or swap out different cooking technologies, such as a pizza stone or steam drawer. This would cater to a variety of cooking styles and preferences, making it a versatile choice for any kitchen.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Upgrade the traditional oven controls with a large, interactive touchscreen that provides step-by-step cooking instructions, videos, and timers. The interface could also include a community feature where users can share their favorite recipes and tips, making cooking a more social experience. Additionally, it could allow users to save their favorite settings for quick access.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Features**: Introduce an oven that uses advanced insulation and smart energy management systems to minimize energy consumption. This could include features like a “sleep mode” that reduces energy use when the oven is not in use and an energy monitor that tracks usage over time. Users could receive tips on how to optimize their cooking habits for better energy savings."
