    "**Miniature Garden Tool**: A pen can be transformed into a small garden tool for indoor plants. Remove the ink cartridge and use the hollow pen body as a tiny trowel to gently dig around the roots of your potted plants. The narrow tip can also be used to poke holes in the soil for planting seeds or bulbs, making it a handy tool for urban gardeners with limited space.",
    "**Sculpture Material**: Instead of throwing away old pens, use them as a medium for art. Break or cut the pens into various lengths and glue them together to create abstract sculptures. You can paint them or leave them in their original colors for a modern, colorful art piece. This not only recycles the pens but also allows for creative expression.",
    "**Thread Spool Holder**: If you're into sewing or crafting, use a pen to hold spools of thread. Simply insert the pen through the center of the spool, and it can be placed upright in a container or on your workspace. This keeps the thread from tangling and makes it easy to pull out the desired length without the spool rolling away.",
    "**Travel Toothpick**: In a pinch, a pen can be used as a makeshift toothpick. After cleaning it thoroughly, the hollow body can be used to hold a small piece of food or even a toothpick itself, which can be inserted into the pen's end. This can be especially handy during travel when you need to maintain oral hygiene without carrying extra tools.",
    "**Stabilizer for Plant Cuttings**: When propagating plants, a pen can serve as a stabilizer for cuttings. Insert the pen into the soil of a pot and then place the cutting alongside it. The pen will help keep the cutting upright while it develops roots, ensuring that it gets the necessary sunlight and water without toppling over."
