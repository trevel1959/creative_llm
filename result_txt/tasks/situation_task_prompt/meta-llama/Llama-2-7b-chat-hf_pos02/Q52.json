    "Fire-roasted Meal: In a world without cooking equipment, meals would need to be prepared using natural sources of heat and fuel. One option would be to use the sun, wind, or even body heat to cook food. For example, you could use a large metal or clay pot placed in the embers of a fire to cook a hearty stew or soup. As the food cooks, you could use a stick or rock to stir it occasionally, ensuring that it cooks evenly.",
    "Solar Oven: Another option for cooking without equipment would be to create a solar oven using a large, insulated box with a clear plastic or glass lid. You could line the inside of the box with a reflective material, such as aluminum foil or a mirror, to concentrate the sun's rays onto the food. You could then place the food inside the oven and wait for it to cook, using the sun's heat to warm the inside of the box. This method would be ideal for cooking lighter, more delicate dishes like fruits, vegetables, and grains.",
    "Bamboo Grill: Bamboo is a versatile and sustainable material that could be used to create a makeshift grill. You could construct a simple grill using bamboo skewers, weaving them together to form a square or rectangular shape. You could then place the grill over a fire or use it to cook food using a portable stove or camping stove. This method would be great for cooking meats, vegetables, and bread.",
    "DIY Smoker: If you have access to a few basic tools and some metal or clay pots, you could create a makeshift smoker using a combination of these materials. You could construct a simple box using the pots and pans, and then cover it with a lid made from a metal sheet or piece of wood. You could then place the food inside the smoker and cook it over a fire or using a portable stove. This method would be ideal for smoking meats, cheeses, and other foods that require a low and slow cooking process.",
