    "Smart Window AC: Create a window-mounted air conditioner that uses AI to adjust its cooling power based on the user's preferences and the ambient temperature. The unit would be equipped with sensors to monitor the room's temperature and humidity levels, and a smart interface to allow users to adjust the cooling power remotely using their smartphones.",
    "Portable Air Purifier: Design a portable air purifier that can be easily carried around the house or office. The device would use a combination of HEPA filters and UV light to remove pollutants and allergens from the air, and would come with a built-in fan for circulation.",
    "Self-Cooling Yoga Mat: Develop a yoga mat that can cool the user's body during exercise. The mat would be made of a special material that absorbs heat from the body and dissipates it through a built-in cooling system, providing a cooling effect during yoga practice.",
    "Air Conditioner with Built-In Humidifier: Create an air conditioner that also functions as a humidifier, providing both cooling and humidification in one device. The unit would use a built-in humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help to relieve dryness and discomfort during hot weather.",
    "Smart Ventilation System: Develop a smart ventilation system that can adjust the amount of air flow and temperature in a room based on the user's preferences and the ambient conditions. The system would use sensors and AI algorithms to optimize the ventilation and temperature in real-time, providing a more comfortable and healthy indoor environment."
