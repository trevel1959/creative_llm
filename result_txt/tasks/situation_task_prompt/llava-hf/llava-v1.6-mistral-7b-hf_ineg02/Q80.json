    "**Contactless Payments**: With the widespread use of smartphones, contactless payment technology would become even more prevalent. Smartphones can be used to make payments by simply tapping them on a contactless payment terminal. This technology is already widely used in many countries and would become even more essential in a cashless society.",
    "**Credit Cards with Biometric Security**: In a cashless society, credit cards with biometric security features, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, would become the norm. These cards would be used for in-store purchases, and the biometric data would be used to verify the identity of the cardholder.",
    "**Smart Wallets**: Smart wallets, which can store digital currencies, credit card information, and other forms of identification, would become ubiquitous. These devices would be used to make payments and authenticate transactions, replacing the need for physical wallets.",
    "**Mobile Apps**: Mobile apps would become the primary means of making payments. These apps would be used to link bank accounts, manage digital currencies, and facilitate payments. They would also offer features such as mobile banking, bill payments, and budgeting tools.",
    "**In-Store Barcode Scanners**: In-store barcode scanners would be used to facilitate payments. Customers would simply scan their smartphones or smart wallets at the checkout, and the transaction would be completed. This would eliminate the need for cashiers and speed up the checkout process."
