    "Solar-Powered Lighting: Install solar-powered lighting systems in homes, offices, and public spaces to provide a sustainable and reliable source of light. These systems can be installed on rooftops or in gardens, and can provide enough light for daily activities.",
    "Artificial Lighting: Develop advanced artificial lighting technologies that are more energy-efficient and can provide brighter light than traditional light bulbs. These technologies could include LED bulbs with adjustable brightness and color temperature, or even organic light-emitting diodes that mimic the natural light of the sun.",
    "Light-Reflecting Materials: Create materials that can reflect light, providing a more even and consistent source of illumination. These materials could be used for interior design, exterior architecture, or even for personal use in the form of light-reflecting clothing or accessories.",
    "Light-Generating Plants: Develop plants that can produce light, either through photosynthesis or through genetic engineering. These plants could be used to create natural lighting in homes, offices, or public spaces, reducing the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Develop mirrors that can reflect light, providing a more efficient and cost-effective source of illumination. These mirrors could be used in homes, offices, or public spaces, and could be designed to adjust the angle and intensity of the light depending on the user's needs."
