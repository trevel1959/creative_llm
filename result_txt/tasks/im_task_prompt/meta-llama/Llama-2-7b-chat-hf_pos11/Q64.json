    "Smartphone-Integrated Alarm System: Develop an alarm system that can be controlled and monitored through a smartphone app. This system would allow users to arm and disarm their homes remotely, receive notifications and alerts, and even view live footage from security cameras. The app could also integrate with popular smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, for added convenience.",
    "Motion-Activated Alarm System: Create an alarm system that uses motion sensors to detect potential intruders. When motion is detected, the system would emit a high-pitched alarm sound that is only audible to the intruder, making it difficult for them to determine the source of the noise. This would give homeowners a chance to investigate and address the issue before calling the authorities.",
    "Environmental Impact Alarm System: Develop an alarm system that takes into account the environmental impact of potential intruders. For example, if an intruder is detected in a room with a high concentration of hazardous materials, the system could emit a loud alarm and alert emergency services. This would not only protect the homeowner but also minimize the risk of environmental damage.",
    "Biometric Alarm System: Create an alarm system that uses biometric data to identify and alert homeowners of potential intruders. For example, the system could use facial recognition technology to identify an intruder and alert the homeowner via a smartphone app. This would provide an added layer of security and peace of mind for homeowners.",
    "Augmented Reality Alarm System: Develop an alarm system that uses augmented reality technology to display important information to homeowners. For example, if an intruder is detected, the system could display a virtual security camera feed on a smartphone or tablet, allowing homeowners to see exactly what is happening in their home. This would provide an added layer of security and convenience for homeowners."
