    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared is to switch to solar power. Vehicles could be equipped with solar panels on their bodies, which would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity to power their engines. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option is to switch to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which use hydrogen as a fuel source to generate electricity, producing only water and heat as byproducts. Hydrogen can be extracted from various sources, including seawater, and can be stored in tanks for use in vehicles. This technology has the potential to be more efficient and cleaner than traditional fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles could be powered by advanced batteries that are more efficient and have a longer range than current batteries. This would allow people to travel longer distances without needing to recharge, making electric vehicles a more practical option for long-distance travel. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Nuclear Powered Vehicles: Another option is to use nuclear power to generate electricity for vehicles. This would involve using small nuclear reactors in vehicles to produce electricity, which could then be used to power electric motors. This technology has the potential to provide a clean and efficient source of energy for vehicles. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bio-Electro-Chemical Fuel Cells: Bio-electro-chemical fuel cells use organic matter to generate electricity, which could be used to power vehicles. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to provide a clean and efficient source of energy for vehicles in the future. Confidence Score: 0.6"
