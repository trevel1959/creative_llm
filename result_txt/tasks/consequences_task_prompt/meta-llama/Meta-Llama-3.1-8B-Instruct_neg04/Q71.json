    "**The Weight of Eternity**: With immortality, people would no longer be bound by the same mortality-driven timeframes. They would have the luxury of taking risks, pursuing long-term projects, and making decisions without the pressure of a limited lifespan. However, this could lead to a lack of urgency, causing people to become complacent and stagnant. They might become overwhelmed by the sheer weight of centuries, centuries of memories, experiences, and relationships, leading to mental health issues, depression, and a sense of existential dread.",
