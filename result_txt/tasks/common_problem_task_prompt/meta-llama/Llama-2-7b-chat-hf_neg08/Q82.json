    "Budget constraints: Building a tiny house can be expensive, and if the budget is not managed properly, it may result in a home that is neither functional nor stylish. For example, cheap materials may be used that do not last long or are not durable.",
    "Limited space: Since tiny houses are, by definition, small, there may be limited space for storage or for living in general. This can lead to clutter and disorganization, making it difficult to live comfortably in the home.",
    "Zoning and building regulations: Depending on where the tiny house is located, there may be zoning laws that prohibit tiny houses or building regulations that make it difficult to construct one. This can cause delays or even prevent the construction of the tiny house altogether.",
    "Maintenance and repair: Since tiny houses are small, they may be more prone to damage or wear and tear, which can be difficult and expensive to repair. For example, a small leak in the roof can quickly become a big problem if not addressed promptly.",
    "Social isolation: Living in a tiny house can be isolating, especially if it is located in a remote area. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from the community."
