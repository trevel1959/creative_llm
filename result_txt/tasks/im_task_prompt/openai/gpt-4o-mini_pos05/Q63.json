    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create roller skates with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out components like wheels, frames, and boots. This would enable skaters to customize their skates for different terrains (indoor vs. outdoor), styles (speed vs. artistic), or even personal aesthetics. Users could have a base set of components and then mix and match according to their needs.",
    "**Adaptive Fit Technology**: Introduce roller skates with an adaptive fit feature that uses materials that mold to the shape of the wearerâ€™s foot over time. This could involve heat-sensitive materials or inflatable bladders that adjust to provide optimal comfort and support. A perfect fit would reduce the risk of blisters and enhance performance.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting System**: Enhance safety and style with roller skates that have built-in LED lights. These lights could be programmed to change colors based on speed or can be set to various patterns for aesthetic appeal. Additionally, a feature could allow the lights to flash in response to music beats, creating a synchronized light show while skating.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop roller skates made from sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include using recycled plastics, organic fabrics, and natural rubber for wheels. Not only would this reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing skates, but it could also appeal to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**All-Terrain Capability**: Innovate roller skates with interchangeable wheels designed for various surfaces. By creating wheels that can easily switch between hard surfaces and softer, more rugged terrains (like grass or gravel), skaters would have the freedom to explore diverse environments without needing separate pairs of skates."
