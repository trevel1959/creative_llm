    "**Human-Powered Transportation**: If all cars stopped working, people could rely on human-powered transportation methods such as bicycles, tricycles, or even rollerblades for shorter distances. This could lead to a resurgence of walking and cycling as primary modes of transportation, promoting health and environmental sustainability. ",
    "**Equestrian Routes**: Historically, many cities had horse-drawn carriages as a common mode of transport. With the sudden absence of motor vehicles, these routes could be revived. Cities could repurpose existing carriage paths into pedestrian and equestrian routes, allowing for a blend of old-world charm and modern eco-consciousness.",
    "**Inflatable Rafting**: For those in coastal or riverine areas, inflatable rafts could become a viable means of travel. These can be easily transported and set up, offering an adventurous way to cross bodies of water between cities. Safety measures like life jackets and navigation tools should be prioritized.",
    "**Human-Powered Watercrafts**: In addition to rafts, human-powered boats such as rowboats or pedal boats could be used for water travel. This not only allows for scenic journeys but also provides a form of exercise, promoting physical health.",
    "**Cable Cars and Ropeways**: In mountainous regions where roads are scarce, cable cars or ropeways could serve as an efficient means of transportation. These can be used to connect cities across valleys, offering spectacular views while minimizing the need for extensive road infrastructure. The technology could be enhanced with solar panels to make them sustainable. "
