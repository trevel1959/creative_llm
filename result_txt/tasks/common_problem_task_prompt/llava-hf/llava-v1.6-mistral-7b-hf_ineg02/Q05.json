    "Structural Integrity: The construction of a stable tree house on a living tree can be challenging. It requires careful planning, proper anchoring systems, and strong structural design to support the weight of the tree house and occupants. Failing to account for rot, pests, and the tree's growth patterns could lead to the tree house becoming unstable over time.",
    "Accessibility and Maintenance: Building a tree house can create accessibility issues, especially for elderly individuals or those with mobility challenges. Ensuring that there are safe means of access and that the tree house is easy to maintain, including regular inspections, will be crucial for a safe and functional tree house.",
    "Weather Damage: Considering the potential for severe weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rain, or lightning strikes, it is essential to use weather-resistant materials and install necessary protection mechanisms to prevent damage to the tree house or the tree it is built in.",
    "Wildlife Interactions: A tree house can attract wildlife, which could lead to problems like disturbance to local ecosystems or damage to the structure. Implementing wildlife deterrent measures and regularly monitoring wildlife activity near the tree house can mitigate these risks.",
    "Safety for Children: If the tree house will be used by children, measures should be in place to ensure their safety, including proper supervision during visits, safety equipment (like harnesses and helmets), and design elements that keep occupants safe, such as secure railings and safe play areas."
