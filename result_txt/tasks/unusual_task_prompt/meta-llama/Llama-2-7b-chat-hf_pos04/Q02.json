    "Virtual Reality Therapy: Utilize the rubber hand illusion to create a virtual reality therapy experience for individuals with phantom limb pain. By placing a rubber hand in front of a person's real hand, the brain will begin to perceive the rubber hand as their own. This can help alleviate pain and discomfort associated with phantom limb sensations.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Design an interactive art installation that incorporates the rubber hand illusion. Visitors can place their real hand in a sensory deprivation tank and watch as a robotic arm places a rubber hand in front of it. As the visitor's brain processes the illusion, the installation will respond by changing colors, lights, or sounds.",
    "Fitness Training: Develop a fitness training program that utilizes the rubber hand illusion to improve grip strength and dexterity. Participants will wear a special glove with a rubber hand attached, which will be used to perform various exercises and movements. As the participant's brain processes the illusion, the muscles in their real hand will be stimulated, improving grip strength and dexterity.",
    "Mindfulness Meditation: Create a mindfulness meditation program that incorporates the rubber hand illusion. Participants will place their real hand in a sensory deprivation tank and focus on the sensation of the rubber hand. As they meditate, the illusion will be used to help the participant become more aware of their body and the sensations within it.",
    "Sensory Deprivation Tanks: Design sensory deprivation tanks that incorporate the rubber hand illusion. The tanks will be used to deprive the senses of sight, sound, and touch, while the rubber hand illusion is used to create a sense of ownership and connection to the body.
