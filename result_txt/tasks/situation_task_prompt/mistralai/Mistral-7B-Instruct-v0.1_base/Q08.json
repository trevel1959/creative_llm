    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater in a large container or cistern and filtering it through a multi-stage filtration system to remove impurities and contaminants. This water can then be used for drinking, cooking, and other household purposes.",
    "Solar still: This is a simple device that uses solar energy to evaporate water from a contaminated source, leaving the impurities behind. The clean water can then be collected and used for consumption.",
    "Reverse osmosis: This is a filtration technology that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove contaminants from water. The process involves pushing water through the membrane under high pressure, which forces contaminants to stay on the other side.",
    "Bio-remediation: This involves using bacteria and other microorganisms to break down contaminants in water. The process involves adding beneficial bacteria to the water, which consume and break down harmful substances, leaving clean water behind.",
    "Water purification tablets: These are small, portable tablets that can be added to contaminated water to kill bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. The tablets arely dissolved in the water andlyly kill the contaminants, making the water safe to drink."
