The ritual could be accompanied by calming music or sounds, and the user could focus on their breath and visualize a peaceful scene to help them relax and fall asleep.",
    "Develop a new type of bedding: The user could create a new type of bedding that is specifically designed to promote sleep. This could include a mattress that conforms to the user's body shape, or a blanket that is made of a special material that regulates temperature and promotes relaxation. The user could also add a scent to their bedding, such as lavender or chamomile, to help them relax and fall asleep.",
    "Use natural light therapy: The user could use natural light therapy to help them fall asleep at night.

Additionally, the user could use a weighted blanket or a stress ball to help them feel grounded and calm."
