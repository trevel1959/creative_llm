    "Once in a vibrant meadow, there lived a horse named Zephyr, who was born with striking zebra stripes. While other horses pranced proudly in their solid coats, Zephyr felt different and often lonely. One day, a group of curious animals approached him, captivated by his unique appearance. They admired his stripes, believing they brought him special powers. Inspired, Zephyr began to embrace his uniqueness, leading the other animals in playful games and adventures. As the sun set, casting a golden hue on the meadow, Zephyr realized that being different was a gift, and he had found his place among friends.",
