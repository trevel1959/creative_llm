    "Solar-powered panels: If the sky were always cloudy, we could install solar-powered panels to generate our own electricity. This would provide us with the energy we need to power our homes and devices, without relying on sunlight.",
    "Artificial lighting: Another option would be to install artificial lighting in our homes and workplaces. This would provide us with the light we need to see and work, without relying on natural sunlight.",
    "Light-emitting plants: We could also grow light-emitting plants in our homes and workplaces. These plants emit light through a process called bioluminescence, which means they can provide us with a natural source of light even when the sky is cloudy.",
    "Solar-powered windows: We could also install solar-powered windows in our homes and workplaces. These windows use thin films of semiconductor materials to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity.",
    "Light-emitting building materials: We could also use light-emitting building materials in the construction of our homes and workplaces. These materials emit light through a process called photoluminescence, which means they can provide us with a natural source of light even when the sky is cloudy."
