    "Solar Still: A solar still is a device that uses solar energy to evaporate water from saline or contaminated water sources and then collects the condensed water for drinking. This device could be used to collect water from the ground or from contaminated sources, providing a clean and safe drinking water supply.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting Roof: A rainwater harvesting roof could be installed on the building. This would involve creating a waterproof membrane on the roof that would collect rainwater and direct it into a storage tank. The water could then be used for various purposes such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning.",
    "Desalination Plant: A small-scale desalination plant could be set up to remove salt and other impurities from seawater. This plant would use a process called reverse osmosis to filter out the salt and other contaminants, leaving behind clean drinking water.",
    "Aquaponics System: An aquaponics system could be used to grow plants and fish in a controlled environment. The fish would produce water that could be used for various purposes, such as drinking and cooking, while the plants would help filter and purify the water.",
    "Groundwater Extraction: Groundwater extraction could be used to collect water from underground sources. This would involve drilling a well and pumping the water to the surface for use. This method would require a significant investment in drilling equipment and pumping systems."
