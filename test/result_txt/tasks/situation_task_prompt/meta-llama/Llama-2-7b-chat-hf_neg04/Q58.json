    "Insect Hotels: To deal with the absence of animals, including insects, we could create artificial habitats that mimic their natural environments. Insect hotels, for instance, are structures made of various materials like wood, bamboo, or even cardboard boxes, that provide shelter and protection for insects. These hotels could be placed in gardens, parks, or even indoor spaces, offering a safe haven for insects to thrive.",
    "Insect-Friendly Gardens: By incorporating insect-friendly plants and flowers, we can create gardens that attract and support insect populations. For example, planting marigolds, lavender, and dill can attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies, while herbs like basil and mint can repel pests like mosquitoes and ants. This approach would not only help maintain a balance in the ecosystem but also provide a sustainable food source for humans.",
    "Bioluminescent Insect Repellents: Researchers have discovered bioluminescent organisms like fireflies and certain species of fungi that emit light without consuming energy. By harnessing these organisms, we could create natural repellents that deter insects without harming them. For instance, we could cultivate fireflies in controlled environments and extract their bioluminescent properties to create a non-toxic, eco-friendly repellent for insects.",
    "Insect-Inspired Robotics: Inspired by the biology and behavior of insects, we could develop robotics that mimic their capabilities. For example, we could create swarm robotics that use collective intelligence to navigate and adapt to their environment, much like how ants communicate and work together. These robots could be used for search and rescue missions, environmental monitoring, or even agricultural applications.",
    "Insect-Based Food Systems: Instead of relying solely on livestock for food, we could explore the potential of insects as a sustainable and nutritious source of protein. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are already consumed in many cultures around the world and have a lower environmental impact than traditional livestock. By"
