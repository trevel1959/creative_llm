    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Create an inflatable pillow that can be easily inflated before use. The pillow can be made of a durable, lightweight material such as nylon or silicone. It can be designed to be compact for easy storage and travel. To use it, simply inflate the pillow to the desired level of firmness before placing it under your head. This allows for a comfortable rest while also providing support.",
    "**Water Pillow**: Use a large water-filled bag as a pillow. This method is similar to using a bean bag chair, but instead of beans, it's filled with water. The water can be adjusted to different levels by adding or removing water, making it customizable for individual comfort preferences. It can also be shaped into various forms, like a U-shape for side sleepers or a flat surface for stomach sleepers.",
    "**Foam Rollers**: Utilize foam rollers, commonly used in exercise routines, as makeshift pillows. These can provide firm support and help align your spine while sleeping. You can place them under your neck, head, or even between your knees for added comfort. Foam rollers are often made from durable materials that resist wear and tear, making them suitable for long-term use.",
    "**Inflatable Lounger**: Design an inflatable lounger that can be used as a resting spot for the head. This lounger would have a backrest and a raised platform for the head. The lounger could be inflated using a small pump or by blowing air into it manually. It would provide ample support for the head and neck, promoting relaxation during sleep.",
    "**Customized Body Pillow**: Create a body pillow that can be tailored to fit around the body, providing support for the head and neck. This pillow could be made from memory foam or another soft, conforming material. It would be adjustable in length and width, allowing individuals to customize the pillow to their specific needs. The pillow could also be segmented, with different sections designed for the head, neck, and shoulders, offering targeted support where needed."
