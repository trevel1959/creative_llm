    "**Utilizing Atmospheric Pressure Patterns:** Without clouds, the primary means of predicting weather changes would rely on atmospheric pressure patterns. High-pressure systems are generally associated with clear skies and stable conditions, while low-pressure systems often bring in storms or other forms of precipitation. By monitoring changes in air pressure and tracking their movements, meteorologists could predict future weather conditions.",
    "**Sensing Solar Radiation Levels:** Another approach would be to measure solar radiation levels. Clear skies allow more sunlight to reach the Earth's surface, leading to higher solar radiation levels. By monitoring these levels over time, we can infer whether the weather is likely to remain sunny or if a change in weather patterns might occur. This method could also help in estimating temperature changes and cloud formation potential.",
    "**Analyzing Wind Patterns and Speeds:** Clouds play a significant role in wind patterns due to their interaction with air currents. Without clouds, the direction and speed of winds could be monitored directly to predict weather changes. Strong, consistent winds could indicate an oncoming storm or high-pressure system, while changes in wind patterns might suggest a shift in the weather.",
    "**Tracking Earth's Magnetic Field Variations:** Changes in the Earth's magnetic field can sometimes correlate with weather events, including storms. By analyzing fluctuations in the magnetic field, scientists might be able to predict upcoming weather conditions without relying on traditional cloud observation methods. This approach would require sophisticated equipment for continuous monitoring and data analysis.",
    "**Monitoring Sea Surface Temperatures and Ocean Currents:** Oceanic conditions significantly influence weather patterns, especially in coastal areas. Without clouds to obscure them, observing sea surface temperatures and ocean currents could provide insights into potential weather changes. For example, warmer sea temperatures might suggest a high-pressure system moving in, while cold temperatures could indicate a low-pressure system or storm activity."
