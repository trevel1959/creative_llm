    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be inflated to the desired level of softness or firmness before use. It can be filled with air using a small pump, allowing it to be compact for storage when not in use. This concept offers flexibility in comfort levels and convenience.",
    "**Memory Foam Wedge**: Create a wedge-shaped memory foam pillow that can be placed under the knees or at the base of the neck to provide support and alignment while sleeping. This can help alleviate discomfort caused by misalignment of the spine during sleep.",
    "**Customizable Pillow Shell**: Develop a pillow shell made from durable material like waterproof nylon, which can be stuffed with various materials like rice, beans, or buckwheat hulls. The user can adjust the stuffing according to their preferred comfort level, making it adaptable for different sleeping positions and personal preferences.",
    "**Hybrid Pillow with Removable Inserts**: Combine a traditional pillow with removable inserts of varying densities or materials. The top layer could be a softer, fluffier material, while the bottom layer could be firmer or more supportive. This allows the user to customize the pillow's feel as needed.",
    "**Wearable Pillow**: Design a wearable pillow that can be worn around the neck or shoulders while sleeping. It would provide continuous support and comfort without the need for a traditional pillow. The pillow could be attached to a wearable device that adjusts its pressure based on the wearer's movements or body position, ensuring constant comfort throughout the night. "
