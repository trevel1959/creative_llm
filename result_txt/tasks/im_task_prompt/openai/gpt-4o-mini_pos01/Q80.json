    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Sensor**: Create a whisk with an ergonomic handle that includes grip sensors. This feature would detect how tightly the user is holding the whisk and adjust the motorized whisking speed accordingly. If the user is whisking vigorously, the whisk could speed up, while a gentle grip would slow it down, providing optimal control and reducing strain on the wrist.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Develop a whisk made from a special non-stick material that has self-cleaning properties. After use, the whisk could be placed in a dishwasher-like base that uses ultrasonic waves and gentle water jets to clean the whisk's wires and handle, eliminating the need for manual scrubbing and making cleanup a breeze.",
    "**Interchangeable Heads for Different Tasks**: Introduce a whisk with interchangeable heads designed for various tasks, such as a balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for sauces, and a spiral whisk for emulsifying. The handle would feature a quick-release mechanism that allows users to swap heads easily, making it a versatile tool for all types of cooking.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Recipe Guide**: Create a whisk that comes with a small digital recipe guide embedded in the handle. This guide could feature a touchscreen interface that provides users with step-by-step instructions for different recipes, including whisking techniques, timing, and ingredient ratios. It would be particularly useful for novice cooks who may need guidance.",
    "**Color-Changing Whisk**: Design a whisk made from heat-sensitive materials that change color based on the temperature of the mixture being whisked. For example, if the mixture is too hot, the whisk could turn red, indicating that the user should let it cool down before whisking. This feature would help prevent cooking mishaps and ensure better control over the cooking process."
