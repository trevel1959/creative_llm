    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**: Develop shopping carts made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, design the carts to be modular, allowing customers to add or remove sections based on their shopping needs. This could reduce the overall weight and carbon footprint of the cart while promoting eco-conscious shopping.",
    "**Mobile App Integration**: Create a mobile app that syncs with the shopping cart. The app could provide personalized shopping lists, store maps, and item locations, guiding customers through the store. Shoppers could also receive notifications about discounts on items they frequently purchase or suggestions for complementary products, enhancing their shopping experience.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cart**: Design a shopping cart that can easily transform into a carrier for groceries. This could include collapsible compartments that allow for easy storage and transport of items, such as a cooler section for perishables. Additionally, the cart could feature a detachable basket that can be used as a tote for quick trips, making it more versatile for various shopping scenarios.",
    "**Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features into shopping carts, such as a child safety harness and an adjustable seat for toddlers. The cart could also have a built-in alert system that notifies the parent when a child unbuckles or stands up. This would ensure a safer shopping experience for families and peace of mind for parents.",
    "**Self-Driving Carts**: Implement autonomous technology in shopping carts, allowing them to follow customers around the store. Using sensors and cameras, these carts could navigate aisles, avoiding obstacles and other shoppers. This would allow customers to focus on their shopping without the hassle of pushing a cart, making the experience more enjoyable."
