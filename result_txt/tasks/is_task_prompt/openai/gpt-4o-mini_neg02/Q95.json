    "In the heart of the jungle, there lived a mighty tiger named Raj. Despite his fearsome roar and majestic stripes, Raj had a secret: he was terrified of mice. Every time a tiny mouse scurried by, he would leap onto the nearest rock, his heart racing. One day, while hiding from a particularly bold mouse, he met a wise old owl who advised him to face his fears. Gathering his courage, Raj approached the mouse, only to find it was just as scared of him. They both laughed, realizing that sometimes, the biggest fears come from the smallest creatures. From that day on, Raj learned to embrace his fears, and he and the mouse became the unlikeliest of friends.",
