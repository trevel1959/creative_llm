    "Floating Cities: One creative solution to living in a drastically changed ocean environment would be to build floating cities. These cities would be designed to float on the water, providing a stable and safe living space for those who have lost their land-based homes. The cities could be made up of interconnected modules, each one providing a different function such as housing, food production, and recreation. The modules could be designed to be easily movable, allowing the city to adapt to changing ocean conditions.",
    "Underwater Bases: Another option for surviving a drastic rise in ocean levels would be to build underwater bases. These bases could be designed to mimic the structure of an underwater cave system, with rooms and corridors carved out of the rock. The bases could be equipped with all the necessary amenities, including life support systems, food production, and communication equipment. The underwater location would provide a natural barrier against the rising waters, protecting the inhabitants from the harsh conditions on the surface.",
    "Aquatic Habitats: For those who are not interested in living in a city or base, an alternative solution could be to create aquatic habitats. These habitats could be designed to mimic the natural environment of the ocean, providing a safe and comfortable living space for humans and other marine life. The habitats could be built using advanced materials that are durable and flexible, allowing them to withstand the harsh conditions of the ocean. They could also be equipped with advanced life support systems, ensuring that the inhabitants have access to clean air, water, and food.",
    "Artificial Islands: Another creative solution to the problem of a drastic rise in ocean levels would be to create artificial islands. These islands could be built using advanced materials and technologies, providing a stable and safe living space for those who have lost their homes. The islands could be designed to mimic the natural environment, with beaches, forests, and other ecosystems. They could also be equipped with advanced life support systems, ensuring that the inhabitants have access to clean air, water, and food.",
    "Ocean-Friendly Architecture: Finally, a more unconventional solution to living in a drastically changed ocean environment could be to design buildings and structures that are specifically adapted to the ocean environment. This could involve using materials and technologies that are durable and"
