    "**Poor character development**: Another potential problem is the lack of well-developed characters. Flat or underdeveloped characters can lead to a lack of emotional investment from the audience, making it difficult to care about the story. The writer should focus on creating characters with depth, backstory, and motivations that drive the plot forward.",
    "**Unrealistic dialogue**: Incorporating realistic and natural dialogue is crucial for believability. If the dialogue sounds forced or unnatural, it can take the audience out of the story. The writer should work on creating dialogue that reflects the characters' personalities and the context of the scene.",
    "**Inconsistent pacing**: A screenplay with inconsistent pacing can make it difficult for the audience to stay engaged. The writer should pay attention to the structure of the story, ensuring that there is a balance between action, dialogue, and exposition. This can help create a more cohesive and engaging narrative.",
    "**Clichéd plot devices**: Overusing clichéd plot devices can make a screenplay feel predictable and unoriginal. The writer should strive to create unique and original plot twists and character arcs to keep the audience guessing.",
    "**Inadequate world-building**: If the screenplay takes place in a fictional world, it's essential to establish the rules and boundaries of that world. This can include creating a consistent backstory, establishing the social and political structures, and defining the laws of physics and magic (if applicable)."
