    "Invent a bug-repelling garden: Create a garden that utilizes natural elements to repel insects. For example, planting mint, basil, and lemongrass can keep pests away. Add a layer of mulch made from crushed eggshells or cinnamon to further deter insects.",
    "Develop a robotic pest control system: Design a robot that can navigate through the environment and detect insects using sensors. Once detected, the robot can use a non-toxic spray or ultrasonic frequency to repel the insects. This system can be integrated into a smart home automation system for easy use.",
    "Harness the power of sound: Create a sound wave-based pest control system that emits a high-frequency sound wave that is undetectable to humans but unpleasant for insects. This technology can be integrated into a home's sound system or a portable device that can be placed in areas where insects are present.",
    "Create a genetically engineered bug-repelling fungus: Genetically modify a fungus to produce a toxin that repels insects. This fungus can be applied to soil or plant surfaces to create a barrier against pests. This method is eco-friendly and can be used in agriculture to protect crops.",
    "Develop a pest-repelling skin treatment: Create a topical cream or spray that contains natural oils and essential oils that repel insects. This treatment can be applied to the skin to prevent insect bites and stings. The cream can also be used on clothing and gear to prevent pests from infesting these items."
