    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One potential solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to transition to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with solar panels on their bodies, which would convert sunlight into electricity to power their engines. This would provide a clean and renewable source of energy, reducing the world's reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option would be to switch to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles would use hydrogen as a fuel source, which would be converted into electricity through a fuel cell. The only byproduct of this process would be water vapor and heat, making it an extremely clean and efficient source of energy. Additionally, the infrastructure for hydrogen fueling stations is already in place in many parts of the world, making it a more practical solution than building a new infrastructure for solar-powered vehicles.",
    "Electric Bikes and Scooters: A third option would be to encourage the use of electric bikes and scooters. These vehicles are already becoming increasingly popular in many cities around the world, and they offer a convenient and efficient way to get around without relying on fossil fuels. By investing in electric bike and scooter charging infrastructure, we could encourage even more people to switch to these environmentally friendly modes of transportation.",
    "Advanced Battery Technologies: Another creative solution would be to invest in advanced battery technologies that could store more energy and charge faster. This would enable vehicles to travel longer distances without needing to stop and recharge, making them more practical for long-distance travel. For example, solid-state batteries have the potential to store more energy and charge faster than traditional lithium-ion batteries, making them a promising alternative for powering vehicles.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Vehicles: Finally, we could explore the use of nuclear power to fuel vehicles. While this may seem like a controversial option, nuclear power is a clean and efficient source of energy that could potentially be used to generate electricity for vehicles. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels altogether, making it a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option. However, there are still many safety and logistical concerns that would need to be"
