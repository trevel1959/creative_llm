    "**Historic and Listed Buildings**: Traditional or historic buildings might face a number of issues when it comes to solar panel installation. Many of these structures may have complex roofing structures, or the use of materials that are not compatible with solar panel installation. This could significantly slow down the installation process and potentially increase costs.",
    "**Shade and Building Orientation**: Homes with trees or other tall structures may receive significant shade, which can negatively impact the efficiency of solar panels. Building orientation is also crucial: solar panel performance is best when they are facing directly at sunrise or sunset. Homes with unoptimal orientations might require larger solar arrays to compensate for inefficient facing angles.",
    "**Accessibility for Repair and Maintenance**: Solar panel installations should be easily accessible for repair and maintenance. However, in some cities with narrow streets, this might be a challenge. The installation of utility poles or other structures to facilitate repair may require additional permits and planning.",
    "**Local Climate Conditions**: Installing solar panels in areas with very cold or very hot climates could affect their performance. Extreme temperatures can cause solar panels to expand and contract, potentially damaging the roof, mounts, or the solar cells themselves. Furthermore, cleaning and maintenance tasks may become more difficult in climates with heavy snowfall or storms.",
    "**Cost of Solar Panels and Installation**: Despite the potential for cost savings over time, solar panels and installation can be expensive upfront. Homeowners in lower-income areas may not be able to afford these costs, creating a gap in participation."
