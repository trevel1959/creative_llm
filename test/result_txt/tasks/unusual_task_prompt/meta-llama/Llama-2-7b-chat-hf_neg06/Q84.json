    "Smart Trash Can: A smart trash can that can detect the type of waste and sort it automatically. The trash can will have a built-in sensor that can identify different types of waste, such as plastic, paper, and organic waste. Once the waste is sorted, the can will automatically compact the waste and seal it to prevent odors and pests. This will make it easier for households and offices to recycle more efficiently.",
    "Trash Can with a Built-In Composter: A trash can that has a built-in composter, allowing users to turn their food waste into nutrient-rich compost. The composter will use a combination of heat and moisture to break down the waste, and the resulting compost can be used in gardens or potted plants. This will reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and provide a valuable resource for gardening.",
    "Trash Can with a Built-In Water Filter: A trash can with a built-in water filter, allowing users to purify water from any source. The filter will use a combination of activated carbon and UV light to remove impurities from the water, making it safe to drink. This will be especially useful in areas where clean drinking water is scarce or contaminated.",
    "Trash Can with a Built-In Power Bank: A trash can with a built-in power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. The power bank will use the trash can's compacted waste to generate electricity, providing a convenient and sustainable source of power. This will be especially useful for campers, travelers, and those in areas without access to electricity.",
    "Trash Can with a Built-In Air Purifier: A trash can with a built-in air purifier, allowing users to breathe cleaner air. The air purifier will use a combination of HEPA filters and UV light to remove pollutants and allergens from the air, improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of respiratory problems. This will be especially useful for people with allergies or asthma, and for those living in areas with high levels of air pollution."
