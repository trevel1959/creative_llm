    "**Portable Cloud Umbrella**: Develop a portable, wearable umbrella that uses advanced materials to mimic the cooling effect of clouds. This umbrella would have a unique mesh design that allows for airflow while providing shade, keeping the wearer cool even in direct sunlight. The umbrella would also be equipped with a built-in misting system, releasing a fine spray of water to further cool the wearer.",
    "**Shade-Generating Window Film**: Create a revolutionary window film that can change its transparency and reflectivity in response to temperature changes. In hot weather, the film would become opaque, blocking out sunlight and providing shade. In cooler weather, the film would become transparent, allowing natural light to enter the building. This film could be applied to windows, cars, and even outdoor furniture.",
    "**Solar-Reflecting Canopies**: Design a series of interconnected, solar-reflecting canopies that can be deployed in public spaces. These canopies would be made from a lightweight, durable material that can reflect up to 90% of sunlight, providing shade and reducing the urban heat island effect. The canopies could be powered by solar panels, making them a sustainable solution.",
    "**Personal Shade Pods**: Develop a line of portable, inflatable shade pods that can be set up in minutes. These pods would be made from a lightweight, waterproof material and would provide a comfortable, private space for individuals to escape the sun. Each pod would be equipped with a built-in cooling system, ensuring a comfortable temperature even in extreme heat.",
    "**Smart Street Furniture**: Design a line of smart street furniture that incorporates shading solutions. For example, a smart bench could have a built-in canopy that adjusts its angle and transparency based on the time of day and weather conditions. This furniture would not only provide shade but also serve as a hub for community engagement, with built-in charging stations, Wi-Fi, and interactive displays. [/INST] "
