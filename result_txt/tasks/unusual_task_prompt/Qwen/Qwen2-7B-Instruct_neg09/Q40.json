This project could also incorporate elements of nutrition education, allowing users to learn about the health benefits of certain ingredients.",

This project combines education with storytelling and creative writing.",
    "**Virtual Garden**: Design an interactive virtual garden where users grow plants from seeds to full-grown specimens.
