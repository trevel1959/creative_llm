    "The Mountain That Loved to Dance stood tall and proud, its peaks glistening under the sun. Every spring, as the flowers bloomed, the mountain would sway gently, creating a symphony of rustling leaves and cascading waterfalls. The animals gathered below, mesmerized by the rhythm of its movements. One day, a curious little fox climbed to the summit, asking, “Why do you dance?” The Mountain smiled, “I dance to celebrate life, to honor the seasons, and to bring joy to those who watch.” Inspired, the fox invited all the creatures to join in a grand celebration, and together, they danced until the stars twinkled above.",
