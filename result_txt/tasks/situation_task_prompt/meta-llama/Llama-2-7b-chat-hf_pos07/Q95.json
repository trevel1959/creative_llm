    "Use a cloud: If all pillows were to disappear, one creative solution would be to use a cloud as a makeshift pillow. Imagine a special cloud-making machine that could create a fluffy, soft, and supportive cloud that could be placed under your head for a comfortable rest. This cloud could be customized to your preferred firmness and could even be equipped with a built-in cooling or heating system for optimal comfort.",
    "Inflatable pillow: Another idea would be to create an inflatable pillow that could be easily inflated and deflated as needed. This pillow could be made of a lightweight, flexible material that could be easily inflated with a hand pump or even a specialized inflation device. The inflatable pillow could be customized to different firmness levels and could even come with a built-in cooling or heating system for added comfort.",
    "Memory foam blocks: For a more sustainable solution, you could create a set of memory foam blocks that could be used to create a makeshift pillow. These blocks could be made of a high-quality, eco-friendly material that would provide the same level of comfort and support as a traditional pillow. The blocks could be stacked and arranged in different configurations to create a customizable pillow that could be adjusted to your preferred firmness level.",
    "Magnetic pillow: If you're looking for a more futuristic solution, you could create a magnetic pillow that uses magnetic fields to provide support and comfort. This pillow could be made of a specialized material that contains magnetic particles, which would be attracted to the magnetic fields in your body, providing a comfortable and supportive rest. The magnetic pillow could also come with a built-in cooling or heating system for added comfort.",
    "3D-printed pillow: For a more high-tech solution, you could create a 3D-printed pillow that could be customized to your specific needs. This pillow could be made of a specialized material that is both comfortable and supportive, and could be customized to your preferred firmness level. The 3D-printed pillow could also come with built-in cooling or heating elements, as well as other features such as a built-in alarm or aromatherapy."
