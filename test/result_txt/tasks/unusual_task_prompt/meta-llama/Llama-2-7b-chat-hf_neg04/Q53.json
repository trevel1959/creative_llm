    "Virtual Keyboard: Develop a virtual keyboard that uses augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) technology to project a full-sized keyboard onto a flat surface, allowing users to type without a physical keyboard. This innovative keyboard could be particularly useful for people with disabilities or those who prefer a more immersive typing experience.",
    "Smart Keyboard: Create a keyboard that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities, allowing it to adapt to the user's typing style and preferences. The keyboard could learn the user's habits and suggest corrections, improve typing speed and accuracy, and even offer personalized suggestions for words and phrases based on the user's past inputs.",
    "Customizable Keyboard: Develop a keyboard that allows users to customize the layout and function of the keys. Users could choose from a variety of pre-designed layouts or create their own custom layouts using a built-in editor. This would allow users to tailor the keyboard to their specific needs and preferences, such as creating a keyboard specifically for gaming or programming.",
    "Keyboard with Built-In Trackpad: Design a keyboard that incorporates a built-in trackpad, allowing users to navigate and control their computer without the need for a separate mouse. This could be particularly useful for people who prefer a more streamlined and intuitive typing experience, or for those who frequently use their keyboard to navigate and control their computer.",
    "Haptic Feedback Keyboard: Create a keyboard that provides haptic feedback, allowing users to feel tactile sensations as they type. This could take the form of vibrations, texture changes, or even temperature changes, and could be particularly useful for people who are visually impaired or have difficulty typing due to hand or finger dexterity issues. The haptic feedback could also enhance the typing experience for able-bodied users, providing a more immersive and engaging typing experience."
