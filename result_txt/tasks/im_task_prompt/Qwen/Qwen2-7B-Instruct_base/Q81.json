    "**Creative Cooking Tool**: Create a multi-functional spatula that can flip pancakes, spread butter or jam, scrape the bottom of pots, and even serve as a ladle for soups. The design could include different ends with various functions to simplify cooking tasks. This idea is original because it combines multiple tools into one, saving space in the kitchen and reducing clutter.",
    "**Interactive Baking Spatula**: Design a spatula that lights up when used on a smart kitchen scale. The light could indicate the amount of batter or dough being measured, helping inexperienced bakers understand portion sizes more easily. It also has an app that suggests recipes based on ingredients detected by the spatula's sensors. This idea merges technology with everyday kitchen tools in a unique way.",
    "**Heated Spatula for Cold Weather Cooking**: Develop a spatula with a built-in heating element that keeps food warm while serving or transferring dishes from stove to plate. This is particularly useful in cold climates where traditional serving utensils might not keep food warm. The handle could have a temperature indicator and be rechargeable via USB, making it eco-friendly.",
    "**Garden Spatula**: Create a versatile tool that doubles as a garden trowel. The design could have a replaceable blade that switches between spatula and trowel depending on the userâ€™s needs. This would be beneficial for those who have limited space in their kitchen and garden, offering convenience in both culinary and gardening tasks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bamboo Spatula**: Produce a set of spatulas made entirely from sustainable bamboo, which is renewable and biodegradable. The spatulas could come in various sizes and colors, and be designed with ergonomic shapes for different tasks like flipping pancakes, spreading condiments, or stirring sauces. This idea promotes environmental responsibility and encourages sustainable living. "
