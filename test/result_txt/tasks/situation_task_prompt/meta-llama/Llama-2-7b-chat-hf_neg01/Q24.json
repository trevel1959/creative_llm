    "Utilize Technology: With the absence of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on technological advancements to enhance their vision. For instance, they could use smart contact lenses that have built-in cameras and artificial intelligence to zoom in on objects, recognize faces, and detect potential hazards. These lenses could also provide virtual displays that project information onto their field of vision, such as text messages, directions, or even virtual guides for navigating unfamiliar environments.",
    "Embrace Natural Vision: People with poor vision could learn to rely on their other senses to navigate and interact with their surroundings. For example, they could use their sense of touch to identify objects and navigate through spaces, or their sense of hearing to detect potential hazards or locate people. This could also lead to a greater appreciation for the natural world and a more immersive experience of the environment.",
    "Develop New Social Dynamics: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, social dynamics could shift as people with poor vision form close-knit communities to support one another. They could establish a new etiquette of communication, such as using hand gestures or facial expressions to convey meaning, or developing a system of visual cues to help them navigate shared spaces. This could lead to a more empathetic and inclusive society.",
    "Reimagine Education: Without glasses or contact lenses, educational institutions could adapt their teaching methods to accommodate students with poor vision. For instance, they could use 3D printing technology to create tactile diagrams or models that students could touch and explore, or develop virtual reality simulations that allow students to interact with complex concepts in a more immersive way. This could lead to a more accessible and engaging learning environment.",
    "Explore New Artistic Expressions: The loss of glasses and contact lenses could inspire new artistic expressions and mediums. Artists with poor vision could use their other senses to create art, such as tactile installations that respond to touch or sound sculptures that vibrate with different frequencies. They could also explore new forms of storytelling, such as tactile graphic novels or audio-only narratives that rely on sound effects and music to convey meaning. This could lead to a more diverse and inclusive art world."
