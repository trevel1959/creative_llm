    "Smart Grids: The city would be equipped with smart grids that can efficiently manage energy consumption and production. These grids would use sensors and algorithms to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time, reducing waste and improving overall efficiency.",
    "Vertical Farms: With limited land available, vertical farms would be built on the sides of buildings, allowing for year-round cultivation of crops without requiring arable land. This would not only provide fresh produce to the city's residents but also reduce transportation costs associated with importing food from other regions.",
    "Autonomous Transportation: Self-driving cars and buses would be the norm in the city, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. These vehicles would communicate with each other and with traffic signals to optimize routes and reduce travel time.",
    "Green Spaces: The city would be designed with ample green spaces, including parks, gardens, and rooftop terraces. These areas would provide residents with opportunities for exercise and relaxation, while also helping to mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve air quality.",
    "Sustainable Water Management: The city would implement sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and wastewater treatment. This would help to conserve water resources and reduce the impact of the city on the environment."
