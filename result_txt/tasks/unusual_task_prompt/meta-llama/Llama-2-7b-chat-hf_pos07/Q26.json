    "Create a smart tennis ball that tracks the player's performance and provides real-time feedback on their technique, speed, and accuracy. This tennis ball could be equipped with sensors and a small computer chip that collects data and transmits it to a mobile app for analysis and feedback.",
    "Develop a tennis ball that changes color based on the temperature of the court. This tennis ball would be made of a special material that changes color as the temperature of the court changes, providing an easy way for players to determine if the court is at the optimal temperature for play.",
    "Invent a tennis ball that generates electricity when hit. This tennis ball would be made of a special material that harnesses the energy of the ball's impact and converts it into electricity, which could be used to power small devices such as a tennis court's lighting system or even a player's electronic devices.",
    "Create a tennis ball that can be used in zero-gravity conditions. This tennis ball would be designed to float and bounce properly in zero-gravity environments, such as on a space station or in a zero-gravity training facility.",
    "Design a tennis ball that can be used underwater. This tennis ball would be made of a special material that can withstand the pressure of water and allow the ball to bounce and float properly in a swimming pool or other body of water."
