    "**Adaptive Suspension System**:    Introduce a smart suspension system that automatically adjusts based on the terrain. Using sensors, the system could detect bumps, potholes, or smooth paths and modify the suspension settings in real-time. This would provide a smoother ride on various surfaces, enhancing comfort and control for the rider.",
    "**Solar-Powered Battery Pack**:    Equip bicycles with a lightweight solar panel integrated into the frame or a detachable battery pack that can be charged via solar energy. This could power lights, GPS, and other electronic devices, ensuring that cyclists have enough energy for long rides without worrying about battery life.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**:    Create a modular bicycle design that allows users to easily swap out components such as the frame, wheels, and accessories. This would enable cyclists to customize their bikes for different activities, such as commuting, mountain biking, or racing, by simply changing parts rather than purchasing a new bike.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Helmet**:    Develop a smart helmet that uses augmented reality to display essential information directly in the rider's line of sight. This could include speed, distance traveled, navigation prompts, and even hazard alerts. The helmet could also feature a built-in camera for recording rides and sharing experiences on social media.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**:    Shift towards sustainability by creating bicycles from biodegradable materials or recycled plastics. This could include using hemp fibers for the frame or bioplastics for components. Additionally, a design that minimizes the use of metal could reduce the carbon footprint of production while still ensuring durability and performance."
