    "**Aesthetic Concerns**: Some homeowners may be resistant to installing solar panels due to aesthetic preferences. Solar panels can alter the appearance of a home, and neighborhoods with strict architectural guidelines may face challenges in getting approvals for installations. This could lead to conflicts between homeowners and local authorities regarding design regulations.",
    "**Initial Cost and Financing**: Although solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be a barrier for many homeowners. Not everyone can afford the upfront costs, and financing options may not be accessible or favorable. This could create a divide between wealthier homeowners who can afford solar installations and those who cannot.",
    "**Energy Storage Limitations**: The effectiveness of solar panels can be compromised without adequate energy storage solutions. Homeowners may struggle with battery systems that are either too expensive or not efficient enough to store energy for nighttime use or cloudy days. This could lead to dissatisfaction with solar energy's reliability and performance.",
    "**Maintenance and Upkeep**: Homeowners may underestimate the ongoing maintenance required for solar panels, such as cleaning and periodic inspections. If panels are not maintained properly, their efficiency can decline, leading to lower energy savings and potential frustration among homeowners who expected consistent performance.",
    "**Grid Integration Issues**: A large-scale installation of solar panels across a city could overwhelm the existing electrical grid infrastructure. This could lead to issues such as grid instability, power surges, or outages if the grid is not adequately upgraded to handle the influx of decentralized energy generation."
