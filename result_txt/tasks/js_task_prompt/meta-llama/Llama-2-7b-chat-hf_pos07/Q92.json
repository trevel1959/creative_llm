    "A Hexagonal Solar System: In this redesign, the solar system would be arranged into a hexagonal shape, with the Sun at the center and six equally spaced planets forming the sides of the hexagon. Each planet would have a unique orbit and rotation, creating a dynamic and visually striking arrangement. The hexagonal shape would also allow for more efficient use of space, as the planets would be closer together and able to interact more frequently.",
    "A Tetrahedral Solar System: In this design, the solar system would be reimagined as a tetrahedron, with the Sun at the center and four planets forming the vertices of the tetrahedron. This arrangement would create a more stable and harmonious system, as the planets would be better aligned and in a more balanced position. The tetrahedral shape would also allow for more efficient energy transfer between the planets, as they would be able to share energy more easily.",
    "A Rotating Solar System: In this redesign, the solar system would be arranged in a rotating disk shape, with the Sun at the center and the planets spaced out evenly around the edge of the disk. As the planets orbit around the Sun, they would also rotate around their own axes, creating a dynamic and constantly changing system. This design would allow for more efficient energy transfer and a more diverse range of climates and environments on each planet.",
    "A Fractal Solar System: In this design, the solar system would be created using fractal geometry, with the Sun at the center and the planets arranged in a repeating pattern of smaller and smaller circles. This would create a system with an infinite number of planets, each one smaller than the last and orbiting around the Sun in a perfectly symmetrical pattern. This design would allow for a vast and diverse range of planets, each with its own unique characteristics and environments.",
    "A Self-Sustaining Solar System: In this redesign, the solar system would be designed to be completely self-sustaining, with the planets working together to maintain a stable and balanced system. The Sun would be powered by a combination of nuclear reactions and solar energy, and the planets would be able to harness and share energy efficiently. This design would create a"
