    "**Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Automatic Switching**: Design a smart power strip that not only monitors energy consumption in real-time but also automatically switches off non-essential devices when not in use. This could be achieved through integration with a smartphone app, which tracks energy usage and sends notifications to the user when a device is left on unnecessarily. The strip could also include USB ports with built-in charging stations for mobile devices, providing a convenient and organized charging experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Strip with Built-in Recycling**: Create a power strip that includes a built-in recycling system for old or broken electronics. The strip could have a designated slot for collecting batteries, wires, or other electronic components, which would then be sorted and recycled through a partnership with a local recycling facility. This innovative feature encourages users to recycle their electronic waste responsibly, promoting a more sustainable environment.",
    "**Power Strip with Integrated Lighting and Mood Settings**: Design a power strip that doubles as a smart lighting system. The strip could have LED lights that adjust color and brightness based on the user's preferences, creating a cozy atmosphere for relaxation or a productive ambiance for work. This feature could be controlled through a voice assistant or a mobile app, allowing users to customize their lighting experience.",
    "**Portable Power Strip with Built-in Solar Panel**: Develop a portable power strip that includes a built-in solar panel, allowing users to charge their devices on-the-go using renewable energy. The strip could have a compact design, making it easy to carry in a backpack or purse, and could also include a built-in battery to store excess energy for later use.",
    "**Power Strip with Integrated Security Features**: Create a power strip that includes advanced security features, such as biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) and real-time monitoring through a mobile app. The strip could also have a built-in alarm system that alerts the user or authorities in case of unauthorized access. This innovative feature provides an added layer of security for valuable electronics and sensitive data.
