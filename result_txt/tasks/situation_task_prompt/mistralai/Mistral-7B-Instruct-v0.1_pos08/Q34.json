    "Use a watering can to manually water the plants: If all rain stopped, one could use a watering can to manually water their plants. This would require more effort and time, but it would still be possible to keep the plants alive.",
    "Collect rainwater in a container: Another option would be to collect rainwater in a container, such as a bucket or a rain barrel. This would require setting up a system to collect the rain, but it would provide a source of water for the plants.",
    "Use a drip irrigation system: A drip irrigation system could be installed to provide a slow, steady flow of water to the plants. This would require more upfront investment, but it would be a more efficient way to water the plants.",
    "Use a water pump: A water pump could be used to pump water from a nearby source, such as a river or lake, to the plants. This would require more effort and resources, but it would provide a sustainable source of water for the plants.",
    "Use a watering gel: A watering gel could be used to provide a slow-release source of water to the plants. This would require less effort and resources, but it would not be as effective as other methods in extreme weather conditions."
