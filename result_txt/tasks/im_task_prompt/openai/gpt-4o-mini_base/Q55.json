    "**Interchangeable Nib System**: Create a fountain pen with an interchangeable nib system that allows users to easily swap out nibs for different writing styles or ink flow preferences. The pen could come with a variety of nibs (fine, medium, broad, italic) that can be changed with a simple twist or click mechanism, allowing for a customizable writing experience.",
    "**Built-in Ink Refiller**: Design a fountain pen that includes a built-in ink refilling mechanism. Users can simply place the pen into a special ink cartridge or ink bottle, and with a press of a button, the pen will draw ink into its reservoir automatically. This would make refilling cleaner and more efficient, eliminating the mess of traditional ink bottles.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip and Adjustable Weight**: Develop a fountain pen with an ergonomic grip that can be adjusted to fit the user's hand size and writing style. Additionally, incorporate adjustable weights that can be added or removed to create a balanced feel for the pen. This would cater to users who may experience discomfort during long writing sessions.",
    "**Ink Color Customization App**: Pair the fountain pen with a smartphone app that allows users to mix and create custom ink colors. By scanning the pen, the app can suggest ink color combinations based on existing colors, and users can save their favorite shades for future use. This would enhance the creative aspect of writing and drawing with a fountain pen.",
    "**Integrated Paper Quality Tester**: Equip the fountain pen with a small sensor that can assess the quality of the paper being used. The pen could analyze the paper's texture and thickness, and provide feedback via a small display on the pen or through a connected app, recommending the best ink and nib combination for optimal writing performance."
