    "**Bioengineered Eye Drops**: Scientists could develop a series of bioengineered eye drops that temporarily enhance vision. These drops would contain nanobots programmed to adjust the eye's lens curvature and focus on nearby or distant objects. Users would simply apply the drops to experience improved vision for several hours, allowing them to perform daily tasks without glasses or contacts.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: In the absence of traditional lenses, a new type of smart contact lens could emerge, integrating augmented reality (AR) technology. These lenses would allow wearers to see the world with enhanced clarity and overlay helpful information directly onto their field of vision. For instance, they could highlight important text, enhance contrast in low-light situations, or even provide real-time translations of written language.",
    "**Adaptive Eyewear**: Fashion designers and engineers could collaborate to create a line of adaptive eyewear that doesn’t rely on lenses. These frames would use advanced materials and shapes to manipulate light in real-time, adjusting to the wearer’s vision needs. For example, they could change shape or tint based on lighting conditions, providing a tailored visual experience without the need for corrective lenses.",
    "**Community Vision Cooperatives**: In a world without glasses or contacts, communities could establish vision cooperatives where individuals with varying degrees of visual impairment come together to share resources and support. These cooperatives could provide access to alternative vision solutions, such as shared tools for reading or magnifying objects, and facilitate workshops on eye exercises and natural methods for improving eyesight.",
    "**Biofeedback Vision Training**: People could turn to biofeedback technology to improve their vision. Devices would be created that help users train their eyes through interactive exercises, utilizing visual stimuli that adapt based on the user’s progress. Over time, this training could strengthen eye muscles and improve focus, potentially reducing reliance on corrective eyewear."
