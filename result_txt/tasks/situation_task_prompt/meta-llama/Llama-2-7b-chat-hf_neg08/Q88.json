    "Build a Sky Ferry System: With a sky ferry system, you could transport people and goods across the impassable roads by air. This would involve constructing a network of interconnected skyports, each equipped with landing pads and cargo bays. Passengers and cargo could be loaded onto sleek, high-tech sky ferries that would fly between the skyports, providing a safe and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Develop Underground Tunnels: In the event of impassable roads, building a network of underground tunnels could be an effective solution. These tunnels could be constructed using advanced engineering techniques and materials, allowing for safe and efficient travel beneath the surface. The tunnels could be equipped with advanced ventilation systems, lighting, and safety features to ensure a comfortable and secure journey.",
    "Create a Network of Waterways: If roads become impassable, converting existing waterways or creating new ones could provide a reliable means of transportation. This could involve dredging rivers and streams to create wider, deeper channels, or building canals and waterways through uninhabited areas. Watercraft, such as boats and barges, could be used to transport people and goods, connecting cities and towns across the network.",
    "Develop Maglev Trains: Maglev trains, which use magnetic levitation technology to float above the tracks, could be an ideal solution for impassable roads. These trains could travel at high speeds, reaching destinations quickly and efficiently, while minimizing the impact on the environment. The trains could be powered by electricity, reducing emissions and providing a sustainable mode of transportation.",
    "Invent a Teleportation Device: For a more futuristic solution, consider inventing a teleportation device that could transport people and goods from one location to another instantly. This technology would involve breaking down matter into subatomic particles, transmitting them through a quantum entanglement network, and reassembling them at the destination. While still in the realm of science fiction, a teleportation device could revolutionize transportation by eliminating the need for roads altogether."
