    "**Modular Bed Design**: Create a bed with interchangeable components that allow users to customize their sleeping experience. For instance, the headboard could feature adjustable lighting for reading, built-in speakers for music or white noise, and even storage for books or gadgets. The mattress could have layers that can be swapped out based on firmness preference, and the bed frame could be adjustable to cater to various sleeping positions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bed**: Design a bed made entirely from sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood, organic cotton, and biodegradable foam. This bed would also feature a built-in air purification system that uses plants or natural filters to improve indoor air quality. To further enhance sustainability, the bed could be modular and easily disassembled for recycling or upcycling.",
    "**Interactive Bed with AR Features**: Develop a bed that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology. Using a headset or smart glasses, users could experience immersive environments while falling asleep, such as a tranquil beach or a serene forest. The bed could also provide interactive storytelling for children, allowing parents to read stories that come to life in AR, making bedtime more engaging.",
    "**Sleep-Inducing Aromatherapy Bed**: This bed would integrate a built-in aromatherapy system that releases calming scents like lavender or chamomile to help users relax and drift off to sleep. The scent release could be timed to coincide with the user's bedtime routine, and the bed could also have a gentle heating feature to create a cozy atmosphere. Users could customize their scent preferences through a mobile app.",
    "**Multi-Functional Bed with Workspace**: Create a bed that doubles as a workspace for those who work from home. The design could feature a fold-out desk and a built-in charging station for devices. The bed could also have soundproofing elements to create a quiet environment for focused work during the day, while still maintaining comfort for sleep at night. This would be ideal for small living spaces."
