    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Venue**: Host your wedding at a sustainable or nature-based venue. This could be a local park with natural scenery, a botanical garden, or a rustic barn that uses renewable energy sources. The idea here is to minimize carbon footprint by choosing a location that already exists in its natural form, thereby reducing the need for construction or extensive landscaping.",
    "**Sustainable Decor**: Instead of using traditional floral arrangements, opt for live plants or air plants which can be taken home by guests as a memento. Use recycled paper for invitations, programs, and thank you cards. Decorate with upcycled items such as reclaimed wood, old jars, or vintage books. ",
    "**Seasonal and Local Menu**: Choose a caterer who specializes in locally-sourced, seasonal foods. This not only supports local farmers but also reduces transportation emissions. Offer vegetarian or vegan options as these typically require less energy to produce compared to meat-heavy dishes. Encourage your guests to eat consciously and reduce waste by setting up composting stations.",
    "**Green Transportation**: Arrange for electric or hybrid vehicles for transportation services on your wedding day. Alternatively, encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation. Consider having bicycles available for guests who wish to cycle to the venue or around it. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with personal vehicles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Gifts**: Instead of traditional wedding favors, offer eco-friendly gifts like reusable water bottles, solar-powered chargers, or plantable seed paper. These gifts serve a dual purpose â€“ they are memorable for the guests and contribute to sustainability."
