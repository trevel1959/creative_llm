    "Inland or mountainous areas: I would move to higher ground, further away from coastlines, to minimize the risk of flooding and erosion.",
    "Sustainably-designed floating communities: Develop innovative, eco-friendly, and sustainably-designed floating communities, built on barges or bargelike structures, to take advantage of water resources and create a self-sustained system for living off the coast of flooded coastal areas.",
    "Coastal construction relocation: Move buildings and infrastructure to inland areas or design and build floating eco-cities that could be anchored away from coastlines to raise landform in strategic areas that would provide natural protection.",
    "Urban planning and adaptation: Implement smart urban planning strategies, such as coastal zone management and flood-resilience design solutions, to help existing coastal cities and communities adapt and survive rising ocean levels.",
    "Large-scale coastal restoration projects: Invest in large-scale coastal restoration projects to help stabilize coastlines, protect natural habitats, and provide buffer zones to help absorb rising sea levels."
