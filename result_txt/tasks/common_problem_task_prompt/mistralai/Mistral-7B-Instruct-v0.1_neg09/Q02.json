    "Use paper: Carbon paper can be a great way to make a copy of your recipe without having to write it down again. Simply place the paper over the original recipe and trace it onto the carbon paper. This way, you can easily make multiple copies of the recipe without having to write it out again.",
    "Cook in advance: To save time and stress on the day of the holiday dinner, consider cooking some of the dishes in advance. This can include making the soup or stew, preparing the sides, or even baking some of the desserts. This will allow you to focus on the main dish and ensure that everything is ready on time.",
