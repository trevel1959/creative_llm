    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Replace the traditional vacuum cleaner's motor with an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly alternative. This could involve using renewable energy sources, creating a closed-loop system that recycles the vacuum's energy, or designing the vacuum to consume less power overall.",
    "**Multifunctional Cleaning**: Integrate additional cleaning functions into the vacuum, such as a steam mop, a carpet cleaner, or a handheld vacuum attachment. This would make the vacuum a versatile tool for different cleaning needs.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Develop the vacuum to integrate seamlessly with smart home devices, allowing it to be controlled remotely, scheduled for cleaning, or even programmed to work in tandem with other smart devices for more efficient cleaning.",
    "**Augmented Reality Guidance**: Equip the vacuum with augmented reality capabilities, providing the user with visual guidance and tips for cleaning different types of surfaces or addressing specific cleaning challenges.",
    "**Self-Charging and Maintenance**: Design the vacuum to be self-sufficient, with the ability to charge itself when needed and alert the user when maintenance is required. This would eliminate the need for manual charging and maintenance."
