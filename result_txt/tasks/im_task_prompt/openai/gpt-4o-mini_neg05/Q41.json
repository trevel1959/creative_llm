    "**Modular Skateboard**: Design a skateboard with interchangeable parts that allow riders to customize their board according to their style and needs. Riders could swap out wheels for different terrains (street, park, or off-road), change the deck shape for tricks, or even adjust the trucks for different levels of stability. This modular approach would cater to both beginners and advanced skaters, making it easier to adapt the board to various riding conditions.",
    "**Self-Balancing Skateboard**: Incorporate gyroscopic sensors and electric motors to create a self-balancing skateboard. This would be particularly beneficial for beginners who struggle with balance. The board could adjust its tilt and provide subtle corrections to help the rider maintain stability, making it easier for new skaters to learn and gain confidence before transitioning to traditional skateboarding.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This skateboard could also incorporate biodegradable grip tape and non-toxic paints. Additionally, a portion of the sales could go toward environmental initiatives, appealing to eco-conscious consumers and promoting a greener lifestyle within the skating community.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-in Storage**: Create a skateboard that features a hidden compartment within the deck for storing essentials like keys, a phone, or a small wallet. The compartment could be accessed through a sliding panel or a discreet hatch, allowing riders to carry their belongings without the need for an extra bag. This design would be especially useful for urban skaters who want to travel light.",
    "**Augmented Reality Skateboarding App**: Pair a traditional skateboard with an augmented reality (AR) app that provides tutorials, challenges, and a virtual skate park. Riders could use their smartphones or AR glasses to see overlays of tricks they want to learn, visual markers for jump heights, or even competitions against other skaters in a virtual space. This interactive experience would make learning new skills more engaging and fun."
