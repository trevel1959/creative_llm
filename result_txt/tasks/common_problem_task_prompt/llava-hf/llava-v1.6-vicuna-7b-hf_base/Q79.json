    "Lack of Shelter Space: Another issue is the lack of available shelter spaces in the city. High demand for available beds and insufficient shelter capacity can hinder efforts to house homeless individuals and families. The city might need to invest in expanding existing shelters or building new ones, but this can be expensive and may require the allocation of resources from other areas.",
    "High Rental Costs: Rising housing costs in some areas can further exacerbate homelessness. For low-income individuals, finding affordable housing options can be difficult, making it harder for them to exit homelessness. Many cities already struggling to provide enough affordable housing might struggle to address this issue.",
    "Mental Health and Substance Abuse: Individuals with mental health issues or substance abuse problems are more likely to become homeless. Providing adequate mental health and substance abuse services is crucial to address this demographic and coordinate efforts to combat homelessness. However, these services are often underfunded, making it difficult to make a significant impact.",
    "Inadequate Transportation: For homeless individuals to secure stable housing, access to reliable transportation is essential. However, many homeless individuals have limited transportation options due to lack of identification or funds to acquire a reliable mode of transport.",
    "Coordination and Collaboration: Developing a comprehensive solution to homelessness often relies on collaboration and coordination with various stakeholders, including government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and community members. However, lack of coordination and communication can hinder efforts to address homelessness effectively and efficiently."
