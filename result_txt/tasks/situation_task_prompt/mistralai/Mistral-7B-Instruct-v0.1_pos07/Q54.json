    "Develop a new type of underwater vehicle that can transport people and cargo across large bodies of water. This vehicle could be designed to withstand extreme conditions and could be powered by renewable energy sources.",
    "Build a network of bridges and tunnels that span large bodies of water. These structures could be designed to withstand the weight of heavy traffic and could be connected to land via high-speed trains or ferries.",
    "Create a fleet of airships that can transport people and cargo across large bodies of water. These airships could be designed to be fuel-efficient and could be powered by alternative energy sources such as solar or wind power.",
    "Build a network of floating islands that can be connected by high-speed boats or ferries. These islands could be designed to be self-sustaining and could be used for agriculture, industry, and tourism.",
    "Develop a new type of water-based transportation that uses advanced propulsion technology to transport people and cargo across large bodies of water. This technology could be based on magnetic levitation or other advanced propulsion systems that are more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional propulsion methods."
