    "Digital Wallets: In a world without paper money or coins, digital wallets would become the primary means of transaction. People could store their money in digital accounts, such as bank accounts or mobile payment apps, and use their smartphones or other devices to make transactions. This would eliminate the need for physical currency and make transactions faster and more convenient.",
    "Bartering System: In the absence of paper money, people might turn to a bartering system, exchanging goods and services directly without using any medium of exchange. For example, a farmer could trade fresh produce for a haircut or a tailor could trade clothes for a meal. This system would promote a more personal and local economy, where people rely on each other for goods and services.",
    "Tokenized Currency: A new form of currency could emerge that is digital but not based on physical money. Tokenized currency would be created and traded on a blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. This would allow for fast, secure, and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks.",
    "Cryptocurrency: Another option would be to adopt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These digital currencies use cryptography for security and are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them. Transactions with cryptocurrencies could be made directly between individuals without the need for intermediaries, making them faster and more efficient.",
    "Credit Systems: In a world without paper money, credit systems could become more prevalent. People could borrow money from financial institutions or use credit cards to make purchases, with the promise to repay the amount later. This would allow for more flexibility in transactions and could help smooth out cash flow fluctuations."
