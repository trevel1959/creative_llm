    "Wheelchair for Dogs: Create a wheelchair specifically designed for dogs, allowing them to move around more easily and comfortably. The wheelchair could be made of lightweight materials and have adjustable straps to ensure a secure fit. It could also include features such as a built-in cooling system to keep the dog comfortable in hot weather, or a heating system to keep them warm in cold weather.",
    "Wheelchair with Built-In Sensors: Develop a wheelchair with built-in sensors that can detect and respond to the user's movements and emotions. The sensors could be used to monitor the user's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, and provide real-time feedback to help them manage their condition. The wheelchair could also be equipped with virtual reality or augmented reality technology to provide a more immersive and engaging experience for the user.",
    "Portable Wheelchair: Create a lightweight and portable wheelchair that can be easily disassembled and transported. The wheelchair could be made of collapsible materials, such as aluminum or carbon fiber, and could be folded up for easy storage and transport. This would make it ideal for people who need to travel frequently or who live in small spaces.",
    "Wheelchair with Artificial Intelligence: Develop a wheelchair with artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn and adapt to the user's needs and preferences over time. The AI could be used to optimize the wheelchair's performance, adjusting things like speed, direction, and stability based on the user's movements and habits. The wheelchair could also be equipped with voice-controlled technology, allowing the user to control it with ease.",
    "Wheelchair with Exercise and Fitness Features: Create a wheelchair with built-in exercise and fitness features, such as a built-in stationary bike or arm ergometers. The wheelchair could also include sensors that track the user's exercise and fitness levels, providing real-time feedback and motivation to help them stay active and healthy. This would be ideal for people who are looking to stay fit and active while still using their wheelchair."
