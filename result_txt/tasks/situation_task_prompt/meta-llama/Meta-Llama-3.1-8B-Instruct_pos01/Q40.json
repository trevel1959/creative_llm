    "**Solar-Powered Wearables**: Develop wearable devices that can harness and store solar energy. These wearables would be equipped with thin-film solar panels, energy storage systems, and advanced power management algorithms. They could be worn on the wrist, as a badge, or even integrated into clothing. This would enable individuals to generate and store their own power, making them less reliant on traditional batteries.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Implement a system that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments, and uses it to generate electricity through a process called electrochemical hydrogen production. This method involves passing an electric current through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can then be used as a clean-burning fuel source or stored for later use.",
    "**Bio-Electricity Harvesting**: Develop technology that harnesses the electrical signals generated by living organisms, such as plants or microorganisms. This could be achieved through the use of bio-electrodes, which would be implanted or attached to the organisms to capture their electrical activity. The bio-electricity could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "**Piezoelectric Roadways**: Design roadways that incorporate piezoelectric materials, which generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress, such as the weight of vehicles or foot traffic. This would allow cities to harness the energy generated by daily traffic and use it to power streetlights, traffic signals, and other urban infrastructure.",
    "**Graphene-Based Energy Harvesting**: Develop a new class of supercapacitors that utilize graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material, to store electrical energy. These supercapacitors would be designed to be ultra-efficient, compact, and long-lasting, making them ideal for powering small devices and wearables."
