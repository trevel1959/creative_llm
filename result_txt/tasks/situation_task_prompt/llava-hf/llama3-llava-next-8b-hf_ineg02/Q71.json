    "Build raised beds: Raised beds can be constructed using materials such as wood, plastic, or metal, allowing for easier access to the soil without the need for digging. This method can be particularly helpful for individuals with physical limitations or in areas with hard ground.",
    "Employ a container gardening system: By using pots or containers, you can grow plants in a controlled environment, regardless of the ground conditions. This method can be especially useful in small spaces or urban settings.",
    "Implement a community garden: In situations where the ground is too hard to dig into, a community garden could be developed, where multiple individuals or groups contribute to the maintenance and upkeep of the garden."
