    "**Physical Health Crisis**: Sleep is crucial for physical health, playing a significant role in processes such as muscle repair, hormone regulation, and immune function. Without sleep, the human body would struggle to recover from daily wear and tear, leading to an increase in chronic health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This could result in a healthcare crisis, overwhelming medical systems and resources.",
    "**Altered Social Structures**: The loss of sleep would dramatically change social interactions and relationships. With everyone awake at all hours, traditional concepts of work, school, and family time would need to be restructured. New social norms may emerge, potentially leading to a more fragmented society where individuals are less likely to share communal experiences, as everyone would be operating on different schedules.",
    "**Increased Dependency on Stimulants**: In the absence of sleep, humans would likely turn to stimulants such as caffeine and other drugs to maintain alertness. This could lead to a widespread dependency on these substances, resulting in addiction issues and further health complications. Additionally, the market for stimulants would explode, creating an economic boom in that sector while simultaneously increasing risks of substance abuse.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: A sleepless society would likely increase energy consumption as people would require more artificial lighting and electronic devices to stay engaged. This could lead to a surge in energy demand, exacerbating environmental issues such as climate change. Additionally, the increase in productivity and constant activity might lead to higher levels of waste and pollution, further straining the planet's resources.",
    "**Shift in Work Culture**: The traditional 9-to-5 workday would become obsolete, leading to the rise of 24/7 work cultures. This could create a competitive environment where individuals are expected to be constantly available and productive, potentially resulting in burnout and mental health crises. Companies may adopt more flexible hours, but the pressure to perform could lead to a toxic work atmosphere where work-life balance is nearly impossible to achieve."
