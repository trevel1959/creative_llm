    "**Modular Components**: Create a desk with modular components that can be rearranged or added to based on the user's needs. For example, the desk could come with detachable sections for additional workspace, storage, or even a foldable section that converts into a standing desk. This flexibility would allow users to customize their workspace for different tasks, whether it's writing, crafting, or working on a computer.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design a desk made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled wood, or even biodegradable plastics. Incorporating a natural aesthetic with eco-friendly finishes would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The desk could also feature a small built-in planter for air-purifying plants, adding a touch of nature to the workspace.",
    "**Ergonomic Features**: Enhance the desk with ergonomic features such as adjustable height settings, a curved surface to promote better posture, and integrated wrist rests for typing comfort. The desk could also have a built-in footrest that can be adjusted to different heights, promoting better circulation and reducing fatigue during long hours of work.",
    "**Cable Management System**: Introduce an innovative cable management system that includes hidden compartments for power strips and cables, along with built-in USB ports for easy device charging. This system could use magnetic clips to keep cables organized and tangle-free, ensuring a clean and clutter-free workspace.",
    "**Personalized Lighting**: Integrate customizable LED lighting into the desk that can change color and intensity based on the time of day or user preference. The lighting could also be programmed to simulate natural light patterns, helping to reduce eye strain and improve focus.
