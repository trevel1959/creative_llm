    "**Housing Pods**: Create modular, prefabricated housing units that can be easily assembled and disassembled. These pods can be designed to be compact, energy-efficient, and equipped with basic amenities like a bed, bathroom, and kitchenette. They can be placed in underutilized public spaces, such as parking lots or vacant lots, and can be managed by a non-profit organization or a social enterprise. The pods can be designed to be easily scalable, allowing for quick expansion or contraction as needed.",
    "**Community Land Trust**: Establish a community land trust (CLT) that allows low-income individuals and families to purchase homes at below-market rates. The CLT would hold the title to the land, while the homeowner would own the structure. This model helps preserve affordability and ensures that the homes remain accessible to those who need them most. The CLT can also provide additional services, such as financial counseling, job training, and social support, to help residents maintain stable housing.",
    "**Co-Living Spaces**: Develop co-living spaces that offer shared accommodations, communal facilities, and supportive services. These spaces can be designed to cater to a variety of needs, including transitional housing for individuals with mental health issues, affordable housing for low-income families, or even specialized housing for seniors. Co-living spaces can foster a sense of community and social connection, which is essential for individuals struggling with homelessness.",
    "**Tiny Home Villages**: Create tiny home villages, where small, eco-friendly homes are clustered together to provide affordable housing options. These villages can be designed to be sustainable, with features like rainwater harvesting, composting toilets, and community gardens. They can also include shared facilities, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms, to reduce costs and promote social interaction.",
    "**Housing First**: Implement a Housing First approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to individuals and families as quickly as possible, regardless of their circumstances. This approach is grounded in the understanding that housing is a fundamental human right and that stable housing is essential for addressing underlying issues, such as addiction, mental health, or unemployment. The Housing First model can be paired with supportive services, like counseling, job training, and healthcare, to help residents maintain their housing and improve their overall well-being."
