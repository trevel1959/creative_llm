    "**DIY Dental Kits**: In a world without dentists, people would need to take matters into their own hands. I'd develop a comprehensive DIY dental kit that includes everything needed for basic oral care. This kit would contain a manual or app-guided guide for teeth cleaning, whitening, and polishing. It would also include a set of interchangeable dental tools, such as interdental brushes, floss, and mouthwash.",
    "**Community Dental Co-ops**: With no dentists, people would need to rely on each other for dental care. I'd establish community dental co-ops where members share knowledge, resources, and expertise to maintain their oral health. These co-ops would provide a space for people to learn from each other, exchange tips, and receive support.",
    "**AI-Powered Dental Assistants**: In a world without dentists, AI-powered dental assistants would become the norm. I'd create an AI system that can analyze dental issues, provide personalized advice, and even perform basic dental procedures. This AI would be accessible through a mobile app or voice assistant, making it easy for people to take care of their teeth.",
    "**Personalized Dental Care Plans**: Without dentists, people would need to create their own dental care plans. I'd develop a platform that allows individuals to input their oral health history, lifestyle, and preferences. Based on this information, the platform would generate a personalized dental care plan, complete with recommended products, routines, and maintenance schedules.",
    "**Crowdsourced Dental Knowledge**: In a world without dentists, people would need to rely on each other's experiences and expertise. I'd create a crowdsourced dental knowledge platform where individuals can share their own experiences, ask questions, and receive advice from others. This platform would include a library of user-generated content, including videos, tutorials, and reviews of dental products and services.
