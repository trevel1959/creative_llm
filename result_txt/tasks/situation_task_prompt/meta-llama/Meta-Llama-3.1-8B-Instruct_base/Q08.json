    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Design a device that can extract clean water from the air, even in arid environments. This device would use a combination of condensation, filtration, and purification technologies to produce clean drinking water. The device could be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Underground Water Wells with Advanced Filtration Systems**: Develop a network of underground water wells that utilize advanced filtration systems to remove contaminants and pollutants from the water. These systems could include technologies such as activated carbon, ultraviolet light, and nanofiltration to ensure the water is safe for drinking.",
    "**Desalination Plants with Energy-Efficient Technologies**: Build desalination plants that use energy-efficient technologies such as reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, or membrane distillation to remove salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water. These plants could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power to minimize their carbon footprint.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems with Built-in Filtration**: Design rainwater harvesting systems that incorporate built-in filtration systems to remove contaminants and pollutants from the collected rainwater. These systems could include features such as first flush devices, sedimentation tanks, and activated carbon filters to ensure the water is safe for drinking.",
    "**Aquaponics Systems with Integrated Water Purification**: Develop aquaponics systems that integrate water purification technologies to remove contaminants and pollutants from the water. These systems could include features such as biofiltration, ultraviolet light, and nanofiltration to ensure the water is safe for drinking while also providing a sustainable source of fish and other aquatic animals.
