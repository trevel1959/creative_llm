    "**Personal Narrative Archives**: People would record their experiences, stories, and memories in a personal narrative archive, using a combination of writing, audio recordings, and video diaries. These archives would serve as a digital repository of personal history, allowing individuals to reflect on their past and share their stories with future generations.",
    "**Emotional Resonance Maps**: A new form of cartography would emerge, where people would create maps that capture the emotional resonance of places, events, and people. These maps would be imbued with sensory details, allowing individuals to recall and relive memories through a tactile and experiential connection to the physical world.",
    "**Memory Weaving**: A community-driven practice would develop, where people would share and weave together their memories into a collective tapestry. This would involve oral storytelling, collaborative drawing, and interactive installations that bring people's memories to life, creating a shared cultural heritage.",
    "**Echoes in the Environment**: The environment itself would become a repository of memories, with people leaving behind tangible artifacts and echoes of their experiences. For example, a tree might be adorned with notes, photos, or other mementos, while a river might carry the whispers of past conversations.",
    "**Dream Incubation Chambers**: Specialized spaces would be designed to facilitate collective dreaming, where people would share their dreams and experiences, creating a shared subconscious repository of memories. These chambers would use sensory stimulation, soundscapes, and neurofeedback to induce lucid dreaming, allowing individuals to tap into the collective unconscious and recall past events and people."
