    "Spatula-shaped space station: Imagine a space station designed to resemble a giant spatula. Astronauts can live and work in the various \"teeth\" of the spatula, conducting experiments and research while enjoying the zero-gravity environment. The \"handle\" of the spatula could house a control center and living quarters, while the \"blade\" could be used for solar panels and other scientific equipment.",
