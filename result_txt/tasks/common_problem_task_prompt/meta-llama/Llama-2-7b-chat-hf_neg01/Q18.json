    "Off-grid energy harvesting: Develop a community-based system that utilizes renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to generate electricity. This system would be decentralized and community-owned, providing a sustainable and reliable source of energy for homes and businesses.",
    "Night-time lighting: Create a unique lighting system that utilizes bioluminescent organisms, such as glowworms or fireflies, to provide light during the night. This system would be eco-friendly and reduce the need for electricity.",
