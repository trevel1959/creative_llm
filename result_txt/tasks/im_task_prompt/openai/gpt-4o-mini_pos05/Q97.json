    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Design a leash that can easily adjust its length through a simple locking mechanism. This would allow dog owners to switch between a short length for crowded areas or training, and a longer length for open spaces. The adjustable feature could be controlled with a one-handed mechanism, making it convenient for owners who need to manage their dog and other tasks simultaneously.",
    "**Integrated Waste Bag Dispenser**: Create a leash that has a built-in, discreet waste bag dispenser. The dispenser could be designed to blend seamlessly with the leash's handle and would include a compartment for storing extra bags. This would ensure that dog owners are always prepared for clean-up without needing to carry an additional item.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Enhance safety during night walks by incorporating reflective materials and LED lights into the leash. The reflective stitching would ensure visibility in low-light conditions, while built-in LED lights could be activated with a button, providing extra illumination. This would be especially beneficial for early morning or late evening walks.",
    "**Comfort Grip Handle with Ergonomic Design**: Redesign the leash handle to include a soft, ergonomic grip that reduces strain on the hands and wrists. This could be made from a non-slip material and could feature a contoured shape that fits comfortably in the hand. Additionally, the handle could have a shock-absorbing mechanism to minimize jarring when a dog suddenly pulls.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Storage**: Develop a leash that includes small storage compartments for essentials like keys, phone, and treats. The storage could be designed as a detachable pouch that can be easily removed when not needed. This would allow dog owners to have everything they need at their fingertips without carrying extra bags or pockets."
