    "**Land Use Conflicts**: The establishment of a conservation park may lead to conflicts with existing land uses. Nearby communities may rely on the land for agriculture, tourism, or resource extraction. These conflicts can create resistance from local stakeholders, who may feel their livelihoods are threatened, necessitating effective negotiation and community engagement strategies to align interests.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding for the parkâ€™s establishment and ongoing management can be a significant hurdle. Initial setup costs, including land acquisition, infrastructure development, and staffing, require substantial investment. Additionally, sustainable funding sources must be identified to ensure long-term maintenance and conservation efforts, which can be difficult in a competitive funding environment.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: The introduction of invasive species can pose a serious threat to the ecosystem within the new conservation park. These species can outcompete native flora and fauna, disrupt food chains, and alter habitat structures. Developing a management plan to monitor and control invasive species is crucial but can be resource-intensive and complex, especially if the invasives are already established in the area.",
    "**Visitor Management and Impact**: If the park is open to the public, managing visitor impact becomes a significant concern. Increased foot traffic can lead to soil erosion, habitat destruction, and wildlife disturbances. Implementing effective visitor management strategies, such as designated trails, educational programs, and visitor limits, is essential to mitigate these impacts while still promoting public enjoyment and awareness of the natural environment.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Establishing a nature conservation park involves navigating a complex landscape of legal and regulatory requirements. This includes obtaining permits, ensuring compliance with environmental protection laws, and potentially addressing historical land claims or rights of indigenous peoples. Failure to adequately address these legal aspects can lead to delays, legal disputes, and even project cancellation."
