    "Floating Cities: With rising ocean levels, the obvious solution would be to build floating cities that can adapt to the new waterfront landscape. These cities could be designed with adjustable buoyancy to keep them afloat, and equipped with sustainable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. The floating cities could be built with modular structures, allowing for easy expansion and contraction as the ocean levels rise and fall.",
    "Water-Resistant Homes: Another option would be to design homes that are specifically built to withstand the harsh conditions of a flooded world. These homes could be made with water-resistant materials such as reinforced concrete, steel, and specialized membranes that can keep water out. The homes could also be designed with built-in water filtration systems, allowing inhabitants to have access to clean drinking water.",
    "Underwater Communities: For those who are willing to fully embrace the change, underwater communities could be a viable option. These communities could be built on the ocean floor or in underwater caverns, providing a unique and sustainable way of life. The homes could be designed with large windows and observation decks, allowing inhabitants to marvel at the beauty of the ocean and its creatures.",
    "Island Nations: With rising ocean levels, some small island nations may become uninhabitable. However, these nations could also become hubs for innovation and sustainable living. Governments and organizations could invest in renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture, and eco-tourism, creating a thriving economy that is not dependent on finite resources.",
    "Artificial Islands: Another option would be to create artificial islands using advanced 3D printing technology. These islands could be built using a combination of sand, concrete, and other materials, and could be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of a flooded world. The islands could be used for a variety of purposes, including residential areas, agriculture, and eco-tourism."
