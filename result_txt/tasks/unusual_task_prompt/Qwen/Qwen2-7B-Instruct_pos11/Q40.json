    "**Interactive Cookie Jar**: Create an interactive cookie jar that can teach kids about healthy eating habits and nutrition. The jar could have a digital display on its lid showing the nutritional value of each cookie. Kids can scan the barcode of the cookie using their smartphone or a tablet to learn about its ingredients, sugar content, and calories. This way, they can make informed choices while enjoying their treats.",
    "**DIY Cookie Jar Kit**: Develop a DIY kit that allows people to customize their own cookie jars. The kit would include materials such as different types of cookie molds, a variety of glass jars, and creative labels. Additionally, it could come with recipes for homemade cookies that fit various dietary needs (like gluten-free, vegan, etc.). This encourages creativity and personalization, making it a fun project for both adults and children.",
    "**Smart Cookie Jar with Inventory Tracking**: Design a smart cookie jar equipped with sensors that track when cookies are added or removed. This would help in managing inventory and reducing waste. For instance, if a certain type of cookie runs low, the jar could send notifications to refill or suggest alternative recipes. This idea can be particularly useful for households or offices where snacks are shared.",
    "**Themed Cookie Jars**: Offer cookie jars with unique themes such as a Harry Potter, Star Wars, or Disney-themed jar, complete with designs and decorations related to popular franchises. These jars can be sold during holiday seasons or themed events, catering to specific audiences and increasing sales through novelty and nostalgia.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cookie Jar**: Create a line of cookie jars made from sustainable materials like bamboo, reclaimed wood, or recycled glass. These jars not only look stylish but also align with environmental values, appealing to eco-conscious consumers. They could also come with biodegradable packaging and a commitment to sourcing ingredients and materials responsibly. This promotes sustainability while still offering a practical and enjoyable product."
