    "Solar-Powered Satellite: Design a satellite that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity, eliminating the need for batteries or fuel. This would reduce the weight of the satellite and increase its lifespan. The satellite could be equipped with solar panels that can adjust to face the sun, ensuring maximum energy capture.",
    "Collaborative Satellite Construction: Develop a satellite that allows multiple space agencies or organizations to collaborate on its construction and operation. This would foster international cooperation and knowledge sharing, leading to more advanced and complex missions. The satellite could be designed with modular components, allowing different teams to work on different parts of the satellite.",
    "Satellite-Based Space Debris Collection: Create a satellite that can collect and remove space debris from Earth's orbit. This would help to reduce the amount of debris in space, making it safer for future missions and reducing the risk of collisions. The satellite could be equipped with a net or a vacuum system to collect debris, and it could also be used to test new technologies for space debris removal.",
    "Satellite-Based Space Weather Monitoring: Develop a satellite that can monitor space weather events such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms. This would provide critical data for predicting space weather events and protecting satellites and astronauts from their effects. The satellite could be equipped with advanced sensors and imaging instruments to detect space weather phenomena and transmit the data back to Earth.",
    "Inflatable Satellite: Design a satellite that uses inflatable structures to provide more living and working space for astronauts. This would allow for more complex missions and longer durations in space, as well as providing a more comfortable living environment for astronauts. The inflatable structure could be made of lightweight materials and could be easily deployed in space, providing a flexible and efficient way to expand the capabilities of a satellite."
