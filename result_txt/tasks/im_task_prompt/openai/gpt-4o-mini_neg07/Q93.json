    "**Ergonomic Grip Enhancements**: Design a bowling ball with customizable grip inserts that conform to the bowler's hand shape. These inserts could be made from a soft, flexible material that molds to the user's fingers, providing a more comfortable and secure grip. Additionally, the ball could have adjustable weight distribution, allowing players to fine-tune the ball's feel and performance based on their preferences.",
    "**Interactive Training Ball**: Create a bowling ball equipped with LED lights that change color based on the bowler's performance. For instance, if the bowler hits a strike, the ball could light up in green; if they miss, it could flash red. This visual feedback would not only make practice more engaging but could also help bowlers identify patterns in their throws and improve their game.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a bowling ball made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that do not compromise on performance. This eco-friendly ball could appeal to environmentally conscious bowlers and promote sustainability in the sport. Additionally, the manufacturing process could incorporate recycled materials, reducing waste and energy consumption.",
    "**Modular Bowling Ball**: Introduce a modular bowling ball design that allows bowlers to change the weight, coverstock, and core configurations easily. This would enable players to adapt their equipment for different lane conditions and personal preferences without having to invest in multiple balls. A simple twist-and-lock mechanism could facilitate easy customization.",
    "**Bowling Ball with Built-in Cooling System**: Implement a cooling mechanism within the bowling ball to help regulate its temperature during play. Overheating can affect performance, especially in high-stakes games. A series of small vents and a lightweight cooling gel could be used to dissipate heat, ensuring that the ball maintains optimal performance throughout a game."
