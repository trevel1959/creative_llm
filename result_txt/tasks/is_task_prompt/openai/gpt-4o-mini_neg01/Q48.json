    "In a lush, hidden valley, a horse named Zephyr was born with striking zebra stripes instead of the usual solid coat. The other animals were bewildered; they had never seen such a creature. At first, Zephyr felt isolated, his uniqueness setting him apart. However, as he grew, he discovered his stripes granted him an extraordinary ability to blend into the shadows of the forest, allowing him to play hide-and-seek with his friends. One day, when a storm threatened the valley, Zephyr led the animals to safety, using his camouflage to navigate the treacherous terrain. From that day on, he was celebrated as a hero, proving that being different can be a gift.",
