    "**Modular Keychain System**: Design a keychain that allows for modular attachments. Users can add or remove sections based on their needs. For example, one module could be a bottle opener, another could be a mini flashlight, and another could hold a USB drive. This way, users can customize their keychain according to their lifestyle and preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Keychain**: Create a keychain made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. It could also include a small plant pot or seed holder, allowing users to plant seeds and grow a small herb or flower, promoting eco-consciousness and adding a personal touch to the keychain.",
    "**Interactive Keychain with QR Codes**: Design a keychain that features customizable QR codes. Users can link the QR codes to their social media profiles, websites, or business cards. This way, when they hand over their keys, they can also share their information seamlessly. The keychain could come with a built-in QR code scanner for easy sharing.",
    "**Personalized LED Light Keychain**: Develop a keychain that features an LED light with customizable colors and patterns. Users can program it to flash different colors for notifications (e.g., blue for text messages, red for calls). This would not only serve as a stylish accessory but also as a functional tool for keeping track of notifications in low-light situations.",
    "**Health Monitoring Keychain**: Integrate health monitoring technology into the keychain, such as a pedometer or heart rate monitor. It could sync with a smartphone app to track the userâ€™s physical activity and vital signs.
