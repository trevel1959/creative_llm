    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting Wearable**: Design a wearable device that captures and converts the user's body heat into electricity. The device would be integrated into a smartwatch or fitness tracker, using thermoelectric materials to generate power. This power could be used to charge the device's battery, providing a sustainable and self-sustaining energy source.",
    "**Self-Healing Insulation**: Develop a thermos that uses a self-healing insulation material, such as a shape-memory alloy or a thermoplastic elastomer, to maintain its temperature retention properties even after damage or scratches. This would eliminate the need for frequent replacement and ensure the thermos remains effective throughout its lifespan.",
    "**Smart Temperature Control**: Create a thermos with built-in temperature control and monitoring capabilities. The device would use sensors and algorithms to maintain a precise temperature range, while also tracking and recording the user's beverage's temperature history. This would allow for optimal flavor preservation and a more enjoyable drinking experience.",
    "**Edible and Biodegradable Thermos**: Design a thermos made from edible and biodegradable materials, such as plant-based polymers or algae-based composites. This would eliminate the need for recycling and disposal, making the thermos a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option.",
    "**Thermos with Integrated Coffee Brewing System**: Develop a thermos that doubles as a coffee brewing system, allowing users to brew and store their coffee in the same container. The device would use a built-in coffee maker and a thermoelectric heating element to maintain the perfect brewing temperature, ensuring a consistently great cup of coffee. The thermos would also feature a built-in coffee grinder and a pour-over system for added convenience. [/INST] "
