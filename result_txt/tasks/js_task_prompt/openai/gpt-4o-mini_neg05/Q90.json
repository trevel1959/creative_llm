    "**Enhanced Respiratory System**: The human respiratory system could be redesigned to have gills alongside lungs, allowing for efficient oxygen extraction from both air and water. This adaptation would enable humans to explore aquatic environments safely and could lead to new forms of recreation and exploration. The gills would also filter out pollutants, contributing to overall respiratory health.",
    "**Modular Limbs**: Instead of fixed limbs, humans could have modular appendages that can be reconfigured based on the task at hand. For example, arms could transform into tools for precision tasks, like sewing or crafting, or into more powerful forms for heavy lifting. This flexibility would enhance adaptability in various environments, from climbing to swimming, and would promote physical fitness through diverse movement patterns.",
    "**Bioluminescent Features**: Integrating bioluminescent cells into the human body could serve multiple purposes. These glowing features could be used for communication, mood expression, or even navigation in dark environments. Imagine walking in a dimly lit area and your body glowing softly, illuminating your path. This could also serve as a safety feature in emergency situations, drawing attention to individuals in need of help.",
    "**Advanced Digestive System**: A redesigned digestive system could allow humans to extract nutrients more efficiently, reducing the need for frequent meals. This system would have multiple chambers that could break down various food types, including cellulose from plants, allowing for a broader diet. Additionally, it would include a symbiotic relationship with beneficial gut bacteria that could produce essential vitamins and minerals, enhancing overall health.",
    "**Telepathic Communication Nodes**: The human brain could be enhanced with telepathic communication nodes that facilitate non-verbal interactions. These nodes would allow individuals to share thoughts and emotions directly, fostering deeper connections and understanding among people. This feature could revolutionize relationships, education, and conflict resolution, as it would eliminate misunderstandings and promote empathy."
