    "**Jealousy Quelling Hanger**: Create a clothes hanger that incorporates calming and mindfulness techniques. The hanger could have clips on it that can be used to attach cards with affirmations, quotes, or tips for managing feelings of envy. Additionally, it might include a small drawer or pouch where one can keep small objects that bring them joy, such as a favorite stone, a picture, or a note from a loved one. This helps redirect focus away from envy and towards personal happiness.",
    "**Progress Tracker Hanger**: Design a clothes hanger that doubles as a visual progress tracker. Each hook represents a different task or goal, and when someone completes a task, they hang a piece of string or ribbon from the corresponding hook. Over time, the collection of strings visually demonstrates growth and accomplishment, reducing feelings of jealousy by focusing on one's own progress rather than comparing to others.",
    "**Envy-Inspired Motivational Hanger**: Develop a hanger with a series of challenges or tasks printed on it, encouraging individuals to complete these activities in order to overcome feelings of envy. For example, tasks could include practicing gratitude, learning a new skill, or engaging in a form of self-care. By completing these tasks, users can build confidence and self-worth, thereby diminishing feelings of jealousy.",
    "**Virtual Reality Hanger Experience**: Create a virtual reality (VR) app that transforms a user's bedroom into a space filled with hangers, each containing digital images or videos of people completing various tasks. The app could include an AI that provides personalized feedback and encouragement, helping users to celebrate others' achievements without feeling envious. It could also offer interactive exercises aimed at improving self-esteem and perspective-taking skills.",
    "**Collaborative Enthusiasm Hanger**: Design a hanger system that encourages community involvement in overcoming envy. Each member of a group (such as friends, colleagues, or family) would contribute to a communal hanger by adding items that inspire them or remind them of their own successes. This could be a physical installation or an online platform. By sharing and celebrating each other's accomplishments, the group fosters a supportive environment that reduces feelings of envy and promotes mutual growth and motivation."
