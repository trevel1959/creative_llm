    "Community-led Water Filtration Systems: The community can be trained to construct and maintain simple water filtration systems using locally available materials. These systems will provide clean drinking water to families and reduce their dependence on unsafe sources of water.",
    "Waterless Sanitation Solutions: In areas where access to clean water is limited, alternative sanitation solutions such as composting toilets or urine-diverting dry toilets can be introduced. These solutions are low-cost, require minimal maintenance, and produce little waste.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: By capturing rainwater from rooftops and storing it for later use, households can have a reliable source of clean water during times of drought. This method also reduces the strain on local water resources.",
    "Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies can help fund and implement large-scale water initiatives. Private companies can bring expertise and resources to the table, while non-profit organizations can provide technical assistance and community engagement.",
