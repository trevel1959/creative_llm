    "Smart Pointer: A smart pointer is a computer mouse that has a built-in AI-powered camera and advanced computer vision algorithms. It can detect and track the user's hand movements, allowing for precise and intuitive navigation. The smart pointer can also detect the user's intent and adjust the cursor accordingly, making it easier to select items on the screen. For example, if the user is trying to select a small icon, the smart pointer can zoom in on the icon and make it easier to click. This feature can be particularly useful for people with disabilities or for applications that require precise navigation, such as graphic design or video editing.",
    "Haptic Feedback Mouse: A haptic feedback mouse is a computer mouse that provides tactile feedback to the user through vibrations, resistance, or texture changes. This feature can enhance the user's sense of immersion and presence in virtual environments, making it feel more realistic and engaging. For example, if the user is playing a game that involves interacting with virtual objects, the haptic feedback mouse can provide resistance when the user tries to pick up an object, simulating the feeling of weight and texture. This feature can also be used to provide feedback for tasks such as typing or drawing, making it easier to learn and master new skills.",
    "Gesture Recognition Mouse: A gesture recognition mouse is a computer mouse that can recognize and interpret hand gestures, allowing users to control their computer with simple hand movements. This feature can be particularly useful for people with mobility or dexterity impairments, as it can provide an alternative way to interact with their computer. For example, a user can use a series of hand gestures to navigate through a presentation or control a video player. The gesture recognition mouse can also be used to control other devices, such as smart home appliances or gaming consoles.",
    "Shape-Shifting Mouse: A shape-shifting mouse is a computer mouse that can change its shape and form to adapt to different tasks and environments. For example, the mouse can transform into a trackpad for navigation or a stylus for drawing. This feature can be particularly useful for artists, designers, and other professionals who need to switch between different tools and applications frequently. The shape-shifting mouse can also be used to provide a more ergonomic and comfortable user experience, as it can adjust to the user's hand size and shape.",
    "Bio-Feedback Mouse: A bio-feedback mouse is a computer mouse that uses biometric sensors to monitor the user's physical and emotional state, providing real-time feedback and suggestions"
