    "Use texture to identify objects: If everything were to turn black and white, you could use the different textures of objects to identify them. For instance, a rough, bumpy surface could indicate a rock, while a smooth, glossy surface could be a piece of glass.",
    "Use smell to identify objects: In a world without colors, the sense of smell could become more important. You could use the distinct scents of different objects to identify them. For example, a pine tree could have a distinctive piney smell, while a flower could have a floral scent.",
    "Use sound to identify objects: Sound could be used to identify objects in a black and white world. Different objects would produce unique sounds when moved or manipulated. For instance, a metal object might have a sharp, metallic sound, while a wooden object would have a more muted, wooden sound.",
    "Use gravity to identify objects: In a world without colors, you could use the way objects interact with gravity to identify them. For example, a heavy object like a rock would be harder to move than a lighter object like a feather. By feeling the weight and resistance of an object, you could determine what it is.",
    "Use light to identify objects: Even though there would be no colors to see, light could still be used to identify objects. Different objects would reflect or absorb light in different ways, allowing you to distinguish them. For example, a shiny object like a mirror would reflect light differently than a rough, matte surface like a rock."
