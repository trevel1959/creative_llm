    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or plant-based plastics. This toothbrush could have replaceable heads, allowing users to keep the handle while disposing of the heads in an environmentally friendly manner. Additionally, the packaging could be made from recycled materials, promoting sustainability in oral care.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Create a toothbrush that includes a small UV light compartment that sanitizes the bristles after each use. This feature would help eliminate bacteria and germs that accumulate on the toothbrush, ensuring a cleaner brushing experience. The UV light could activate automatically when the toothbrush is placed in its holder, providing a hygienic solution for oral care.",
    "**Toothbrush with Flavor Infusion Technology**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates flavor-infusing technology, allowing users to choose their preferred flavor (mint, strawberry, etc.) that is released during brushing. This could be achieved through small capsules or a built-in reservoir that releases flavor as the bristles make contact with the teeth, making brushing more enjoyable, especially for children.",
    "**Toothbrush with Adjustable Bristle Firmness**: Introduce a toothbrush with adjustable bristle firmness, allowing users to switch between soft, medium, and hard bristles depending on their oral health needs or preferences. This could be achieved through a simple dial or lever on the handle that adjusts the bristle tension, providing a customizable brushing experience for different users and situations.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**: Combine a toothbrush with a small water flosser feature that allows users to rinse and floss simultaneously. This device could have a water reservoir in the handle, with a nozzle that releases a gentle stream of water while brushing. This dual functionality would encourage better oral hygiene by making it easier to clean between teeth and remove debris while brushing."
