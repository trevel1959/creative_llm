Incorporating expert opinions and citing recent studies can also enhance the article's reliability.",
    "**Weak Structure and Flow**: An article that lacks a clear structure or logical flow can confuse readers and diminish its impact. A potential issue is not organizing the content effectively, leading to a disjointed reading experience. To solve this, the writer should create an outline before drafting, ensuring a logical progression of ideas. Utilizing subheadings, bullet points, and transitional phrases can also improve readability and maintain reader engagement.",
