    "Electric vehicles: The most obvious solution would be to switch to electric vehicles, which are already gaining popularity due to their environmental and cost-effectiveness. Governments and car manufacturers could invest heavily in developing and promoting electric cars, providing incentives for people to switch to them.",
    "Solar-powered vehicles: Solar panels could be installed on vehicles to generate electricity to power the engine. This would require significant advancements in battery technology to store enough energy for long-distance travel.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles: Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen gas into electricity, which powers the vehicle's engine. This technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a clean and efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuels.",
    "Biodiesel vehicles: Biodiesel is a fuel made from plant-based materials such as soybeans or corn. It could be used as an alternative to diesel fuel in vehicles, reducing the dependence on oil.",
    "Maglev trains: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to propel the train, eliminating the need for fuel altogether. This technology is already being used in some cities, but it could be expanded to include other forms of transportation."
