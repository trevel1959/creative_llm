    "Once, in a sky filled with towering cumulus, there lived a small cloud named Nimbus. Unlike his friends, Nimbus was terrified of heights. He watched enviously as they soared high, basking in the sun's warmth. One day, a fierce storm brewed, threatening the meadow below. The other clouds rushed to help, but Nimbus hesitated. Gathering his courage, he floated upward, discovering that he could create rain to nourish the thirsty earth. As he descended, he realized that heights weren't so scary after all. Nimbus learned that sometimes, facing your fears can lead to the most beautiful moments, even from above.",
