    "**Bicycle Bell Revolution**: Create a smart bicycle bell that not only alerts pedestrians and other cyclists but also doubles as a portable sound system. The bell can be equipped with a small speaker and a microphone, allowing riders to stream their favorite music or podcasts while on the go. The bell can also be programmed to play a specific sound or message to alert others, making it a fun and interactive way to navigate the city.",
    "**Bike Buddy**: Design a companion app that pairs with a smart bicycle bell to provide a social feature. The app can connect riders with other cyclists in their area, allowing them to share routes, tips, and recommendations. The app can also track riders' progress, providing rewards and badges for completing certain routes or achieving specific milestones.",
    "**Bell-o-Matic**: Develop a smart bicycle bell that can detect and respond to the rider's emotions. Using machine learning algorithms and wearable technology, the bell can sense the rider's heart rate, skin conductance, and other biometric data to determine their emotional state. The bell can then play a customized sound or message to help the rider relax, energize, or focus.",
