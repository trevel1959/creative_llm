    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Design contact lenses with microchips and tiny cameras embedded within them. These lenses can detect and recognize objects, text, and even facial expressions, providing real-time feedback to the wearer through subtle vibrations, temperature changes, or even scent releases. The lenses could also have built-in GPS, allowing the visually impaired to navigate through spaces with ease. For example, when walking through a busy street, the lenses could alert the wearer to obstacles, people, or street signs, making navigation safer and more efficient.",
    "**Echolocation Wearables**: Create wearable devices that utilize echolocation technology, similar to bats and dolphins, to help the visually impaired navigate their surroundings. These wearables would emit high-frequency sounds, which would bounce off objects and return to the device as echoes. The device would then convert these echoes into a 3D audio map, allowing the wearer to build a mental image of their environment. This technology could be especially useful for people with severe visual impairments, such as those with macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa.",
    "**Tactile Graphics Display**: Develop a device that translates visual information into tactile sensations. This could be achieved through the use of electroactive polymers (EAPs) or shape-memory alloys (SMAs) that can change shape or texture in response to electrical signals. For example, a user could place their hand on a surface displaying a tactile graphic, and the device would create a 3D representation of the image, allowing them to \"feel\" the information. This technology could be used for reading books, navigating maps, or even creating art.",
    "**Personal Navigation Assistants**: Design AI-powered personal assistants that use machine learning algorithms to learn a user's daily routines, preferences, and mobility patterns. These assistants would provide real-time audio feedback, guiding the user through their environment, and even offer suggestions for alternative routes or destinations based on their preferences. The assistants could also learn to recognize and respond to the user's voice commands, making it easier for them to interact with their surroundings.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Prosthetics**: Develop prosthetic limbs that incorporate advanced haptic feedback systems, allowing users to feel tactile sensations in their prosthetic hands or feet. This could be achieved through the use of sensors, motors, and actuators that simulate the sensation of touch, texture, and pressure. For example, a user could feel the texture of a surface or the weight of an object in their prosthetic hand,"
