    "Artificial Lens Technology: People with poor vision could adapt to a new reality where glasses and contact lenses no longer exist. They could use artificial lenses that are implanted in their eyes, similar to how hearing aids work for the deaf. These lenses would amplify light signals to improve vision, making it easier for people to see and navigate their surroundings.",
    "Brain Training Programs: With the loss of glasses and contact lenses, people would need to rely more heavily on their brains to process visual information. Brain training programs could be developed to help people with poor vision improve their visual acuity and depth perception. These programs would use a combination of exercises, puzzles, and games to strengthen the visual cortex and improve overall visual function.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to bionic eye implants. These implants would use microchips and cameras to capture and enhance visual information, allowing people to see more clearly. The implants could be programmed to enhance certain aspects of vision, such as color or contrast, to better suit the individual's needs.",
    "Virtual Reality Visual Aids: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could use virtual reality technology to enhance their visual experience. Virtual reality headsets could be designed to provide a 360-degree visual experience, with adjustable settings to suit the individual's needs. This would allow people to see the world in a new and immersive way, making it easier to navigate and interact with their surroundings.",
    "Advanced Sensory Training: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could focus on developing their other senses to compensate. Advanced sensory training programs could be developed to help people improve their hearing, touch, and balance. This would allow people to navigate their surroundings more effectively, even without the aid of visual aids."
