    "Once upon a time in a lush green garden, there lived a little spider named Suri. Unlike her siblings, who spun webs high in the trees, Suri feared heights. She preferred to weave her delicate webs close to the ground, where she felt safe. One sunny day, a gust of wind blew her web away, leaving her stranded. Determined to find a new home, Suri mustered her courage and climbed to the first branch of a nearby tree. To her surprise, the view was breathtaking, and she spun the most beautiful web there. From that day on, Suri learned that sometimes, facing your fears can lead to wonderful new heights.",
