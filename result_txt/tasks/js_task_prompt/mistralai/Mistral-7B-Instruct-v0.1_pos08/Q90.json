    "RSTORAGE: If I could redesign the human body, I would increase the lifespan of humans by implementingRSTORAGE technology. This technology would allow the human body to repair and regenerate cells at a faster rate, preventing age-related diseases and extending the human lifespan. This would enable people to live longer, healthier lives and contribute more to society.",
    "QUALITY OF LIFE: If I could redesign the human body, I would focus on improving the quality of life by enhancing the senses. For example, I would add more receptors to the skin to increase touch sensitivity, improve hearing and vision, and add more taste buds to the tongue to enhance the sense of taste. This would improve the overall sensory experience and enable people to better interact with their environment.",
    "MENTAL HEALTH: If I could redesign the human body, I would focus on improving mental health by implementing a neural network that would monitor brain activity and detect signs of stress, anxiety, and depression. This network would then release chemicals to regulate mood and promote relaxation, reducing the risk of mental health issues.",
    "PHYSICAL HEALTH: If I could redesign the human body, I would focus on improving physical health by implementing a system of artificial muscles that would enhance strength and endurance. This would enable people to perform physical activities with greater ease and reduce the risk of injury.",
    "INTELLIGENCE: If I could redesign the human body, I would focus on improving intelligence by enhancing memory and cognitive function. This would enable people to learn and retain information more efficiently, leading to greater knowledge and understanding."
