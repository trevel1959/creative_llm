    "Sound-Activated Bicycle Bell: Develop a bell that automatically plays a specific sound when the handlebars are turned, eliminating the need for the cyclist to manually ring the bell. This would free up the cyclist's hands, allowing them to maintain control of the bicycle while still signaling their presence to others.",
    "Multi-Tone Bicycle Bell: Create a bell that can play different musical notes or melodies when the handlebars are turned. This would add a unique, personalized touch to the cyclist's ride and potentially make them more memorable to others.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Built-In Camera: Incorporate a small, high-resolution camera into the bell. This would allow the cyclist to capture images or videos of their surroundings while riding, which could be useful for documenting their journey or for sharing with friends.",
    "Bicycle Bell with GPS Tracking: Add a GPS chip to the bell, which would track the cyclist's location and route. This could be useful for planning rides, tracking progress, or sharing the cyclist's route with friends.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Air Pump: Develop a bell that also contains a small air pump. This would allow the cyclist to inflate the bell if it becomes deflated, extending its lifespan and reducing waste."
