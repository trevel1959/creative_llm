    "**Steering Wheel to Charge Devices**: Design a steering wheel with USB ports or wireless charging pads built into it. This would be particularly useful for long road trips where drivers could charge their smartphones, tablets, or other electronic devices without having to worry about their cables getting tangled or lost.",
    "**Interactive Steering Wheel Interface**: Develop a steering wheel that integrates touch screen technology, allowing drivers to control various vehicle functions like climate control, audio settings, navigation, and even entertainment apps directly from the wheel itself. This would enhance the driver's experience by keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, improving safety.",
    "**Emergency Alert System**: Incorporate a built-in emergency alert system into the steering wheel. When sensors detect an accident or potential collision, the wheel could vibrate or light up, alerting the driver to take immediate action. This feature could potentially save lives in critical situations.",
    "**Driver Fatigue Detection System**: Utilize the steering wheel as a sensor for a fatigue detection system. By monitoring steering wheel movements and driver behavior, the system can detect signs of drowsiness or distraction and alert the driver, or even suggest a rest stop if necessary.",
    "**Adaptive Cruise Control Integration**: Integrate the steering wheel with adaptive cruise control features, making it easier for drivers to adjust their speed automatically based on traffic conditions. The wheel could also provide haptic feedback, vibrations, or changes in resistance, allowing drivers to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front without taking their hands off the wheel."
