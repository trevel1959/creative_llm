    "A smart cane that uses sensors and GPS to help the visually impaired navigate their surroundings. The cane would vibrate or make a sound when it detects an obstacle or a change in direction, helping the user to stay on track.",
    "A virtual reality headset that allows the visually impaired to experience the world around them in a more immersive way. The headset would use audio cues and haptic feedback to create a 3D environment that the user can interact with.",
    "An app that uses machine learning to recognize and describe objects in real-time. The app would use the camera on the user's phone to scan objects and then use voice recognition to describe them, making it easier for the visually impaired to identify and understand their surroundings.",
    "A wearable device that uses a combination of sensors and machine learning to help the visually impaired with daily tasks. The device would be able to detect when the user is holding an object and provide audio cues to help them identify it.",
    "A system that uses facial recognition to help the visually impaired navigate their environment. The system would use a camera to detect the user's face and then use machine learning to recognize the objects around them. The system would then provide audio cues to help the user navigate their surroundings."
