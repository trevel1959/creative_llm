    "**Global Governance Overhaul**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, traditional nation-state boundaries would become obsolete. A new, unified global government would be established to manage the city's infrastructure, resources, and social services. This could lead to a more efficient and coordinated response to global challenges, but also risks a loss of local autonomy and cultural diversity.",
    "**Economic Mergers and Acquisitions**: The concentration of global resources and populations in a single city would create unprecedented economic opportunities. However, it could also lead to the concentration of wealth and power among a few large corporations and individuals, exacerbating income inequality and social unrest.",
    "**Environmental Consequences**: A single city the size of the entire world would require an enormous amount of resources to sustain, leading to unprecedented environmental pressures. The city's carbon footprint, waste management, and resource consumption would become major concerns, potentially threatening the very survival of the city and its inhabitants.",
    "**Social Stratification and Segregation**: With the entire world living in a single city, social and economic disparities would become more pronounced. The city's infrastructure and services might be designed to cater to the needs of the wealthy and powerful, while the marginalized and vulnerable would be relegated to the fringes, leading to increased social tensions and conflicts.",
    "**Cultural Homogenization**: As people from diverse backgrounds and cultures are forced to coexist in a single city, cultural differences might be eroded, and a new, homogenized culture could emerge. This could lead to a loss of traditional practices, languages, and customs, potentially threatening the city's cultural diversity and richness."
