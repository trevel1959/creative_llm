    "Rechargeable hairbrush: Another way to improve a hairbrush is to make it rechargeable. This would eliminate the need for batteries and allow the user to simply plug the hairbrush into a wall outlet to recharge. This would also make it more environmentally friendly by reducing the amount of waste generated by disposable batteries.",
