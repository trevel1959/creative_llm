    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop surfboards using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, organic resins, and bamboo. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of surfboard production but also appeal to eco-conscious surfers. Additionally, incorporating biodegradable components could help lessen ocean pollution.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a surfboard with a modular design that allows surfers to easily swap out fins, tails, or even the board's core. This would enable customization for different wave conditions and skill levels. Surfers could purchase different modules based on their preferences, making the board versatile and adaptable.",
    "**Built-in Cooling System**: Design surfboards with a built-in cooling system that regulates the temperature of the board during long surf sessions under the sun. This could be achieved through a layer of insulating material or a heat-dissipating design that keeps the board comfortable to handle and reduces heat absorption.",
    "**Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Implement AR technology that displays performance metrics, wave heights, and even tutorials directly on the board or through AR glasses. This could enhance the learning experience for beginners and provide advanced surfers with analytics to improve their technique.",
    "**Inflatable Surfboard Option**: Create a durable, inflatable surfboard that can be easily transported and stored. This would be ideal for travelers or those with limited space. The inflatable design could incorporate advanced materials to ensure performance comparable to traditional boards while being lightweight and portable."
