    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Biodegradable Staples**:    Create a stapler that uses biodegradable staples made from materials like plant fibers or recycled paper. This stapler could also feature a built-in recycling compartment that collects used staples for easy disposal or recycling. It would cater to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the workplace.",
    "**Multi-Functional Stapler with Integrated Tools**:    Design a stapler that combines multiple office tools into one device. This could include a hole punch, paper cutter, and even a small binder clip feature. The multi-functional stapler would save space on desks and eliminate the need for multiple tools, making it ideal for students and professionals who value efficiency.",
    "**Adjustable Stapler for Various Paper Thicknesses**:    Introduce an adjustable stapler that can easily switch between different thicknesses of paper. With a simple dial or lever, users could set the stapler to accommodate everything from a single sheet to a thick stack of papers or even cardboard. This would eliminate the frustration of having to use multiple staplers for different tasks.",
    "**Magnetic Stapler for Easy Paper Management**:    Create a stapler with a magnetic base that can stick to metal surfaces, such as filing cabinets or whiteboards. This would allow users to keep the stapler within easy reach while working, reducing the chances of misplacing it. Additionally, the magnetic feature could be used to hold papers temporarily while organizing them before stapling.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Comfort Grip**:    Redesign the stapler to feature an ergonomic shape and a cushioned grip that reduces hand fatigue during prolonged use. This stapler could also have a trigger mechanism that requires less force to operate, making it accessible for users with limited hand strength or dexterity. The focus would be on comfort without sacrificing functionality."
