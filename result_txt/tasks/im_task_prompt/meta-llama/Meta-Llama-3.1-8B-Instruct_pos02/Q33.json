The gallery features a collection of original, surreal artworks that respond to the viewer's presence, movement, and emotions. Each artwork is a 3D interactive sculpture that evolves and changes as the viewer interacts with it. The VR experience could be accessible through a dedicated app or a web platform, allowing users to explore the gallery from anywhere in the world.",
    "**AI-Generated Music Orchestra**: Develop an AI system that generates music in real-time, creating an immersive experience for the audience. The AI system would analyze the audience's emotions, movement, and biometric data to create a unique musical composition that adapts to the situation.
