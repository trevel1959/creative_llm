    "Bug Hotels: One creative solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to build bug hotels. These hotels would be structures made of various materials like twigs, leaves, and soil that would provide a safe and cozy habitat for insects. The idea is to encourage insects to move into these hotels instead of your home or garden, reducing the chances of them becoming pests.",
    "Insect Repellent Gardens: Another creative solution is to create insect repellent gardens. These gardens would be designed to attract insects with a strong repellent effect, such as basil or lavender. By planting these insect-repelling plants in strategic locations around your home or garden, you can keep pests at bay without harming them.",
    "Solar-Powered Insect Traps: Another idea is to create solar-powered insect traps that use UV light to attract and trap pests. These traps would be made of a reflective material and would be placed in areas where pests are most active. The UV light would attract the insects, and they would get trapped in the device, providing a pest-free solution.",
    "Insect-Friendly Homes: A creative solution to deal with pests like insects is to design homes that are insect-friendly. This would involve using materials that are less attractive to insects, such as cedar or redwood, and incorporating features like screens or mesh to keep them out. This approach would allow you to live in harmony with insects without worrying about them becoming pests.",
    "Insect-Inspired Fashion: Finally, why not turn to insects for inspiration when it comes to fashion? You could design clothing and accessories that incorporate elements of insects, such as delicate lace or intricate patterns inspired by the wings of butterflies. This approach would not only be creative but also raise awareness about the importance of insects in our ecosystem."
