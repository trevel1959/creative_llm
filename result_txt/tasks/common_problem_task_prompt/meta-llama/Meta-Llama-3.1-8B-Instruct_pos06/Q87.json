    "**Immersive Rescue Scenario**: Develop a VR training program that simulates a rescue mission in a virtual environment. Participants will be placed in a realistic scenario where they have to navigate through a burning building, locate and rescue trapped individuals, and escape with their \"patients.\" The program will include realistic sound effects, smoke, and heat to create an immersive experience. The goal is to improve decision-making and reaction time in high-pressure situations. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Virtual Firefighting Academy**: Create a comprehensive VR training program that covers various aspects of firefighting, such as equipment operation, fire behavior, and hazardous materials response. Participants will engage in interactive simulations, including virtual fire extinguishing, rescue operations, and emergency medical response. The program will also include scenario-based training, where participants will have to make decisions in response to different emergency situations. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Disaster Response Training**: Develop a VR training program that simulates various disaster scenarios, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. Participants will be placed in a virtual environment where they have to respond to emergencies, such as search and rescue operations, damage assessment, and evacuation procedures. The program will include realistic physics and graphics to create a believable experience. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Emergency Medical Response Training**: Create a VR training program that focuses on emergency medical response, including CPR, first aid, and patient assessment. Participants will engage in interactive simulations, such as responding to cardiac arrests, treating injuries, and managing medical emergencies. The program will include realistic patient simulations, allowing participants to practice their skills in a safe and controlled environment. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Collaborative Emergency Response**: Develop a VR training program that focuses on teamwork and communication in emergency response situations. Participants will be placed in a virtual environment where they have to work together to respond to emergencies, such as search and rescue operations, fire suppression, and medical emergencies. The program will include realistic team dynamics and communication challenges to create a realistic and immersive experience. (Confidence score: 0.85) [/INST] "
