    "Conservation: Zoos play a vital role in conservation efforts, both by protecting endangered species and by educating the public about the importance of wildlife preservation. However, zoos may also face challenges in raising funds for conservation efforts and in balancing the needs of the animals with the demands of the public.",
    "Public safety: Zoos must prioritize the safety of their visitors and staff. This includes providing clear signage and barriers to prevent visitors from getting too close to the animals, as well as implementing safety measures such as fences and moats.",
    "Staff management: Zoos require a large number of staff members to run smoothly, including animal caretakers, veterinarians, and educators. Managing staff schedules, training new employees, and ensuring proper communication between departments can be challenging.",
    "Financial management: Zoos must balance the cost of animal care, staff salaries, and maintenance with the revenue generated by ticket sales and donations. This can be difficult, especially during economic downturns or when visitor numbers decline.",
    "Disease control: The spread of diseases within a zoo can be a significant concern, both for the animals and for the visitors. Zoos must have strict protocols in place to prevent the spread of diseases and to respond quickly in the event of an outbreak."
