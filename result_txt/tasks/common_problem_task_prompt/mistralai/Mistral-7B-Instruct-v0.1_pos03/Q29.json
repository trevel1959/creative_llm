    "Design a submersible that is self-sustaining and can withstand the extreme pressure of the deep sea. It should be equipped with advanced technology to aid in navigation and communication, as well as to collect data and samples from the ocean floor.",
    "Create a team of highly trained deep-sea divers who are experts in underwater exploration and have experience in operating in extreme environments. They should also have specialized equipment and training to handle any emergencies that may arise during the mission.",
    "Develop a detailed plan for the mission, including the objectives, route, and timeline.",
    "Establish a communication system that can withstand the deep-sea environment and provide real-time data and updates to the surface team. This should include a reliable satellite link and underwater acoustic communication systems.",
    "Conduct extensive research and testing to ensure that the submersible and equipment are safe and reliable. This should include simulated deep-sea missions and testing of the equipment in real-world conditions."
