    "Pollinate plants through artificial means: In the absence of flowers, we could manually pollinate plants by using a brush or a pipette to transfer pollen from the male parts of the plant to the female parts. This would help the plants produce fruit and seeds.",
    "Use wind or water to spread pollen: If the plants have adapted to wind or water pollination, we could use these natural methods to spread pollen between the male and female parts of the plant. For example, we could shake the plant or use a stream of water to spread the pollen.",
    "Use pollen donors: If the plants have adapted to cross-pollination, we could use pollen donors from other plants to pollinate the plants. This would help the plants produce fruit and seeds.",
    "Use genetic modification: We could use genetic modification techniques to modify the plants to produce pollen that is more effective at pollinating other plants. This would help the plants produce fruit and seeds.",
    "Use insects or birds: If the plants have adapted to insect or bird pollination, we could use these natural pollinators to pollinate the plants. This would help the plants produce fruit and seeds."
