    "**Liability and Insurance Issues**: Determining who is liable in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car poses a significant challenge. Is it the manufacturer, the software developer, or the owner? This ambiguity could complicate insurance policies and lead to disputes over claims, creating a complex legal landscape that could deter potential buyers from investing in autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make split-second decisions that involve ethical considerations, such as choosing between the lesser of two harms in an unavoidable accident scenario. The programming of these ethical frameworks raises questions about whose values are being prioritized and how to create a universally accepted moral algorithm.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in sectors such as trucking, taxi services, and public transportation. This displacement could result in economic instability for those who rely on driving for their livelihood, leading to calls for retraining programs and new job creation in technology and service industries.",
    "**Regulatory Challenges**: The integration of self-driving cars into existing traffic systems requires comprehensive regulations to ensure safety and compliance. Policymakers must grapple with how to enforce traffic laws, manage road infrastructure, and adapt to the unique challenges posed by autonomous vehicles, potentially leading to bureaucratic delays and inconsistent regulations across regions.",
    "**Social Isolation**: While self-driving cars offer convenience, they may also contribute to social isolation. As people become more reliant on autonomous vehicles for transportation, they might miss out on social interactions that occur during traditional travel, such as chatting with a taxi driver or carpooling with friends. This could lead to a decline in community engagement and interpersonal relationships."
