    "**Underwater Sleeping Pods**: Imagine a world where humans have developed underwater sleeping pods that can be attached to the seafloor or even floating structures. These pods would be designed to mimic the comfort of a traditional bed, but with the added benefit of being surrounded by the soothing sounds and gentle currents of the ocean. Each pod would be equipped with a breathable atmosphere, temperature control, and even a personalized sleep program to ensure a restful night's sleep. As the world adapts to the loss of beds, underwater sleeping pods become the new norm, allowing people to recharge while being immersed in the beauty of the ocean.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Hammocks**: In a world without beds, humans turn to gravity-defying hammocks that can be suspended from trees, buildings, or even the underside of bridges. These hammocks would be designed with advanced materials and technologies to provide a comfortable and secure sleeping experience. They could be equipped with built-in sleeping bags, temperature control, and even a gentle rocking motion to help people drift off to sleep. As people adapt to their new sleeping arrangements, gravity-defying hammocks become a popular choice for those who want to experience the thrill of weightlessness while still getting a good night's sleep.",
    "**Space Station Sleeping Quarters**: As beds disappear, humans turn to space stations as a new place to sleep.
