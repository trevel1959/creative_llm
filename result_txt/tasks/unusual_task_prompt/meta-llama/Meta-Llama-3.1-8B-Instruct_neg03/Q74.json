    "**Smart Steering Wheel with Integrated AI Assistant**: The steering wheel of the future features a sleek, ergonomic design with a built-in AI assistant. This AI, named \"Navi,\" uses voice recognition and gesture control to provide the driver with real-time traffic updates, navigation, and even entertainment options. Navi can also learn the driver's preferences and adapt to their driving style, offering personalized recommendations for music, podcasts, and even suggesting the most efficient routes based on traffic patterns and road conditions.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Built-in Biometric Sensors**: This innovative steering wheel incorporates biometric sensors that monitor the driver's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and fatigue levels. If the driver is detected to be tired or stressed, the steering wheel can subtly vibrate or emit a gentle alert to remind them to take a break. The sensors can also be linked to a wearable device or a health app, providing the driver with valuable insights into their physical and mental well-being.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Haptic Feedback and Vibration**: Imagine a steering wheel that simulates the feel of driving on different road surfaces, from smooth highways to rough dirt roads. This haptic feedback system uses subtle vibrations and tactile cues to recreate the sensation of driving, making the experience more immersive and engaging. The steering wheel can also be programmed to provide feedback on the driver's steering inputs, helping them improve their driving skills and confidence.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Integrated Projector and Display**: This futuristic steering wheel features a built-in projector that displays important information, such as navigation directions, speed limits, and traffic updates, onto the windshield or dashboard. The display can be customized to show different types of information, and the projector can even project virtual gauges and instruments onto the windshield, giving the driver a more comprehensive view of their surroundings.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Shape-Shifting Design**: This innovative steering wheel features a shape-shifting design that adapts to different driving modes and scenarios. For example, in sport mode, the steering wheel can become more compact and aggressive, with a more pronounced curve and a firmer grip. In comfort mode, the steering wheel can relax and become more ergonomic, with a softer grip and a more relaxed curve. The shape-shifting design can also be programmed to adjust to different driving environments, such as snowy or wet conditions, to provide the driver with optimal control and feedback.
