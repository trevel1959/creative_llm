    "Invent a new pollination method: Create a machine that can simulate the movements of insects and pollinate plants without the need for flowers. This machine could be equipped withlets or tiny brushes that can transfer pollen from one flower to another.",
    "Use a different pollinator: Instead of relying on flowers for pollination, use other pollinators such as birds, bats, or beetles. These animals can be trained to pollinate plants byletting themeat pollen-rich fruits or providing them witheateasy-to-pollinate plants.",
    "Create a pollination garden: Design a garden specifically for pollination. This garden could be filled with plants that have large, showy flowers that attract pollinators, as well as plants that do not have flowers but still require pollination.",
    "Use genetic modification: Use genetic modification techniques to create plants that are more attractive to pollinators. This could involve creating plants with brighter or more fragrant flowers, or plants that produce nectar or other sweet substances that attract pollinators.",
    "Use wind or water: Pollinate plants using wind or water. This could involve creating wind turbines or water pumps that can be used to pollinate plants. The wind or water could be used to simulate the movements of insects and transfer pollen from one flower to another."
