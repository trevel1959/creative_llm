    "**Aquatic Oasis**: Design a surfboard with a built-in, inflatable water pod that provides a safe and comfortable space for surfers to rest and recharge while waiting for waves. The pod would be made of a lightweight, waterproof material and could be easily inflated and deflated using a hand pump or electric compressor. This feature would not only provide a unique experience for surfers but also help to reduce the risk of fatigue and injury while waiting for waves.",
    "**Eco-Warrior**: Develop a surfboard made from 100% recycled and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastic and plant-based composites. The board would not only reduce waste and minimize environmental impact but also provide a unique, eco-friendly experience for surfers. The board's design could incorporate a built-in, removable fin made from a recycled metal or a plant-based composite, further reducing waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Smart Surf**: Design a surfboard with integrated, real-time sensors and GPS tracking that provide surfers with valuable insights and data on their performance, including speed, distance, and wave count. The board could also include a built-in, waterproof speaker that streams music or provides audio cues to help surfers stay focused and motivated. This feature would not only enhance the surfing experience but also provide a new level of engagement and competition for surfers.",
    "**Underwater Explorer**: Create a surfboard with a built-in, waterproof camera and lights that allow surfers to capture stunning underwater footage and photos. The board could also include a built-in, adjustable fin that allows surfers to explore and navigate underwater caverns and shipwrecks. This feature would not only provide a unique experience for surfers but also allow them to discover and explore the underwater world in a way that was previously impossible.",
    "**Shape-Shifter**: Design a surfboard with a modular, interchangeable fin system that allows surfers to quickly and easily switch between different fin configurations and styles. The board could also include a built-in, adjustable rocker (curve) that allows surfers to customize the board's performance and feel to suit their individual riding style. This feature would not only provide a high level of customization and flexibility but also allow surfers to adapt to changing wave conditions and styles."
