A reclusive old woman, known as the Keeper of Echoes, revealed that the music had been trapped in a crystal hidden deep within the Echo Cavern.

A curious girl named Lila, known for her knack for storytelling, proposed a different approach: to create a new sound from their silence. Together, they explored the acoustics of the empty hall, clapping, tapping, and whispering.
