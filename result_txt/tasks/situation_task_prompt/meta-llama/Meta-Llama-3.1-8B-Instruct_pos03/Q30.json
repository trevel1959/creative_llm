    "**Hydroponic Farms in Space**: Establish a network of self-sustaining hydroponic farms in space, where astronauts can grow a variety of fruits and vegetables using controlled environments and advanced hydroponics. This would ensure a steady supply of essential vitamins and minerals for space missions and provide a reliable source of food for future space colonies.",
    "**Microalgae-Based Nutrition**: Develop microalgae-based supplements that provide essential vitamins and minerals. Microalgae are a rich source of nutrients, including vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc. These supplements could be produced on a large scale using advanced biotechnology and fermentation techniques.",
    "**Insect-Based Protein and Vitamin Sources**: Cultivate insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers as a sustainable source of protein and essential vitamins and minerals. Insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and calcium, and can be farmed using vertical farming techniques to maximize space efficiency.",
    "**Seaweed-Based Supplements**: Harness the nutritional power of seaweed to create supplements that provide essential vitamins and minerals. Seaweed is a rich source of vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc. These supplements could be produced on a large scale using advanced biotechnology and fermentation techniques.",
    "**Bioengineered Yeast**: Develop bioengineered yeast that can produce essential vitamins and minerals on a large scale. This could involve genetically modifying yeast to produce specific vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12 or iron, which could then be harvested and used as supplements. This approach would provide a reliable and sustainable source of essential nutrients.
