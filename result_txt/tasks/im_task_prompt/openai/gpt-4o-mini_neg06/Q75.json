    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Design a flavor infusion chamber within the toaster that allows users to add herbs, spices, or even oils that can be heated and infused into the sandwich as it cooks. This could create unique flavor profiles and elevate the taste of simple sandwiches. Users could select from a variety of infusion options, such as garlic oil or basil-infused olive oil, to enhance their culinary experience.",
    "**Multi-Layer Cooking Grids**: Create a sandwich toaster with adjustable multi-layer cooking grids that allow users to make multiple sandwiches at once. Each layer could be adjustable to accommodate different sandwich sizes and ingredients, making it perfect for families or gatherings. The toaster could also have a built-in timer for each layer, ensuring that all sandwiches are cooked to perfection simultaneously.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to easily add fillings such as cheese, vegetables, or spreads directly into the sandwich while itâ€™s being assembled. This could include a small container for liquids, such as sauces, which would dispense evenly onto the sandwich without making a mess. The dispenser could be programmable, allowing users to select their preferred ingredients for automatic dispensing.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design the sandwich toaster using sustainable and eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. Additionally, the toaster could feature energy-efficient heating elements that consume less power while maintaining high performance. An accompanying app could provide users with tips on reducing food waste and suggestions for using leftover ingredients creatively.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Profiles**: Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to save their favorite sandwich recipes and settings. The toaster could feature a digital display where users can select their saved profiles, which would automatically adjust cooking time, temperature, and even the infusion options based on their preferences. This feature would be especially useful for families with different tastes and dietary restrictions."
