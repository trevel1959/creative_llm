    "**Mindful Obstacle Course**: Create a physical obstacle course that incorporates mindfulness exercises. Participants navigate through a series of challenges that require focus, balance, and self-awareness. Each obstacle is designed to represent a common obstacle in life, such as fear, self-doubt, or procrastination. As participants overcome each challenge, they receive a mantra or affirmation to help them stay motivated and focused. The course culminates in a final challenge that requires participants to apply the skills and mindset they've developed throughout the course to overcome a simulated obstacle.",

    "**Chaos Lab**: Create a simulated environment where participants are dropped into a chaotic scenario, such as a natural disaster or a crisis situation. The twist? Each participant has a unique set of skills and strengths that can be used to mitigate the crisis. As participants navigate through the chaos, they must work together to identify and leverage their strengths, overcome obstacles, and develop a plan to restore order.
