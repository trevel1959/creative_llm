    "If all watches and clocks disappeared, I would schedule my day using a digital calendar and reminders on my phone. I would set reminders for important events, meetings, and deadlines throughout the day, and use my phone's built-in alarm to wake me up at a regular time each morning.",
    "I would use natural cues, such as the position of the sun, to help me estimate the time of day. For example, I could use the sun's position to determine whether it is morning, afternoon, or evening, and adjust my activities accordingly.",
    "I would use my body's natural sleep-wake cycle to schedule my day. I would aim to wake up and go to bed at the same time each day, and use my body's natural sleepiness and alertness cues to help me stay on track.",
    "I would use a physical activity tracker to monitor my movement throughout the day. By tracking my activity levels, I could estimate the time of day based on how much movement I have been making.",
    "I would use a GPS device to track my location throughout the day. By knowing my current location, I could estimate the time of day based on the position of the sun and other environmental cues."
