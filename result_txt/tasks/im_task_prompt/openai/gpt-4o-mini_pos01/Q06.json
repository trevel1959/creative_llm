    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella with USB Charging**: Design an umbrella with a canopy made of solar fabric that captures sunlight and converts it into energy. This energy can be stored in a small battery located in the handle, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. The umbrella could also have built-in LED lights for visibility at night, enhancing safety.",
    "**Automatic Opening and Closing Mechanism**: Create an umbrella that features an automatic opening and closing mechanism activated by a button on the handle. This would allow users to quickly deploy or retract the umbrella with one hand, making it especially useful when carrying bags or other items.",
    "**Self-Drying Umbrella**: Incorporate a self-drying feature using a combination of lightweight, high-absorbent materials and a small fan or heating element in the umbrella's frame. After use, the umbrella could automatically dry itself in a matter of minutes, preventing water from dripping everywhere when stored.",
    "**Multi-Functional Umbrella with Detachable Canopy**: Design an umbrella with a detachable canopy that can be easily swapped out for different purposes. For example, one canopy could be designed for rain protection, while another could be a sunshade with UV protection for beach outings. The frame would remain the same, allowing for easy customization.",
    "**Reflective Safety Umbrella**: Construct an umbrella using reflective materials that enhance visibility during rainy or low-light conditions. The canopy could feature bright colors and reflective strips, ensuring that pedestrians are seen by drivers. This would be especially beneficial for children and individuals walking at night."
