    "A laundry basket with a built-in water reservoir: This idea would be perfect for people who live in areas with water scarcity. The water reservoir could be filled with water from the tap, and the laundry basket could be used to wash clothes without the need for a separate washing machine. This would save water and make the laundry process more sustainable.",
    "A laundry basket with a built-in drying rack: This idea would be perfect for people who live in areas with limited space. The drying rack could be folded away when not in use, and the laundry basket could be used to dry clothes after washing. This would save space and make the laundry process more efficient.",
    "A laundry basket with a built-in ironing board: This idea would be perfect for people who are always on the go. The ironing board could be folded away when not in use, and the laundry basket could be used to iron clothes after washing. This would save time and make the laundry process more efficient.",
    "A laundry basket with a built-in fabric softener dispenser: This idea would be perfect for people who want to make their clothes smell fresh and clean. The fabric softener dispenser could be filled with softener before the laundry basket is used, eliminating the need for a separate fabric softener bottle. This would save time and make the laundry process more efficient.",
    "A laundry basket with a built-in deodorizer: This idea would be perfect for people who want to keep their clothes smelling fresh and clean. The deodorizer could be added to the laundry basket before washing, and the clothes would come out smelling fresh and clean. This would save time and make the laundry process more efficient."
