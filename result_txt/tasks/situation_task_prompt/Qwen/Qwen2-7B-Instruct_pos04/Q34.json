    "**Rainwater Harvesting System:** You could build or purchase a rainwater harvesting system to collect water during occasional rain events. This system can be installed on rooftops, capturing the water that falls as rain. The collected water is then stored in a tank and used for watering plants when there's no rain.",
    "**Aquaponics Setup:** Consider setting up an aquaponics system where fish waste provides nutrients for plants while the plants help clean the water for the fish. This self-sustaining system could potentially provide a constant supply of water for your plants without relying on rain.",
    "**Recycling Household Water:** Collect greywater from your home, which includes water from sinks, showers, and washing machines. After treating this water to remove contaminants, it can be used to water plants. Ensure proper filtration and disinfection to prevent the spread of bacteria and other pathogens.",
    "**Water Recycling from Indoor Activities:** Capture water from various indoor activities such as washing fruits and vegetables, cooking, and cleaning. This water can be collected in large containers and reused for watering plants after proper treatment and purification.",
    "**Solar-Powered Sprinkler System:** Design a sprinkler system that utilizes solar energy to power its operation. The system could be set up in your garden and programmed to water plants at specific times. Solar panels would provide the necessary energy, making the system independent of rain and traditional electricity sources. "
