    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Develop scissors with a built-in mechanism that sharpens the blades automatically as they are used. This could involve a small, replaceable sharpening stone embedded in the handle that activates when the scissors are closed. This feature would ensure that the scissors remain sharp without the need for manual sharpening, enhancing usability and longevity.",
    "**Ergonomic Adjustable Handles**: Create scissors with handles that can be adjusted for grip size. Using a simple dial or lever, users can customize the handle size to fit their hand perfectly, reducing strain during prolonged use. This would be especially beneficial for people with arthritis or other hand conditions, making cutting easier and more comfortable.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors**: Design a pair of scissors that includes interchangeable attachments for different functions, such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, or a small ruler. These attachments could snap on and off easily, transforming the scissors into a versatile tool for various tasks, making it ideal for outdoor enthusiasts or those who frequently tackle DIY projects.",
    "**Safety Lock with Cutting Mode Indicator**: Implement a safety lock mechanism that not only locks the blades when not in use but also indicates the cutting mode. For example, a green light could signal that the scissors are in “normal cutting mode,” while a red light could indicate “safety lock mode.” This feature would enhance safety, particularly in households with children.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade Tips for Different Materials**: Introduce scissors with color-coded blade tips that indicate the best use for various materials (e.g., blue for fabric, green for paper, red for plastic). This would help users quickly identify the right scissors for their project, reducing the risk of damaging materials or the scissors themselves."
