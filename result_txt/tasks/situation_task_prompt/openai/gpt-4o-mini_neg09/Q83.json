    "**Bioluminescent Sleep Pods**: Imagine sleep pods that utilize bioluminescent materials to create a calming environment for rest. These pods would be designed to simulate a night-time atmosphere with gentle, glowing lights that mimic stars and moonlight. The pods could be equipped with sound systems that play soothing nature sounds or white noise to further enhance relaxation. The bioluminescent technology would be sustainable and could change colors to reflect different moods or times of the day, allowing individuals to create their personalized sleep sanctuary.",
    "**Sleep Cycles with Virtual Reality**: Virtual reality (VR) technology could be harnessed to create immersive environments that help people \"escape\" the constant daylight. Users could put on VR headsets and enter a simulated night-time setting, complete with dark skies, stars, and calming night sounds. This virtual experience would allow them to unwind and mentally prepare for sleep, making it easier to transition into a restful state, even when the sun is shining outside.",
    "**Social Sleep Zones**: In a world without night-time, communities could establish designated \"sleep zones\" where individuals can gather to rest in a controlled environment that mimics night. These zones could be equipped with blackout curtains, ambient lighting, and soundproofing to create a peaceful atmosphere. People could schedule communal naptimes, fostering a sense of community and support for those struggling to adapt to the lack of night. Additionally, these zones could offer workshops on sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques to help everyone find their ideal rest.",
    "**Adaptive Clothing for Sleep**: Develop a line of adaptive sleepwear that changes its properties based on the time of day. These clothes could incorporate temperature-regulating fabrics and smart textiles that monitor the wearer's body temperature and adjust accordingly. During the \"night\" phase (the period individuals choose to sleep), the clothing could release soothing scents or emit gentle vibrations to promote relaxation. This adaptive clothing would help individuals feel more comfortable and encourage better sleep, regardless of the constant daylight outside.",
    "**Soundscapes for Sleep**: Create a platform that curates personalized soundscapes designed specifically for sleep in a non-night-time world. Users could select from a variety of options, such as rain, ocean waves, or gentle wind, and combine them with guided meditations or calming narratives. This platform would utilize AI to analyze users' preferences and sleep patterns, tailoring soundscapes to help them relax and fall asleep faster. Additionally, the platform could integrate with smart home devices to create a multi-sensory experience, combining sound, light, and temperature control."
