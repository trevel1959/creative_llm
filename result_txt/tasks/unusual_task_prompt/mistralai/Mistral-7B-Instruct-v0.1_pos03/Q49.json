    "\"Frame the Moment\": A virtual reality experience that allows users to capture and frame their favorite moments in 3D. Users can select a location, time, and angle, and then experience the moment as if they were actually there. The resulting 3D image can be viewed in a virtual reality headset or printed as a high-quality frame.",
    "\"Frame the Future\": A smart mirror that uses machine learning to predict and frame future events. The mirror displays images of people, places, and things that are likely to be important in the user's life in the near future. The user can then save these images as a frame to remind them of their goals and aspirations.",
    "\"Frame the World\": A mobile app that uses augmented reality to superimpose images of the world onto a user's view of the physical world. Users can choose from a variety of frames, such as a vintage postcard or a futuristic cityscape, and then see how the world would look if it were framed in that way.",
    "\"Frame the Past\": A time capsule that uses AI to create a 3D reconstruction of a user's past. The user can select photos, videos, and other memories, and the time capsule will use machine learning to create a virtual reality experience that allows the user to relive their past in a new way.",
    "\"Frame the Present\": A smart home device that uses machine learning to analyze the user's daily routine and suggest ways to optimize it. The device can frame the user's day in a way that maximizes productivity and happiness, such as suggesting the most efficient way to get to work or the best time to take a break."
