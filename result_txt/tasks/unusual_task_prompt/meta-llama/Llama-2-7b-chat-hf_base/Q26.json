    "Design a smart tennis ball that can track and analyze a player's shots, providing real-time feedback on their technique and performance. The ball could have sensors embedded in its core, which would collect data on factors such as spin, speed, and trajectory. This information could be displayed on a companion app or device, helping players improve their game.",
    "Create a tennis ball with a built-in speaker that plays music or sound effects during gameplay. This could add an extra layer of excitement and entertainment to the game, especially during long matches or when playing with friends. The speaker could be powered by a small battery or solar panel, ensuring it never runs out of juice.",
    "Develop a tennis ball that changes color or pattern depending on the temperature or humidity level. This could provide players with real-time information about the conditions of the court, allowing them to adjust their game accordingly. For example, if the ball changes color when the court is too wet, players could adjust their shots to compensate for the slippery surface.",
    "Invent a tennis ball that can transform into a miniature golf ball when it is no longer usable on the tennis court. This could be achieved through a unique design or by using a special material that can be easily transformed. This would provide a fun and creative way to extend the life of the ball, as well as offer a new and exciting gameplay experience.",
    "Create a tennis ball that can be used as a portable and compact stress ball. The ball could be designed with a textured surface or a unique shape that allows players to squeeze and release it, providing a calming and relaxing experience. This could be especially helpful for players who are feeling anxious or tense during a match, as it could help them to focus and regain their composure."
