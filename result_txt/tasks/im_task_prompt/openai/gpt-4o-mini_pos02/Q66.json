    "**Modular Compartments**: Design the picnic basket with modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed according to the size of the picnic. Users could have interchangeable sections for different types of food (snacks, main courses, desserts) or drinks. This allows for more flexibility and customization based on the occasion and number of people.",
    "**Self-Cooling Technology**: Incorporate a built-in cooling system using phase change materials or gel packs that can keep food and drinks cold for extended periods. This could involve a small, insulated compartment that activates when needed, ensuring that perishables stay fresh without needing ice packs that can melt and create a mess.",
    "**Integrated Cooking Equipment**: Transform the picnic basket into a portable cooking station by including foldable cooking equipment such as a small grill, portable stove, or even a mini oven. The basket could have compartments specifically designed to hold cooking utensils, seasonings, and small ingredients, making it easy to prepare meals on-site.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign the picnic basket using sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or organic cotton for the lining. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and could include features like biodegradable plates and utensils that fit neatly within the basket, promoting zero-waste picnicking.",
    "**Weather-Resistant Features**: Enhance the picnic basket with weather-resistant materials and a waterproof lining to protect contents from unexpected rain or spills. Additionally, incorporate a removable, water-repellent cover that can be used as a picnic blanket or as a protective layer for the basket when not in use."
