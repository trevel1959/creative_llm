    "A smart stapler that uses AI to optimize stapling: This stapler would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the document being stapled and adjust the stapling pattern accordingly. For example, it could recognize the type of paper and adjust the staple size and spacing for optimal binding.",
    "A stapler with a built-in paper trimmer: This stapler would have a built-in paper trimmer, allowing users to neatly trim their documents to the desired size without the need for an additional tool. This would save time and reduce clutter.",
    "A stapler that doubles as a paperweight: This stapler would have a weighted base that can be used to keep papers from blowing away in the wind or to hold them in place on a messy desk. This would be especially useful for people who work in breezy or cluttered environments.",
    "A stapler with a retractable staple magazine: This stapler would have a retractable magazine that can be extended or retracted as needed, allowing users to easily load or unload staples without having to open the entire stapler. This would be more convenient and efficient than traditional staplers.",
    "A stapler that uses kinetic energy to staple: This stapler would use the user's own motion to staple papers, eliminating the need for a separate stapling mechanism. The stapler would be designed with a spring-loaded mechanism that is triggered by the user's hand movement, allowing for a smooth and efficient stapling process."
