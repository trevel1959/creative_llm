    "Water Filtration System: A water filtration system is a device that removes impurities and contaminants from water. This can be a simple, portable filter made from materials like sand, gravel, and activated carbon, or a more complex, commercial-grade filtration system. By passing the polluted water through the filter, the impurities are trapped, leaving behind clean drinking water.",
    "Water Purification Tablets: Water purification tablets are small, lightweight tablets that can be dissolved in water to kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. These tablets can be used to purify water in emergency situations, such as natural disasters or when access to clean water sources is limited.",
    "Water Distillation: Water distillation is a process that involves heating the water to produce steam, which is then condensed and collected in a separate container. This method removes impurities, such as salt, metals, and other contaminants, from the water. A simple distillation system can be made using a pot and a heat source, such as a camping stove or a wood fire.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. This can be done using a simple rain barrel or a more complex, underground storage system. The collected rainwater can be filtered and treated to remove impurities before consumption.",
    "Water Purification Pump: A water purification pump is a device that uses a filter to remove impurities from water, and it can be powered by a variety of sources, such as solar energy, hand crank, or batteries. These pumps are portable and can be used in emergency situations or in areas with limited access to clean water sources."
