    "**Adjustable Weight Distribution**:    - Ski poles could be designed with adjustable weight distribution mechanisms. Skiers could modify the weight at the top or bottom of the pole, allowing them to customize their poles for different skiing styles (e.g., slalom vs. freestyle). This feature could be controlled via a dial or slider, providing optimal balance and stability based on the skier's preference.",
    "**Interchangeable Tips for Different Terrain**:    - Create ski poles with interchangeable tips that can be easily swapped out depending on the terrain. For instance, users could switch between a sharp tip for icy conditions and a wider tip for powder. This feature would enhance grip and performance across various snow conditions, making skiing safer and more enjoyable.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Built-in Heating**:    - Develop ski poles with an ergonomic grip that includes built-in heating elements. This would keep hands warm in cold conditions, reducing the risk of numbness and improving grip. The heating could be adjustable and powered by rechargeable batteries, providing comfort without compromising functionality.",
    "**Collapsible Poles with Self-Deploying Mechanism**:    - Introduce ski poles that can collapse into a compact size for easy transportation and storage. These poles could feature a self-deploying mechanism that allows them to expand automatically when pulled apart, ensuring they are always ready for use without the hassle of manual adjustments.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Skiing Assistance**:    - Integrate AR technology into ski poles that provides real-time visual guidance. By wearing AR goggles or using a smartphone, skiers could receive overlays of optimal skiing paths, safety alerts, and even tutorials for improving their technique. This could help beginners learn more effectively and allow experienced skiers to refine their skills."
