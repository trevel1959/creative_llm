    "Community-based off-grid living: Establish a self-sustaining community that utilizes renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Members would share resources and work together to maintain the community's infrastructure, reducing reliance on outside sources and promoting a sense of cooperation and interdependence.",
    "Solar-powered transportation: Develop a network of electric vehicles that run on solar power, allowing for zero-emission transportation. These vehicles could be shared among community members, reducing the need for personal vehicles and promoting a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle.",
    "Personal energy harvesting: Create wearable technology that harnesses the body's natural energy, such as kinetic energy from walking or heat energy from the body, to power small devices like smartphones or fitness trackers. This would eliminate the need for traditional batteries and provide a sustainable source of energy.",
    "Off-grid agriculture: Develop a hydroponic or aquaponic system that uses no electricity to grow crops and raise fish. These systems would utilize natural light and nutrient-rich water to sustainably produce food, reducing the carbon footprint of traditional agriculture.",
    "Bioluminescent lighting: Create a lighting system that uses bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria, to provide illumination. This would eliminate the need for traditional lighting sources and provide a unique and sustainable lighting solution."
