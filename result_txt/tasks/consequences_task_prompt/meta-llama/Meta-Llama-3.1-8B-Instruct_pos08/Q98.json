    "**Revival Technology and Ethics**: The discovery of a technology that can revive the dead would raise a plethora of ethical questions. Governments, scientists, and the public would have to navigate complex moral dilemmas. Would revived individuals retain their memories, personalities, and experiences, or would they be rebooted into a blank slate? Would they be treated as fully-fledged citizens with rights, or would they be viewed as \"zombies\" with limited agency? How would society accommodate the emotional and psychological impact on families and friends who lost loved ones, now forced to reconcile their grief with the possibility of reunion?",

Funerals and memorial services would become redundant, and the concept of grief would need to be redefined.

This could lead to a shift in cultural values, with a greater emphasis on preserving life and preventing death. The economy and social structures might also be impacted, as the concept of inheritance and property ownership would need to be reevaluated.",
    "**Revival as a Form of Punishment**: In a dystopian scenario, the government could use revival technology as a means of punishment for crimes. Those who have committed serious offenses could be revived and subjected to a form of \"re-education\" or \"rehabilitation\" through repeated cycles of revival and reintegration into"
