    "**Solar-Powered Wearables**: Design a line of wearable devices that harness solar energy to charge your phone, smartwatch, or other gadgets. These wearables would be equipped with high-efficiency solar panels and advanced energy storage systems, ensuring a reliable power supply. Imagine a wristband or armband that not only tracks your fitness goals but also charges your devices on the go. With the ability to generate power from sunlight, you'd never run out of juice again.",
    "**Bio-Energy Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses the energy generated by the human body to power devices. This could be achieved through the use of piezoelectric materials that convert mechanical stress into electrical energy. For example, a smart sock that generates power with every step you take or a wearable that captures the kinetic energy of your movements. This technology could revolutionize the way we power our devices, making it more sustainable and convenient.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Create a device that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments, and uses it to generate electricity through hydrogen fuel cells. This innovation would not only provide a sustainable source of power but also help alleviate water scarcity issues. Imagine a portable device that can be set up in any location, providing a reliable source of energy and clean drinking water.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Roads**: Design a network of roads that harness the kinetic energy generated by vehicles to power homes, businesses, and infrastructure. This could be achieved through the use of piezoelectric tiles or electromagnetic induction systems that capture the energy released by moving vehicles. By tapping into the kinetic energy of traffic, we could reduce our reliance on traditional power sources and create a more sustainable transportation system.",
    "**Urban Algae Farms**: Develop large-scale algae farms within urban areas that produce biofuels, such as biodiesel or bioethanol, to power vehicles and devices. These algae farms would utilize wastewater and CO2 from urban sources, reducing the environmental impact of traditional energy production methods. Imagine a city where algae farms are integrated into the urban landscape, providing a sustainable source of energy and helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. [/INST] "
