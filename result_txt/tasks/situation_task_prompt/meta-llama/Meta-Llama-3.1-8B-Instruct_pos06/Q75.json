    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that extracts water vapor from the air, even in arid environments, and uses it to generate hydrogen through electrolysis. This hydrogen can then be used as a clean-burning fuel for vehicles. The system would be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, ensuring a sustainable energy source. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Bio-Electricity Generation**: Engineer microorganisms that can convert organic waste into electricity, which can be harnessed to power vehicles. This method would not only reduce waste but also produce a sustainable energy source. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Graphene-Based Supercapacitors**: Develop advanced supercapacitors using graphene, which can store electrical energy efficiently and rapidly release it when needed. These supercapacitors can be integrated into vehicles, allowing them to travel longer distances without the need for traditional fossil fuels. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Establish a network of solar panels in orbit around the Earth, which can collect solar energy and beam it back to the planet as a microwave beam. This energy can then be converted into electricity and used to power vehicles. Confidence score: 0.92",
    "**Methane Capture and Utilization**: Develop a system that captures methane from landfills, agricultural waste, and other sources, and converts it into a clean-burning fuel for vehicles. This method would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also provide a sustainable energy source. Confidence score: 0.88"
