    "A bowling ball that can change color and pattern in response to sound waves. The ball would be embedded with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) that can detect sound frequencies and adjust the color and pattern of the ball's surface accordingly. For example, if the ball is hit with a loud crash, the ball could turn bright red and display a flashing pattern. If the ball is hit with a soft, gentle roll, the ball could turn a soothing blue and display a calming pattern. This would add an extra layer of fun and excitement to the game of bowling, and could even be used as a tool for music therapy or sensory stimulation.",
    "A bowling ball with a built-in, high-resolution display screen that shows the user's score, statistics, and even a video feed of the game. The display screen would be made of a flexible, transparent material that can be wrapped around the ball, allowing the user to see the information without obstructing their view of the lane. The display screen could also be used to show animations, graphics, and even advertisements, making the game of bowling more engaging and interactive.",
    "A bowling ball that can track the user's progress and provide personalized feedback and coaching. The ball would be equipped with sensors that can track the user's speed, accuracy, and technique, and provide real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement. The ball could also be connected to a mobile app or online platform, allowing users to track their progress and compete with others.",
    "A bowling ball that can change its weight and balance in response to the user's preferences. The ball would be equipped with a system of weights and counterweights that can be adjusted to change the ball's weight and balance. This would allow users to customize the ball to their individual needs and preferences, making the game of bowling more accessible and enjoyable for people of all ages and abilities.",
    "A bowling ball that can shoot out a stream of colorful, glowing particles when it is rolled down the lane. The particles would be made of a safe, non-toxic material and would be designed to create a mesmerizing display of light and color. The particles could be programmed to change color and pattern in response to the user's score, the game's progress, or even the user's mood. This would add an extra layer of fun and excitement to the game of bowling, and could even be used as a tool for stress relief and relaxation."
