    "**Biodiversity Management**: Ensuring that the park supports a diverse range of flora and fauna can be complicated. Some species may be endangered or threatened, requiring specific conservation strategies. There could also be invasive species that threaten native ecosystems. A comprehensive biodiversity management plan would need to be developed, which includes monitoring species populations, habitat conditions, and implementing measures to control invasive species.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Engaging the local community is crucial for the success of a conservation park. Resistance from local residents or businesses may arise if they feel their interests are not considered, or if they perceive restrictions on land use. To address this, the park's management could host community meetings, offer educational workshops, and create volunteer opportunities that encourage local involvement and investment in the park's success.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Issues**: Navigating the regulatory landscape can be complex, as establishing a conservation park often involves multiple governmental agencies and legal frameworks. Zoning laws, environmental regulations, and land-use policies may pose hurdles. A thorough legal review and collaboration with local government entities would be essential to ensure compliance and to streamline the establishment process.",
    "**Visitor Management and Impact**: While attracting visitors is important for funding and awareness, it can lead to negative impacts on the park's ecosystem. Overcrowding can result in habitat degradation, wildlife disturbance, and pollution. Implementing a visitor management plan that includes designated trails, visitor caps, and educational signage can help mitigate these issues while promoting responsible tourism.",
    "**Climate Change Resilience**: Climate change poses significant risks to natural habitats and wildlife. Establishing a conservation park means planning for future climate scenarios that could affect local ecosystems. This might involve selecting resilient species for reforestation efforts, creating buffer zones to protect against extreme weather, and developing adaptive management strategies to respond to changing conditions."
