    "Housing Hubs: Create a network of interconnected, modular housing units that can be easily assembled and disassembled to meet the changing needs of the homeless population. These hubs could be placed in underutilized areas of the city, such as empty lots or abandoned buildings, and would provide a temporary, safe, and dignified place for people to live while they get back on their feet.",
    "Virtual Reality Rehabilitation: Develop a virtual reality program that allows homeless individuals to engage in various forms of rehabilitation, such as physical therapy, mental health counseling, and job training, in a simulated environment. This could help address the unique challenges faced by the homeless population, such as limited access to resources and a lack of privacy, while also providing a more engaging and effective form of rehabilitation.",
    "Urban Gardening Initiative: Establish a city-wide initiative that promotes urban gardening and food production among the homeless population. This could involve providing access to community gardens, gardening supplies, and training on sustainable gardening practices. Not only would this help address food insecurity, but it could also provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment for individuals who may be struggling with mental health issues or other challenges.",
    "Mobile Health Clinics: Develop a network of mobile health clinics that can be deployed to areas of the city where the homeless population is most concentrated. These clinics could provide access to medical and mental health services, as well as hygiene facilities and other essential amenities. This would help address the unique health challenges faced by the homeless population, such as inadequate access to healthcare and poor living conditions.",
    "Community-Led Design: Engage the homeless population in the design and development of solutions for homelessness. This could involve holding workshops and focus groups to gather input from homeless individuals on what they need and want in terms of housing, rehabilitation, and other services. By involving the homeless population in the design process, solutions could be more effective and culturally sensitive, and could help build trust and rapport between the homeless and the broader community."
