    "**Stapler Selfie Station**: Create a futuristic stapler with a built-in camera and screen that allows users to take a selfie while stapling documents. The stapler could be designed with a sleek, compact body and a flip-up screen that displays the user's face. As the user staples, the camera captures a photo, which is then displayed on the screen. The stapler could also include features like filters, stickers, and text overlays to make the selfie experience more fun. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Smart Stapler with AI-Powered Stapling**: Develop a stapler that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the type of paper being stapled and adjust the stapling pressure accordingly. The stapler could include a sensor that detects the paper's thickness, texture, and type, and then adjust the stapling pressure to prevent damage or jamming. This feature could be particularly useful for office workers who staple a variety of documents on a daily basis. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Stapler with Built-in Wireless Charging**: Design a stapler that includes a wireless charging pad, allowing users to charge their devices while stapling documents. The stapler could be designed with a sleek, modern aesthetic and a compact body that fits easily on a desk. The wireless charging feature could be particularly useful for office workers who are always on the go and need to keep their devices charged. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Stapler with Integrated Document Scanning**: Create a stapler that includes a built-in document scanner, allowing users to scan documents and save them digitally. The stapler could be designed with a flatbed scanner or a sheet-fed scanner, and include features like automatic document detection and OCR (optical character recognition) software. This feature could be particularly useful for office workers who need to digitize paper documents regularly. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Stapler with 3D Printing Capability**: Develop a stapler that includes a 3D printing module, allowing users to print small objects or prototypes directly from the stapler. The stapler could be designed with a compact 3D printing module that uses a proprietary filament or a standard 3D printing material. This feature could be particularly useful for office workers who need to create small prototypes or models quickly and efficiently. Confidence score: 0.95"
