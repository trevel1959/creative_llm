    "Data Trees: Create a network of trees with each branch representing a different type of data. Each leaf on the tree would contain a unique piece of information. This system would be self-sustaining as the leaves could be used to create new trees, ensuring the information is preserved. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Memory Molecules: Develop a method to convert digital data into molecules that can be stored in a molecular database. This would involve breaking down the data into its smallest components and synthesizing them into unique molecules. The molecules could be stored in a crystal or other stable structure, ensuring their preservation. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Data Crystals: Create crystals that contain data through a process called crystal growth. This process would involve encoding the data onto a substrate and then growing a crystal around it. The crystal would act as a stable storage medium, preserving the data indefinitely. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Brain-Inspired Storage: Develop a storage system inspired by the human brain. This system would use a network of interconnected nodes to store data, with each node representing a different piece of information. The nodes would be connected through synapses, allowing the system to recall data in a more efficient and organized manner. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Information Tattoos: Create tattoos that contain information. This could involve using nanotechnology to encode data onto a tattoo, which could then be read using a special device. The tattoos could be applied to any part of the body, providing a secure and personalized storage solution. Confidence Score: 0.85"
