    "Create a shelter: The first thing to do is to find or create a shelter to protect yourself from the elements. You can use natural materials like palm fronds, vines, and branches to build a lean-to or a hut. You can also use any available materials like rocks, sand, or coral to create a solid foundation. Make sure the shelter is sturdy enough to withstand wind, rain, and any potential predators.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Finding a source of fresh water is crucial for survival on a deserted island. Look for streams, rivers, or ponds, or collect rainwater by placing a container under a tree or on a slope to catch the rain. You can also dig a well or a hole in the ground to reach underground water. Make sure to purify the water before drinking it to avoid any waterborne illnesses.",
    "Start a fire: Fire can provide warmth, light, and a way to cook food. Find dry wood or other flammable materials to start a fire. You can use two sticks to create a fire pit or use a piece of glass or a mirror to reflect sunlight and start a fire. Once the fire is lit, you can use it to cook your food, boil water, and keep warm at night.",
    "Find food: The island may have a variety of fruits, nuts, and other edible plants. Look for coconuts, papayas, mangoes, and other tropical fruits that are easy to find and can provide you with essential nutrients. You can also catch fish and other seafood by using a spear or a net. Make sure to cook the food thoroughly to avoid any foodborne illnesses.",
    "Signal for help: To get rescued, you need to signal for help. Use a mirror to reflect sunlight towards any passing planes or ships, or create a smoke signal during the day. You can also use a whistle to create a loud noise that can be heard from a distance. Make sure to keep signaling for help until you are rescued."
