Offering programmable energy-saving modes that automatically adjust the microwave's power, depending on the load, can also contribute to cost savings and reduced electricity consumption.",
    "Safety Features: Installing child-proof locks, cool-to-touch handles, and an automatic defrost feature can enhance safety in the kitchen. For example, the locks can prevent accidently starting the microwave while a child is nearby, and touch handles can be designed to stay cool to avoid burns.",
    "Multi-Functionality: By introducing a combination of microwave and oven functions, users can achieve versatile cooking options in one appliance. A microwave oven with baking, broiling, and convection capabilities can cater to various cooking needs and streamline meal preparation."
