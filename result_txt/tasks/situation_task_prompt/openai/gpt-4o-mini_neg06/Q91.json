    "**Smart Home Environment**: Create a smart home equipped with advanced AI and sensor technology that monitors your surroundings. This system would use cameras and sensors to detect potential dangers, such as obstacles, spills, or changes in temperature. The AI could provide audio alerts or visual cues (like flashing lights) to guide you safely around your home, effectively creating a protective bubble that keeps you aware of your environment.",
    "**Enhanced Mobility Aids**: Design a specialized mobility aid, like a smart cane or walker, that incorporates obstacle detection and navigation technology. These devices would use ultrasonic sensors or LiDAR to identify obstacles and provide audio feedback or gentle directional cues (like a slight tilt) to help guide you safely through your environment, allowing you to navigate without physical sensation.",
    "**Personal Safety Drone**: Imagine a personal safety drone that follows you around, equipped with sensors to detect hazards. This drone could alert you to potential dangers through sound or visual signals, such as flashing lights. It could also be programmed to create a safe perimeter around you, warning you when you get too close to dangerous areas, like traffic or stairs.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training**: Utilize virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate real-world environments where you can practice navigating safely without physical sensations. The VR system could create scenarios where you learn to recognize potential hazards and develop strategies to avoid them, reinforcing your spatial awareness and decision-making skills in a safe, controlled environment.",
    "**Smart Footwear**: Create footwear embedded with pressure sensors and accelerometers that can detect uneven surfaces, temperature changes, or potential slips. The shoes could provide auditory feedback (like beeping) or subtle vibrations to alert you when you're stepping on something hazardous, helping you adjust your movements accordingly."
