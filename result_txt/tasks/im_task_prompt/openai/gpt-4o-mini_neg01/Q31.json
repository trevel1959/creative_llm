    "**Adaptive AI Editing Assistant**:    Integrate an AI-driven editing assistant directly into the camera that learns a photographer's style over time. After capturing images, the assistant could provide instant editing suggestions, such as color correction, cropping, or applying filters that align with the userâ€™s previous preferences. This would streamline the workflow from capture to editing, allowing photographers to spend less time post-processing and more time creating.",
    "**Multi-Sensor Capture Mode**:    Design a camera that can simultaneously capture images using multiple sensors with different settings (e.g., one for low light, one for high dynamic range, etc.). This would allow users to choose the best image from various perspectives and conditions after the fact. This technology could be particularly beneficial for action shots or unpredictable environments where conditions change rapidly.",
    "**Integrated Projector for Instant Review**:    Add a small, built-in projector to the camera that can project captured images onto a nearby surface, such as a wall or table. This would allow photographers to instantly review their shots with friends or clients without needing to crowd around a small screen. It could also facilitate discussions about framing and composition in real-time, making it a collaborative tool for creative projects.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Charging System**:    Develop a camera that incorporates solar panels on its body, allowing it to charge while in use outdoors. This eco-friendly feature would appeal to nature photographers and travelers who spend extended periods in the field. Additionally, the camera could have an energy-efficient mode that optimizes battery use based on shooting conditions, extending its operational time.",
    "**Customizable Grip with Modular Attachments**:    Create a camera with a customizable grip that allows users to attach various modules, such as additional buttons, a secondary display, or even a mini stabilizer. This would enable photographers to personalize their camera for specific types of shoots, whether they need extra control for sports photography or a more ergonomic design for portrait work."
