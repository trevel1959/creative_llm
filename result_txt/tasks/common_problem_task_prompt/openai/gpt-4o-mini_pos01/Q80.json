    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Catering can generate a significant amount of waste, especially with single-use plastics and food waste. Couples can mitigate this by opting for caterers who specialize in zero-waste practices. This includes using seasonal and local ingredients, providing reusable or compostable dinnerware, and creating a plan for leftover food, such as donating it to local shelters or composting it. Additionally, couples can consider a buffet-style meal to minimize food waste from uneaten plated meals.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples can explore digital invitations or eco-friendly paper options made from recycled materials or plantable paper that guests can grow into flowers or herbs. This approach not only reduces waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding while encouraging guests to participate in sustainable practices.",
    "**Sustainable Attire**: The wedding dress and bridal party attire can be significant sources of environmental impact due to the fast fashion industry. Couples can look for designers who create wedding attire using sustainable fabrics, vintage dresses, or even rental options. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing new clothing and promotes a circular economy. Additionally, encouraging guests to wear outfits they already own or to thrift can further enhance the eco-friendly theme.",
    "**Transportation Solutions**: Weddings often involve transporting guests to various locations, which can lead to increased carbon emissions. Couples can address this by arranging group transportation options, such as shuttles or buses, to minimize individual car use. Additionally, selecting a venue that can accommodate both the ceremony and reception can reduce the need for transportation altogether. Promoting carpooling among guests can also contribute to a lower carbon footprint.",
    "**Natural Decor**: Traditional wedding decor often involves artificial flowers and materials that may not be environmentally friendly. Couples can opt for decor that incorporates natural elements, such as locally sourced flowers, potted plants, or even edible arrangements. After the wedding, these items can be repurposed or given away to guests, minimizing waste and promoting a sustainable approach to decor."
