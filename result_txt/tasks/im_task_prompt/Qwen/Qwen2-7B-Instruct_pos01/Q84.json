    "**Smart Coat Rack with Temperature Control:** This idea involves integrating a smart temperature sensor into a coat rack. The rack would automatically adjust its heating or cooling capabilities based on the ambient temperature. For instance, during colder months, it could heat up to provide warmth for coats and jackets, while in warmer climates, it could cool down to keep them fresh and reduce odors. This not only adds convenience but also enhances user comfort.",
    "**Automated Coat Rack with Personalized Storage:** This innovation combines artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to personalize storage space for each user. The rack would learn users' preferences over time, such as which coats are typically worn together, and organize them accordingly. It might also suggest outfits based on weather forecasts or user's previous choices, offering a personalized styling experience.",
    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Virtual Stylist:** This idea integrates augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to virtually try on different outfits using their phone or tablet while hanging their clothes on the rack. Users can receive real-time style advice from AI-powered virtual stylists, enhancing fashion decisions and personal style without physically trying on clothing.",
    "**Sustainable Coat Rack with Built-in Recycling:** This eco-friendly design features compartments for collecting small items like gloves, scarves, and accessories. It also includes a built-in recycling bin for paper, plastic, and other materials, encouraging users to recycle more conveniently. The rack could be made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics, promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Multi-functional Coat Rack with Built-in Charging Stations:** This idea combines practicality and convenience by adding charging ports to the coat rack. Users can hang their coats and charge their smartphones, tablets, or other devices simultaneously. This feature is especially useful in public spaces like offices, cafes, or waiting areas, where people often need to charge their gadgets."
