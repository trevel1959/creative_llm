    "**Stamping Tool for Fabric**: Instead of traditional fabric stamps, you can use a clothes iron to transfer designs onto fabric. Create your own stamps using foam or rubber, attach them to a flat surface, and apply heat with the iron to imprint the design onto the fabric. This can be used for custom t-shirts, bags, or home decor.",
    "**Heat-Activated Seed Germination**: If youâ€™re looking to start a small indoor garden, use a clothes iron to create a mini greenhouse effect. Place a damp cloth over seed trays and gently press the iron on low heat for a few seconds. This can help to create a warm environment, speeding up the germination process for certain seeds.",
    "**Flattening Craft Materials**: When working with paper or other craft materials, you can use a clothes iron to flatten items like paper flowers, ribbon, or even scrapbook pages.
