    "**Impact on Time Perception**: If the speed of light were reduced to half, it would significantly affect our perception of time. This is due to the principle of time dilation in Einstein's theory of relativity. At slower speeds, time passes more slowly for an object compared to a stationary observer. As light travels at half its original speed, time would pass more slowly for any object moving relative to this new, slower light. This could lead to dramatic differences in aging rates between observers moving at different speeds.",
    "**Communication Challenges**: Communication over long distances would become nearly impossible under such conditions. Messages sent from one end of the universe to another would take much longer to reach their destination, given the reduced speed of light. This would have profound implications for global networks, including internet and radio communications, leading to potential isolation or a fragmented global community.",
    "**Astronomical Observations**: The observation of celestial events like supernovae or distant galaxies would be dramatically altered. Light from these events would take much longer to reach Earth, potentially delaying our understanding of astronomical phenomena by years or even decades. This could impact our ability to study the universe in real-time and could lead to significant shifts in our understanding of cosmic events and processes.",
    "**Cosmological Implications**: The structure and evolution of the universe would be drastically affected. The expansion rate of the universe, which is driven by the speed of light, would slow down. This could alter the rate at which galaxies form, cluster together, and evolve. It might also influence the distribution of matter in the universe, potentially leading to different patterns of galaxy formation and cosmic structures than what we observe today.",
    "**Technological Advancements**: To cope with the reduced speed of light, humanity would need to develop new technologies that can function effectively at slower speeds. This could spur innovations in fields like quantum computing, where information processing might become more stable and less prone to errors caused by high-speed interactions. Additionally, spacecraft propulsion systems would need to be reimagined, possibly focusing on alternative methods of acceleration or using entirely new forms of energy that are not reliant on light."
