    "**Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Create a version of Post-it Notes that changes color based on temperature or UV light exposure. This could serve as a visual cue for urgency (e.g., turning red if left in sunlight for too long) or simply as a fun feature that allows users to customize their notes according to their mood or the environment.",
    "**Post-it Note Wall Calendar**: Design a larger Post-it Note that functions as a wall calendar. Each note could represent a day, allowing users to jot down events, reminders, or tasks. The sticky nature would let users move notes around easily, providing a dynamic way to visualize and manage their schedules without the rigidity of traditional calendars.",
    "**Post-it Note QR Code Integration**: Introduce a version of Post-it Notes that includes a space for a QR code. Users can generate a QR code that links to a digital document, video, or website. When someone scans the code, they can access more information related to the note, making it a useful tool for presentations or collaborative projects.",
    "**Post-it Note Organizer with Built-in Storage**: Create a compact desktop organizer that holds Post-it Notes, pens, and highlighters, with a built-in whiteboard surface. This would not only keep the workspace tidy but also allow users to jot down quick ideas or reminders without wasting a note. The organizer could also feature a magnetic strip for holding notes in place.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Post-it Notes**: Develop a line of biodegradable Post-it Notes made from recycled paper and plant-based adhesives. Each note could also come with a seed embedded in it, allowing users to plant their notes after use. This eco-conscious approach would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and promote sustainability."
