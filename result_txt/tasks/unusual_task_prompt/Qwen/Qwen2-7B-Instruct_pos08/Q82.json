    "**Smart Clothing Iron**: Create a smart clothing iron that learns your preferences over time. It can be connected to your smartphone via an app, allowing you to adjust settings according to fabric type, heat preference, or even time of day. This innovation not only simplifies ironing but also ensures better results every time. The iron could also provide real-time feedback on the quality of ironing, helping users improve their technique.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Iron**: Develop an iron that uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and germs on its soleplate after each use. This feature would be particularly useful in households where cleanliness is a priority, such as hospitals or hotels. It would also extend the lifespan of the iron by reducing the buildup of lint and grime.",
    "**Energy-Saving Iron**: Design an iron that utilizes heat recovery technology. When the iron is turned off, it recovers some of the heat from the soleplate and stores it in a battery. This battery can then power other devices within the home, such as lights or small appliances, making it a sustainable and innovative addition to eco-conscious homes.",
    "**Voice-Activated Iron**: Integrate voice recognition technology into the iron, allowing users to control various functions through spoken commands. This feature could include adjusting heat levels, changing fabrics settings, or even setting reminders for when the iron needs to be turned off. It makes the ironing process more hands-free and convenient, especially for those who are multitasking.",
    "**Iron with Built-in Humidifier**: Incorporate a humidifier into the design of the iron, which automatically adds moisture to the fabric during the ironing process. This can be particularly beneficial for ironing delicate fabrics like silk, wool, or cashmere, ensuring they remain soft and wrinkle-free without the need for excessive heat. The humidifier can be activated through a touch sensor or a button on the handle, providing a seamless experience for the user."
