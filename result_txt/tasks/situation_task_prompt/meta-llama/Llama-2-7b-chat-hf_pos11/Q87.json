    "Using technology: In a world where scissors and knives have vanished, people could turn to advanced cutting technologies like laser cutters or water jet cutters. These machines use high-powered beams of light or a jet of water to cut through materials with precision and accuracy.",
    "Sharpened sticks: People could use sharpened sticks or branches to cut through materials like paper, cloth, or even some types of wood. This method would require more effort and time, but it could be a viable solution in a pinch.",
    "Stone tools: In a survival situation, people could use stone tools like flint knives or obsidian blades to cut through materials. These tools are made by chipping and flaking stone to create a sharp edge, and they could be used for a variety of tasks, including cutting.",
    "Bow saws: A bow saw is a hand-cranked saw that uses a flexible blade to cut through wood. In a world without scissors or knives, a bow saw could be used to cut through larger pieces of wood or thicker materials like rope or bone.",
    "Fire: In some cases, fire could be used to cut through materials. For example, a red-hot poker could be used to burn through thick leather or rope, or a fire could be used to char wood and create a rough cutting edge. This method would require patience and time, but it could be a useful solution in a survival situation."
