    "**Integrating AI and Machine Learning**: Create a smart bowling ball that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze the bowler's release and suggest adjustments to improve their performance. The ball could also provide real-time feedback through a mobile app or a wristband.",
    "**Incorporating Sustainable Materials**: Design a bowling ball made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastic or biodegradable resins. This would reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing bowling balls and contribute to a greener sport.",
    "**Adding a Haptic Feedback System**: Incorporate a haptic feedback system into the bowling ball that provides tactile feedback to the bowler during the release. This would help the bowler feel the ball's motion and rotation, potentially improving their control and accuracy.",
    "**Creating a Customizable Bowling Ball**: Develop a modular bowling ball with interchangeable components that allow bowlers to customize the ball's weight, size, and core composition. This would cater to the unique needs and preferences of each bowler.",
    "**Integrating Wireless Charging**: Include wireless charging capabilities in the bowling ball to eliminate the need for a bowling ball stand. This would simplify the bowler's setup and reduce clutter."
