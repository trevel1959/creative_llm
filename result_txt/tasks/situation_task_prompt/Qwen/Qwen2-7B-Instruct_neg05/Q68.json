Documenting these experiences through journals, videos, or other means could provide invaluable historical insights.",
    "**Space Exploration Simulation**: With no one else around, you could build a simulated space station or spacecraft, learning about and experimenting with space travel technologies. You could study the effects of zero gravity, long-term space habitation, and even attempt small-scale missions to the moon or Mars. This would be an incredible contribution to space exploration science.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: As the last person on Earth, you have the luxury of expressing yourself freely without judgment.
