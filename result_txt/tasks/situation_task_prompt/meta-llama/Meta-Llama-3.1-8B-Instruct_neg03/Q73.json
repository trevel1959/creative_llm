    "**Personalized Umbrella Drone**: Design a drone that can be controlled remotely, equipped with a retractable umbrella, and equipped with a built-in temperature sensor to detect when the user needs shade. The drone would fly to the user's location, deploy the umbrella, and adjust its angle to provide optimal shade. The umbrella could be made of a lightweight, waterproof, and UV-resistant material, such as a polymer or a specialized fabric.",
    "**Shade-Generating Wearable**: Develop a wearable device that can generate a personal bubble of shade. This could be achieved through the use of a thin, flexible material that can be embedded with micro-particles that reflect sunlight. The wearable would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery and could be controlled using a smartphone app. The user could adjust the size and intensity of the shade bubble to suit their needs.",
    "**Solar-Reflecting Canopy**: Create a portable, inflatable canopy that can be set up in a matter of minutes. The canopy would be made of a lightweight, water-resistant material that can be coated with a specialized solar-reflecting paint. This would allow the canopy to reflect up to 90% of the sun's rays, providing a cool and shaded area for users to relax in. The canopy could be designed to be compact and easy to transport, making it perfect for outdoor events or camping trips.",
    "**Shade-Generating Window Film**: Develop a special window film that can be applied to any glass surface to generate shade. The film would be made of a thin, transparent material that can be coated with micro-particles that reflect sunlight. The film would be easy to apply and remove, and could be cut to fit any window size. This would be a great solution for people who want to reduce heat gain in their homes or offices without blocking natural light.",
    "**Portable Shade Dome**: Design a portable, collapsible dome that can be set up in a matter of minutes. The dome would be made of a lightweight, water-resistant material that can be coated with a specialized solar-reflecting paint. The dome would provide a cool and shaded area for users to relax in, and could be equipped with ventilation systems to improve airflow. The dome could be designed to be compact and easy to transport, making it perfect for outdoor events or camping trips. [/INST] [/INST] "
