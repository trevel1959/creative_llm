    "Once upon a time, in a valley nestled between towering peaks, there was a mountain named Tundra. Unlike other mountains, Tundra loved to dance. Each morning, as the sun rose, Tundra would sway and shimmy, causing avalanches of colorful flowers to cascade down its slopes. The valley’s inhabitants, enchanted by Tundra’s graceful movements, would gather to celebrate, singing and dancing along. One day, a fierce storm threatened the valley. Tundra, determined to protect its friends, danced harder than ever, creating a barrier of snow that shielded them. From that day on, Tundra was not just a mountain but a beloved guardian.",
