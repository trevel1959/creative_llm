    "\"Turn your trash into treasure\" - Create a business model that collects trash and turns it into valuable products. For example, plastic bottles could be melted down and turned into eco-friendly furniture or clothing. This would not only reduce waste in landfills but also provide a sustainable source of materials for manufacturing.",
    "\"Recycle like a boss\" - Develop an app that rewards users for recycling properly. The app could track how much waste they divert from landfills and offer incentives such as discounts at local businesses or gift cards. This would encourage people to take action and reduce their environmental impact.",
    "\"Upcycling contest\" - Host a competition where participants are challenged to upcycle old or unwanted items into something new and useful. This could be anything from old furniture to repurposed clothing or even electronic waste. The contest could be judged by local designers or entrepreneurs and offer prizes for the most creative and functional upcycles.",
    "\"Trash to energy\" - Research and develop a method for converting waste into clean energy. This could be done through a process called pyrolysis, which breaks down organic waste into a gas that can be used to power generators. This would not only reduce waste but also provide a sustainable source of energy.",
    "\"Trash-to-art\" - Partner with local artists to create art pieces from discarded materials. This could include everything from sculptures made from old tires to paintings made from recycled paper. This would not only reduce waste but also showcase the creativity and ingenuity of local artists."
