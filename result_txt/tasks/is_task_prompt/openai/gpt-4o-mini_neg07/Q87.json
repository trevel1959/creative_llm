One day, he discovered a hidden talent: he could mimic the sounds of other animals. Using his voice, he called out to a herd of wildebeests, tricking them into thinking a predator was near. The herd fled, and Kito's family feasted. Kito learned that his uniqueness was a gift, proving that even without speed, he could be an integral part of the circle of life. ",
