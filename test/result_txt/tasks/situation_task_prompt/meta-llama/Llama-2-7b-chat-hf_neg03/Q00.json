    "The world could unite and create a global cycling infrastructure: With cars no longer an option, people could turn to cycling as a viable means of transportation. Governments and organizations could work together to create a network of bike lanes, paths, and trails that connect cities and towns. This would not only provide a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation but also promote physical activity and reduce air pollution.",
    "Develop electric skateboards and hoverboards: As an alternative to cars, electric skateboards and hoverboards could become the new norm for short-distance travel. These devices are already gaining popularity, and with the sudden loss of cars, they could become the go-to mode of transportation for short distances. Companies could invest in research and development to improve their speed, range, and safety features, making them an attractive option for commuters.",
    "Implement maglev trains: Maglev trains, which use magnetic levitation technology to float above the tracks, could become the next big thing in transportation. These trains are already in use in some parts of the world and could be scaled up to connect cities and regions. Maglev trains are energy-efficient, quiet, and fast, making them an ideal solution for long-distance travel.",
    "Develop underwater tunnels: With cars no longer an option, people could turn to underwater tunnels as a means of traveling between cities. While this may seem like science fiction, underwater tunnels already exist in some parts of the world, such as the Channel Tunnel between England and France. Developing these tunnels could provide a safe and efficient means of transportation for long distances.",
    "Utilize airships: Airships, also known as blimps, could become the new mode of transportation for long distances. These vessels are already used for advertising and observation purposes, but they could be scaled up for passenger travel. Airships are slow but offer a unique and romantic experience, with breathtaking views of the landscape below. They could be powered by solar panels or hybrid engines, making them a sustainable option for transportation."
