    "Customizable finger holes: Another way to improve a bowling ball is to make the finger holes customizable. This can be done by adding interchangeable inserts that can be easily swapped out by the player. The inserts can have different sizes and shapes, allowing the player to adjust the ball's weight distribution and control according to their throwing style.",
    "Anti-skid coating: To improve the grip of the ball, an anti-skid coating can be applied to the surface. This can be done using a variety of materials, such as silicone or rubber, which can provide a secure grip even in wet or oily conditions. The coating can also improve the ball's overall control and accuracy during the throw.",
    "Improved aerodynamics: To enhance the ball's performance, its aerodynamics can be improved. This can be done by redesigning the ball's shape and surface, creating a more streamlined and efficient design. The ball can also be made with special materials that are more resistant to air friction, allowing it to travel further and with more accuracy.",
    "Energy-absorbing material: To reduce the impact of the ball on the pins, an energy-absorbing material can be added to the surface. This can be done by incorporating materials such as shock-absorbing foam or rubber into the ball's design. The energy-absorbing material can help to reduce the force of the impact, protecting the pins and improving the player's accuracy.",
    "Customizable weight distribution: Another way to improve a bowling ball is to make the weight distribution customizable. This can be done by adding adjustable weights to the ball, allowing the player to fine-tune the ball's balance and control according to their throwing style. The weights can be added or removed as needed, providing a high degree of customization and control."
