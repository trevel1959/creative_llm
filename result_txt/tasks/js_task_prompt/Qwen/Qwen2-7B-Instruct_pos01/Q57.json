    "**Evolving Democracy:** This system combines elements of democracy with adaptive mechanisms that respond to societal changes and technological advancements. It includes periodic referendums on governance structures and policies, allowing citizens to suggest and vote on potential changes. The government would be made up of elected officials who can be recalled if they fail to meet certain performance benchmarks set by the populace. Additionally, there would be an autonomous AI system designed to monitor and predict trends in public sentiment, ensuring policies align with the majority's wishes.",
    "**Decentralized Autonomy:** In this model, power is distributed among smaller, locally-governed units rather than centralized at a single national level. Each region or community would have autonomy in decision-making processes, focusing on local issues while still contributing to the overall national strategy. Decisions are made through consensus-building methods such as deliberative polling or multi-criteria decision analysis. This system aims to increase responsiveness and efficiency by addressing concerns more closely tied to local contexts.",
    "**Stakeholder Democracy:** This form of government integrates various stakeholders into the decision-making process, not just voters but also businesses, environmental groups, academics, and other relevant organizations. Stakeholders are given equal voting rights based on their impact on society, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered in policy formulation. This approach encourages collaboration and innovation across sectors, fostering a more sustainable and inclusive society.",
    "**Sustainability-focused Governance:** This system prioritizes long-term environmental sustainability over short-term gains. It incorporates principles from ecological economics, circular economy, and regenerative development. Key decision-making bodies would include representatives from nature conservation, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture. Policies would be evaluated based on their ecological impact, aiming to minimize resource depletion and promote biodiversity conservation.",
    "**Universal Basic Income Democracy:** This government structure introduces a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a foundational right for all citizens, regardless of employment status. The UBI serves as a financial safety net and reduces income inequality. As part of the democratic process, citizens would regularly assess the effectiveness of the UBI system and its distribution methods. This could lead to adjustments in funding, targeting, or the amount provided based on societal needs and economic conditions."
