    "**Smart Print Assistant**: Develop an AI-driven assistant integrated into the printer that can analyze print jobs and suggest the best settings based on the content type (e.g., images, text, graphics). It could also learn from the user's habits, automatically adjusting preferences over time and even suggesting alternative formats or layouts to save paper.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional buttons with a vibrant, interactive touchscreen that offers a user-friendly experience. The interface could include tutorials, customizable themes, and shortcuts for frequently used functions, as well as a built-in calendar for scheduling print jobs or reminders for maintenance tasks.",
    "**Mobile Printing Hub**: Create a mobile app that allows users to manage their printing tasks from anywhere. The app could feature cloud storage integration, enabling users to print documents directly from services like Google Drive or Dropbox. It could also include a photo-editing tool for quick adjustments before printing.",
    "**Modular Design**: Design the printer with a modular approach, allowing users to upgrade specific components like the print head, ink system, or paper tray as technology evolves. This would extend the lifespan of the printer and reduce electronic waste, as users could replace only the parts that need upgrading rather than the entire unit.",
    "**Wireless Charging Base**: Incorporate a wireless charging base that allows users to charge their devices while printing. The printer could have built-in Qi technology, enabling users to simply place their smartphones or tablets on the printer for convenient charging, reducing the clutter of wires in the workspace."
