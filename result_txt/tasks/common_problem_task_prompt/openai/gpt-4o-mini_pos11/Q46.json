    "**Community Resistance**: Residents may resist changes to the transportation system, especially if they feel their needs are not being met or if they fear increased costs. To mitigate this, the city could host a series of interactive workshops and community forums to gather input and involve citizens in the planning process. This could include digital platforms where residents can vote on proposed changes, ensuring their voices are heard and incorporated.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Upgrading or building new transportation infrastructure can face significant logistical challenges, such as land acquisition, zoning laws, and existing urban layouts. A potential solution is to employ modular construction techniques, allowing for quicker, less invasive builds that can adapt to existing urban structures, minimizing disruption while still modernizing the system.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The overhaul may lead to concerns about environmental sustainability, particularly if new projects disrupt local ecosystems or increase pollution. Implementing green technologies, such as electric buses and solar-powered stations, can alleviate these concerns. Additionally, conducting thorough environmental impact assessments and sharing the findings with the public can build trust and transparency.",
    "**Technology Integration**: Integrating new technologies (like mobile ticketing and real-time tracking) can be challenging, especially for older populations who may struggle with digital interfaces. A solution could involve a dual-system approach where traditional methods are maintained alongside new technologies. Workshops and outreach programs can educate all demographics on using the new systems, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.",
    "**Service Reliability and Frequency**: A major concern with public transportation is the reliability and frequency of services. To tackle this, the city could implement a data-driven approach to analyze peak usage times and routes, optimizing schedules accordingly. Additionally, real-time tracking apps can provide users with updates, increasing their confidence in the system."
