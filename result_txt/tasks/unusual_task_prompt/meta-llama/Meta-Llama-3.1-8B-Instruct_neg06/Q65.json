The cart would be designed to accommodate various types of disabilities, ensuring equal access to shopping for everyone.",
    "**Smart Cart Assistant**: Develop a shopping cart that can detect and automatically add items to the user's list as they pick them up. This cart would be equipped with AI-powered computer vision and machine learning algorithms that recognize products and prices. The cart would also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's shopping history and preferences.",
    "**Virtual Try-On**: Introduce a shopping cart that allows users to virtually try on clothing and accessories using augmented reality (AR) technology.
