    "**Smart Companion Drone**: Create a small, intelligent drone that follows the individual, equipped with obstacle detection and navigation technology. The drone would use LIDAR and camera systems to map the surroundings in real-time, alerting the user to potential hazards through audio cues or visual indicators. It could also provide physical assistance, such as gently nudging the person away from danger or even deploying a protective shield in case of an imminent collision.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: Design AR glasses that can overlay visual warnings onto the real world. These glasses would use computer vision to analyze the environment and identify potential hazards, such as sharp objects, uneven surfaces, or hazardous materials. The glasses would provide real-time feedback, highlighting dangerous areas in red and safe zones in green, helping the wearer navigate their surroundings safely.",
    "**AI-Powered Risk Assessment App**: Develop a mobile application that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's surroundings through their smartphone camera. The app would assess risks based on the environment, providing alerts about potential dangers such as traffic, uneven ground, or slippery surfaces. It could also suggest safer routes and provide step-by-step navigation, ensuring the user avoids areas that pose a higher risk of injury.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Wearables**: Create a series of wearables, such as wristbands or ankle bands, that utilize haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of touch. These devices would vibrate or pulse in response to environmental stimuli, such as a sudden change in temperature or proximity to a hard surface. By translating external sensations into haptic feedback, the wearer would receive alerts about their environment, allowing them to take precautionary actions.",
    "**Community Safety Network**: Establish a community-based safety network where individuals can connect with neighbors or local volunteers who can provide assistance. This network could utilize a mobile app that allows users to signal for help when they feel unsafe or need guidance. Community members could be trained to provide support, helping to guide the individual away from hazards and ensuring their safety in public spaces."
