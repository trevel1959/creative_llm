This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers looking for sustainable fashion options.",
    "**Built-in Wearable Technology**: Incorporate technology into the sweater, such as built-in headphones or a Bluetooth speaker. This could also include pockets designed to hold and charge smartphones wirelessly, or LED lights for visibility during nighttime walks or outdoor activities. This would merge fashion with functionality, making it a versatile piece for tech-savvy individuals.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a sweater made from self-cleaning fabrics that utilize nanotechnology to repel dirt and stains. This would eliminate the need for frequent washing, thus saving water and energy.
