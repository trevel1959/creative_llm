    "**Airships**: Develop a network of airships that could travel long distances, allowing for a more eco-friendly and flexible mode of transportation. These airships could be powered by renewable energy sources.",
    "**Submarine Ferries**: Establish a network of submarine ferries that could travel between continents. These ferries would need to be designed for long journeys and would require regular refueling and maintenance.",
    "**Space Elevators**: Construct space elevators that would allow for travel to other continents by ascending to space and then descending to another continent. This would require significant engineering advancements.",
    "**Sailboats**: Create a fleet of large, specially designed sailboats that could travel long distances. These boats would need to be equipped with advanced navigation systems and would require skilled sailors.",
    "**Tunnel Boring Machines**: Use tunnel boring machines to create tunnels through the seabed, allowing for underwater travel between continents. This would require extensive engineering and infrastructure."
