    "**Biometric Tattoos**: In a world without identification, people could opt for biometric tattoos that store their personal data, such as fingerprints, iris scans, or DNA profiles. These tattoos would be virtually impossible to forge or alter, providing a secure and permanent form of identification. The tattoos could be designed to be discreet, allowing individuals to choose when and where they want to reveal their identity.",
    "**Neural Network Identification**: By implanting a neural network chip in the brain, individuals could access a decentralized network that stores their personal data, including their identity, medical history, and financial information. This would eliminate the need for physical identification and provide a secure, always-accessible form of identification.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Smart contact lenses could be designed to store and display personal data, such as a person's name, age, and occupation. These lenses could be linked to a secure network, allowing individuals to access their information and verify their identity with a simple glance.",
    "**Personalized Nanobots**: Tiny nanobots could be designed to be injected into the bloodstream, where they would store and display personal data. These nanobots could be programmed to respond to specific commands, allowing individuals to reveal their identity when needed.",
    "**Environmental DNA Profiling**: In this scenario, individuals could have their DNA profiled from the environment around them, such as from a sample of skin cells or hair. This would provide a unique identifier that is linked to the individual's genetic makeup, making it virtually impossible to forge or alter."
