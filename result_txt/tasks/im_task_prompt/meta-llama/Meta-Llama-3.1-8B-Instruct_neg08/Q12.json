    "**Eco-Friendly Wallet**: Design a wallet made from recycled or biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastic, bamboo, or hemp. This would reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of traditional leather wallets. The wallet could also be made with a built-in solar panel to charge small devices.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Power Bank**: Incorporate a rechargeable battery into the wallet that can charge small devices like smartphones, headphones, or smartwatches. This would be especially useful for travelers or individuals who are always on the go.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Organizer**: Create a wallet with a built-in organizer system that includes separate compartments for cards, cash, and receipts. This would help users stay organized and find what they need quickly.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Camera**: Embed a small camera in the wallet that can take photos of receipts, business cards, or other important documents. This would make it easier to digitize and organize receipts for tax purposes or to save business cards for future reference.",
    "**Wallet with a Built-in Biometric Scanner**: Incorporate a fingerprint or facial recognition scanner into the wallet that can securely store and authenticate user data. This would provide an additional layer of security for transactions and access to sensitive information."
