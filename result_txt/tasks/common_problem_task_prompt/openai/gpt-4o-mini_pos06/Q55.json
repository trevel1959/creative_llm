    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Securing sufficient funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant challenge. Potential problems include underestimating costs or reliance on unstable funding sources. To mitigate this, the park could explore diverse funding avenues, such as grants, partnerships with NGOs, and community fundraising initiatives. Additionally, establishing an endowment fund could help ensure long-term financial sustainability.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Local community opposition can arise if residents feel excluded from the planning process or fear that the park will disrupt their way of life. To address this, itâ€™s crucial to engage the community early on, hosting public forums and workshops to gather input and address concerns. Creating volunteer programs that allow locals to participate in park activities can also foster a sense of ownership and support.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: The introduction or presence of invasive species can threaten the integrity of the park's ecosystems. If not managed effectively, these species can outcompete native flora and fauna, leading to biodiversity loss. Implementing a proactive management strategy, including regular monitoring and removal of invasive species, is essential to maintain ecological balance.",
    "**Infrastructure and Accessibility**: Designing the park's infrastructure, such as trails, visitor centers, and restrooms, poses challenges related to environmental impact and accessibility. Poor planning could lead to habitat destruction or accessibility issues for individuals with disabilities. To tackle this, planners should conduct environmental impact assessments and prioritize eco-friendly construction methods while ensuring that pathways and facilities are inclusive.",
    "**Wildlife Human Interaction**: As the park attracts visitors, the potential for human-wildlife conflicts increases. This can lead to dangerous situations for both animals and people, as well as the risk of habituating wildlife to human presence. To mitigate these issues, the park can implement educational programs about responsible wildlife viewing, establish clear guidelines for visitor behavior, and create physical barriers to minimize interactions."
