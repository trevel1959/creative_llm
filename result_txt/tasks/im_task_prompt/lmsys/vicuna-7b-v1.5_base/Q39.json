    "Self-reinforcing hose: A garden hose made of a material that can reinforce itself when stretched or compressed, making it more durable and long-lasting. This can be achieved by using a special type of polymer that can change its physical properties when subjected to mechanical stress.",
    "Adjustable hose length: A garden hose that can be easily adjusted in length to accommodate different gardening needs. This can be achieved by incorporating a quick-release mechanism that allows the user to easily extend or shorten the hose.",
    "Weather-resistant hose: A garden hose that is designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, UV radiation, and moisture. This can be achieved by using a special type of material that is resistant to these factors, or by adding a protective layer to the hose.",
    "Hose-mounted sprinkler system: A garden hose that can be attached to a sprinkler system, allowing for more efficient and accurate watering.
