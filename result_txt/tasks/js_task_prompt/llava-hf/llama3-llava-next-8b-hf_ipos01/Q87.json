    "The Universe of Harmony: In this universe, every action has a direct and immediate effect on the entire cosmos. The laws of this universe would be based on the principles of harmony, where every change in one part of the universe would create a symmetrical and balanced response throughout the entire universe.",
    "The Universe of Timelessness: In this universe, time does not exist as we know it. Instead, events unfold in a continuous, unending flow, and every moment is both past and future simultaneously. The laws of this universe would be based on the concept of eternalism, where all moments in time are equally real and interconnected.",
    "The Universe of Energy: In this universe, energy is the fundamental force that governs everything. The laws of this universe would be based on the principles of thermodynamics, where energy can be transformed but never created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.",
    "The Universe of Gravity: In this universe, gravity is the sole force that shapes the cosmos. The laws of this universe would be based on the principles of general relativity, where gravity warps the fabric of spacetime and influences the motion of objects.",
    "The Universe of Causality: In this universe, every effect has a clear and direct cause. The laws of this universe would be based on the principle of causality, where every event is the result of a chain of causes and effects that can be traced back to the beginning of time."
