    "**Smart Sandwich Maker**: This idea integrates a sandwich toaster with smart technology. The device can connect to your smartphone or smart home system via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It can store recipes for various types of sandwiches, adjust cooking times based on the ingredients, and even send notifications when your sandwich is ready. Users can customize their preferences through an app, such as choosing between toasting only one side, adding specific toppings at different stages of cooking, or adjusting the temperature.",
    "**Personalized Flavor Infuser**: A sandwich toaster that includes small, replaceable pods that release flavored oils or powders directly onto the bread during toasting. These pods could be customized with various flavors, from classic butter and garlic to exotic flavors like truffle oil or sriracha. This would allow users to add flavor directly into their sandwiches without needing additional condiments.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Display**: This toaster features a small LCD screen inside the lid, which not only shows cooking progress but also allows users to follow interactive cooking instructions or recipes. For example, it could display step-by-step images of how to layer ingredients, suggest alternative fillings, or even recommend wine pairings. The screen could also display nutritional information about the sandwich being made.",
    "**Sustainable Sandwich Box**: A sandwich toaster that doubles as a compact lunch container. After toasting, the lid can fold down to create a seal around the toasted bread, keeping the sandwich fresh until consumption. The box itself might be made from sustainable materials, like bamboo or recycled plastics, and could include compartments for storing additional items like fruits, nuts, or sauces.",
    "**Multi-Function Sandwich Station**: This toaster combines several kitchen tools in one appliance, including a sandwich toaster, a mini grill for cooking meat or vegetables, a small oven for reheating leftovers, and a microwave function for warming up cold foods. The design would be compact and efficient, perfect for small kitchens or dorm rooms where space is limited. It would also have adjustable heat settings for each function, allowing for versatile meal preparation."
