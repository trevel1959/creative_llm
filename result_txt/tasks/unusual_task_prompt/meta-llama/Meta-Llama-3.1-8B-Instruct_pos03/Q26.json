    "**Tennis Ball Treasure Hunt**: Organize a large-scale treasure hunt where participants have to find hidden tennis balls with clues attached to them. The final clue leads to a grand prize, such as a year's supply of tennis balls or a tennis lesson with a professional coach. To make it more challenging, the clues can be hidden in creative spots, like inside hollowed-out tennis balls, inside a tennis-themed pi√±ata, or even in a fake tennis court.",
    "**Tennis Ball Sculpture Garden**: Create a community art project where people can bring their used tennis balls and contribute to a massive sculpture garden. The balls can be used to create giant tennis rackets, balls, or even a tennis-themed maze. The sculpture garden can be displayed in a public park or a community center, and people can take part in the creation process by painting or decorating the tennis balls.",
    "**Tennis Ball Time Capsule**: Organize a time capsule project where people can contribute their favorite tennis-related memories or predictions for the future, along with a used tennis ball. The tennis balls will be sealed in a capsule and buried in a designated location, to be opened at a future date (e.g., 10 years from now). This project can be a fun way to document the history of tennis and the community's involvement with the sport.",
    "**Tennis Ball Recycling Challenge**: Launch a campaign to collect used tennis balls and recycle them into new products, such as dog toys, bird feeders, or even tennis ball-themed jewelry. Participants can collect used tennis balls and bring them to a designated drop-off location, where they can be sorted and recycled. The goal is to collect a certain number of tennis balls and create a record for the most tennis balls recycled in a set timeframe.",
    "**Tennis Ball Street Art**: Organize a street art project where local artists can create murals or graffiti using tennis balls as a medium. The tennis balls can be used to create large-scale patterns, designs, or even 3D art pieces. The project can be a fun way to beautify public spaces and engage the community with art and tennis. The finished art pieces can be displayed in a public exhibition or left to be enjoyed by the community. "
