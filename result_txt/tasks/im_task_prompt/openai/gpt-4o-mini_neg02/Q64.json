    "**Adaptive Learning Algorithms**: Implement machine learning algorithms that allow the alarm system to learn the homeowner's routines and behaviors over time. This could include understanding when the house is typically occupied or vacant, and adjusting sensitivity levels accordingly. For example, if the system detects that a window is opened every morning at 8 AM, it could ignore that sound at that time to prevent false alarms.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Expand the functionality of the alarm system to include health monitoring features. By using wearables or smart home devices, the system could alert homeowners to health emergencies, such as a fall or a sudden drop in heart rate, and even notify emergency contacts or services.",
    "**Visual Alerts via Augmented Reality**: Create a companion app that uses augmented reality (AR) to visually alert homeowners about security events. For example, when an alarm is triggered, the app could show a live feed of the security cameras overlaid with the location of the alarm, helping users assess the situation quickly and efficiently.",
    "**Community Network Integration**: Develop a feature that connects multiple alarm systems within a neighborhood to create a community alert network. If one system is triggered, nearby systems could be notified, creating a shared awareness of potential threats and encouraging neighbors to look out for one another.",
    "**Emergency Response Automation**: Enhance the system to automatically contact local authorities or emergency services when a serious threat is detected. This could include features such as providing real-time video feeds and critical information about the situation, allowing responders to prepare before arriving on the scene."
