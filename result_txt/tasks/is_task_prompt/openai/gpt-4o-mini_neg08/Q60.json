    "Once in a lush jungle, there lived a playful monkey named Milo. One day, as he swung joyfully from vine to vine, a fierce storm swept through, breaking his favorite swing. Heartbroken, Milo searched for a replacement but found nothing that felt right. Days turned into weeks, and Milo grew sadder, watching his friends play. One evening, he spotted a fallen branch and decided to create a new swing. With determination, he crafted a beautiful seat. As he swung again, laughter filled the air, and Milo realized that sometimes, losing something leads to discovering new joys. He had not just found a swing; he had found his creativity.",
