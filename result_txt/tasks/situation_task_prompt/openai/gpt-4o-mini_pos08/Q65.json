    "**Reflective Surfaces and Mirrors**: Transform your room by using strategically placed mirrors and reflective surfaces. Instead of relying on direct light sources, design the room to maximize natural light during the day. At night, you could utilize candles or other small light sources, and the mirrors would bounce that light around, creating a brighter environment. This approach combines aesthetics with functionality, allowing for an elegant yet practical solution.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Elements**: Integrate glow-in-the-dark elements into your furnishings and decor. For example, furniture pieces could have glow-in-the-dark paint or materials, allowing them to subtly illuminate the room when the lights go out. Imagine a bookshelf with glowing edges or a bed frame that softly glows, providing just enough light to navigate without overwhelming brightness.",
    "**Firefly-Inspired Lanterns**: Create a series of lanterns inspired by fireflies, which can be powered by small solar panels. During the day, these lanterns would charge and, at night, emit a soft, flickering light that mimics the natural glow of fireflies. These could be hung from the ceiling or placed around the room, providing a whimsical yet effective lighting solution that adds a touch of magic to the space.",
    "**Fiber Optic Light Trails**: Install fiber optic cables throughout the room, weaving them into the architecture or furniture. These cables can be illuminated from a single light source, creating a soft, ambient glow that outlines features of the room or highlights artwork. The light trails can change colors or patterns, allowing you to customize the mood of the space effortlessly.",
    "**Scented Candles with Color Changing Wax**: Combine the calming effects of scented candles with innovative color-changing wax. These candles would not only provide light but also change colors as they burn, creating a dynamic visual experience. You could have different scents and colors for various moods, making it a multi-sensory lighting experience that enhances the atmosphere of the room."
