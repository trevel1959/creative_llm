    "**Robotics for Rehabilitation**: Design a robot that assists in rehabilitation therapy for individuals with physical disabilities or injuries. The robot, named \"RehabBot,\" would be equipped with advanced sensors and AI to provide personalized therapy sessions. RehabBot would help patients regain mobility, strength, and coordination through a variety of exercises and activities, such as walking, balance, and fine motor skills. The robot would also be able to adapt to the patient's progress, adjusting the intensity and difficulty of the exercises accordingly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Recycling Robot**: Develop a robot that can sort and recycle waste materials, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and minimizing the environmental impact of human error. The robot, called \"EcoCycle,\" would use computer vision and machine learning to identify and categorize different types of waste, then sort and process them for recycling. EcoCycle would also be able to detect and remove hazardous materials, such as batteries and electronics, to prevent them from contaminating the recycling process.",
    "**Agricultural Automation**: Create a robot that can assist farmers in planting, maintaining, and harvesting crops. The robot, named \"FarmBot,\" would be equipped with precision agriculture technology to optimize crop growth, detect pests and diseases, and apply targeted fertilizers and pesticides. FarmBot would also be able to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and other environmental factors to ensure optimal growing conditions.",
    "**Disaster Response Robot**: Design a robot that can quickly respond to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. The robot, called \"RescueBot,\" would be equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems to navigate through debris and rubble, locate survivors, and provide critical care and support. RescueBot would also be able to assess damage to infrastructure and provide critical information to emergency responders.",
    "**Artistic Expression Robot**: Create a robot that can generate and create art, music, and other forms of creative expression. The robot, named \"ArtiBot,\" would be equipped with advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities to analyze and understand different art forms, then generate new and original pieces. ArtiBot would be able to create a wide range of art, from paintings and sculptures to music and dance, and would be able to adapt to different styles and themes. [/INST] "
