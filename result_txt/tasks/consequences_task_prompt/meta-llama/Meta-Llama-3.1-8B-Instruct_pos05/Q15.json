    "**Global Shift to Renewable Energy**: The world would accelerate its transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and mitigating climate change. As a result, the global economy would experience a significant shift, with new industries and job opportunities emerging in the renewable energy sector.",
    "**Mass Migration and Social Unrest**: The depletion of oil would lead to widespread economic disruption, causing a significant increase in unemployment and poverty. This, in turn, would lead to mass migration from urban areas to rural areas, where people would seek to grow their own food and find alternative means of survival. Social unrest and conflict would become more common as people struggle to adapt to the new reality.",
    "**Revival of Local Economies**: The scarcity of oil would force communities to become more self-sufficient, leading to a revival of local economies. People would focus on producing their own food, building their own homes, and relying on local services. This would lead to a more sustainable and equitable society, where communities are more connected and resilient.",
    "**New Forms of Transportation**: The world would see a significant shift in transportation, with the development of new, sustainable modes of transportation such as electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. This would lead to a reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improving public health and the environment.",
    "**Global Cooperation and Innovation**: The depletion of oil would bring nations together, as they would need to cooperate to find alternative energy sources and develop new technologies. This would lead to a new era of global cooperation and innovation, with scientists, engineers, and policymakers working together to create a more sustainable future."
