    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are another option for powering vehicles without oil. Hydrogen is a clean and abundant element that can be produced from various sources, including water, natural gas, and coal. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which can be used to power electric vehicles. This technology is already in use in some commercial vehicles and is expected to become more widespread in the future.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are made from organic matter, such as plants and algae, and can be used to power vehicles. Biofuels are a renewable resource and can be produced from various sources, including agricultural waste and algae. They can be used to power internal combustion engines or can be converted into electricity to power electric vehicles.",
    "Nuclear power: Nuclear power plants generate electricity by splitting atoms, which can be used to power electric vehicles. Nuclear power is a reliable and sustainable source of energy that can be used to power vehicles without the need for oil.",
    "Solar power: Solar power is a clean and renewable source of energy that can be used to power vehicles. Solar panels can be installed on buildings or on the roofs of vehicles to generate electricity, which can be used to power electric vehicles.",
    "Wind power: Wind power is another renewable source of energy that can be used to power vehicles. Wind turbines can be installed in open areas to generate electricity, which can be used to power electric vehicles."
