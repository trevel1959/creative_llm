The twist: the stories are hidden in plain sight, encoded in the artwork itself, and can only be deciphered using a custom-built app that uses AI-powered image recognition and natural language processing to decode the hidden messages.",
    "An immersive, interactive theater experience where the audience is transported to a fantastical world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. The twist: the audience members are not just passive observers, but active participants who can influence the story through their choices and actions, which are tracked and reflected in real-time through a custom-built virtual reality system.",
