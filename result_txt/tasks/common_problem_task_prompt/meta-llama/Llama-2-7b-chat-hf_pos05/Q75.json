    "Eco-tourism hub: Establish the park as an eco-tourism hub by offering guided tours, hiking trails, and educational programs that highlight the park's unique biodiversity and promote sustainable tourism practices. This will attract environmentally conscious travelers who are eager to experience nature while minimizing their impact on the environment.",
    "Community outreach and engagement: Develop partnerships with local communities and engage in outreach programs to educate them about the importance of conservation and sustainable management of the park. This will help to build trust and support from the local community, ensuring that the park is managed in a way that benefits both the environment and the local population.",
    "Renewable energy infrastructure: Invest in renewable energy infrastructure such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power to reduce the park's carbon footprint and provide a sustainable source of energy. This will not only reduce the park's reliance on non-renewable energy sources but also serve as an example for other national parks and communities to follow.",
    "Water conservation and management: Implement water conservation measures such as rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and efficient irrigation systems to reduce the park's water usage and protect this vital resource. This will not only help to conserve water but also reduce the park's operating costs and minimize the impact of droughts and water shortages.",
    "Innovative waste management: Develop and implement innovative waste management strategies such as composting, recycling, and waste-to-energy programs to minimize the park's waste output and promote sustainable waste management practices. This will not only reduce the park's waste disposal costs but also help to protect the environment and promote sustainable practices within the park and beyond."
