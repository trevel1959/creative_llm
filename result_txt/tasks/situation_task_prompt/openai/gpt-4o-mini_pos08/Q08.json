    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Create a rainwater collection system using large, clean containers or barrels. Position them strategically to capture rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces. This water can be filtered through a series of sand and charcoal filters to remove impurities and then treated with UV light or boiled to ensure it is safe for drinking. This method not only provides a clean water source but also promotes sustainable practices.",
    "**Bioremediation with Plants**: Develop a bioremediation garden using specific plants known for their ability to absorb and filter pollutants from water. Species such as water hyacinth or duckweed can be cultivated in a controlled environment where they take up contaminants. After allowing these plants to process the water, the remaining liquid can be filtered and purified for drinking. This method not only cleans water but also promotes biodiversity and ecological balance.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration Units**: Design and manufacture portable water filtration devices that utilize advanced filtration technologies such as activated carbon, ceramic filters, and UV purification. These devices could be compact and easy to use, allowing individuals to filter and purify small quantities of water from contaminated sources quickly. This approach would empower communities to take control of their water supply and ensure access to clean drinking water.",
    "**Desalination using Wind Energy**: In coastal areas, build small-scale desalination plants powered by wind turbines. These plants can use reverse osmosis or solar desalination techniques to convert seawater into fresh drinking water. By harnessing renewable energy, this method provides a sustainable solution to water scarcity while also addressing pollution issues in freshwater sources.",
    "**Community Water Purification Workshops**: Organize community workshops focused on teaching individuals how to build their own water purification systems using local materials. This could include constructing sand filters, charcoal filters, or solar stills. By empowering communities with knowledge and skills, this initiative fosters resilience and encourages collective problem-solving in the face of water pollution."
