    "**Sustainable Solar-Powered Tiny House:** Design a tiny house that incorporates solar panels for energy production. This not only reduces the environmental impact but also significantly lowers utility costs over time. The house could feature large windows to maximize natural light and passive solar gain. Include rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation or toilet flushing, making it self-sufficient in water supply as well. The design should prioritize natural materials and eco-friendly insulation to enhance thermal efficiency.",
    "**Smart Tiny House with IoT Integration:** Create a tiny house that integrates smart home technology for enhanced functionality and convenience. Incorporate devices such as smart thermostats, lighting systems, and appliances controlled via a mobile app or voice command. Utilize sensors for monitoring air quality, temperature, and humidity, adjusting systems automatically to optimize comfort and energy use. A centralized smart hub could manage all connected devices, providing a seamless and efficient living experience.",
    "**Customizable Modular Tiny House:** Design a modular tiny house system that allows for easy customization based on user preferences and changing needs. Each module could be designed for specific functions like sleeping, cooking, or storage, and interconnected through standardized interfaces. The modules could be expanded or reconfigured over time, enabling homeowners to adapt their living space without needing to build from scratch. This approach encourages sustainable growth and flexibility in housing solutions.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tiny House with Vertical Space Optimization:** Develop a tiny house that maximizes vertical space to create more usable area without increasing the footprint. Use loft beds, pull-out furniture, and multi-level storage systems. Incorporate rotating shelves, hidden drawers, and foldable surfaces to efficiently utilize every inch of available space. The design should prioritize vertical living spaces for bedrooms, offices, and living rooms, making the most of limited floor space.",
    "**Tiny House with an Integrated Workshop:** Design a tiny house that includes a compact yet functional workshop area, ideal for individuals who enjoy hobbies or require workspace for their profession. This could involve designing a space with adjustable workbenches, tool storage, and electrical outlets for power tools. Include overhead storage for large items and incorporate natural light sources for better visibility during tasks. This design caters to those who value versatility in their living space, allowing them to pursue their interests while maintaining a minimalist lifestyle."
