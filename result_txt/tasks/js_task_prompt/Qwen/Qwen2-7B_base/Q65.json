    "A symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a tree that enhances carbon sequestration. The fungus would be engineered to produce enzymes that break down organic matter in the soil, releasing carbon back into the atmosphere. The tree would then absorb the carbon through root nodules, and convert it into wood and other biomass. This relationship would create a closed-loop system that efficiently sequesters carbon and produces renewable resources.",
    "An insect-like organism that preys on greenhouse gases, converting them into harmless compounds. The organism would be designed to survive in extreme environments, such as industrial waste dumps or arctic tundra. It would incorporate sensors that detect the presence of harmful gases, and release enzymes that degrade them into harmless products.",
    "A synthetic organism that produces a biofuel from sunlight and carbon dioxide. The organism would be designed to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, and then convert the glucose into a biofuel. The biofuel could be used as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.",
    "A plant-like organism that grows in dense, vertical structures, covering buildings and landscapes. The organism would be engineered to produce its own nutrients, using sunlight and water as sources. It would also absorb carbon dioxide, and convert it into oxygen and biomass. The organism would be designed to be easy to maintain, with automated irrigation and nutrient delivery systems.",
    "An air-breathing organism that feeds on bacteria and other microorganisms. The organism would be designed to survive in low-oxygen environments, such as contaminated soil and water. It would be engineered to consume harmful bacteria, and convert them into carbon-neutral compounds. The organism could be used to clean up polluted environments, such as oil spills and chemical dumps."
