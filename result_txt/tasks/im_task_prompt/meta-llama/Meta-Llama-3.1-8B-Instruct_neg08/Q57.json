    "**Multi-Modal Input**: Develop a computer mouse that accepts input from various modalities, such as voice commands, hand gestures, and even brain-computer interface signals. This would enable users to interact with their computers in a more natural and intuitive way.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Surface**: Create a computer mouse with a self-cleaning surface that repels dirt, dust, and germs. This could be achieved through the use of nanotechnology or advanced materials that change color or texture when exposed to contaminants.",
    "**Wireless Power Transfer**: Design a computer mouse that uses wireless power transfer technology to recharge its batteries, eliminating the need for cables or charging docks. This would make the mouse more portable and convenient to use.",
    "**Haptic Feedback**: Develop a computer mouse that provides haptic feedback to the user, allowing them to feel tactile sensations when interacting with virtual objects or environments. This could enhance the gaming experience and provide a more immersive experience.",
    "**Autonomous Navigation**: Create a computer mouse that can navigate on its own, using AI and machine learning algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles. This would be particularly useful for users with mobility impairments or those who need to navigate complex virtual environments."
