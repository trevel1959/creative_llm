    "Building a tree house requires proper planning and execution to ensure the structure is safe and sturdy. Potential problems that may arise include: * The tree may not have sufficient strength to support the weight of the tree house. * The tree's branches may not be stable or strong enough to support the structure. * The tree may be protected by local regulations, which may require obtaining permits or facing penalties for construction. * Weather conditions, such as storms or strong winds, may affect the stability of the tree house. * The tree house may be built too high, making it difficult to access for maintenance or occupants. * The tree may have pests or diseases that could compromise its structural integrity over time. * The tree house may obstruct the view of nearby properties or violate neighborhood regulations.",
