    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Health Monitoring**: Create a pair of glasses that not only block UV rays but also monitor your health in real-time. The lenses could have embedded sensors to detect changes in blood pressure, oxygen levels, or even track your heart rate. This would be especially beneficial for individuals with chronic conditions, providing instant data that can be immediately shared with healthcare providers.",
    "**Smart Reading Glasses for the Elderly**: Design glasses specifically for seniors, equipped with advanced features such as magnification, text-to-speech capabilities, and a feature to highlight and annotate text. These glasses could also include an audio guide that reads out information about surroundings, helping the elderly navigate unfamiliar environments safely and easily.",
    "**Glasses with Changeable Lenses for Fashion**: Offer glasses with interchangeable lens options, where each lens could be designed with different colors, patterns, or even themes (like floral, geometric, abstract). This allows users to change their look instantly without having to buy multiple pairs of glasses. The frames themselves could be made from lightweight, flexible materials that are easy to adjust for comfort.",
    "**Virtual Reality Enhancing Glasses**: Develop glasses that combine augmented reality with virtual reality. These glasses could overlay digital information on the real world while also enabling users to enter immersive virtual environments. This technology could be particularly useful in education, gaming, or training simulations, offering a more engaging and interactive experience than traditional VR setups.",
    "**Glasses with Built-in Environmental Awareness Tools**: Create glasses that not only improve vision but also enhance awareness of environmental factors around the user. For example, they could alert wearers to air quality changes, provide notifications about nearby noise pollution, or even detect temperature variations. This feature would be valuable for those who spend significant time outdoors, helping them make informed decisions about their environment."
