    "Overwhelming Information Overload: With the ability to remember everything read, humans would be bombarded with an immense amount of information, making it difficult to filter and prioritize what's important. This could lead to information overload, causing confusion, anxiety, and difficulty making decisions.",
    "Loss of Personal Identity: With every memory stored, there would be no room for personal growth or self-discovery. Humans rely on their ability to forget and move on to form their own identities. Without this ability, individuals may feel lost and unable to develop their own unique personalities.",
    "Uncontrollable Memory Recall: If humans could remember everything, there would be no escaping the constant recall of painful or traumatic memories. This could lead to emotional distress, anxiety, and even mental health issues.",
    "Increased Social Isolation: With the ability to recall every interaction, humans may become overly critical of themselves and others, leading to increased social isolation. The inability to move on from past conflicts or misunderstandings could make it challenging to maintain healthy relationships.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas: With the ability to recall every detail of every event, humans would be faced with ethical dilemmas on a daily basis. For example, if someone were to steal a valuable item, the ability to remember every detail of the theft could lead to an inability to forget the transgression, causing guilt and shame that could be difficult to shake off."
