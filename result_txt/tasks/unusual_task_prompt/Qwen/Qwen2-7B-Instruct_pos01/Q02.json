    "**Rubber Hand Illusion as a Teaching Tool**: In psychology classes, we can use a rubber hand illusion to demonstrate how our brains interpret sensory information. For example, synchronizing tactile stimulation on a rubber hand with the actual hand of a participant can make them perceive that the rubber hand is their own. This can be used to teach about sensory integration, perception, and brain plasticity. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Art Installation**: Create an art installation where participants can interact with a large, animated rubber hand displayed in a public space. The hand could react to touch or movement, potentially performing actions or displaying emotions, engaging the audience in an interactive and immersive experience. This could explore themes of human interaction, technology, and the boundaries of self-awareness. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Interactive Virtual Reality Game**: Design a VR game where players control a rubber hand and must perform tasks that require dexterity and precision. The game could incorporate elements like puzzle-solving, platforming, or even combat scenarios. The use of a rubber hand would add a unique challenge and could enhance the sense of immersion, especially when combined with haptic feedback. **Confidence Score: 0.7**",
    "**Sensory Rehabilitation Tool**: Develop a rubber hand device for individuals with limb amputations or those recovering from injuries. By stimulating the rubber hand's skin and muscles with sensations that mimic the original limb, it might help stimulate neural pathways and aid in rehabilitation processes. This could potentially improve motor skills and sensation recovery. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Ergonomic Workstation Accessory**: Create a rubber hand-shaped grip for computer mice or other small handheld devices. This could provide additional support and comfort for people who spend long hours using computers, especially those with limited mobility or repetitive strain injuries. It could also be designed with specific textures or materials to cater to different needs, such as better grip for those with arthritis. **Confidence Score: 0.8**"
