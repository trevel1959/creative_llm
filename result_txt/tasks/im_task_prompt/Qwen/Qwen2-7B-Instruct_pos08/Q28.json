    "**Innovative Bicycle Helmet with Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Design a bicycle helmet that integrates AR technology. The helmet would project navigation directions directly onto the rider's line of sight, eliminating the need to look down at a separate device or map. This would enhance safety by keeping the rider's attention on the road, and also make navigation more convenient and engaging.",
    "**Bicycle Helmet as a Mobile Power Bank**: Create a bicycle helmet that doubles as a mobile power bank. The helmet would be equipped with rechargeable batteries, allowing riders to charge their smartphones or other devices while on the go. This could prove particularly useful for emergency situations where a phone might be dead, or for staying connected during long commutes.",
    "**Personalized Health Monitoring Bicycle Helmet**: Develop a helmet that includes sensors for monitoring vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and even brain activity. This could provide real-time health data to the rider, helping them adjust their riding pace or notify them of potential health issues. It could also alert emergency services in case of a critical situation.",
    "**Recyclable Bicycle Helmets Made from Bamboo Fibers**: Design a helmet made from sustainable materials like bamboo fibers, which are known for their strength and durability. This not only promotes eco-friendly practices but also reduces the environmental impact of helmet production. The helmet would feature a unique design, making it appealing to those who prioritize sustainability in their choices.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Helmet with Smart LED Lighting**: Integrate smart LED lighting into the helmet design that can change colors based on the user's preferences or the current weather conditions. The lighting could also include patterns that help alert drivers and pedestrians to the rider's presence, enhancing visibility. Additionally, the helmet could incorporate a system that adjusts the brightness of the lights based on the light levels, ensuring the rider is always visible when needed."
