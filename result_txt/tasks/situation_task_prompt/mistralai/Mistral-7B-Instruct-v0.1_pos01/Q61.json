    "Invent a pollinator robot: I would design a robot that can move from plant to plant, collecting pollen from the male parts of the flower and transferring it to the female parts of the plant. This robot could be programmed to recognize different types of plants and pollinate them accordingly.",
    "Use wind to pollinate plants: If all the flowers disappeared, wind could still be used to pollinate plants. This would require a deep understanding of wind patterns and the timing of flowering. By strategically planting flowers that bloom at different times, we could ensure that they are pollinated by the wind.",
    "Use animals to pollinate plants: Many animals, such as bees and butterflies, are natural pollinators. If all the flowers disappeared, we could introduce new species of plants that attract these animals and encourage them to pollinate the plants.",
    "Use a pollinator drone: A drone could be equipped with a camera and a small pollinator arm that could be used to collect pollen from one plant and transfer it to another. The drone could be programmed to fly from plant to plant, pollinating them as it goes.",
    "Use genetic engineering to create self-pollinating plants: Genetic engineering could be used to create plants that are capable of pollinating themselves. This would require a deep understanding of plant biology and genetics, but could be a viable solution if all other methods fail."
