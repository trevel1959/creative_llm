    "Wheelchair Upgrade: Another option would be to integrate a high-tech wheelchair that utilizes advanced suspension systems, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to adapt to any changes in terrain. This would give the user more control and stability while moving.",
    "Teleoperated Exoskeleton: A teleoperated exoskeleton could be developed that connects to the user's nervous system to enable them to control their movement using their mind. This could be achieved through techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) sensors.",
    "Augmented Reality Navigation System: A wearable augmented reality (AR) system could be developed that uses image recognition and positioning technology to navigate the environment. This would translate physical commands into robotic movements, effectively making the user feel like they have a body again.",
    "Mind-controlled robotic exoskeleton: Using a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI), the user could control robotic exoskeletons that are connected to their body or can be worn externally. The BCI would translate the user's thoughts into body movements.",
    "Magnetic Traction Systems: A magnetic traction system could be developed to assist people with movement by connecting their wheelchair or walker to a magnetically charged surface. This would give them the stability of standing while moving."
