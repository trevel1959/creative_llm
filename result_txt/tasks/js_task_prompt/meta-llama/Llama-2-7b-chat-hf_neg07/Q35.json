    "Woolly Mammoth: I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth as they were highly intelligent and social creatures. They were known to live in herds and had a complex communication system, which would be fascinating to study. Plus, their large size and thick fur would make them a unique sight to behold in modern-day ecosystems.",
    "Quagga: The Quagga is a unique subspecies of zebra that was once found in large numbers in South Africa. They were known for their distinctive stripes, which had a brownish-red tint on the front half and white on the back half. By bringing back the Quagga, we could learn more about the evolution of striped patterns in animals and how they interact with their environments.",
    "Passenger Pigeon: The Passenger Pigeon was once the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, due to overhunting and habitat loss, they went extinct in 1914.

    "Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger): The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, was a carnivorous marsupial that was native to Tasmania and mainland Australia. They were known for their distinctive stripes and powerful jaws, and were a vital part of their ecosystems. By bringing back the Thylacine, we could learn more about the evolution of predator-prey relationships and the impact of habitat loss on ecosystems.",
    "Moa: The Moa was a large flightless bird that was native to New Zealand. There were several species of Moa, ranging in size from 2 to 10 feet tall and weighing up to 1,000 pounds. By bringing back the Moa, we could study the evolution of flightless birds and learn more about the unique ecosystems of New Zealand."
