    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: This involves collecting rainwater that falls on rooftops or any surface and storing it for later use. It can be filtered using sand, gravel, and charcoal to remove impurities before drinking. This system is sustainable, requires minimal maintenance, and can provide a significant amount of water in regions where rainfall is adequate.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Devices**: Invention of small, portable devices that can filter out contaminants from water sources in real-time. These could be battery-powered, requiring only the user to carry the device and find a source of water. They could use advanced filtration techniques like reverse osmosis, UV light sterilization, or a combination of both.",
    "**Plants for Purification**: Certain plants have the ability to absorb pollutants from water. An idea could be creating large-scale plant-based purification systems, like floating gardens on bodies of water, where plants like water hyacinth, duckweed, or cattails are used to purify the water naturally.",
    "**Nano-Filtering Water Pouches**: These are lightweight, disposable pouches that use nanotechnology to filter water instantly. The pouch contains a layer of nanofibers that effectively trap contaminants while allowing water molecules to pass through. This method could provide clean drinking water quickly and efficiently, especially in emergency situations.",
    "**Biological Water Treatment Plants**: Implementing microorganisms in tanks to naturally break down and eliminate pollutants in water. These plants can be designed to treat large volumes of water by introducing bacteria and fungi that specifically target harmful substances. The treated water can then be harvested and distributed, providing a renewable and environmentally friendly solution to water purification."
