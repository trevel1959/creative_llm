    "Unethical commercialization: Cloning extinct animals for commercial purposes, such as selling them as pets or displaying them in zoos, could lead to unethical and exploitative practices. It could also perpetuate the notion that animals are commodities rather than living beings with inherent value and rights.",
    "Ecological imbalances: Restoring an extinct species to its original ecosystem could have unintended consequences, such as upsetting the delicate balance of the ecosystem and leading to the decline or extinction of other species. For example, the reintroduction of the woolly mammoth could lead to a surge in vegetation growth, which could outcompete other herbivores for resources and alter the food chain.",
    "Genetic diversity concerns: Cloning the same individual multiple times could lead to a loss of genetic diversity within the species, which could make it more vulnerable to disease and environmental changes. Additionally, the cloning process could introduce genetic mutations that could further reduce the genetic diversity of the species.",
    "Ethical considerations: Cloning extinct animals raises ethical questions about the value and rights of the cloned individuals. Are they the same entity as the original animal, or are they a new entity with their own rights and identity? How do we ensure their welfare and well-being, particularly if they are used for commercial purposes?",
    "Temporal paradoxes: Cloning an extinct animal from a preserved specimen could create temporal paradoxes, such as the possibility of two individuals of the same species existing in different time periods. This could lead to confusion and disruptions in the timeline, potentially causing unforeseen consequences."
