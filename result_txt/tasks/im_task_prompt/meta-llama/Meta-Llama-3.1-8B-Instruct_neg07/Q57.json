    "**GripSense**: A computer mouse with a built-in grip sensor that detects the user's hand shape and size, adjusting the mouse's sensitivity and cursor speed accordingly. This feature would be especially helpful for users with varying grip strengths or disabilities. The grip sensor would use a combination of pressure sensors and computer vision to analyze the user's hand shape and adjust the mouse's performance in real-time.",
    "**EcoMouse**: A sustainable computer mouse made from recycled and biodegradable materials, with a focus on reducing electronic waste. The EcoMouse would have a modular design, allowing users to easily replace worn-out components and upgrade the mouse without contributing to landfill waste. The mouse would also have a built-in power-saving feature, automatically turning off when not in use.",
    "**MindMouse**: A brain-computer interface (BCI) mouse that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect the user's brain activity, allowing them to control the cursor with their thoughts. The MindMouse would use machine learning algorithms to learn the user's brain patterns and adapt to their preferences. This feature would be especially helpful for users with mobility or dexterity impairments.",
    "**SmartSight**: A computer mouse with built-in optical and infrared sensors that detect the user's surroundings, providing real-time feedback and alerts. The SmartSight mouse would be able to detect objects, people, and environments, allowing users to navigate and interact with their digital world more efficiently. For example, the mouse could detect when a user is working near a deadline and provide a pop-up reminder.",
    "**AirMouse**: A wireless computer mouse that uses a combination of air gestures and voice commands to control the cursor. The AirMouse would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect the user's hand and finger movements, as well as their voice commands. This feature would be especially helpful for users who prefer a more intuitive and hands-free interaction experience. The AirMouse would also have a built-in gesture recognition system, allowing users to perform complex actions with simple hand movements.
