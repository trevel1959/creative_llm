    "The \"Clima-Tunnel\": A climate-controlled habitat that uses a geodesic dome structure to create a microclimate. The dome would be insulated and have a transparent outer shell that allows for natural light to enter while keeping the interior cool. The habitat would be equipped with advanced climate control systems, such as air purification, humidity regulation, and temperature control.",
    "The \"Floating Oasis\": This habitat would be built on a large floating platform in the middle of the ocean. The platform would be equipped with renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and solar panels, and it would have a self-sustaining water system that collects and filters rainwater. The habitat would also include green spaces for vegetation and wildlife.",
    "The \"Subterranean Sanctuary\": This habitat would be built underground, utilizing the natural insulation of the earth to maintain a stable temperature. The habitat would be designed with a network of interconnected tunnels and chambers, providing ample space for various species to live and thrive. The habitat would also include advanced lighting systems and air filtration systems.",
    "The \"Mars Colony\": This habitat would be designed to sustain life on the planet Mars. The habitat would be built in a large crater or valley, providing natural protection from the harsh Martian environment. The habitat would be equipped with life support systems, such as oxygen generators and air recycling systems, as well as greenhouse structures for growing food.",
    "The \"Bioluminescent Biosphere\": This habitat would utilize bioluminescent organisms to create a glowing, luminescent environment. The habitat would be designed with a series of interconnected chambers that could be illuminated by these organisms, creating a unique and beautiful ecosystem. The habitat would also include features such as water recycling systems and air filtration systems."
