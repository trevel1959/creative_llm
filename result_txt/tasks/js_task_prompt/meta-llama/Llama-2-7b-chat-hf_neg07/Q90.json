    "Hydrogen-Powered Muscles: Instead of relying on traditional muscle fibers, the human body could be designed with muscles that use hydrogen fuel cells to generate energy. This would provide a cleaner, more efficient source of energy, reducing the body's carbon footprint and dependence on non-renewable resources.",
    "Bioluminescent Skin: The human body could be equipped with bioluminescent skin that emits a soft, blue-green glow. This would provide an additional means of communication and expression, allowing individuals to convey emotions and messages without words. It could also enhance the body's visibility in low-light environments, improving safety and mobility.",
    "Shape-Shifting Bones: The human skeleton could be designed with the ability to change shape in response to the body's needs. For example, during exercise, the bones could become lighter and more flexible, allowing for greater mobility and endurance. In times of stress or injury, the bones could shift to provide additional support and protection.",
    "Self-Healing Organs: The human body could be equipped with organs that have the ability to repair and regenerate themselves. This would eliminate the need for surgeries and medical interventions, allowing the body to heal itself in a more efficient and natural way.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Clothing: The human body could be covered in clothing that harvests energy from the environment. For example, special fabrics could be designed to capture wind energy, convert kinetic energy from movement, or absorb solar energy from the sun. This would provide an additional source of energy for the body, reducing the need for external power sources and improving overall energy efficiency."
