When wrapped around the body, it would help maintain an optimal temperature—keeping you cool after a workout or warm after a swim. This would be particularly beneficial for outdoor enthusiasts or anyone who experiences temperature fluctuations.",

Using lightweight, durable materials and clever folding mechanisms, this versatile towel would be perfect for travelers and outdoor adventurers, reducing the number of items they need to carry.",
    "**Smart Towel with Sensors**: This towel could be equipped with sensors that track moisture levels and temperature. When the towel is dry, it could send a notification to your smartphone, reminding you to wash it or alerting you when it’s ready for use. Additionally, it could have a built-in hydration reminder that prompts you to drink water after workouts or sun exposure.",
    "**Scent-Infused Towel**: Imagine a towel that releases a soothing scent as it dries your skin. Infused with natural essential oils, such as lavender or eucalyptus, the towel would enhance your post-bath experience. It could also feature a removable scent pouch that can be replaced or refilled, allowing users to customize their aroma based on mood or preference.",
    "**Towel with Built-in Storage**: This towel would feature hidden pockets for storing small essentials like keys, phone, or sunscreen. The pockets could be designed to be water-resistant and secure, making it ideal for beach days or gym sessions. Users would no longer have to worry about where to place their valuables while they dry off."
