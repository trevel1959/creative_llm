    "Utilize Paper and Pen: In the event of a global computer crash, I would revert to using traditional methods of documentation and research. I would grab a notebook and pen and start jotting down notes, ideas, and important information. This would allow me to continue working and studying without relying on technology.",
    "Use a Typewriter: For more detailed work, I would break out my old typewriter and continue writing and editing documents. Typewriters are reliable and can produce high-quality content without the need for electricity. This would be a great way to ensure that important documents and research are preserved and can be shared with others.",
    "Collaborate with Others: If all computers have crashed, I would reach out to my colleagues and classmates and organize a collaborative workspace. We could work together in person or remotely, using whiteboards, flipcharts, and other non-digital tools to brainstorm and create. This would allow us to continue working and learning together, even in the absence of technology.",
    "Teach Others: In the event of a global computer crash, I would take it upon myself to teach others how to work without technology. I would create lesson plans and hold workshops on how to use traditional methods of documentation, research, and collaboration. This would not only help others but also ensure that important knowledge and skills are preserved for future generations.",
    "Use Alternative Energy Sources: If all computers have crashed, I would focus on alternative energy sources to power my work. I would invest in solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources to ensure that my work and studies are not disrupted. This would not only provide a backup plan for when technology fails but also reduce my carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future."
