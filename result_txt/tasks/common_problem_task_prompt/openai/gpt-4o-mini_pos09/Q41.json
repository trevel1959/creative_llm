    "**Life Support Systems**: Ensuring the safety and comfort of astronauts during long missions is crucial. Designing an effective life support system involves managing air, water, and food supplies, as well as waste recycling. Problems can arise from system failures, inadequate supplies, or unexpected emergencies. Developing robust backup systems and ensuring redundancy in critical components is essential to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Thermal Control**: Spacecraft must maintain optimal temperatures for both the equipment and the crew. The vacuum of space can lead to extreme heat or cold, depending on the spacecraft's position relative to the sun. Designing a thermal control system that can efficiently dissipate heat and insulate against cold is a complex challenge. Problems may include overheating of sensitive electronics or freezing of vital components, requiring innovative solutions such as advanced insulation materials or active thermal management systems.",
    "**Propulsion Systems**: Choosing the right propulsion system is vital for maneuverability and efficiency. Traditional chemical rockets may not be suitable for long-duration missions due to fuel limitations, leading to the exploration of alternative propulsion methods, such as ion thrusters or solar sails. Each system comes with its own set of challenges, including thrust-to-weight ratios, energy requirements, and the need for extensive testing to ensure reliability in space.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: In the vastness of space, accurate navigation and reliable communication are paramount. Designing systems that can function in the absence of GPS and deal with the vast distances involved presents significant challenges. Potential problems include signal delays, loss of communication due to solar flares, or navigation errors that could lead to mission failure. Developing robust algorithms and backup systems for navigation and communication is essential to ensure mission success.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Space is filled with harmful cosmic radiation that poses serious health risks to astronauts. Designing effective shielding without adding excessive weight is a major challenge. Solutions may involve using specialized materials or innovative designs that incorporate water or other substances as radiation barriers. Problems may arise if the shielding is inadequate, leading to potential long-term health effects for crew members."
