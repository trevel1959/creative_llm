    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Navigation and Safety Features**: Design ski poles with built-in GPS, altimeters, and compasses to help skiers navigate challenging terrain. Additionally, the poles could have an emergency SOS feature that sends a distress signal to emergency services in case of an accident. The poles could also have a built-in accelerometer to detect falls and alert ski patrollers or emergency services.",
    "**Ski Poles with Adjustable Length and Angle**: Create ski poles with adjustable length and angle settings, allowing skiers to customize their pole length and stance to suit their individual needs. This feature would be particularly beneficial for skiers with different body types or those who prefer a more aggressive or relaxed stance. The adjustable poles could also have a feature that allows skiers to switch between different stance settings quickly and easily.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Storage and Organization**: Design ski poles with built-in storage compartments for small items such as snacks, water bottles, or first aid kits. The poles could also have a built-in organization system for ski passes, lift tickets, or other essential documents. This feature would be particularly useful for skiers who prefer to carry minimal gear or want to keep their essentials within easy reach.",
    "**Ski Poles with Biometric Feedback and Training Tools**: Develop ski poles with built-in biometric sensors that track a skier's heart rate, pace, and other vital signs. The poles could also have training tools that provide real-time feedback on a skier's technique, including their stance, stride length, and arm swing. This feature would be particularly beneficial for skiers looking to improve their performance or recover from injuries.",
    "**Ski Poles with LED Lighting and Visibility**: Create ski poles with integrated LED lights that provide increased visibility and safety on the slopes. The lights could be programmed to flash or change color in response to a skier's movements or to indicate their position on the mountain. This feature would be particularly useful for skiers who ski at night or in low-light conditions."
