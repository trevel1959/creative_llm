    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Handling computer components can pose a risk of static electricity discharge, which can damage sensitive electronics. This is particularly a concern when dealing with RAM and CPUs. To prevent this issue, builders should use anti-static wrist straps, work on non-static surfaces, and ground themselves before touching any components. Additionally, storing parts in anti-static bags can help protect them until they are installed.",
    "**Improper Assembly**: New builders may face challenges during the assembly process, such as misaligning components, overtightening screws, or failing to connect cables properly. This can lead to a malfunctioning system or even hardware damage. To avoid these issues, following a step-by-step guide or video tutorial can be beneficial. It’s also wise to double-check connections and placements before powering on the system.",
    "**Cooling and Airflow Problems**: Inadequate cooling can lead to overheating, which can cause system instability or hardware failure. Builders must ensure that the case has sufficient airflow and that fans are positioned correctly for optimal cooling. This involves placing intake and exhaust fans strategically and ensuring that there are no obstructions to airflow within the case. Regularly monitoring temperatures using software can help identify potential cooling issues early.",
    "**Software Installation and Driver Issues**: After assembling the hardware, the next step is installing the operating system and drivers. Problems may arise if the wrong drivers are installed or if the operating system doesn’t recognize certain hardware components. To tackle this, builders should download the latest drivers from manufacturer websites and ensure that the operating system is compatible with the hardware. Creating a bootable USB with the OS installer can also streamline the installation process.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Building a computer can sometimes lead to unexpected expenses, especially if one gets tempted by high-end components that exceed the original budget. This can result in financial strain or the need to compromise on other parts. To prevent budget overruns, it’s crucial to set a clear budget before starting and stick to it. Prioritizing components based on needs versus wants can help in making informed decisions about where to splurge and where to save."
