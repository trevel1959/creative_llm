    "DIY Magnifying Glasses: People could create their own magnifying glasses using everyday items like CDs, mirrors, and lenses from old glasses. They could also use a small mirror to create a makeshift telescope to see objects at a distance.",
    "Natural Vision Aids: Nature has provided us with many natural vision aids that could help people with poor vision. For example, some plants have natural magnifying properties, such as the Venus flytrap, which can help people see objects more clearly. People could also use crystals like quartz or amethyst, which have been known to improve vision.",
    "Sound-based Vision: In a world without glasses or contacts, people could rely more heavily on their sense of hearing to navigate their surroundings. They could use sound to detect objects and distances, similar to how bats use echolocation. People could also use sound to communicate with each other more effectively, such as by tapping their feet or using hand signals.",
    "Braille and Tactile Communication: In a world without visual aids, people could rely more heavily on tactile communication methods like Braille. They could use raised letters and symbols to communicate with each other, or even create tactile maps to navigate their surroundings. This could also help people with poor vision to read and write more easily.",
    "Technology-based Solutions: In a world without glasses or contacts, technology could play a bigger role in helping people with poor vision. For example, there could be smart contact lenses that can magnify objects or project images onto the wearer's retina. There could also be virtual reality devices that can simulate a visual world for people with poor vision, allowing them to see objects and distances more clearly."
