    "**Sunlight Alarm**: Develop a smart window that automatically adjusts its opacity based on the time of day. In the morning, it would gradually become more transparent, allowing sunlight to enter the room, simulating a sunrise and naturally waking you up. This would be especially effective for people who have trouble waking up during the winter months when sunlight is scarce.",
    "**Vibrational Wake-Up**: Create a wearable device that uses subtle vibrations to wake you up. This device would be embedded in a wristband or a smartwatch and would vibrate at a specific frequency to signal the start of your day. The vibrations would be gentle enough not to startle you, but firm enough to get your attention.",
    "**Aromatherapy Alarm**: Design a smart alarm system that releases a specific scent at a set time, simulating the aroma of freshly brewed coffee or a warm breakfast. This would trigger a Pavlovian response, associating the scent with the start of your day and making you feel more alert and awake.",
    "**Personalized Light Show**: Develop an AI-powered light system that creates a personalized wake-up light show based on your preferences and sleep patterns. This could include a gradual transition from a calming blue light to a stimulating red light, accompanied by a soothing soundtrack or a motivational message.",
    "**Sleep Stage Awareness**: Create a wearable device that tracks your sleep stages and wakes you up during a light sleep phase, ensuring you feel rested and refreshed. This device would use EEG sensors to monitor your brain activity and wake you up during a period of low brain activity, reducing the likelihood of grogginess and disorientation. [/INST] "
