    "Smart Keyboard: Develop a keyboard that learns your typing habits and adapts to your preferences. The keyboard could use machine learning algorithms to analyze your typing patterns and adjust the layout, key positions, and even the feel of the keys to provide a more personalized typing experience. This could be especially useful for people who spend a lot of time typing, such as writers, programmers, or gamers.",
    "Keyboard with Built-in Speaker: Create a keyboard with a built-in speaker that allows users to listen to music or watch videos without having to use a separate device. This could be especially useful for people who spend a lot of time typing on their computers, such as writers, programmers, or students.",
    "Ergonomic Keyboard: Design a keyboard that is ergonomically designed to reduce strain on the hands and wrists. The keyboard could have a split design, with the left and right halves angled at a slight degree to reduce pressure on the wrists, and the keys could be arranged in a way that promotes proper hand positioning. This could be especially useful for people who spend long hours typing or gaming.",
    "Customizable Keyboard: Develop a keyboard that allows users to customize the layout and function of the keys. Users could choose from a variety of pre-designed layouts or create their own custom layouts using a software program. This could be especially useful for people who have specific typing needs, such as programmers or musicians.",
    "Haptic Feedback Keyboard: Create a keyboard that provides haptic feedback to the user. The keyboard could use vibrations, pressure sensors, or other mechanisms to provide tactile feedback to the user, allowing them to feel the characters they are typing. This could be especially useful for people who are visually impaired or have difficulty seeing the screen."
