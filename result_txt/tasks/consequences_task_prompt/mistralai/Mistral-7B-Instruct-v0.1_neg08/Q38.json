    "If we could predict the future, we could plan our lives more effectively and make better decisions. We could anticipate potential challenges and opportunities and prepare accordingly.",
    "Predicting the future could lead to a sense of control and security, as we would know what to expect and be able to plan accordingly.",
    "However, it could also lead to a lack of spontaneity and flexibility, as we might become too focused on following a predetermined path.",
