    "Incorporate a touch screen display: A touch screen display can allow users to easily select their preferred settings, recipes, and even track their calorie intake. It can also provide instructions and tips for using the juicer, making it more user-friendly.",
    "Implement a self-cleaning system: A self-cleaning system can make the juicer easier to maintain and reduce the risk of bacterial growth. This can be achieved through the use of a self-cleaning brush or a water flushing system.",
    "Add a filter replacement alert: Many juicers have filters that need to be replaced regularly. By adding an alert system, the user will be notified when it's time to replace the filter, ensuring that the juicer continues to operate at its best.",
    "Incorporate a compact design: Some people may have limited space in their kitchen, making it difficult to fit a traditional juicer. By designing a compact juicer, it can be more easily stored in smaller spaces.",
    "Create a portable version: A portable juicer can be taken on-the-go, allowing users to juice wherever they go. This can be especially useful for people who are health-conscious and want to juice during their daily commute or while traveling."
