    "Insect-based Nutrition: One possible solution is to rely on insects as a source of essential vitamins and minerals. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are already a good source of protein and can be farmed for their nutritional value. By breeding and processing insects, it could provide a sustainable and reliable source of essential vitamins and minerals. For example, crickets are high in calcium, iron, and potassium, while mealworms are rich in vitamin B12 and iron.",
    "Algae-based Supplements: Another option is to use algae as a source of essential vitamins and minerals. Algae are rich in nutrients like vitamin D, calcium, and iron, and can be grown in large quantities in controlled environments. Algae-based supplements could be added to food or taken as a standalone supplement. Additionally, algae are a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly option compared to traditional farming methods.",
    "Microbial Fermentation: Microbial fermentation is a process where microorganisms like bacteria and yeast are used to convert plant material into nutrient-rich food. By fermenting plant material like wheat, barley, or soybeans, it's possible to create a variety of nutrient-dense foods like bread, cereals, and protein powders. This method can also be used to create supplements like probiotics and prebiotics, which are essential for maintaining a healthy gut.",
    "Vertical Farming: Vertical farming is a method of growing plants in vertically stacked layers, often in indoor environments. This method can increase crop yields while minimizing land use and water consumption. By using vertical farming techniques, it's possible to grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including those that are high in essential vitamins and minerals. This method can also be used to create a more sustainable and efficient food system.",
    "Synthetic Food: In the most extreme scenario, synthetic food could be created in a laboratory using chemical reactions and processes. This method would involve"
