    "\"Fusion-Cube\" Energy: Imagine a small, portable cube that can generate energy through nuclear fusion. The cube would use a combination of hydrogen and helium isotopes to produce a clean and sustainable source of energy. This energy could be used to power electronic devices, charge phones, and even provide electricity to small homes. The cube would be compact, lightweight, and easy to use, making it a perfect solution for people who are always on the go.",
    "\"Bio-Energy\" Energy: Imagine a type of energy that is generated from living organisms, such as plants or bacteria. This energy could be harnessed through a process called photosynthesis, which converts sunlight into chemical energy that can be stored in the form of glucose. The glucose could then be used to power fuel cells, which would generate electricity. This type of energy would be clean, renewable, and sustainable, making it a great solution for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "\"Wave-Energy\" Energy: Imagine a type of energy that is generated from ocean waves. This energy could be harnessed through the use of turbines that are placed underwater. As the waves crash against the turbines, they would generate electricity that could be sent to the shore. This type of energy would be clean, renewable, and sustainable, making it a great solution for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "\"Solar-Powered\" Energy: Imagine a type of energy that is generated from the sun. This energy could be harnessed through the use of solar panels, which would capture the sun's rays and convert them into electricity. This electricity could be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. This type of energy would be clean, renewable, and sustainable, making it a great solution for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "\"Geothermal\" Energy: Imagine a type of energy that is generated from the heat of the Earth's core. This energy could be harnessed through the use of geothermal power plants, which would use steam from deep underground reservoirs to generate electricity. This type of energy would be clean, renewable, and sustainable, making it a great solution for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels."
