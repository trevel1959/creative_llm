    "**LED Mood Lighting**: Incorporate customizable LED lighting into the fan design. The lights could change colors based on the time of day or user preferences, creating a dynamic atmosphere in the room. For example, soft warm light could be used in the evening for relaxation, while bright white light could be used during the day for productivity. Users could control the lighting through an app or a remote.",
    "**Air Quality Monitoring**: Equip the ceiling fan with built-in air quality sensors that monitor pollutants, humidity, and temperature. The fan could then adjust its speed or direction based on the air quality readings. If pollutants are detected, the fan could increase airflow to help circulate and purify the air. The fan could also provide real-time feedback to users via a connected app.",
    "**Artistic Blade Designs**: Create interchangeable fan blades with various artistic designs and materials. Users could customize their ceiling fan to match their interior decor, choosing from themes like nature, modern art, or vintage styles. This would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the fan but also allow users to express their personality through their home decor.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and gentle airflow to eliminate dust and allergens from the fan blades. The fan could automatically activate this cleaning mode at scheduled intervals or when it detects a high level of dust in the room. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and help maintain better air quality.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a ceiling fan made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites. Additionally, the fan could be designed for energy efficiency, using a low-energy motor and incorporating solar panels for power. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing carbon footprints."
