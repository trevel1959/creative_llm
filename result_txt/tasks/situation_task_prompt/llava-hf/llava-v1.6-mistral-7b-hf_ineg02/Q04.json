    "Artificial Forests: Create artificial forests using biomimicry techniques to replicate the ecosystem services of natural forests. These artificial forests would be designed to absorb carbon dioxide, produce oxygen, and support biodiversity.",
    "Forest Restoration: Invest in large-scale forest restoration projects to regrow degraded and deforested areas. This would involve reforestation efforts to restore the natural balance and biodiversity of these ecosystems.",
    "Forest Biotechnology: Develop biotechnological solutions to create trees and plants that can thrive in harsh conditions or produce more sustainable natural resources. This would involve genetically modifying trees and plants to produce higher-quality materials.",
    "Biochar: Utilize biochar, a form of charcoal made from the slow pyrolysis of organic matter, as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility and sequester carbon. This would help to maintain and enhance the natural resources found in soil.",
    "Green Roofs: Encourage the use of green roofs on buildings to provide urban green spaces that can support biodiversity and produce natural resources. This would involve the creation of green roofs on existing buildings and the incorporation of green roofs into new construction projects."
