    "**Cactus Battery**: Cacti contain small amounts of electrolytes that can be extracted and used to create a rudimentary battery. By harvesting the electrolytes and connecting them to a small circuit, you can create a simple cactus-powered device, such as a clock or a small electronic device.",
    "**Cactus Pest Repellent**: Cacti have natural pest-repellent properties due to the presence of thorns and the secretion of chemicals that deter insects. By placing cacti around areas prone to insect infestations, you can use their natural defense mechanisms to deter pests from entering your home or garden.",
    "**Cactus Water Filter**: Cacti have small, porous roots that can filter out impurities from water. By placing a cactus in a container of water and allowing it to absorb the water, you can create a simple water filter that can help purify the water for drinking.",
    "**Cactus Solar Charger**: The spines of cacti can be used to create a makeshift solar charger. By placing a solar panel on top of the cactus and connecting it to a small battery, you can create a portable solar-powered charger for electronic devices.",
    "**Cactus Clock**: A cactus can be used as a natural clock by using the time it takes for the cactus to absorb water and release it into the air. By measuring the time it takes for the cactus to go through its moisture cycle, you can create a simple, natural clock."
