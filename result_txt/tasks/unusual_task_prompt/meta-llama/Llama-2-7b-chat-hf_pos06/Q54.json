    "Smartwatch for the Visually Impaired: Create a wristwatch that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. The watch would be equipped with a camera that captures images of the environment and utilizes object recognition algorithms to identify objects, people, and obstacles. The watch would then provide audio or tactile feedback to guide the user, such as voice commands or vibrations, to help them navigate safely. Confidence Score: 0.9/1",
    "Fitness Tracker with Integrated Blood Oxygen Levels: Design a wristwatch that tracks not only fitness metrics like heart rate and steps taken but also blood oxygen levels. The watch would use a non-invasive pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation and display the data on the watch face or through a companion app. This feature would be particularly useful for individuals with respiratory conditions or those who engage in high-altitude activities. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Wearable Music Instrument: Create a wristwatch that doubles as a wearable music instrument. The watch would have a built-in speaker and microphone, allowing users to create and play music without the need for any additional equipment. The watch could also have sensors to detect hand gestures or movements, allowing users to create different sounds and rhythms. Confidence Score: 0.7/1",
    "Environmental Monitoring Watch: Design a wristwatch that tracks and monitors the user's exposure to environmental pollutants, such as air quality, noise levels, and UV radiation. The watch would use sensors to detect these factors and provide real-time data to the user, allowing them to take appropriate action to protect their health. Confidence Score: 0.6/1",
    "Interactive Art Installation Watch: Create a wristwatch that doubles as an interactive art installation. The watch would have a touch-sensitive display and sensors that detect hand gestures, allowing users to interact with digital art pieces and installations on the watch face. The watch could also have Bluetooth connectivity to allow users to connect with other art installations and share their creations with others. Confidence Score: 0"
