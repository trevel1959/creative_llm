    "**Trash Can Transformation**: Design a smart trash can that can transform into a compact, portable planter or a decorative centerpiece. The can would have a built-in sensor that detects when it's being lifted or moved, triggering a hidden mechanism that converts it into a planter or centerpiece. This innovative design would reduce waste, promote sustainability, and add a touch of whimsy to any room.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Recycling Bin**: Create a recycling bin that doubles as a mini-garden or a small herb planter. The bin would have separate compartments for different types of recyclables, and as users deposit their recyclables, the bin would automatically sort and compress them. The compressed recyclables would then be converted into nutrient-rich soil for the mini-garden or herb planter, promoting a closed-loop system and reducing waste.",
    "**Smart Waste Management System**: Develop a smart waste management system that uses AI-powered sensors and IoT technology to optimize waste collection and disposal. The system would analyze waste patterns, detect contamination, and provide real-time feedback to residents on proper waste disposal. It would also integrate with existing waste management infrastructure, streamlining the process and reducing waste-related costs.",
    "**Upcycled Art**: Design a series of upcycled art pieces created from discarded trash. Each piece would be handcrafted from a unique combination of materials, such as old CDs, plastic bottles, or cardboard tubes. The art pieces would not only reduce waste but also raise awareness about the importance of sustainability and creative reuse. The pieces could be sold or displayed in public spaces to promote environmental consciousness.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Converter**: Develop a device that converts organic waste into clean energy, such as electricity or biofuels. The device would use advanced nanotechnology and bioreactors to break down organic matter, producing a valuable byproduct that can be harnessed for energy. This innovative solution would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease waste sent to landfills, and provide a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources."
