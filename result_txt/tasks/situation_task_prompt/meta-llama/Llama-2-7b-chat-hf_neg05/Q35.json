    "Build a Community Bike Share Program: Create a community-driven bike share program where individuals can borrow bicycles from designated locations. This would provide an alternative mode of transportation for those who rely on bicycles for daily commutes or errands.",
    "Utilize Electric Bicycles: Invest in a fleet of electric bicycles that can be used for short-distance commutes. These e-bikes would provide a convenient and environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional bicycles, especially for those who struggle with longer distances.",
    "Develop a Bicycle-Friendly Public Transit System: Work with public transit agencies to create a bicycle-friendly public transit system that integrates bicycles into the existing transportation network. This could include designated bike lanes, bike racks, and secure storage facilities at transit stations.",
    "Implement a Bike-Sharing App: Develop a bike-sharing app that connects individuals with available bicycles in their area. Users could reserve a bike through the app and pick it up at a designated location, providing an easy and convenient alternative to car ownership.",
    "Create a Car-Free Neighborhood: Designate a neighborhood as car-free, where only bicycles, pedestrians, and other non-motorized vehicles are allowed. This would encourage residents to rely on bicycles for their daily commutes and errands, creating a more sustainable and livable community."
