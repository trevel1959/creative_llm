The workshop could also include blending sessions where participants can mix various beans to create their own unique blends. ",
    "**Grinder Art Installation**: Transform the coffee grinder into a sculptural piece by integrating it into an art installation that explores the transformation of raw materials into something valuable.

Participants can enjoy traditional coffee-making methods while learning about the history of coffee grinding. Pair this with live music, period-appropriate decor, and a menu featuring classic coffee drinks prepared on the grinders.",
    "**Grinder-Focused Cooking Class**: Develop a cooking class centered around recipes that utilize freshly ground ingredients.
