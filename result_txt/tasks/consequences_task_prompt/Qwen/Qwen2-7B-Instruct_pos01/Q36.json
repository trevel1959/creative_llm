    "**Enhanced Evolutionary Adaptability**: The ability to regenerate limbs could lead to a significant shift in evolutionary strategies. Organisms might evolve to have more fragile limbs that can be easily replaced when damaged or lost, reducing the energy required for protection. This could result in faster evolution of new species and potentially new forms of life not seen before. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Sustainable Medical Practices**: In medicine, this ability could revolutionize the treatment of injuries and diseases that currently result in limb loss or disfigurement. Patients could potentially regrow limbs, eliminating the need for prosthetics or reconstructive surgeries. This could reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life significantly. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The widespread regeneration of limbs could lead to an increase in biodiversity. Species that might have previously been outcompeted due to the inability to replace limbs quickly would now have a better chance to survive and thrive. This could lead to ecosystems with more diverse species and possibly new ecological niches. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Technological Integration**: As humans could potentially regenerate limbs, the integration of technology into human bodies (prosthetics, implants) could become obsolete. The body might automatically replace lost components, leading to a new era where the human body is essentially self-repairing. This could also pave the way for advanced bioengineering where limbs can be customized and improved upon. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The psychological benefits of being able to regenerate limbs could be immense. Individuals who lose limbs could experience a significant improvement in mental health, as they no longer have to cope with the trauma and limitations associated with permanent disability. This could lead to a society where physical limitations are less stigmatized, fostering a culture of resilience and adaptability. Confidence Score: 0.9"
