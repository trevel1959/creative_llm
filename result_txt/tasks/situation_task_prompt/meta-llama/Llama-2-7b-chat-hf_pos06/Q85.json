    "Data Crystals: Create a new form of data storage using crystals that can store massive amounts of information. These crystals can be programmed and read using advanced nanotechnology, allowing for efficient and reliable data retrieval. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Memory Molecules: Develop a method to encapsulate memories in synthetic molecules that can be stored in a liquid state. These molecules can be injected into a person's body, where they will remain stable for an extended period, allowing for the preservation of memories. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Quantum Neural Networks: Utilize the principles of quantum computing to create a neural network that can store and process information in a quantum state. This would allow for faster and more efficient data processing, as well as the ability to perform complex computations that are currently impossible with classical computers. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Data Fractals: Develop a method to represent data as fractals, which are geometric shapes that repeat at different scales. This would allow for the efficient storage of large amounts of data in a compact format, while also providing a way to access and manipulate the data using fractal geometry. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "Time Crystals: Create a device that can store information in the form of time-dependent crystals. These crystals would have a periodic structure that is dependent on the passage of time, allowing for the storage of information in a way that is both stable and reversible. Confidence Score: 0.9"
