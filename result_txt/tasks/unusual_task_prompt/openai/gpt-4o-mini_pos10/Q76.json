    "**Plant Watering Device**: Use a wide-brimmed hat as a funnel to water plants. Simply fill the hat with water, and then tip it gently to pour water into the soil. The brim can help control the flow, preventing too much water from spilling at once, making it a quirky yet effective watering tool.",
