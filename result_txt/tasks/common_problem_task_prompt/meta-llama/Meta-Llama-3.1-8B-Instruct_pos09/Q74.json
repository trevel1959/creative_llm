    "**Space-based Eco-System Monitoring**: Design a satellite equipped with advanced sensors to monitor and track the health of Earth's ecosystems, including deforestation, ocean pollution, and climate change. The satellite would provide real-time data to scientists, policymakers, and the public, enabling informed decisions to mitigate the effects of environmental degradation.",
    "**Global Food Security Network**: Develop a satellite constellation to monitor crop health, detect early signs of disease, and optimize agricultural practices. This network would help farmers, governments, and organizations make data-driven decisions to increase food production, reduce waste, and ensure global food security.",
    "**Disaster Response and Recovery**: Launch a satellite with advanced imaging and communication capabilities to rapidly respond to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. The satellite would provide critical information to emergency responders, helping them allocate resources, prioritize rescue efforts, and facilitate recovery operations.",
    "**Space-based Renewable Energy**: Deploy a satellite to harness and beam solar energy back to Earth, providing a clean and sustainable source of power. This technology would enable remote communities and regions with limited access to energy to receive a reliable and renewable energy supply.",
    "**Space-based Education and Research**: Create a satellite with interactive modules and educational resources to engage students and researchers in space-related STEM fields. The satellite would offer hands-on learning experiences, promote scientific literacy, and inspire the next generation of space explorers and innovators.
