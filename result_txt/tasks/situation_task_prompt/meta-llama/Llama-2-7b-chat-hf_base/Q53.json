    "I would create a music-making app that utilizes brain-computer interfaces to generate musical compositions. Users would think of a melody or rhythm, and the app would translate it into a musical score, complete with harmonies and instrumentation.",
    "I would create a virtual reality music experience that allows users to immerse themselves in a 3D environment and interact with virtual musicians. Users could choose the type of music they want to listen to, and the virtual musicians would perform it for them.",
    "I would develop a music-based language translation app that can translate lyrics and melodies into different languages. Users could sing or hum a song in one language, and the app would translate it into another language in real-time.",
    "I would create a community-driven music platform that allows users to create and share their own musical compositions. Users could collaborate on projects, share their work with others, and even earn money from their creations.",
    "I would develop a music-based meditation app that uses binaural beats and isochronic tones to create a relaxing and calming atmosphere. Users could choose from different types of music, such as nature sounds, classical music, or ambient music, and the app would generate a personalized meditation experience for them."
