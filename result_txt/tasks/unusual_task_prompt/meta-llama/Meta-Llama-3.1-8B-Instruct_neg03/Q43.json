    "**Bicycle-Powered Air Purification System**: Design a bicycle that doubles as an air purification system. The rider pedals a special wheel that uses centrifugal force to separate pollutants from the air, which are then collected in a filter. The purified air is released back into the environment, while the pollutants are stored in a container for proper disposal. This system could be particularly useful in areas with high levels of air pollution.",
    "**Smart Bike Helmet with Integrated Navigation and Safety Features**: Develop a bike helmet with a built-in GPS, navigation system, and safety features such as collision detection, lane departure warning, and blind spot monitoring. The helmet could also include a built-in speaker for receiving voice commands or making hands-free phone calls. This would enhance rider safety and provide a more convenient and connected cycling experience.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Water Purification System for Disaster Relief**: Create a bicycle-powered water purification system that can be used in disaster relief situations. The system would use a bicycle to generate power for a water purification unit, which would remove contaminants and bacteria from water, making it safe for drinking. This would provide a sustainable and portable solution for communities affected by natural disasters.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bike-Sharing System with Integrated Recycling Program**: Design a bike-sharing system that encourages users to recycle their old bicycles. The system would include a network of bike-sharing stations where users can drop off their old bikes, which would then be refurbished and resold or recycled. This would promote sustainability, reduce waste, and create a closed-loop system for bike reuse.",
    "**Bicycle-Based Urban Farming System**: Develop a bicycle-powered urban farming system that allows users to grow their own fruits and vegetables in small spaces. The system would include a bicycle-powered hydroponic or aeroponic system that uses nutrient-rich water to grow crops. This would provide a sustainable and space-efficient solution for urban agriculture, promoting local food production and reducing reliance on industrial agriculture.
