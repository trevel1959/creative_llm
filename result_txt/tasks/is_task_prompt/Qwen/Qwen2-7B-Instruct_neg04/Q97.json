    "**Sunflower-Themed Art Installation**: Create an interactive public art installation where visitors can engage with large-scale sunflower sculptures that are programmed to smile at certain times of the day or when someone approaches them. This idea combines the joyfulness of sunflowers with technology, enhancing the visitor's experience through unexpected, positive interactions. The installation could also include a \"smile counter\" that tracks how many smiles the sunflowers have inspired, fostering community engagement.",
