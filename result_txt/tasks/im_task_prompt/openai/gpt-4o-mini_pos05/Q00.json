    "**Modular Pencil System**: Imagine a pencil that can be customized with interchangeable components. Users could choose different grips, lead types (e.g., graphite, colored, or even erasable), and lengths based on their preference or the task at hand. This modular design would not only cater to individual needs but also reduce waste, as users could replace only the parts that wear out.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Pencil with Seed Capsules**: This pencil would be made from sustainable materials and feature a hollow end filled with seed capsules. Once the pencil is too short to use, the user can plant it in soil, and it will biodegrade, allowing the seeds to germinate. This encourages environmental responsibility while providing a unique way to grow plants.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Sharpener and Eraser**: This innovative pencil would include a retractable sharpener at one end and an eraser at the other, all contained within a sleek design. The sharpener could be designed to catch shavings, eliminating mess, while the eraser would be replaceable, ensuring longevity and functionality without the need for separate accessories.",
    "**Mood-Reflecting Color-Changing Pencil**: Utilizing thermochromic materials, this pencil would change color based on the user's temperature or emotional state, which could be detected through touch. This feature would allow users to express their mood visually while writing or drawing, making it a fun and interactive tool for artists and students alike.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Voice Recorder**: This pencil would have a tiny voice recorder embedded within it, allowing users to record their thoughts or ideas while they write. The recordings could be synced to an app that transcribes the audio into text, making it easier for users to capture their ideas without interrupting their writing flow."
