    "In a quaint village, an invisible elephant roamed freely, causing mischief. Villagers often found their gardens trampled, but they never saw the culprit. Curious, young Mira decided to uncover the mystery. She crafted a special paint made from crushed flowers that would glow under moonlight. One night, she painted a path of flowers leading to her garden. To her astonishment, the invisible elephant appeared, glowing in hues of blue and green! Mira realized it was lonely, longing for friendship. Instead of scaring it away, she offered it a basket of fruit. From that night on, they became the best of friends, sharing laughter and adventures under the stars.",
