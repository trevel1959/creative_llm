    "Floating Islands: In a world without beaches, I would seek out floating islands as a new destination for relaxation. These man-made structures, made from sustainable materials like recycled plastic, could provide a tranquil getaway while also promoting environmental sustainability. Imagine a series of interconnected islands, each one teeming with lush vegetation and vibrant marine life. Visitors could explore the islands by foot or take a leisurely boat ride, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and the breathtaking views of the surrounding ocean.",
    "Cave Retreats: If beaches were to disappear, I would look for alternative relaxation spots in the form of vast underground caves. These natural wonders could offer a unique and serene experience, with towering ceilings, glistening crystals, and the soothing sound of dripping water. Visitors could explore the caves on foot or take a guided tour, marveling at the stunning formations and the sense of calm that comes with being underground.",
    "Urban Oases: In a world without beaches, I would seek out urban oases â€“ tranquil spaces within bustling cities that offer a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. These could include rooftop gardens, greenhouses, or even indoor water parks. Imagine strolling through a lush green space in the heart of a busy city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and the hum of traffic. These urban oases could provide a much-needed respite for city dwellers, promoting mental well-being and a deeper connection to nature.",
    "Cloud Forests: If beaches were to disappear, I would look to cloud forests as a new destination for relaxation. These dense, misty ecosystems are home to a diverse array of plant and animal life, and offer a unique and peaceful experience. Imagine hiking through a dense canopy of trees, surrounded by the soft chirping of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves. Visitors could take in the breathtaking views from the summit of a cloud forest peak, feeling invigorated and refreshed after their journey.",
