    "**Environmental Degradation**: Increased tourism can lead to environmental issues, such as pollution, habitat destruction, and strain on natural resources. To mitigate this, the city could implement sustainable tourism practices, such as promoting eco-friendly accommodations, establishing conservation areas, and encouraging tourists to participate in local environmental initiatives, like beach clean-ups or tree planting.",
    "**Cultural Erosion**: The influx of tourists may lead to the commercialization of local culture, diluting authentic traditions and practices. To preserve cultural heritage, the city could support local artisans and cultural events, create community-led tourism experiences, and educate visitors about the importance of respecting local customs and traditions.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While tourism can generate revenue, it can also lead to economic disparities, where profits are concentrated in a few businesses, leaving local communities behind. To combat this, the city could promote local businesses through tourism campaigns, offer grants or incentives for local entrepreneurs, and ensure that tourism revenue is reinvested into the community through public services and infrastructure.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: An increase in tourism can lead to higher crime rates or safety concerns, affecting both tourists and residents. To enhance safety, the city could increase police presence in tourist areas, implement community watch programs, and provide clear information on safety practices for tourists, including emergency contact numbers and local laws.",
    "**Overtourism**: Popular attractions may become overcrowded, diminishing the experience for visitors and residents alike. To manage this, the city could implement visitor caps, promote lesser-known attractions, and create a timed entry system for popular sites to ensure a more enjoyable experience while distributing tourist traffic more evenly across the city."
