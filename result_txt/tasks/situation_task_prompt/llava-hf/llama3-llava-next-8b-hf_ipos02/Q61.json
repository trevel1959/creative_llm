    "Pollination Drones: Create a fleet of small drones equipped with specialized sensors and pollination devices. They would navigate to flowers, collect pollen, and deposit it on other plants' reproductive parts.",
    "Robotics: Develop robotic arms or grippers that can be mounted on vehicles or other platforms to reach high trees or hard-to-access flowers. These robots would use sensors to locate and manipulate flowers for pollination.",
    "Pollination Towers: Construct vertical structures with multiple levels of flowers at various heights. Pollinators could be attracted to the towers and travel from one level to another, collecting and distributing pollen.",
    "Edible Pollination Agents: Train insects like ants, wasps, or bees to consume pollen as part of their diet. They would naturally pollinate plants while consuming the pollen, thus acting as a sustainable pollination method.",
    "Pollination Vests: Create wearable vests with pollen-catching patches on the wearer's back. As the wearer moves between plants, the vest would collect and distribute pollen."
