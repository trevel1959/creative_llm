    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to transition to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with solar panels on their bodies, which would absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle's motor. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions significantly.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option would be to use hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which use hydrogen as a fuel source to generate electricity, producing only water and heat as emissions. These vehicles would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells that convert hydrogen into electricity, providing a clean and efficient source of energy.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles could also be powered by advanced batteries that are more efficient and have a longer lifespan than current batteries. For example, lithium-air batteries could be used, which have the potential to provide a longer range and faster charging times than traditional batteries.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, could be used to power vehicles instead of oil. These fuels are derived from organic matter, such as plants or agricultural waste, and can be produced sustainably. Biofuels can be blended with traditional gasoline or diesel to provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.",
    "Nuclear Powered Vehicles: A more unconventional option would be to use nuclear power to generate electricity for vehicles. Nuclear power plants could provide a reliable and consistent source of energy, and the electricity generated could be used to power electric vehicles directly. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions significantly."
