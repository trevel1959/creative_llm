    "Wheelchair with a twist: I would design a high-tech wheelchair that can move around independently using AI-powered navigation and obstacle detection. The wheelchair would have a sleek and futuristic design, with adjustable seating and footrests for maximum comfort. The AI system would allow for seamless navigation through crowded areas, and the wheelchair could even avoid stairs and other obstacles automatically. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Hoverchair: I would invent a hoverchair that uses advanced magnetic levitation technology to float above the ground. This would allow for effortless movement and a smooth ride, even over uneven terrain. The hoverchair would also have a sleek and stylish design, making it a fashion statement as well as a practical mode of transportation. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Exoskeleton suit: I would design an advanced exoskeleton suit that would provide support and mobility for individuals with limited mobility. The suit would be lightweight and flexible, with adjustable joints and motors that could be controlled by the user. The exoskeleton would also have a built-in AI system that could learn the user's movements and adapt to their needs. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Magnetic tracking system: I would develop a magnetic tracking system that could be integrated into a wheelchair or other mobility device. The system would use magnetic sensors to detect the user's movements and adjust the direction of the wheelchair accordingly. This would allow for more precise and efficient movement, even in crowded areas. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Mind-controlled wheelchair: I would invent a wheelchair that could be controlled using mind-control technology. The user would wear a headset or other device that would detect their brain signals and translate them into movement commands for the wheelchair. This would allow for a more intuitive and natural way of controlling the wheelchair, and could potentially be used in conjunction with other mobility aids. Confidence score: 0.9"
