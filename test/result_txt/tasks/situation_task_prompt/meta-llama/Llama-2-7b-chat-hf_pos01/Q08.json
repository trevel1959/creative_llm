    "Solar Still Distillation: A solar still distillation system would be a great option to purify water. This system uses the heat of the sun to evaporate water, which is then collected and condensed, leaving impurities behind. This method is effective, sustainable, and doesn't require any external energy sources. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "AquaGenie: AquaGenie is a portable, self-sustaining water purification system that uses a combination of UV light and nanotechnology to purify water. This system is easy to use, requires minimal maintenance, and can be powered by a small solar panel or battery. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Water-Gathering Trees: Designing trees that can gather and store water could be a creative solution to obtaining clean drinking water. These trees could have specialized leaves or branches that collect and condense water vapor from the air, which could then be collected and stored for use. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Personal Water Bottle Filters: Developing personal water bottle filters that use advanced filtration technologies, such as activated carbon or reverse osmosis, could provide a reliable source of clean drinking water. These filters could be small enough to be carried in a backpack or purse, making them easy to use in any situation. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Floating Water Farms: Creating floating water farms that use a combination of hydroponics and algae cultivation could provide a sustainable source of clean drinking water. These farms could be designed to harness the power of the sun and ocean currents to purify and cultivate water, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water. Confidence Score: 0.9"
