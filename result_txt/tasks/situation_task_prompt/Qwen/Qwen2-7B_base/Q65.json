    "Another creative solution would be to use glow-in-the-dark paint. Paint the walls, ceiling, and even furniture with glow-in-the-dark paint to create a peaceful and otherworldly atmosphere. This would also save electricity and keep the room cool during the day.",
    "Another idea would be to use solar-powered lights. Install solar-powered lamps or solar lighting fixtures around the room, which would automatically turn on at night and provide a source of light without the need for electricity or batteries.",
    "Another option would be to use blacklights. Blacklights emit a UV light that turns certain materials fluorescent, such as glow sticks, glow-in-the-dark paints, or certain types of paper. This would require carefully selecting these materials, but it could create an interesting and unique atmosphere.",
    "A more practical solution would be to use natural light. Open up any curtains or shades during the day to let in as much natural light as possible. This would keep the room brightly lit, and the warmth of the sunlight could provide a comforting glow.",
    "Another option would be to use emergency lights. Install emergency lights strategically in the room to provide a source of light in the event of a power outage. These lights don't require batteries and can often be powered by the emergency power grid."
