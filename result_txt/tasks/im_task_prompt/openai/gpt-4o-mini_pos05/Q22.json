    "**Multi-Function Smart Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that incorporates smart technology, allowing it to connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could provide features such as brightness control, battery status, and even a locator function if the flashlight is misplaced. Additionally, it could have pre-set modes for different situations, such as a strobe for emergencies or a softer light for reading.",
    "**Adjustable Beam Focus**: Create a flashlight with a unique lens system that allows users to adjust the focus of the beam from a wide floodlight to a narrow spotlight with a simple twist or slide mechanism. This would enable users to adapt the light output to their specific needs, whether they are camping, hiking, or working on detailed tasks.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Equip the flashlight with built-in safety features such as a personal alarm, a distress signal (like SOS in Morse code), and a high-intensity strobe light to alert others in emergencies. This would make the flashlight not just a source of light but also a crucial safety tool for outdoor enthusiasts or those in potentially dangerous situations.",
    "**Modular Design with Attachments**: Design the flashlight with a modular approach, allowing users to add or remove attachments based on their needs. Attachments could include a lantern head for diffused light, a magnetic base for hands-free use, or a tripod mount for stability. This versatility would make the flashlight suitable for a variety of activities, from camping to home repairs.",
    "**Built-In Power Bank**: Integrate a power bank feature into the flashlight, allowing it to serve as a charging station for other devices, such as smartphones or tablets. This would be especially useful in emergency situations or during outdoor adventures where access to power sources is limited. The flashlight could include USB ports for easy charging."
