    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Half Marathon**: Create a VR experience where participants can explore different virtual environments while running. For example, they could run through a futuristic city, a tropical island, or even a fantasy world. The VR system would track their progress, providing a unique and immersive experience. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Sensory Deprivation Half Marathon**: Organize a half marathon where participants are blindfolded and rely solely on their other senses to navigate the course. This would challenge their spatial awareness, trust, and adaptability. The course would be marked with tactile markers and audio cues to ensure safety. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Teamwork Half Marathon**: Develop a relay-style half marathon where teams of four runners take turns completing the course. Each team member would run a specific section, with a unique theme or challenge for each section. For example, one section could be a \"dark run\" where participants run in complete darkness, while another section could be a \"trail run\" through a scenic park. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Time-Traveling Half Marathon**: Create a half marathon where participants are given a \"time machine\" that allows them to relive and redo sections of the course. For example, if a participant struggles with a particular hill, they could use the time machine to go back and try again. The twist: each time they use the time machine, they would be transported to a different decade or era, with corresponding music, costumes, and scenery. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "**Mirror Image Half Marathon**: Design a half marathon where participants are paired with a \"mirror image\" runner who runs the course simultaneously. The twist: the mirror image runner is actually a robotic duplicate, programmed to mirror the participant's movements and pace. This would create an interesting dynamic, with participants competing against their own robotic doppelganger. Confidence score: 0.8"
