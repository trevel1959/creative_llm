    "Writing: I would write down my thoughts and questions, and others could respond in writing. This would allow me to express myself and understand others even without hearing.",

    "Visual aids: I could use visual aids such as drawings, pictures, or symbols to communicate my ideas and thoughts to others. This would be especially helpful when trying to explain something complex or abstract.",
    "Lip reading: I would focus on reading the lips of the people I was speaking with in order to understand what they were saying. This would require me to pay close attention to their mouths and the movements of their lips.",
    "Speech-to-text technology: I would use speech-to-text technology to convert the spoken words of others into written text. This would allow me to read what was being said and respond accordingly."
