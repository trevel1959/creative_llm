    "**Smart Print Queue Management**: Create an integrated app that connects to the printer and allows users to manage print jobs remotely. This app could enable users to prioritize documents, cancel jobs, and receive notifications when a print job is complete. It could also provide analytics on ink usage and suggest optimal times for printing to save energy.",
    "**Modular Printer Design**: Introduce a modular printer design that allows users to easily swap out components such as the print head, paper tray, and ink cartridges. This would not only make repairs simpler and more cost-effective but also allow users to upgrade specific parts without having to replace the entire printer. For example, if a user needs higher-quality prints, they could upgrade just the print head.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Implement an advanced touchscreen interface that uses AI to guide users through printing tasks. This interface could provide visual tutorials, suggest print settings based on the type of document, and even allow for custom templates and designs. Voice command features could also be included for hands-free operation.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Setup Assistance**: Create an AR app that helps users set up and troubleshoot their printers. By using their smartphone camera, users could see step-by-step instructions overlaid on their printer, making it easier to understand connections, load paper, and replace cartridges. This could significantly reduce frustration for non-tech-savvy users.",
    "**Wireless Charging Capability**: Integrate wireless charging technology into the printer design, allowing users to charge their devices directly from the printer. This could be especially useful in home offices or shared workspaces where multiple devices are used. Users could simply place their phone or tablet on a designated area of the printer to charge while printing."
