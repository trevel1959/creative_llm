    "Virtual Reality Shopping Experience: Create an immersive virtual reality (VR) shopping experience that allows customers to browse and interact with products in a virtual environment. Customers could browse through virtual aisles, examine products up close, and even try them on virtually. This could be especially useful for customers who are unable to visit physical stores due to location or mobility issues.",
    "Personalized Product Recommendations: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and provide personalized product recommendations based on their browsing and purchasing history. This could be displayed on the shopping cart page, or even before the customer adds an item to their cart. This feature would help customers discover new products they might be interested in, and increase the likelihood of impulse purchases.",
    "Interactive Product Visualization: Develop an interactive 360-degree product visualization feature that allows customers to rotate, zoom, and pan products in real-time. This could be particularly useful for complex products such as furniture or electronics, where customers want to see every angle before making a purchase.",
    "Smart Shopping Cart: Create a smart shopping cart that automatically applies coupons, discounts, and promo codes based on the customer's loyalty program status, purchase history, and location. This feature would save customers time and increase their chances of saving money.",
    "Augmented Reality Product Preview: Develop an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows customers to preview products in their own space before making a purchase. Customers could use their mobile device to scan their surroundings and see how the product would look in their home or office. This feature would help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and reduce the risk of buying products that don't fit or match their decor."
