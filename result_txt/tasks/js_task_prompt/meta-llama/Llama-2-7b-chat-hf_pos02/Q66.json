    "Sustainable Energy Systems: To ensure a self-sufficient and eco-friendly island, I would design a private island with sustainable energy systems. This could include solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power generation. The island could also have a system for harnessing and storing rainwater for irrigation and other non-potable uses.",
    "Eco-Friendly Transportation: To minimize the island's carbon footprint, I would design a transportation system that runs on electric or hybrid vehicles. This could include electric golf carts for internal transportation, as well as electric boats for ferrying guests and supplies between the island and the mainland.",
    "Vertical Farming: To provide fresh produce to the island's inhabitants and guests, I would incorporate vertical farming techniques into the island's design. This would involve constructing greenhouses and indoor farming spaces that use hydroponics, aeroponics, or other methods to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs.",
    "Nature Reserves and Wildlife Habitats: To preserve the island's natural beauty and biodiversity, I would designate areas of the island as nature reserves and wildlife habitats. This could include protected areas for endangered species, such as sea turtles, monkeys, and birds, as well as areas for reforestation and habitat restoration.",
    "Artificial Reefs: To promote marine life and provide a unique attraction for guests, I would designate areas of the island as artificial reefs. This could involve constructing underwater structures, such as reef balls or artificial coral, to provide habitat for fish and other marine species. The artificial reefs could also be used for recreational activities, such as snorkeling and scuba diving."
