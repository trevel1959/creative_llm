    "If all chairs disappeared, where would you sit?",
    "I would sit on a log or a tree branch, as they are sturdy and can support weight. This wouldde the idea of finding alternative seating options and encourage people to think creatively about how to rest and relax.",
    "I would sit on a bench, as benches are designed specifically for people to sit on and can be found in many public spaces. This would remind us of the importance of public spaces and the need for comfortable seating in our communities.",
    "I would sit on a rock or a boulder, as they are naturally occurring and can be found in many outdoor spaces. This would encourage people to explore and appreciate the beauty of nature.",
    "I would sit on a piece of furniture that is not a chair, such as a couch, a loveseat, or a bench. This would remind us that there are many different types of seating options available and that we don't always need to rely on traditional chairs."
