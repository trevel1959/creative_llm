    "**Virtual Contact Lenses**: People with poor vision could wear virtual contact lenses that project high-quality images directly onto their retinas. These lenses would use advanced display technology and artificial intelligence to correct vision and provide real-time information about their surroundings. For example, a virtual contact lens could project a clear image of a menu in a restaurant, allowing someone with poor vision to read it easily. The lens could also provide navigation assistance, alerting the user to obstacles or providing turn-by-turn directions.",
    "**Smart Canes**: A smart cane would be a high-tech version of the traditional white cane. Equipped with sensors, GPS, and AI, it would provide real-time feedback about the user's surroundings. The cane could detect obstacles, stairs, and other hazards, and even alert the user to potential dangers like low-hanging branches or uneven pavement. The smart cane could also be connected to a wearable device, providing the user with additional information about their environment and helping them navigate more safely.",
    "**Personalized 3D Printing**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on personalized 3D printing technology to create customized corrective devices. Using advanced 3D scanning and printing techniques, individuals could create bespoke lenses or implants that perfectly match their unique vision needs. This technology could also be used to create prosthetic eyes or other vision-correcting devices.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Vision Restoration**: In this scenario, people with poor vision could use a BCI to bypass damaged or non-functioning eyes and restore their vision directly to their brain. A BCI would use electroencephalography (EEG) or other neural interfaces to read brain signals and translate them into visual information. This technology could potentially restore vision in individuals with severe visual impairments or blindness.",
    "**Holofractal Vision**: This concept involves using advanced holographic technology to create a virtual \"fractal\" environment that adapts to the user's visual needs. The holofractal would use AI to analyze the user's surroundings and create a personalized, high-resolution hologram that compensates for their vision impairment. This technology could potentially provide users with a more immersive and interactive experience, allowing them to engage with their environment in new and innovative ways."
