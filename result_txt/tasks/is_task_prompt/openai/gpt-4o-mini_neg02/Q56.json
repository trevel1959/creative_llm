The townsfolk whispered about it, but young Theo was enchanted. One day, he slipped inside and found a library filled with stories from all the places the house had been. Each book glowed with magic, and as Theo read, he felt himself transported to far-off lands. With each story, the house would grow stronger, feeding off the dreams of those who dared to enter.",
