    "Microbially Enhanced Biodegradation: Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi could be genetically engineered to break down plastic more quickly and efficiently. This process, known as biodegradation, could occur in specially designed landfills or even in the ocean, reducing plastic waste.",
    "Enzyme-Based Decomposition: Scientists could develop enzymes that specifically target and break down different types of plastics, similar to how enzymes in nature break down organic matter. These enzymes could be used to speed up the biodegradation process in landfills or even in the ocean.",
    "Photodegradation: Exposure to sunlight could be harnessed to break down plastic through a process called photodegradation. This process would involve creating plastics with special pigments that absorb UV light, causing the plastic to degrade more quickly.",
    "Bioplastics: Bioplastics are made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, and they can be biodegradable. Bioplastics could replace traditional plastics in many applications, reducing the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.",
    "Artificial Photosynthesis: Similar to how plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, scientists could develop a way to mimic this process to break down plastic. This technology would use sunlight to convert plastic into carbon dioxide and water, which could then be released into the atmosphere or used as fuel."
