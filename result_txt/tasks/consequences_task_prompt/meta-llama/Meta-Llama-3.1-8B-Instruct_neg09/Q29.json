    "**Information Overload and Mental Fatigue**: With the ability to recall every piece of information read, humans would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data. Mental fatigue would set in as they struggle to process and retain all the information, leading to decreased productivity and cognitive function. Imagine having to remember every single fact, statistic, and detail from every book, article, and social media post you've ever consumed. It would be like trying to hold a never-ending ocean of knowledge in your mind.",

This would stifle creativity and innovation, leading to a stagnant society where progress is impossible.

    "**The Blurring of Reality and Fiction**: If humans could remember every piece of information they've read, the lines between reality and fiction would become increasingly blurred.
