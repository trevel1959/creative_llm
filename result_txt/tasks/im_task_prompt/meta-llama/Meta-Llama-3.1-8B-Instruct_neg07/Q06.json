The umbrella's handle could feature a small display screen, while the canopy could include a waterproof speaker for audible alerts.",
    "**Umbrella with Built-in Air Quality Monitor**: Design an umbrella that includes a built-in air quality monitor, allowing users to track the surrounding air quality in real-time. This feature could be achieved through a partnership with an air quality monitoring service, providing users with data on pollutants, particulate matter, and other air quality metrics. The umbrella's handle could feature a small display screen, while the canopy could include a small sensor array to collect air quality data.",
    "**Umbrella with Integrated Navigation System**: Create an umbrella that includes a built-in navigation system, providing users with turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. This feature could be achieved through a partnership with a mapping service provider, allowing the umbrella to receive and display location-based information. The umbrella's handle could feature a small display screen, while the canopy could include a small speaker for audible directions.",
    "**Umbrella with Built-in Water Purification System**: Design an umbrella that includes a built-in water purification system, allowing users to collect and purify rainwater for drinking or other non-potable uses. This feature could be achieved through a partnership with a water purification technology provider, providing users with a reliable source of clean water in emergency situations. The umbrella's canopy could feature a built-in water collection system, while the handle could include a small filter and purification system. "
