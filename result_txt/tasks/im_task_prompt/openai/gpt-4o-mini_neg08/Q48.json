    "**Smart Sheet Music Display**: Create a digital display that attaches to the piano and shows sheet music. This display would be touch-sensitive, allowing users to swipe through pages or adjust tempo and key signatures with a simple gesture. The display could also have a built-in metronome and a feature to highlight notes as they are played, helping beginners follow along and improve their reading skills.",
    "**Adaptive Key Sensitivity**: Design a piano with adjustable key sensitivity settings. This feature would allow players to customize the touch response of the keys based on their playing style or physical needs. For example, beginners could set the keys to be lighter for easier play, while advanced players could choose a firmer touch for more expressive playing. This adaptability would make the piano more accessible to a wider range of players.",
    "**Sound Customization Panel**: Incorporate a sound customization panel on the piano that allows players to modify the tonal qualities of the sound produced. Users could experiment with various sound effects, such as reverb, chorus, or delay, and save their favorite settings for quick access. This would encourage creativity and exploration, allowing musicians to create unique soundscapes that suit their personal style.",
    "**Integrated Composition Tool**: Embed a composition tool within the piano that allows users to record their playing and arrange their compositions directly on the instrument. This tool would feature a simple interface for layering tracks, adding percussion, and adjusting dynamics. It would be particularly beneficial for songwriters and composers, making it easier to capture ideas spontaneously and develop them into full pieces.",
    "**Visual Learning Aids**: Introduce LED lights embedded in the keys that light up to indicate which notes to play. This visual aid would be particularly helpful for beginners or younger players, making it easier to learn songs without needing to read sheet music immediately. The lights could also change colors based on the key signature or chord progressions, adding a fun and engaging element to practice sessions."
