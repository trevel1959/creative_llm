    "Floating Island: One creative solution to living in a world with rising ocean levels is to build floating islands. These islands could be made of various materials such as steel, concrete, or even recycled materials. They could be designed to withstand ocean waves and could be equipped with all the necessary amenities such as water, electricity, and sanitation systems. ",
    "Underwater Homes: Another solution could be to build homes underwater. This could involve constructing large, dome-shaped structures that would house multiple families. These homes could be equipped with all the necessary amenities and could be designed to withstand the pressure of the ocean.",
    "Elevated Homes: A third solution could be to build homes on elevated platforms. This could involve constructing large, sturdy platforms that would be built on top of stilts or other structures. These homes could be designed to withstand the winds and could be equipped with all the necessary amenities.",
    "Modular Homes: A fourth solution could be to build modular homes. These homes could be constructed in sections and then assembled on-site. This would allow for greater flexibility in design and could be a cost-effective solution.",
    "Sustainable Living: A fifth solution could be to build sustainable living communities. These communities could be designed to be self-sufficient and could be built using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. They could also be designed to be water-efficient and could use rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store rainwater."
