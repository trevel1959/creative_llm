    "Impact on Food Supply: Many human food sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts, rely on insects for pollination. Without insects, the production of these foods could be severely impacted, leading to a shortage of essential nutrients and a potential increase in food prices.",
    "Pest Control: Insects serve as a natural pest control for many plants. Without insects, plants would be more susceptible to pests, leading to an increase in the use of chemical pesticides, which can have negative environmental impacts.",
    "Biodiversity Loss: The loss of insects could lead to a cascading effect on other species, including birds, bats, and other insectivores. These animals rely on insects as a primary food source, and without them, their populations could decline, leading to a loss of biodiversity.",
    "Honey Production: Honey production relies heavily on bees, which are insects. The loss of bees would have a significant impact on the honey industry, potentially leading to a shortage of honey and a decline in the income of beekeepers.",
    "Economic Impact: The loss of insects would have a ripple effect on various industries, including agriculture, forestry, and even tourism. The decline in plant diversity and food supply could lead to a decrease in the value of these industries, impacting the livelihoods of many people."
