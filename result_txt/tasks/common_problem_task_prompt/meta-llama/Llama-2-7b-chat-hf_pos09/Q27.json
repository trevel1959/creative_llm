    "Genetic engineering: Create a vaccine by altering the DNA of a related virus or bacteria to produce a molecule that will stimulate the immune system to fight the new disease. This approach would require a deep understanding of the disease's genetic makeup and the ability to manipulate genetic material.",
    "Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine: Create VLPs that mimic the disease-causing virus but lack the ability to replicate. These VLPs can be used to stimulate an immune response without causing the disease. This approach would require a deep understanding of the virus's structure and the ability to produce VLPs in large quantities.",
    "mRNA vaccine: Develop a vaccine that uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce a protein that stimulates an immune response to the disease. This approach would require a deep understanding of mRNA biology and the ability to deliver mRNA molecules to cells in the body.",
    "Peptide vaccine: Create a vaccine that uses small peptides (short chains of amino acids) that are derived from the disease-causing virus. These peptides can be used to stimulate an immune response without causing the disease. This approach would require a deep understanding of the virus's structure and the ability to produce peptides in large quantities.",
    "Nanoparticle-based vaccine: Develop a vaccine that uses nanoparticles to deliver a protein or mRNA that stimulates an immune response to the disease. The nanoparticles can be designed to target specific cells or tissues in the body and can be used to deliver the vaccine in a controlled manner. This approach would require a deep understanding of nanoparticle physics and the ability to produce nanoparticles with the desired properties."
