    "**Hyperloop Integration**: Implement a Hyperloop network within the city, connecting major hubs and neighborhoods. This high-speed transportation system would significantly reduce travel times, increase efficiency, and provide a unique, futuristic experience for commuters. The Hyperloop would be powered by renewable energy sources, minimizing its carbon footprint. To make it even more appealing, the Hyperloop stations could be designed as sleek, modern architecture landmarks, showcasing the city's commitment to innovation and sustainability.",
    "**Smart Bike-Sharing System**: Develop a smart bike-sharing system that allows users to rent bikes for short or extended periods. The bikes would be equipped with GPS, safety features, and integrated with the city's public transportation network. This system would encourage eco-friendly transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and provide a fun, active way for citizens to get around the city. To take it to the next level, the bikes could be designed with built-in technology, such as air-quality sensors, noise-reducing features, or even augmented reality displays.",
    "**Elevated Pedestrian Walkways**: Construct elevated pedestrian walkways above major streets, providing a safe and efficient way for pedestrians to navigate the city. These walkways could be designed with unique features, such as: \t* **Green roofs**: Plant-covered roofs that help to mitigate the urban heat island effect and create habitats for local wildlife.",
    "**Autonomous Vehicle Network**: Establish a network of autonomous vehicles that can transport citizens within the city. These vehicles would be designed to be efficient, safe, and accessible, with features such as: \t* **Shared transportation**: Autonomous vehicles would pick up and drop off passengers at designated points, reducing the need for personal vehicles and decreasing congestion.",
    "**Underground Transportation Tunnels**: Develop a network of underground transportation tunnels that connect major hubs, neighborhoods, and commercial areas. These tunnels would provide a fast, efficient, and climate-controlled way for citizens to"
