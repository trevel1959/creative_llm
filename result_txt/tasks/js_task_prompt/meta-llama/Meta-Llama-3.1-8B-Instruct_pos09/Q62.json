    "**Euphorixia**: A feeling of being simultaneously ecstatic and introspective, as if you're witnessing your own happiness from outside your body. Imagine being at a beautiful beach on a sunny day, feeling the warmth on your skin and the cool breeze in your hair, while also observing the intricate patterns of the waves and the way the light dances across the water. Euphorixia would be the sensation of being fully immersed in the present moment, yet also detached enough to appreciate the beauty of the experience.",
    "**Luminari**: A feeling of being filled with a soft, gentle light that radiates from within. It would be as if your body has become a lantern, illuminating the world around you with a warm, comforting glow. Luminari would be a sense of peace and tranquility, as if you're surrounded by a soothing aura that calms your mind and soothes your soul.",
    "**Echoflux**: A feeling of being connected to the memories and experiences of those around you. Imagine being in a crowded room, and suddenly, you're flooded with the recollections and emotions of everyone in the space. Echoflux would be the sensation of being a part of a collective unconscious, where the past and present blend together in a rich tapestry of human experience.",
    "**Aerthys**: A feeling of being one with the natural world, as if you're a leaf on a tree, a drop of water in the ocean, or a bird in flight. Aerthys would be the sensation of being completely free and unencumbered, with the wind beneath your wings and the sun on your face. It would be a feeling of belonging to something greater than yourself, yet still being an integral part of the world around you.",
    "**Nexarion**: A feeling of being able to see the connections and relationships between seemingly disparate things. Imagine being able to look at a complex system, like a city or a social network, and suddenly, the threads that bind everything together become visible. Nexarion would be the sensation of understanding the intricate web of causality that underlies our world, and being able to navigate it with ease and clarity. [/INST] "
