    "**Shelter Construction**: Finding or building a suitable shelter is essential for protection against the elements, such as rain, wind, and sun exposure. Without proper materials, constructing a durable shelter can be difficult. The need for insulation and safety from wildlife adds complexity to this task, potentially leading to injuries or illness if the shelter fails.",
    "**Navigation and Rescue**: Being on a deserted island can lead to disorientation, especially if there are no landmarks. Without navigational tools or knowledge, finding a way back to civilization becomes a daunting task. Additionally, the lack of communication devices means that rescue efforts could be significantly delayed, leading to a sense of hopelessness.",
    "**Mental Health Challenges**: Isolation can have a profound impact on mental health. Feelings of loneliness, despair, and anxiety may arise, leading to a decline in overall well-being. Developing coping mechanisms and maintaining a positive mindset become critical, but this can be difficult without social interaction or support.",
    "**Wildlife Encounters**: While some wildlife can provide food sources, others may pose threats. Encounters with aggressive animals or insects can lead to injuries or disease. Additionally, understanding which animals are safe to consume and which are not is crucial for survival, as making the wrong choice can be fatal.",
    "**Injury and Illness**: On a deserted island, the risk of injury from environmental hazards (sharp rocks, falling branches) or accidents (falls, cuts) is heightened. Without access to medical supplies, even minor injuries can become serious. Furthermore, exposure to the elements can lead to illnesses like hypothermia or heatstroke, complicating survival efforts."
