    "Smart Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can monitor and track the temperature of the ice cubes it produces. This would be achieved through the integration of a small temperature sensor and a Bluetooth module, allowing users to monitor the temperature of their ice cubes remotely through a smartphone app. This feature would be particularly useful for people who are concerned about the temperature of their drinks, such as those who are storing medication in the freezer or those who are preparing drinks for a party.",
    "Personalized Ice Cubes: Develop an ice tray that can be programmed to produce ice cubes with custom shapes and designs. This could be achieved through the use of a 3D printer or a molding process that allows for the creation of intricate designs. This feature would be perfect for parties or events where guests can enjoy unique and personalized ice cubes.",
    "Self-Replenishing Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can automatically refill itself when the ice cubes inside start to melt. This would be achieved through the integration of a small water reservoir and a pump system that can refill the ice tray as needed. This feature would be particularly useful for people who live in hot climates or for those who enjoy having a steady supply of ice cubes available.",
    "Health Monitoring Ice Tray: Develop an ice tray that can monitor the temperature and humidity of the air around it. This information can then be used to provide insights into the user's health, such as their respiratory health or their sleep patterns. This feature would be particularly useful for people who are concerned about their health and want to monitor their environment in real-time.",
    "Interactive Ice Tray: Create an ice tray that can interact with users through voice commands or other sensors. This could include features such as a game where users can play trivia or puzzles by solving ice cube puzzles, or a virtual assistant that can help users with their daily tasks. This feature would be perfect for parties or events where guests can enjoy a fun and interactive ice tray experience."
