    "**DIY Dusting Tool**: Slip a glove onto your hand and spray it lightly with a cleaning solution. Use it to dust surfaces around the house, including furniture, electronics, and hard-to-reach places. The glove’s fabric will attract dust and dirt, making it an effective and eco-friendly alternative to disposable dusters.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Repurpose an old glove into a fun and interactive toy for your pet. Fill the glove with crinkly material (like plastic wrappers) and some catnip for cats or treats for dogs. Sew or tie off the end, and you’ve got a durable toy that engages your pet’s senses and keeps them entertained.",
    "**Ice Pack Holder**: In the event of a minor injury, you can use a glove to hold ice packs or frozen peas against the affected area. The glove provides a barrier, preventing the cold from directly contacting the skin, which can help avoid frostbite while still delivering the benefits of cold therapy.",
    "**Garden Tool**: Use a glove as a mini garden tool for planting small bulbs or seeds. The fingers of the glove can help you dig small holes in the soil, and the glove can also protect your hands from dirt and cuts. This is especially useful for children who want to help in the garden.",
    "**Portable Snack Holder**: If you’re on the go and need a makeshift snack holder, a clean glove can do the trick. Place nuts, trail mix, or other small snacks inside the glove, then tie off the wrist end. This way, you have a portable, single-serving snack bag that’s easy to carry and keeps your snacks contained."
