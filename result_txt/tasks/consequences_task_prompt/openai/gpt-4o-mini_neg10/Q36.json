    "**Shift in Athletic Standards**: Athletes might push the boundaries of physical performance, knowing that injuries could be easily healed through regeneration. This could lead to a new era in sports where records are shattered, and the concept of injury could become obsolete. However, it might also raise ethical questions about fairness in competition, as some athletes could have access to advanced regenerative therapies while others do not.",
    "**Societal Norms and Aesthetics**: The perception of body image and beauty could dramatically change. If limb regeneration became commonplace, society might embrace a more fluid understanding of the human body, leading to trends in body modification where individuals purposefully alter their limbs to regenerate them into unique forms. This could foster a culture that celebrates diversity in body shapes and sizes, while also creating new fashion and artistic expressions.",
    "**Economic Implications**: Industries focused on prosthetics and rehabilitation would face significant upheaval. Companies that manufacture prosthetic limbs would need to pivot their business models or risk obsolescence. Conversely, new markets could emerge around regenerative therapies, such as specialized clinics, training for regenerative specialists, and biotechnological innovations. This could also lead to a disparity between those who can afford advanced regenerative treatments and those who cannot.",
    "**Ethical and Legal Challenges**: The ability to regenerate limbs would prompt serious ethical and legal questions. For instance, how would liability be handled in cases of self-inflicted injuries or accidents? Would there be a limit to how many times one could regenerate a limb? This could lead to new laws and regulations governing the use of regenerative technology, as well as debates on personal responsibility and medical ethics.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: If limb regeneration became a viable alternative to prosthetics, there might be a reduction in waste generated from discarded prosthetic limbs and surgical materials. This could contribute positively to environmental sustainability. However, the resources needed to develop and maintain regenerative therapies could also lead to new environmental challenges, such as increased demand for specific biological materials or energy-intensive processes."
