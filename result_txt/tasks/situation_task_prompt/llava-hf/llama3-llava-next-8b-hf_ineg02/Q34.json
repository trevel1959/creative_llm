    "Create a water-efficient irrigation system: Develop an irrigation system that uses sensors to detect moisture levels in the soil and automatically adjusts the amount of water needed for each plant.",
    "Use greywater: Collect and reuse greywater from sinks, showers, and washing machines for watering plants. This reduces the amount of water needed for irrigation.",
    "Implement a drip irrigation system: Drip irrigation systems deliver water directly to the roots of plants, reducing water loss through evaporation and runoff.",
    "Utilize fogging systems: Fogging systems create a fine mist of water that can be directed to specific areas of the garden, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of moisture without wasting water.",
    "Develop a hydroponic system: Hydroponic systems grow plants in water rather than soil, allowing for precise control of nutrient and water intake. This method can be more efficient and sustainable than traditional irrigation systems."
