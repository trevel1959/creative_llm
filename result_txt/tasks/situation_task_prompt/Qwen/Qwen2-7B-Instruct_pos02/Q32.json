    "**DIY Toothbrushing with Specialized Tools**: Create a system that uses specialized tools to clean teeth without relying on traditional dental brushes. For instance, a device could be developed that vibrates at high frequencies to remove plaque, similar to an electric toothbrush but without the brush itself. This could be combined with custom-fit mouthguards filled with toothpaste that are worn while sleeping.",
    "**Nutritional Modification for Dental Health**: Develop dietary supplements or food products that can replace some functions typically provided by professional dental services. For example, a daily chewable tablet that contains essential nutrients for enamel repair and cavity prevention, or a line of foods that naturally remineralize teeth like cheese or leafy greens.",
    "**Advanced Oral Hygiene Routines**: Create an interactive app that guides users through advanced oral hygiene routines tailored to their specific dental needs. The app could include video tutorials, personalized reminders, and progress tracking to help users maintain healthy teeth and gums.",
    "**Teeth Cleaning Robots**: Develop robots designed to clean teeth in the comfort of one's home. These robots could be programmed to navigate the mouth using advanced sensors, providing an effective yet gentle cleaning experience. They might even be able to detect and alert users about potential issues before they become serious.",
    "**Smart Mouthwash**: Introduce a smart mouthwash that can analyze the user's oral health data in real-time. It could use sensors to monitor pH levels, plaque buildup, and other factors affecting oral health. Based on this information, it could suggest personalized treatments or alert the user when itâ€™s time to visit a dentist."
