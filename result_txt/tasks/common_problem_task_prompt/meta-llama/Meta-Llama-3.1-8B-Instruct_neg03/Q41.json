    "**Aurora**: The spaceship is designed to resemble a giant aurora borealis, with undulating solar sails that shimmer and glow in a mesmerizing display of color and light. The ship's hull is made of a lightweight, iridescent material that shifts and changes color depending on the angle of the light, creating an otherworldly appearance. The ship's propulsion system is powered by a unique fusion of solar energy and advanced plasma technology, allowing it to traverse vast distances in a relatively short period of time.",
    "**Nexus**: The spaceship is a modular, interconnected network of spherical modules that can be easily detached and reattached as needed. Each module serves a specific purpose, such as life support, propulsion, or communication, and can be swapped out with a new one if damaged or upgraded. The modules are connected by a network of slender, glowing fibers that pulse with energy, creating a sense of dynamic movement and flexibility. The ship's AI, named \"Nexus,\" serves as a central hub, coordinating the various modules and ensuring seamless communication and operation.",
    "**Luminari**: The spaceship is a majestic, crystalline structure that shimmers and glows with an inner light. The ship's hull is composed of a lattice of interconnected crystals that refract and reflect light in dazzling patterns, creating an ethereal atmosphere. The ship's propulsion system is powered by a rare, high-energy crystal that is capable of harnessing and amplifying the energy of nearby stars. The ship's AI, named \"Lumin,\" serves as a guardian and guide, using its vast knowledge and experience to navigate the vast expanse of space.",
    "**Kairos**: The spaceship is a sleek, aerodynamic vessel designed for speed and agility. The ship's hull is made of a lightweight, super-dense material that allows it to cut through space-time with ease, while its advanced propulsion system uses a combination of gravitational manipulation and exotic matter to achieve incredible acceleration.
