    "Sunscreen Cap: One idea could be to create a custom-made sunscreen cap that covers the entire head, including any bald areas. The cap could be made of lightweight and breathable materials, such as mesh or cotton, to ensure comfort while protecting against harmful UV rays. The cap could also come in different styles and colors to match personal preferences.",
    "Headband with Sunscreen: Another idea could be to create a headband that is lined with sunscreen to provide added protection for the scalp. The headband could be made of a stretchy material that fits snugly on the head, ensuring that it stays in place throughout the day. It could also be designed with ventilation holes to keep the head cool and comfortable.",
    "Scalp Shield: A third idea could be to create a protective shield for the scalp that covers the entire area, including any bald spots. The shield could be made of a sturdy and durable material, such as plastic or metal, and could be designed to fit snugly on the head. It could also be equipped with adjustable straps to ensure a secure fit.",
    "Hair Replacement System: A fourth idea could be to develop a hair replacement system specifically designed for people who have lost their hair due to cancer treatment. The system could consist of artificial hair strands that are attached to the scalp using special adhesive or clips. This would allow individuals to wear hats and other accessories without worrying about exposing their bald head to the sun.",
    "Sunscreen-Infused Clothing: Finally, a fifth idea could be to incorporate sunscreen into clothing items such as shirts, hats, and swimwear. The clothing could be treated with a special formula that contains SPF to provide additional protection against the sun's harmful rays. This would be a convenient and practical solution for people who want to stay protected while enjoying outdoor activities."
