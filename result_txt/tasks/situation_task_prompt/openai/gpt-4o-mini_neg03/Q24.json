    "**Vision Enhancement Tattoos**: A revolutionary concept could involve temporary tattoos that use bioluminescent ink to enhance vision. These tattoos could be applied around the eyes and would react to light, improving contrast and helping individuals with low vision perceive their surroundings better. They could also include micro-sensors that adjust the ink's properties based on the lighting conditions, providing a customizable visual experience.",
    "**Biometric Eye Drops**: Scientists could develop eye drops that temporarily alter the eye's focal length or enhance the eye's natural ability to focus. These drops could be administered before activities that require good vision, allowing individuals to see clearly for a few hours at a time. The drops could also contain nutrients to improve overall eye health and delay the progression of vision problems.",
    "**Smart Contact Lens Substitutes**: Instead of traditional lenses, people could use smart lens-like devices that adhere to the eye's surface. These devices could use micro-LED technology to project images directly onto the retina, providing a clear visual experience without the need for corrective lenses. Users could control the focus and brightness through a companion app, allowing for a personalized visual experience tailored to different activities.",
    "**Community Vision Sharing Networks**: To cope with the loss of glasses and contact lenses, communities could establish \"vision sharing\" networks where individuals with good vision volunteer to assist those with poor vision. This could involve guided walking services, reading assistance, or even technology-sharing programs where people can borrow AR devices or other vision aids from those who have them. This community-driven approach would foster social connections while helping those in need navigate their daily lives.",
    "**Bioengineered Eye Enhancements**: Advances in biotechnology could lead to the development of bioengineered eye enhancements, such as implantable devices that mimic the function of glasses or contact lenses. These implants could be designed to correct vision issues by altering the shape of the cornea or enhancing light reception in the retina. The implants would be biocompatible and could be adjusted over time to adapt to changes in an individual's vision."
