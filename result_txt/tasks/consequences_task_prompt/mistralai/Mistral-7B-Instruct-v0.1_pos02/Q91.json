    "The world as we know it would be turned upside down. Buildings and structures would collapse under their own weight, and transportation systems would be disrupted. People would be unable to walk or stand without falling over.",
    "The oceans would drain out of the Earth's surface, leaving the planet dry and barren. This would have catastrophic consequences for life on Earth.",
    "The planet's atmosphere would be thrown into chaos, with gases and particles swirling in all directions. This could lead to severe weather events and other natural disasters.",
    "The sun and other celestial bodies would appear to be in the sky at different times of day. This could lead to confusion and disorientation for people on Earth.",
    "Gravity could have unintended consequences on technology and engineering. For example, spacecraft designed to travel in space would be rendered useless on Earth, and structures like bridges and buildings would have to be redesigned to withstand the effects of gravity."
