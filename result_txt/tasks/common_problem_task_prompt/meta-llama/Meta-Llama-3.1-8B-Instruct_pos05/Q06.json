    "**Mars Habitat Dome**: Design a self-sustaining, inflatable dome that serves as a home for Martian residents. The dome would be made of a durable, transparent material that allows for natural light to enter and provides a 360-degree view of the Martian landscape. The interior would be climate-controlled, with a comfortable atmosphere, temperature, and humidity level. The dome would also have a built-in air recycling system, which would extract CO2 from the Martian atmosphere and convert it into oxygen. This would minimize the need for resupply missions from Earth and reduce the carbon footprint of the Martian settlement.",
    "**Underground City**: Construct an underground city that utilizes the natural insulation of the Martian regolith to maintain a stable temperature. The city would be built into the side of a Martian hill or crater, with layers of rock and soil providing natural protection from radiation and extreme temperatures. The city would have a network of tunnels and caverns, with habitats, life support systems, and infrastructure for the residents. The underground location would also provide a natural shield against meteorites and other space debris.",
    "**Inflatable Space Station**: Develop an inflatable space station that can be transported to Mars and deployed in orbit around the planet. The station would be made of a lightweight, yet incredibly strong material that can withstand the harsh conditions of space. The station would have a modular design, allowing for easy expansion and modification as needed. It would also have a built-in solar panel array, which would provide power for the station and its occupants. The inflatable design would also make it easier to transport and deploy the station, reducing the need for complex and expensive robotic assembly.",
    "**Mars Base Camp**: Establish a base camp on the Martian surface, which would serve as a hub for scientific research, exploration, and potential resource extraction. The base camp would be built using local materials, such as Martian regolith, and would have a prefabricated design that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. The base camp would have a range of facilities, including laboratories, living quarters, and life support systems. It would also have a landing pad for spacecraft and a launch pad for Mars ascent vehicles.",
    "**Atmospheric Processor**: Develop an atmospheric processor that can extract resources from the Martian atmosphere, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The processor would use a combination of chemical and physical processes to separate and purify the gases, which would then be used to support life and power the Martian settlement. The processor would also have a"
