    "Build a community-based water filtration system: Develop a decentralized water filtration system that can be built and maintained by the local community. This system would use locally sourced materials and be designed to be easy to maintain and repair. The filtration system could be powered by solar energy, making it a sustainable and reliable source of clean water.",
    "Implement a rainwater harvesting system: Develop a rainwater harvesting system that can collect and store rainwater for use in the community. This system could be integrated with the filtration system, providing a reliable source of clean water during times of drought or water scarcity. The system could also be designed to include a simple and efficient drainage system to prevent flooding and maintain water quality.",
    "Create a mobile water purification unit: Develop a mobile water purification unit that can be transported to remote areas of the developing country. This unit could use a combination of ultraviolet light, ceramic filters, and other technologies to purify water on the go. This would provide a reliable source of clean water for communities that lack access to a centralized water filtration system.",
    "Establish a water conservation program: Develop a water conservation program that educates the local community on the importance of water conservation and provides incentives for reducing water usage. This could include measures such as installing low-flow showerheads and toilets, implementing water-saving irrigation systems, and promoting water-efficient agriculture practices. By reducing water usage, the community can conserve water resources and reduce the strain on the centralized filtration system.",
    "Create a community-based water testing program: Develop a community-based water testing program that empowers the local community to test and monitor the quality of their water. This program could provide training and resources for community members to collect and analyze water samples, identify contaminants, and advocate for changes to improve water quality. By involving the community in water testing and monitoring, the program can build trust and increase the effectiveness of water quality improvements."
