    "**Solar-Powered Space Station for Disaster Relief**: Design a satellite that doubles as a space station, equipped with solar panels and a cutting-edge communication system. The satellite can be deployed to disaster-stricken areas, providing critical communication services, navigation, and even solar-powered electricity to aid in rescue and relief efforts. The satellite's advanced sensors can also monitor the disaster's impact and provide valuable data to emergency responders.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester for Sustainable Space Exploration**: Develop a satellite that can extract water from the atmosphere, making it a self-sustaining water source for future space missions. The satellite would utilize advanced nanotechnology and AI-powered algorithms to collect and condense water vapor, providing a reliable source of drinking water, hygiene, and even life support systems for astronauts.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power for Renewable Energy**: Launch a satellite that collects solar energy in orbit and beams it back to Earth as a microwave beam. This technology would provide a constant and reliable source of renewable energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. The satellite could be designed to be modular, allowing for easy maintenance and upgrade.",
    "**Orbital Recycling Facility for Space Debris**: Develop a satellite that can collect and recycle space debris, reducing the growing problem of orbital pollution. The satellite would utilize advanced robotics and AI-powered sorting systems to identify and collect debris, then break it down into its constituent materials, which could be reused in future space missions.",
    "**Advanced Weather Monitoring System for Climate Change Mitigation**: Launch a satellite that provides high-resolution, real-time weather monitoring and forecasting capabilities, enabling scientists to better understand and predict climate-related phenomena. The satellite would be equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered analytics, providing critical data for climate modeling, weather forecasting, and disaster preparedness."
