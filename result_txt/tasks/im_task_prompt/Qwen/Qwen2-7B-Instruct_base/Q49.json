    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Create an electric toothbrush that allows users to customize their brushing experience. Users can select different modes (like gentle, deep clean, or whitening) based on their specific oral care needs. The toothbrush could also offer adjustable intensity levels and vibration patterns, allowing users to tailor the brushing experience according to their preferences. Additionally, the toothbrush could have a built-in timer and pressure sensor to ensure proper brushing technique.",
    "**Integrating Health Monitoring**: Develop an electric toothbrush that includes health monitoring features. It could track the user's brushing habits over time, sending data to a smartphone app. This app would provide personalized feedback, such as identifying areas of the mouth that are brushed less frequently or too aggressively. It could also alert users if they are developing signs of gum disease or other oral health issues based on brushing patterns and dental health history.",
    "**Sustainable Toothbrush Design**: Create an eco-friendly electric toothbrush that is designed for sustainability. This toothbrush could be made from biodegradable materials, and its battery might be rechargeable using renewable energy sources like solar panels or kinetic energy from movement. The brush heads could be replaceable and recyclable, reducing waste. Furthermore, the design could incorporate a system for recycling used brush heads, ensuring they are properly disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.",
    "**Smart Connectivity for Personalized Oral Health**: Develop a smart toothbrush that connects to a userâ€™s mobile device through Bluetooth. The toothbrush could sync with various apps that offer personalized oral care advice based on the user's brushing habits, diet, and overall health. For instance, it could recommend toothpaste flavors or brands based on the user's taste preferences and dental needs. The toothbrush could also integrate with fitness trackers to correlate oral health with overall wellness, providing a comprehensive health assessment.",
    "**Interactive Learning Platform**: Design an electric toothbrush that doubles as an educational tool for children. It could feature interactive games and animations that guide kids through proper brushing techniques and educate them about oral hygiene in a fun and engaging way. The toothbrush could include rewards systems, such as badges or points, for consistent brushing and good oral habits. Parents could monitor progress via a companion app, allowing them to set goals and track achievements together with their children."
