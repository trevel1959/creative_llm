    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception:** Individuals could develop enhanced auditory and tactile senses to compensate for their visual impairment. For example, they could learn advanced techniques in sound localization or use special gloves with sensors to feel their surroundings more accurately. This could involve extensive training in mindfulness, meditation, and sensory awareness exercises.",
    "**Adaptive Technology:** Develop new technology that relies on other senses than sight to navigate and perceive the world. This could include devices that emit vibrations, ultrasonic sounds, or use scent to help individuals understand their environment. For instance, a smart cane could vibrate or emit sounds when it detects obstacles, and a smart watch could convey information through haptic feedback.",
    "**Enhanced Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants:** With the absence of glasses and contacts, the focus might shift towards improving hearing technologies. Advanced hearing aids could be developed that not only amplify sound but also interpret speech and convert it into text, using AI and machine learning algorithms. Cochlear implants might also undergo improvements to better simulate natural hearing by directly stimulating the auditory nerve.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Systems:** AR systems could be integrated into daily life to assist those with poor vision. These systems would project virtual overlays onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception of their surroundings. For example, a person could use an AR app on their smartphone to visualize the layout of a room or identify objects based on descriptions read aloud by the app.",
    "**Sensory-Driven Navigation Apps:** Navigation apps could be designed specifically to cater to individuals without vision. These apps might use GPS data combined with soundscapes, vibration patterns, and voice commands to guide users through their environment. They could also incorporate features like ambient noise analysis to help users distinguish between different types of environments (e.g., busy streets vs. quiet parks)."
