    "Wheelchair with a twist: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, I would design a wheelchair with a built-in joystick system that allows me to control the direction and speed of the chair using my mouth movements. This would enable me to move around with greater precision and ease, even without the use of my legs. The joystick could be connected to a computer or smartphone, allowing me to navigate through virtual environments and interact with digital objects.",
    "Exoskeleton suit: I would create an exoskeleton suit that would provide support and mobility for my body, allowing me to stand and walk again. The suit would be equipped with advanced sensors and actuators that would detect and respond to my muscle movements, allowing me to perform a wide range of tasks with greater ease and precision. The suit could also be equipped with a built-in oxygen supply system, allowing me to move around for longer periods of time without needing to rest.",
    "Hoverchair: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, I would design a hoverchair that uses advanced magnetic levitation technology to allow me to move around without touching the ground. The hoverchair would use a series of magnets to create a cushion of air around the chair, allowing me to float above the ground and move around with greater ease and comfort. The chair could also be equipped with a built-in oxygen supply system, allowing me to move around for longer periods of time without needing to rest.",
    "Brain-computer interface: I would use a brain-computer interface (BCI) to control a virtual avatar that would allow me to move around in a virtual environment. The BCI would use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect electrical activity in my brain and translate it into digital commands. This would allow me to control the avatar's movements and interact with virtual objects and environments with greater ease and precision. The BCI could also be used to control other devices, such as a computer or smartphone, allowing me to interact with the digital world in new and innovative ways.",
    "Robotic arms: I would design a pair of robotic arms that would allow me to perform a wide range of tasks without the need for my legs. The robotic arms would be equipped with advanced sensors and actuators"
