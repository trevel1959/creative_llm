    "Solar-powered lighting: One solution to light up a room at night without lamps or lighting fixtures is to install solar panels on the roof or walls of the room. These panels can be used to charge a set of rechargeable LED lights that can be placed throughout the room. This solution would require some initial setup and maintenance, but it would be a sustainable and eco-friendly way to light up a room.",
    "Bioluminescent plants: Another option is to incorporate bioluminescent plants into the room's design. These plants emit a soft, natural glow that can be used to light up the room at night. This solution would require some research and planning to ensure that the plants are compatible with the room's lighting and temperature requirements.",
    "Candles and lanterns: A more traditional solution is to use candles and lanterns to light up the room. This solution would require some effort to gather and set up the candles and lanterns, but it would provide a warm and cozy atmosphere.",
    "Glow-in-the-dark furniture and decor: Another option is to incorporate glow-in-the-dark furniture and decor into the room's design. This could include tables, chairs, and rugs that have a soft glow, or even a wall mural that can be used to light up the room. This solution would require some creativity and planning to ensure that the furniture and decor are compatible with the room's lighting and color scheme.",
    "LED strip lighting: Finally, LED strip lighting can be used to light up the room at night. This solution would require some setup and maintenance, but it would provide a sleek and modern look to the room. LED strip lighting can be used to light up the walls, ceiling, or even the furniture and decor, and it can be controlled with a remote or a smartphone app."
