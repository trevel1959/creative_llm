    "**Lumina**: A wearable device that translates the wearer's emotions into a dynamic, color-shifting light display. This device would use AI-powered emotion recognition software to detect the wearer's emotional state and respond with a corresponding light pattern. For example, if the wearer is feeling calm, the light would shift to a soothing blue hue. If they're feeling energetic, the light would flash with a vibrant red color. This device could be used in various settings, such as therapy sessions, public performances, or even as a fashion statement.",

    "**ChronoLoop**: A time-traveling puzzle game where players must navigate a series of interconnected timelines to prevent a catastrophic future from unfolding. Using AI-powered temporal mechanics, players would be able to jump between different eras, interacting with historical figures and altering the course of events to create a new timeline.
