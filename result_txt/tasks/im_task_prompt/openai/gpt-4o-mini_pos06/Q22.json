    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that incorporates solar panels to charge its battery during the day. This eco-friendly flashlight can be used for outdoor activities, ensuring that it remains charged without needing to rely on traditional power sources. Additionally, it could have a built-in power bank feature to charge other devices in emergencies.",
    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Emergency Tools**: Combine a flashlight with essential emergency tools such as a seatbelt cutter, a glass breaker, and a whistle. This multi-functional device can be a lifesaver in emergencies, making it not just a light source but also a practical tool for survival situations, especially in cars or during outdoor adventures.",
    "**Modular Flashlight Design**: Create a modular flashlight where users can swap out different components based on their needs. For instance, users could choose between different lenses for various beam patterns, or add attachments like a lantern head for broader illumination or a strobe feature for signaling. This customization allows users to tailor the flashlight to specific situations.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that can be controlled via voice commands. This feature would be especially useful for individuals with disabilities or when hands are occupied. Users could turn the flashlight on/off, adjust brightness, or change light modes simply by speaking commands, making it more accessible and convenient.",
    "**Interactive Projection Flashlight**: Imagine a flashlight that can project images or patterns onto surfaces. This could be used for educational purposes, such as projecting constellations for stargazing or fun designs for parties. It could also have a \"story mode\" where it projects visuals while narrating a story, making it a unique tool for children's bedtime routines."
