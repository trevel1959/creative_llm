    "**Modular Growth**: This plant could have a modular growth pattern, where individual branches or leaves can be separated and propagated independently. This would allow for a unique, customizable plant that could be shaped and trimmed to fit any space or design preference.",
    "**Edible Flowers**: The new plant could have flowers that are not only beautiful but also edible. The flowers could be a source of nutrition, providing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are beneficial to human health.",
    "**Air Purification**: The plant could be designed to have a heightened ability to purify the air. It could be engineered to absorb pollutants and produce oxygen more efficiently than existing plants. This would be particularly useful in urban environments where air quality is often a concern.",
    "**Self-Watering**: The new plant species could have a self-watering mechanism, allowing it to survive and thrive in environments with limited water resources. This could be achieved through the use of water-storing roots or through a genetic modification that allows the plant to absorb and retain water more effectively.",
    "**Fragrance Production**: The plant could be designed to produce a pleasant, aromatic scent. This could be achieved through the use of essential oils or through genetic modification to increase the production of certain fragrant compounds. The fragrance could be used for relaxation, mood enhancement, or even as a natural insect repellent."
