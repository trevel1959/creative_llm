    "Smart Bike Helmet: Develop a bicycle helmet with integrated sensors and a compact computer system that can detect and alert the rider of potential hazards such as speed cameras, potholes, and obstacles. The helmet can also track the rider's speed, distance, and route, providing real-time data to improve safety and performance.",
    "Personalized Fit System: Create a bicycle helmet with a customizable fit system that allows riders to adjust the size and shape of the helmet to their individual head shape. This would provide a more comfortable and secure fit, reducing the risk of the helmet shifting or coming loose during riding.",
    "Anti-Theft System: Develop a bicycle helmet with an anti-theft system that includes a GPS tracker and a loud alarm. If someone tries to steal the helmet, the alarm will sound, alerting the rider and others in the area. The GPS tracker will also allow the rider to locate the helmet on a map in real-time.",
    "Smart Lighting System: Design a bicycle helmet with built-in LED lights that can be controlled by the rider. The lights can be set to flash in different patterns to indicate the rider's direction of travel, providing increased visibility to other road users, especially in low-light conditions.",
    "Environmental Monitoring System: Create a bicycle helmet with a built-in air quality sensor that can detect pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. The helmet can also monitor temperature and humidity levels, providing riders with real-time data on the environmental conditions they are riding in. This information can be displayed on a small screen on the helmet or through a mobile app."
