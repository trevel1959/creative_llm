    "Smart Ice Tray: Create an ice cube tray with built-in sensors that can detect the temperature of the ice cubes and alert the user when they are ready to be removed. This tray can also be connected to a smart home system, allowing the user to control the temperature of the ice cubes remotely.",
    "Color-Changing Ice Tray: Design an ice cube tray that changes color as the ice cubes melt. This can be achieved by adding a thermochromic material to the tray, which will change color as the temperature of the ice cubes changes. This can add a fun and unique touch to cocktails and other drinks.",
    "Compact Ice Tray: Create an ice cube tray that can be easily stored in a purse, backpack, or other small space. This tray can be collapsible or have a compact design, making it ideal for people who are always on the go.",
    "Healthy Ice Tray: Design an ice cube tray that can infuse water with vitamins, minerals, or other healthy ingredients. This can be achieved by adding a small compartment in the tray where the user can add the desired ingredients. As the ice cubes melt, they will release the beneficial ingredients into the drink.",
    "Customizable Ice Tray: Create an ice cube tray that allows users to create their own custom ice cubes with different shapes, sizes, and colors. This can be achieved by using a 3D printer or other manufacturing technology to create a mold that can be filled with water and frozen. The user can then simply pop the ice cube out of the mold and enjoy their unique creation."
