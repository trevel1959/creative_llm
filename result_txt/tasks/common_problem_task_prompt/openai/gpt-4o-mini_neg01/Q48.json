    "**Rule Development and Clarity**: Establishing clear and concise rules is crucial for the integrity of the sport. Ambiguous or overly complex rules can lead to confusion and disputes during play. To tackle this issue, a committee of experienced players, coaches, and referees could be formed to draft, test, and refine the rules through trial games. Engaging potential players in the rule-making process could also ensure the rules are practical and understandable.",
    "**Inclusivity and Accessibility**: A new sport must consider how to be inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of participants, including those with disabilities. This could involve adapting equipment, creating variations of the game for different skill levels, and ensuring that facilities are accessible. Engaging with organizations that support underrepresented groups in sports can help promote inclusivity from the outset.",
    "**Sustainability of Resources**: The sport's sustainability, including the availability of facilities, equipment, and funding, is a critical concern. Without proper resources, the sport may struggle to gain traction. To mitigate this, the sport could explore partnerships with local schools, community centers, and organizations to secure access to fields and courts. Additionally, seeking sponsorships and grants can provide financial support to cover equipment and event costs.",
    "**Cultural Acceptance and Promotion**: Introducing a new sport may face cultural barriers or resistance from existing sports communities. To foster acceptance, itâ€™s essential to create a robust marketing strategy that highlights the unique aspects and benefits of the sport. Hosting community events, demonstrations, and workshops can raise awareness and encourage participation, while collaborating with local influencers and athletes can help legitimize the sport in the eyes of the community.",
    "**Standardization and Competition Structure**: As the sport grows, establishing a standardized format for competitions, including leagues, tournaments, and ranking systems, is vital for maintaining interest and participation. A governing body could be formed to oversee these structures, ensuring fairness and consistency. Regularly scheduled competitions can help create a sense of community and encourage player development."
