    "Multiple Sun System: Imagine a solar system with multiple suns. The suns could be of different sizes and temperatures, creating a more diverse and dynamic environment. Planets and moons would need to adapt to the varying conditions of the multiple suns, leading to unique geological formations and ecosystems.",
    "Tilted Orbits: Design a solar system with planets and moons that have tilted orbits. This would create a sense of motion and energy, as the planets and moons would appear to be constantly changing directions.",
    "Hollowed-Out Planets: Create a solar system with hollowed-out planets. The interior of the planets could be filled with habitable environments, such as oceans, forests, and cities. This would create a unique and intriguing solar system, where the planets are not just rocky bodies but also thriving ecosystems.",
    "Binary Star System: Design a solar system with a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other. This would create a more dynamic and energetic environment, as the stars would be constantly changing positions and creating varying levels of light and heat.",
    "Oceanic Planets: Imagine a solar system with planets that are primarily oceanic in nature. The planets could be covered in oceans that span their entire surface, with mountains and islands rising from the depths. This would create a unique and fascinating solar system, where the planets are not just rocky bodies but also thriving ecosystems."
