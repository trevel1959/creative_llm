    "**Innovative Aquatic Ecosystem**: Design an underwater habitat for a unique aquatic creature that combines elements of fish, sea turtles, and octopuses. The habitat could feature artificial coral reefs, kelp forests, and underwater caves to mimic natural environments. It would include water filters to maintain optimal conditions, as well as a system for introducing nutrients through algae beds. The habitat could also have a transparent dome allowing for public viewing while keeping the creature in its natural environment.",
    "**Vertical Forest Habitat**: For a flying mammal like a giant bat or flying squirrel, create a vertical forest habitat. This would consist of tall trees connected by platforms and bridges, with various layers representing different levels of the forest canopy. Each layer could have different types of foliage, insects, and small prey to support the ecosystem. This design allows the animal to fly between platforms, providing exercise and freedom of movement, while also offering a variety of habitats for different stages of life.",
    "**Desert Oasis Retreat**: Design a desert oasis habitat for an animal adapted to extreme arid conditions, such as a giant tortoise or a species of lizard. This habitat would include a central pool of water surrounded by lush vegetation that can survive on minimal water. Artificial rainfall systems could be used to ensure consistent water supply, and the area around the oasis could be designed to mimic desert landscapes with sand dunes and rocks. This would provide both a water source and shelter for the animal.",
    "**Iceberg Exploration Area**: Create a polar habitat for a large penguin or seal species that thrives in cold environments. This could involve building an artificial iceberg with multiple floors, each serving a different purpose - from resting areas to swimming lanes. The habitat would be cooled to mimic the cold climate, with a system for maintaining ice formation and meltwater collection. The floors could be interconnected by tunnels and ramps, encouraging exploration and physical activity.",
    "**Rainforest Canopy Walkway**: Develop a rainforest habitat for arboreal animals such as monkeys or large birds. This would be a series of elevated walkways, platforms, and branches suspended high above the ground, mimicking the complex structure of a dense rainforest. Each level could represent different parts of the canopy (e.g., lower canopy, mid-level canopy, upper canopy), providing diverse environments for the animals to explore. The habitat could also incorporate interactive features like climbing structures, zip lines, and bird feeders to enrich the animal's experience and offer educational opportunities for visitors."
