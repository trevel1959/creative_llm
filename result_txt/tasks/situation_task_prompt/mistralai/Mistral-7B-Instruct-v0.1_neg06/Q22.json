    "Use a bicycle: If all roads disappeared, the bicycle would become the primary mode of transportation in a town or city. This would require people to purchase bikes or rent them, and would encourage cycling culture. It would be an environmentally friendly solution as well.",
    "Build bridges and walkways: If roads disappear, people can build bridges and walkways to connect different parts of the city. This would be a permanent solution and would allow people to move around freely.",
    "Use public transportation: If roads disappear, public transportation such as buses, trains, and trams would become the primary mode of transportation. This would require people to rely on public transportation, which would reduce the number of cars on the road.",
    "Build elevators: If roads disappear, people can build elevators to connect different floors of buildings. This would be a convenient solution for people who live in tall buildings.",
    "Use boats: If roads disappear, people can use boats to move around the city. This would be an interesting solution and would require people to adapt to a new way of transportation. It would also provide a unique perspective of the city from the water."
