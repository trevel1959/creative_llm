    "Rubber Duck Therapy: Rubber ducks have been used in therapy for children for decades, providing a comforting and calming presence during stressful situations. Take this concept a step further by creating a Rubber Duck Therapy program, where patients can interact with specially designed rubber ducks that are programmed to provide emotional support and guidance. The ducks could be equipped with sensors to detect a patient's emotional state and respond accordingly, offering words of encouragement or soothing sounds. This unique therapy could be especially helpful for children and adults with anxiety or depression.",
    "Rubber Duck Water Park: Build a water park centered around rubber ducks! The park could feature various rubber duck-themed attractions, such as the \"Quacking River\" (a lazy river), \"Duck Pond\" (a wave pool), and \"Webbed Feet Water Slides\" (water slides with rubber duck-shaped tubes). Visitors could also enjoy rubber duck-themed food and drinks, such as \"Quackers\" (a rubber duck-shaped ice cream cone) and \"Duck Pond Punch\" (a refreshing drink served in a rubber duck-shaped cup).",
    "Rubber Duck Fashion Show: Host a fashion show featuring rubber ducks as the main attraction! Designers could create outfits for rubber ducks, showcasing their creativity and imagination. The show could be held in a large pool or tank, with the rubber ducks walking down the runway and strutting their stuff. Audience members could vote for their favorite duck, with prizes awarded for the best outfit. This unique event could raise money for a local children's hospital or animal shelter.",
    "Rubber Duck Art Exhibit: Create an art exhibit featuring rubber ducks as the main subject. Artists could submit their interpretations of rubber ducks in various mediums, such as paintings, sculptures, and installations. The exhibit could be held in a gallery or museum, with visitors encouraged to vote for their favorite piece. A portion of the proceeds could go to a local art school or children's art program.",
