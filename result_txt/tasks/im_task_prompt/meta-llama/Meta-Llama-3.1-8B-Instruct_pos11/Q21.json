    "**Sustainable City**: Design a futuristic city that runs entirely on renewable energy, with towering vertical farms, self-sustaining ecosystems, and cutting-edge green architecture. The city would be powered by a combination of solar, wind, and hydro energy, with a focus on minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. Residents would live in eco-friendly homes made from locally sourced, sustainable materials, and would have access to advanced public transportation systems that reduce carbon emissions.",
    "**Mars Colonization**: Establish a human settlement on Mars, with a focus on terraforming the planet to make it habitable for future generations. The colony would be powered by a combination of nuclear energy and advanced solar panels, with a robust system for recycling water and air. Residents would live in habitats made from Martian regolith, with a focus on creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that can support a diverse range of plant and animal life.",
    "**Underwater City**: Design an underwater city that exists beneath the waves, with towering domes and habitats that provide a safe and sustainable environment for residents. The city would be powered by a combination of tidal and wave energy, with a focus on minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. Residents would live in eco-friendly homes made from locally sourced, sustainable materials, and would have access to advanced public transportation systems that reduce carbon emissions.",
    "**Space Station**: Create a self-sustaining space station that orbits the Earth, with a focus on scientific research and exploration. The station would be powered by a combination of solar and nuclear energy, with a robust system for recycling water and air. Residents would live in habitats made from advanced materials, with a focus on creating a safe and sustainable environment for long-term space travel.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Island**: Design an eco-friendly island that exists in the middle of the ocean, with a focus on sustainable tourism and environmental conservation. The island would be powered by a combination of solar and wind energy, with a focus on minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. Residents would live in eco-friendly homes made from locally sourced, sustainable materials, and would have access to advanced public transportation systems that reduce carbon emissions. The island would also feature advanced systems for recycling water and waste, and would be home to a diverse range of plant and animal life. "
