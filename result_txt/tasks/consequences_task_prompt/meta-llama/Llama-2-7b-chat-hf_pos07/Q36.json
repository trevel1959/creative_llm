    "Enhanced Resilience: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans would possess unparalleled resilience in the face of injuries or amputations. The ability to regrow lost limbs would significantly reduce the risk of infection, promote faster healing, and minimize the need for extensive medical interventions. This would enable individuals to recover more quickly and return to their normal lives, leading to improved mental and physical well-being.",
    "New Prosthetic Opportunities: The ability to regenerate limbs would open up new possibilities for prosthetic design. Prosthetics could be designed to integrate with the body's natural regenerative processes, allowing for more natural movement and control. This would lead to improved functionality, comfort, and aesthetics for individuals with prosthetic limbs. Additionally, the development of advanced prosthetic limbs could revolutionize the field of robotics, enabling the creation of more sophisticated and realistic artificial limbs.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: With the ability to regenerate limbs, humans could potentially develop enhanced sensory perception. Starfish have a unique sensory system that allows them to detect vibrations and pressure changes in the water. By incorporating this ability into human limbs, individuals could gain a heightened sense of touch and spatial awareness, allowing them to navigate their environment more effectively. This could also lead to advancements in fields such as medicine, where doctors could use their enhanced sensory perception to detect subtle changes in patient vital signs.",
    "New Forms of Exploration: The ability to regenerate limbs would enable humans to explore new environments and environments that were previously inaccessible. For example, deep-sea explorers could regrow lost limbs to navigate the extreme pressures and temperatures of the ocean depths. Similarly, astronauts could regenerate limbs to explore the surface of other planets and moons, where the lack of atmosphere and extreme temperatures would pose significant challenges to human exploration.",
    "Ethical Considerations: With the ability to regenerate limbs, there would arise new ethical considerations regarding the use of this technology. For example, would individuals have the right to choose which limbs to regenerate, and how would this"
