    "**Decompression Sickness**: Also known as \"the bends,\" decompression sickness can occur if divers ascend too quickly after spending time at significant depths. This condition can cause severe pain and potentially life-threatening complications. To prevent this, a strict ascent protocol should be established, including slow ascent rates and mandatory safety stops. Training divers in proper decompression techniques is also crucial.",
    "**Limited Communication**: Deep-sea environments can severely limit communication with the surface due to water pressure and distance. This lack of communication can lead to difficulties in coordinating operations or responding to emergencies. To address this, utilizing advanced underwater communication technologies, such as acoustic modems or satellite communication buoys, can help maintain contact with the team above.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The deep sea is home to various environmental hazards, including strong currents, underwater volcanoes, and unpredictable marine life. These factors can pose risks to the safety of the crew and the integrity of the equipment. Conducting comprehensive pre-mission environmental assessments and utilizing real-time monitoring systems can help navigate these hazards effectively.",
    "**Psychological Stress**: Spending extended periods in a confined space underwater can lead to psychological stress among crew members. This stress can manifest as anxiety, cabin fever, or interpersonal conflicts. To counteract this, providing crew members with psychological support, ensuring regular communication with loved ones, and incorporating leisure activities during the mission can help maintain morale and mental well-being.",
    "**Data Collection Challenges**: Collecting data in the deep sea can be complicated by equipment limitations, environmental conditions, and the sheer scale of the underwater terrain. Instruments may not function as expected, or the data may be difficult to interpret. To improve data collection, utilizing a combination of advanced technologies, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), can enhance the quality and quantity of data gathered."
