    "Elevator Repair Drone: Deploy a small drone equipped with repair tools and programming to fix the malfunctioning elevators. The drone could navigate through the shaft and reach the elevator's control panel to make the necessary repairs. Once the repairs are complete, the drone could guide the elevator to the desired floor.",
    "Magnetic Lifts: Install magnetic lifts in the elevator shafts that can lift people or objects to the desired floor. These lifts would use magnetic fields to levitate and move up or down the shaft, eliminating the need for traditional elevator cars.",
    "Gravity-Defying Cables: Install cables that can counteract the force of gravity, allowing people to climb up the sides of skyscrapers. These cables would be secured to the building's structure and provide a safe and secure way to ascend to higher floors.",
    "Personal Rocket Packs: Provide each person with a small rocket pack that can propel them to the top of the skyscraper. These packs would use a combination of thrusters and parachutes to slow the descent and ensure a safe landing on the roof.",
    "Sky Bridge Connections: Build sky bridges connecting the skyscraper to adjacent buildings or structures. These bridges could provide a safe and convenient way to traverse between buildings, eliminating the need for elevators. The sky bridges could be designed with walkways, stairs, or even small vehicles for transportation."
