The design could include unique patterns or styles that are both trendy and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Artisanal Custom Sweater Service**: Offer a custom sweater service where customers can choose their own colors, designs, and even the fabric type.

You could host these events in various cities, partnering with local boutiques and influencers. This event-based marketing strategy would increase brand visibility and engagement.",
    "**Sweater Recycling Program**: Initiate a program that encourages customers to return their old, worn-out sweaters for recycling or upcycling.
