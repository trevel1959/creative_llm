    "**Global Language Requirement**: If I could create a single rule for everyone in the world to follow, it would be that everyone must learn and use at least two languages fluently. This rule would promote global understanding, reduce cultural barriers, and enhance international cooperation. By speaking multiple languages, individuals can communicate more effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, fostering empathy and tolerance. Additionally, this rule would boost cognitive abilities, as studies have shown that bilingualism can improve memory, problem-solving skills, and even delay the onset of dementia.",
    "**Universal Basic Income**: Another rule could be implementing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all citizens worldwide. Everyone would receive a regular, unconditional sum of money, ensuring a basic standard of living and reducing poverty. This rule would eliminate financial stress, allowing individuals to pursue education, entrepreneurship, or personal growth without worrying about meeting basic needs. It could also stimulate the economy by increasing consumer spending and reducing income inequality.",
    "**Global Recycling Mandate**: Enforcing a strict recycling mandate worldwide would encourage sustainable practices and reduce environmental degradation. Every individual and organization would need to recycle waste materials, separating them into specific categories for efficient processing and reuse. This rule would significantly decrease landfill waste, conserve natural resources, and reduce pollution. Additionally, it would promote innovation in recycling technologies and create new job opportunities in the green economy.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Programs**: Implementing a universal cultural exchange program where every person spends at least one year living and working in a different country would foster global understanding and appreciation for diversity. This rule would allow individuals to experience firsthand the customs, traditions, and perspectives of other cultures, promoting empathy and reducing prejudice. It would also encourage cross-cultural collaboration and innovation, as people from various backgrounds share knowledge and skills.",
    "**Digital Detox Law**: To address the growing concerns around excessive screen time and its negative impact on mental health, I would introduce a Digital Detox Law. This rule would mandate a minimum amount of screen-free time per day for all individuals, encouraging them to engage in offline activities like reading, exercising, or spending time outdoors. This law would help reduce addiction to digital devices, improve mental well-being, and strengthen interpersonal relationships by promoting face-to-face interactions. It would also contribute to the preservation of privacy and the protection of personal data in an increasingly digital world."
