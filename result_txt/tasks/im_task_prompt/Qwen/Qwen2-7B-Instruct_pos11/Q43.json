    "**Smart Oven for Meal Preparation**: Design an oven that can be connected to your smartphone or a home automation system like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. It comes with pre-programmed recipes and can automatically adjust temperature, time, and cooking mode based on the type of food you're cooking. For instance, when you select a pizza recipe, it could suggest the perfect temperature and cooking time, ensuring the pizza is cooked evenly and deliciously.",
    "**Energy-Saving Oven with Solar Integration**: Create an oven that uses solar energy to heat up its interior. The oven would have a solar panel integrated into its design, which collects solar energy during the day and stores it in batteries. At night, this stored energy heats the oven. This not only reduces the dependency on traditional energy sources but also lowers the carbon footprint associated with conventional ovens.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Experience Oven**: Build an oven that includes a touch screen interface, where users can follow along with interactive cooking videos, adjust ingredients in real-time, and receive feedback on their cooking progress. This feature would enhance the learning experience for beginners, and provide a more engaging way for experienced cooks to experiment with new recipes.",
    "**Multi-functional Smart Oven**: Design an oven that doubles as a microwave, toaster, and air fryer, all within one appliance. This would save space in kitchens while offering versatile cooking options. It could also include smart features such as voice command activation, automatic temperature adjustments based on the type of dish being cooked, and even the ability to send notifications to your phone when your food is ready.",
    "**Vegan-Friendly Oven**: Develop an oven that is optimized for vegan cooking. It could come with specific settings tailored for vegan dishes, such as vegan baking modes, which might require different temperatures or humidity levels compared to traditional baking. Additionally, the oven could be equipped with sensors that detect the presence of certain ingredients and suggest complementary cooking methods or adjustments, making it easier for vegans to explore a wide variety of recipes."
