    "**Eco-friendly Clothes Iron:** Create an iron that utilizes renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. This would not only help reduce carbon footprint but also make the iron a practical choice for those who live in areas with limited access to electricity. The iron could have an automatic shut-off feature when the power source is depleted.",
    "**Smart Clothes Iron with AI Assistance:** Design a smart clothes iron that learns your preferences over time. It could automatically adjust heat settings based on the fabric type, or even suggest the best ironing techniques based on the garment's characteristics. The iron might also integrate with your smart home system, allowing you to control its settings from your smartphone.",
    "**Portable Clothes Iron for Travel:** Develop a compact, lightweight clothes iron that is suitable for travel. This could be a mini version of the standard iron, possibly using a rechargeable battery. It could also come with a heat-resistant carrying case, making it easy to transport. The design could include features such as quick heat-up times and a small water tank for steam function, ideal for touch-ups while on the go.",
    "**Heated Garment Storage System:** Create a clothes iron that doubles as a heated storage rack for clothes. After ironing, the garment can be hung on the iron's built-in hanger, which keeps the clothes smooth and wrinkle-free. This idea combines two functions into one device, saving space and providing convenience. It could also include a timer to ensure garments don't remain too long at high temperatures, preventing damage.",
    "**Voice-activated Clothes Iron Control:** Develop a voice-activated clothes iron that responds to commands issued through a built-in microphone. This feature would be especially helpful for individuals with mobility issues or those who struggle with fine motor skills. Users could dictate their ironing needs, such as \"heat up\" or \"iron shirt,\" without having to physically interact with buttons or knobs. The system would need advanced speech recognition technology to interpret commands accurately."
