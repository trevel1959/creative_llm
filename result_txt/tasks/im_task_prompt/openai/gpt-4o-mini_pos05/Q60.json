    "**Multi-Purpose Towel**: Design a towel that can transform into various items. For example, it could have hidden zippers and compartments that allow it to convert into a beach bag, a picnic blanket, or even a travel pillow. This multifunctionality would appeal to travelers and outdoor enthusiasts looking to save space.",
    "**Scent Infusion System**: Embed microcapsules of essential oils or fragrances within the fabric of the towel. When the towel is used, the friction releases the scent, providing a soothing aroma while drying off. This would enhance the bathing or beach experience, making it more enjoyable and relaxing.",
    "**Smart Towel**: Integrate smart technology into the towel, such as a small Bluetooth speaker or a health monitoring system that tracks hydration levels or skin moisture. The towel could also connect to an app that reminds users to stay hydrated or alerts them when itâ€™s time to reapply sunscreen.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create towels made from 100% recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or ocean waste. Additionally, the production process could utilize environmentally friendly dyes and manufacturing methods. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers looking for sustainable options.",
    "**Personalized Towel Design**: Offer a service where customers can customize their towels with personal designs, colors, or monograms. Using an online platform, users could upload images or choose from a library of graphics, creating a unique and personal towel that reflects their style."
