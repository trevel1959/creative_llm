    "Magnetic levitation trains: A high-speed train system that uses magnetic levitation technology could be built to travel between continents. This would allow for faster and more comfortable travel, while also reducing the environmental impact of transportation.",
    "Underwater vehicles: Advanced underwater vehicles, such as submersibles, could be used for long-distance travel. These vehicles would be equipped with advanced life support systems and could travel at high speeds underwater, eliminating the need for air travel.",
    "Space elevators: A space elevator could be built to allow for travel between continents by ascending into space and then descending onto another continent. This would eliminate the need for air travel and provide a more efficient and environmentally friendly option.",
    "Tunneling: A network of tunnels could be built between continents to allow for rapid and efficient travel. This would eliminate the need for air travel and provide a more environmentally friendly option.",
    "Teleportation: A teleportation system could be developed to allow for instant travel between continents. This would eliminate the need for air travel and provide a more efficient and environmentally friendly option."
