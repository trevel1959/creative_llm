    "Hairbrush for Hair Growth: Create a hairbrush with a unique design that stimulates hair growth by massaging the scalp. The brush would have multiple soft bristles with different lengths and angles, allowing for a gentle yet effective massage. The brush could also have a built-in scalp massager that provides a gentle vibration, further promoting blood flow and hair growth.",
    "Smart Hairbrush: Develop a hairbrush with built-in sensors that detect and analyze various aspects of hair health, such as hair type, density, and split ends. The brush could also include a microchip that detects changes in hair texture and adjusts brushing speed and pressure accordingly. This would provide personalized hair care recommendations based on individual hair types and needs.",
    "Hairbrush with Built-in Heating/Cooling System: Create a hairbrush with a built-in heating or cooling system that can be adjusted based on individual preferences. This would provide a more comfortable and relaxing hair brushing experience, as well as help to style hair more easily. The brush could also have multiple heat/cool settings, allowing for customized styling.",
    "Hairbrush with Built-in Detangling Tool: Design a hairbrush with a built-in detangling tool, such as a small comb or brush, that makes it easier to gently detangle hair without causing breakage or tangles. This would be particularly useful for people with long or curly hair, who often struggle with detangling.",
    "Interactive Hairbrush: Create a hairbrush that responds to voice commands or other gestures, allowing users to control the brushing experience. For example, the brush could adjust brushing speed or direction based on voice commands, or provide customized styling recommendations based on hair type and desired look. This would provide a more personalized and interactive hair brushing experience."
