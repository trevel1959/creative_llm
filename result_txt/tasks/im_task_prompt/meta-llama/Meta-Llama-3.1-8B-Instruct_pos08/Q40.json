    "**Obstacle Course with a Twist**: Design an obstacle course that incorporates real-world challenges, such as navigating through a mock office cubicle maze, crawling through a tunnel filled with \"paperwork\" (represented by crumpled paper), or balancing on a \"tightrope\" (a narrow beam) while being bombarded with \"distractions\" (represented by balloons popping or loud noises). The twist: participants must complete the course while wearing a VR headset that simulates real-world stressors like deadlines, meetings, or phone calls.",
    "**The Great Escape**: Create a room-escape-style challenge where participants are \"trapped\" in a mock prison cell. The twist: the cell is filled with \"distractions\" like a TV playing a never-ending loop of cat videos, a \"noise-making\" device that emits loud, annoying sounds, and a \"snack attack\" that tempts participants with unhealthy treats. The goal is to escape the cell within a set time limit by solving puzzles and riddles that require creative problem-solving and critical thinking.",
    "**The Pitch**: Develop a challenge where participants are given a random product or service and must come up with a creative pitch to sell it to a mock investor (played by a charismatic actor). The twist: the participant must do the pitch while being interrupted by a \"distraction\" (represented by a sudden loud noise, a fake phone call, or a surprise visit from a \"nosy neighbor\"). The goal is to adapt the pitch on the fly and convince the investor to invest in the product or service.",
    "**The Art of Adaptation**: Create a challenge where participants are given a random art supply kit and must create a piece of art within a set time limit. The twist: the participant must adapt to a series of \"distractions\" like a sudden change in lighting, a \"noise-making\" device that disrupts their focus, or a surprise visit from a \"critic\" who provides constructive feedback. The goal is to think creatively and adapt to the changing environment to produce a unique and impressive piece of art.",
    "**The Team Tango**: Develop a challenge where participants are divided into teams and must work together to complete a series of tasks, such as building a bridge with limited materials or solving a complex puzzle. The twist: each team member has a unique \"distraction\" that they must overcome, such as a \"tech-phobe\" who is terrified of using a specific tool or a \"perfectionist"
