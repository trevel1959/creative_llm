    "Corkscrew-shaped solar panels: A corkscrew-shaped solar panel design could maximize energy absorption and minimize space usage. The spiral shape would allow for more efficient energy collection, as the panels could be placed closer together without overlapping. This design could be particularly useful for small-scale or portable solar power systems, such as those used in remote areas or for camping. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Corkscrew-shaped wind turbines: A corkscrew-shaped wind turbine could take advantage of the increased airflow generated by the spiral shape. As the wind flows through the turbine, it would be channeled through the spiral, generating more power. This design could be particularly useful for small-scale wind power systems, such as those used in residential areas or for farming. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Corkscrew-shaped water purification systems: A corkscrew-shaped water purification system could use the spiral shape to increase the surface area of the filtration medium, allowing for faster and more efficient water purification. The system could be particularly useful in areas where access to clean water is limited, such as developing countries or disaster zones. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Corkscrew-shaped gardening tools: A corkscrew-shaped gardening tool, such as a trowel or cultivator, could make it easier to maneuver in tight spaces and reach into corners of the garden. The spiral shape would allow for more efficient digging and planting, and could also help to aerate the soil. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Corkscrew-shaped furniture: A corkscrew-shaped piece of furniture, such as a chair or table, could add an interesting design element to a room. The spiral shape could also provide a unique seating or working surface, and could be particularly useful in small spaces or for people with mobility issues. Confidence score: 0.6"
