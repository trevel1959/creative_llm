    "**Invest in Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: IPM is a holistic approach to managing pests that involves the use of multiple strategies, such as cultural, biological, and chemical methods. This approach can help reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides and minimize the environmental impact of pest control.",
    "**Use Plant-Based Pest Control**: There are many plant-based pest control solutions that can be effective against insects. For example, neem oil, garlic spray, and diatomaceous earth are all natural and non-toxic options that can be used to control pests.",
    "**Incorporate Pest-Resistant Plants**: Some plants are naturally resistant to pests, and incorporating these plants into gardens and landscapes can help reduce the need for chemical pesticides. For example, marigolds, garlic, and chrysanthemums are known to repel insects and can be used as natural barriers.",
    "**Create a Physical Barrier**: Physical barriers, such as netting or row covers, can be used to protect plants from insects. This can be particularly effective for preventing damage to fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Use Traps and Baits**: Traps and baits can be used to capture and control pest populations. For example, sticky traps can be used to catch flying insects, while bait stations can be used to attract and kill ground-dwelling pests."
