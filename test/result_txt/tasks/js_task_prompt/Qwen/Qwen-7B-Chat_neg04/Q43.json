    "Security System: With the ability to see through walls, I could create a security system that could detect any suspicious activity or intruders within a building. This system would consist of cameras placed on the exterior of the building that can transmit their footage to a central monitoring station. The cameras would have advanced sensors that can detect even the tiniest movement in the walls and alert the monitoring station immediately. This way, the security team can respond quickly and prevent any potential threats.",
    "Spy Equipment: If I were a spy, I could use my ability to see through walls to gather intelligence on enemy activities. For example, I could place small cameras inside a room and monitor their conversations without being detected. Similarly, I could use thermal imaging technology to detect hidden weapons or explosives in a location. Additionally, I could use this power to infiltrate enemy bases undetected.",
    "Home Inspection: As an interior designer or home inspector, I could use my ability to see through walls to identify structural issues or hidden damage in a property. By looking through the walls, I could determine if there are any leaks, cracks, or other problems that need to be addressed before a sale or renovation. This would save time and money for both homeowners and contractors.",
    "Entertainment: I could use my ability to see through walls as a unique form of entertainment. Imagine hosting a party where guests can use special glasses to see through walls and watch the activities taking place behind them. This would create a thrilling and immersive experience for guests, making the event unforgettable.",
    "Psychological Therapy: Finally, I could use my ability to see through walls as a tool for psychological therapy. By allowing clients to see into their own minds, I could help them understand their thoughts and emotions better. This would provide valuable insights into their behavior and help them develop coping strategies for dealing with stress and anxiety. Additionally, it could also be used to diagnose mental health conditions such as depression or schizophrenia."
