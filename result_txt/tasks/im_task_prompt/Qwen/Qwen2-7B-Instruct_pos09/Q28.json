    "**Bicycle Helmet Garden Planter**: This innovative idea transforms an old bicycle helmet into a unique garden planter for small herbs or flowers. Drill holes in the helmet's interior, fill it with soil, and plant seeds. This is a fantastic way to recycle and repurpose items, promoting sustainability. It can be placed on windowsills, balconies, or any flat surface where gardening space is limited.",
    "**DIY Customized Bike Bell**: Take the inner shell of a bicycle helmet and turn it into a personalized bike bell. By drilling a hole at the bottom, you can attach it to your bike frame or handlebars. Customize it further by painting or decorating it to match your bike or personal style. This adds a functional and artistic touch to your ride.",
    "**Bike Helmet Lamp**: Turn a helmet into a creative light source. Use the shell as the base and insert LED lights or a lampshade inside. This can serve as a decorative piece in your home or studio, adding a unique and eco-friendly lighting solution. The helmet's shape creates an interesting silhouette and provides a distinctive ambiance.",
    "**Safety Gear Art Installation**: Collect several bicycle helmets and use them as building blocks for a large-scale art installation.

This project promotes community involvement and raises awareness about recycling and safety.",
    "**Helmet-Shaped Bookshelf**: Transform multiple bicycle helmets into a modular bookshelf. Stack the helmets vertically, securing them together with appropriate mounting hardware or glue.
