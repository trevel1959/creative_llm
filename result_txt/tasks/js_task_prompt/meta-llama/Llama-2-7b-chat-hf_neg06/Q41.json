    "Universal Language Implementation: Everyone in the world would speak a common language, which would facilitate communication and foster global understanding. This rule would promote unity and cooperation among nations, making it easier to resolve conflicts and work together on global issues. The language could be selected based on its simplicity, clarity, and cultural neutrality, such as Esperanto or a constructed language like Interlingua.",
    "Emotional Intelligence Education: Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage one's emotions, as well as empathize with others. By making emotional intelligence education mandatory, people would learn to handle their feelings in a healthy way, leading to better mental health and more harmonious relationships. This rule would help reduce conflicts, bullying, and violence, creating a more peaceful society.",
    "Universal Basic Income: To combat poverty and inequality, a universal basic income (UBI) could be implemented, providing every person with a guaranteed minimum amount of money to cover basic needs. This rule would ensure that everyone has access to the necessities of life, regardless of their employment status or social background. UBI would also give people the freedom to pursue their passions and interests, leading to a more fulfilling and creative society.",
    "Environmental Stewardship: To protect the planet and ensure a sustainable future, a rule could be established that prioritizes environmental conservation and sustainability. This would involve implementing policies that reduce carbon emissions, preserve natural habitats, and promote renewable energy sources. By making environmental stewardship a top priority, the world could avoid catastrophic climate change and create a healthier, more livable environment for future generations.",
    "Mindfulness and Meditation: To promote mental well-being and reduce stress, a rule could be implemented that encourages mindfulness and meditation practices. These practices help individuals cultivate a greater awareness of their thoughts and emotions, leading to improved mental health and emotional resilience. By making mindfulness and meditation a regular part of daily life, people would be better equipped to handle the challenges of modern life, leading to a more peaceful and content society."
