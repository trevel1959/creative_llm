    "**Customizable Temperature Zones**:    - Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For instance, a section for fruits and vegetables could have higher humidity, while a meat compartment could be colder. Users could control these zones through a smartphone app, allowing for optimal preservation of different food types.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration and Infuser**:    - Incorporate a built-in water filtration system that not only purifies water but also allows users to infuse it with fruits, herbs, or flavors. This feature would enable users to have fresh, flavored water readily available, promoting hydration and reducing reliance on sugary drinks.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**:    - Introduce an AR interface that projects onto the refrigerator door, allowing users to see the contents of their fridge without opening it. Users could view recipes, nutritional information, and expiration dates through a simple touch or voice command, enhancing convenience and efficiency in meal preparation.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Solar Panels**:    - Equip refrigerators with small, integrated solar panels that can supplement their energy consumption. These panels could power minor functions like lighting or temperature displays, reducing overall energy usage and promoting sustainability. This could be especially useful in off-grid homes or during power outages.",
    "**Odor Neutralization Technology**:    - Develop a built-in odor neutralization system that uses activated carbon filters or UV light to eliminate unwanted smells. This feature would ensure that the refrigerator maintains a fresh scent, even when storing strong-smelling foods, and could be activated with a simple button or automatically triggered when certain smells are detected."
