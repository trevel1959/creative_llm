    "The idea is to create a device that can control various aspects of a person's life, such as their phone, TV, lights, and thermostat, all from a single, sleek interface. The twist? It's not just a remote control - it's a wearable device that can be controlled using hand gestures, voice commands, or even brain activity. Imagine being able to change the channel on your TV or turn on the lights in your living room just by thinking about it.",
    "A smart home device that uses AI to learn a person's habits and preferences, and adjusts the lighting, temperature, and even the scent of their home accordingly. For example, it could detect when you're feeling stressed and automatically light a calming color scheme, or sense when you're about to wake up and start brewing a fresh cup of coffee.",
    "A device that uses sound waves to create a 3D audio experience in any environment. Imagine being able to feel like you're in the middle of a concert or a sports game, even if you're just sitting in your living room. The device could be controlled using a smartphone app, and could even be integrated with other smart home devices to create a fully immersive experience.",
    "A wearable device that tracks a person's mental and physical health, and provides personalized recommendations for improvement. For example, it could detect when you're feeling anxious and suggest a meditation session, or track your sleep patterns and recommend a new mattress.",
    "A device that uses augmented reality to bring art and culture to life in the home. Imagine being able to point your smartphone at a painting or sculpture and see it come to life in 3D, or watch a virtual tour of a famous museum. The device could be controlled using a smartphone app, and could even be integrated with other smart home devices to create a fully immersive experience."
