    "Sun-Powered Umbrellas: Create umbrellas with built-in solar panels that harness the energy from indirect sunlight filtering through the clouds. These umbrellas could power small devices, like smartphones or headlamps, providing a reliable source of light even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a network of strategically placed LED lights suspended from balloons or drones that float above the clouds. These lights could be programmed to illuminate specific areas, providing a natural and soft source of light for various activities.",
    "Reflective Window Coatings: Develop a specialized window coating that can reflect a significant amount of sunlight, even on cloudy days. This coating could be applied to windows, skylights, or even entire buildings, allowing for more natural light to enter and brighten up indoor spaces.",
    "Cloud-Bridge Concept: Design a sky bridge or a series of interconnected bridges that span across the clouds, providing a safe and stable pathway for people to walk or bike through. These bridges could be equipped with translucent panels that allow for diffused sunlight to pass through, illuminating the path ahead.",
    "Solar-Powered Clouds: Develop a technology that can convert sunlight into tiny, lightweight clouds that can be released into the atmosphere. These clouds would be able to store and release solar energy as needed, providing a reliable and sustainable source of light even on cloudy days. This could be achieved through the use of nanotechnology, which could create tiny solar panels that can be dispersed into the atmosphere."
