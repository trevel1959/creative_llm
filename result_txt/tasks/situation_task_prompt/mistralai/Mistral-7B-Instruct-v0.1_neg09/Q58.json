    "Implement anief System: Belief-based insect repellent system could be developed that would use natural compounds to repel insects. This system would work byieving the presence of insects, and then releasing the appropriate repellent to the specific area.",
    "Use Robotics: Robots couldie placed in areas where insects are prevalent, and they could use sensors to detect and track insecties. Once the insects are detected, the robots could release a non-toxic insecticide to kill them.",
    "Introduce Predatory Insects: Introducing predatory insects could be an effective way to control pest populations. For example, ladybugs are natural predators of aphids, so releasing ladybugs in an area could help control aphid populations.",
    "Use Natural Insecticides: There are many natural insecticides that can be used to control pests. For example, neem oil is a natural insecticide that can be used to control a variety of pests.",
    "Implement Biological Control: Biological control involves using natural enemies of pests to control their populations. For example, parasitic wasps can be used to control caterpillar populations. These wasps lay their eggs inside the caterpillars, which hatch and kill the caterpillars."
