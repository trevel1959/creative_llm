    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Create a picnic basket that transforms into a picnic table. By incorporating foldable legs and a detachable top, the basket can be set up as a surface for dining. This design would be especially useful for families or groups, as it eliminates the need for extra furniture.",
    "**Smart Technology Integration**: Equip the picnic basket with smart technology, such as a built-in Bluetooth speaker for music, LED lights for evening picnics, and a small solar charger for devices. An app could also be developed to track food items, suggest recipes based on what's inside, and provide weather updates for optimal picnic planning.",
    "**Modular Storage Compartments**: Design the basket with customizable, modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the type of picnic. Users could choose to have more space for drinks, snacks, or even a picnic blanket, allowing for personalization based on individual needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Construct the picnic basket using sustainable, biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a greener lifestyle. Additionally, the basket could come with reusable utensils and plates made from the same materials.",
    "**Built-In Game Section**: Include a dedicated section in the basket for outdoor games. This could feature foldable board games, playing cards, or even a small set of sports equipment (like a frisbee or a ball). This addition would encourage social interaction and fun activities during picnics."
