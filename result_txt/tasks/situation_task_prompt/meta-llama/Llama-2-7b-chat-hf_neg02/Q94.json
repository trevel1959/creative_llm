    "Immersive Outdoor Cinemas: Create large-scale outdoor cinemas that utilize projection mapping technology to transform public spaces like parks, rooftops, or even abandoned buildings into immersive cinematic experiences. Audience members can lounge on comfortable furniture or bring their own blankets and pillows, while the movie is projected onto the surrounding walls and structures.",
    "Virtual Reality Cinemas: Develop VR headsets that transport viewers into the movie itself, allowing them to experience the story from the perspective of the characters. This could be achieved through a combination of VR technology and motion capture suits that track the viewer's movements, creating a truly immersive experience.",
    "Interactive Cinematic Installations: Create interactive installations that blur the lines between movie and viewer. These installations could take the form of interactive exhibits, where viewers can manipulate objects or environments within the installation to influence the story being told. For example, a visitor could manipulate a giant light box to create their own narrative within the installation.",
    "Mobile Cinematic Vans: Convert old school buses or vans into mobile cinemas, equipped with projection screens, sound systems, and comfortable seating. These vans could travel to different locations, setting up temporary cinematic experiences in unexpected places like parks, beaches, or even on top of buildings.",
    "Holographic Cinematic Experiences: Develop holographic technology that allows for the creation of holographic images that can be projected into space, creating the illusion of a 3D image floating in mid-air. This technology could be used to create immersive cinematic experiences that transport viewers into the world of the movie, creating a truly unique and unforgettable experience."
