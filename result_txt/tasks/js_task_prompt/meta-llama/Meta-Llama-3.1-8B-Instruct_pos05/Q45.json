It would allow people to understand the history of a place, track the movement of objects or animals, and even sense the presence of others in a way that's both eerie and fascinating.",
    "**Aerthys**: Aerthys would be the ability to perceive the intricate patterns of air currents and temperature fluctuations around us. It would be like having a built-in weather vane that not only tells us the direction of the wind but also the temperature, humidity, and even the presence of pollutants. This sense would be incredibly useful for predicting weather patterns, navigating through dense forests, and even detecting subtle changes in the environment that could indicate potential health risks.",

    "**Luminance**: Luminance would be the ability to perceive the subtle changes in light intensity and color that occur across different wavelengths. It would allow us to \"see\" the infrared radiation that's invisible to the human eye, the ultraviolet light that's hidden from our view, and even the subtle changes in light that occur during the day-night cycle. This sense would be like having a built-in spectrometer that lets us understand the world in a way that's both scientific and poetic.",
