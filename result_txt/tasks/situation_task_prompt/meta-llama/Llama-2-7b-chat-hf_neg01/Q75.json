    "ideas for powering vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared: 1. Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Hydrogen fuel cells use hydrogen as a fuel source and oxygen from the air to produce electricity, which can be used to power vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells are clean, efficient, and have the potential to replace traditional fossil fuels.",
    "Solar Power: Solar power uses photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which can be used to power vehicles. This is a renewable energy source that is clean, abundant, and can be harnessed using various technologies such as solar panels or solar-powered charging stations.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power uses nuclear reactions to generate electricity, which can be used to power vehicles. This is a high-energy density energy source that can provide a reliable and consistent power supply, but it does come with safety and environmental concerns.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are fuels produced from organic matter such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. These fuels can be used to power vehicles in place of traditional fossil fuels, providing a renewable and sustainable energy source.",
    "Electric Motors: Electric motors use electricity to power vehicles, eliminating the need for fossil fuels altogether. Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, and advancements in battery technology are making them more practical and affordable."
