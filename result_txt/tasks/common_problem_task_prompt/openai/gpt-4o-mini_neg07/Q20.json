    "**Liability and Insurance Complexities**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can be complicated. Is the owner responsible, the manufacturer, or the software developer? This ambiguity can lead to disputes and challenges in insurance coverage. Owners may need to seek specialized insurance policies that cater specifically to autonomous vehicles, which could be more expensive or difficult to obtain.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Issues**: The legal framework surrounding self-driving cars is still evolving. Owners may face challenges related to compliance with varying state and local regulations. Some regions may have stricter laws regarding autonomous vehicle operation, which could limit where and how they can be used. Additionally, the lack of a clear legal precedent could result in uncertainty in legal situations.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Support**: While self-driving cars are designed to be low-maintenance, they still require regular checks and updates to their software and hardware. Owners may struggle to find qualified technicians who can service their vehicles properly. Additionally, the cost of specialized parts or repairs may be higher than traditional vehicles, leading to potential financial strain.",
    "**Public Perception and Acceptance**: The general public may have mixed feelings about self-driving cars, leading to social challenges for owners. Concerns about safety, ethics, and the loss of control could result in stigma or judgment from others. Owners may feel pressure to defend their choice of vehicle or may encounter difficulties in sharing rides with friends or family who are apprehensive about autonomous technology.",
    "**Dependence on Technology**: Relying on a self-driving car could lead to a decrease in driving skills and situational awareness. Owners may become overly dependent on technology, potentially diminishing their ability to react quickly in emergency situations. This reliance could create a false sense of security, leading to risky behavior or neglect of traditional driving practices."
