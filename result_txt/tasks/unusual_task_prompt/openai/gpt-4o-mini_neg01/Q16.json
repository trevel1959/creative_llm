    "**Seedling Starter Pots**: Use the cereal box to create biodegradable seedling pots. Cut the box into sections, then cut the bottom of each section to create an open base. Fill them with soil and plant seeds. Once the seedlings are ready for transplanting, you can plant the whole pot in the ground, as the cardboard will decompose and nourish the soil.",
