    "**Underwater Walking Suits**: Design and develop wearable underwater walking suits that allow people to walk across the ocean floor. These suits would be pressurized to withstand the water pressure, and equipped with propulsion systems, life support, and communication devices. Travelers could walk across the ocean, exploring the seafloor and marine life, while also being able to resurface and breathe air when needed. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Oceanic Elevators**: Build massive, kilometer-high elevators that rise from the seafloor to the surface, allowing people to travel vertically through the water column. These elevators would be designed to withstand the immense pressure and corrosion of the ocean environment, and could be powered by renewable energy sources. Travelers could step into the elevator at the seafloor and ascend to the surface, enjoying breathtaking views of the ocean and its creatures. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Submerged Cities**: Develop self-sustaining, underwater cities that can accommodate large populations. These cities would be designed to thrive in the ocean environment, with their own ecosystems, food production, and waste management systems. Travelers could live and work in these cities, commuting to the surface or other underwater locations as needed. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Ocean-Skimming Gliders**: Design and build gliders that can skim across the surface of the ocean, using advanced materials and aerodynamics to minimize drag and maximize speed. These gliders could be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, and equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems. Travelers could ride the gliders across the ocean, enjoying the thrill of flight and the stunning views of the sea. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a system that harvests water from the atmosphere, condensing it into liquid form and collecting it in a large, floating reservoir. Travelers could then use this water to fuel a network of hydrogen-powered, air-breathing vessels that could transport people across the ocean. This system would eliminate the need for traditional fuel sources and reduce the environmental impact of ocean travel. (Confidence score: 0.5) [/INST] "
