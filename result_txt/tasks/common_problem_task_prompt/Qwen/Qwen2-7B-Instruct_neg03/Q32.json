This concept would attract fans who enjoy immersive, interactive experiences and are looking for something new and exciting.",

This would appeal to foodies who appreciate the fusion of culinary arts with music and culture.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Night Festival**: Host a night festival that incorporates all five senses to enhance the music experience.
