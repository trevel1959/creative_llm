    "**Eco-Friendly Door with Solar Panels**: Design a door that incorporates thin, flexible solar panels on its surface. This door would not only serve its primary function but also generate electricity to power smart home devices or outdoor lighting. The energy collected could be stored in a battery within the door, promoting sustainability and reducing energy costs.",
    "**Interactive Door with Augmented Reality (AR)**: Create a door that features an AR interface on its surface. When approached, users could see information about the home (like energy usage, weather updates, or messages from family members) projected onto the door. This would make the door not just a barrier but an interactive hub for information and communication.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Door**: Utilize nanotechnology to create a door that is self-cleaning. The surface would be coated with a special material that repels dirt, water, and grime, making maintenance easier for homeowners. This door would be particularly beneficial for those living in areas with high pollution or frequent rain, as it would always look clean and new without regular washing.",
    "**Soundproof Door with Integrated Speakers**: Develop a door that not only blocks noise but also has built-in speakers that can play music or ambient sounds. This could enhance privacy and create a calming atmosphere in the home. The speakers could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to set the mood as they enter or exit.",
    "**Door with Integrated Planter**: Design a door that features built-in planters on either side. This would allow homeowners to add greenery and flowers to their entrance, improving curb appeal and providing a welcoming atmosphere. The planters could have a self-watering system, making it easy to maintain without requiring constant attention."
