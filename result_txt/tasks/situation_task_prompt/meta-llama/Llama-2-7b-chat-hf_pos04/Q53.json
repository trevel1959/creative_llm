    "Build a Sonic Sculpture: Create a three-dimensional structure that converts sound waves into visual patterns. By attaching sensors to musical instruments, these patterns would be projected onto a screen or wall, allowing people to experience music through sight.",
    "Aural Architecture: Design buildings that generate music through their architectural elements. For example, the vibrations of a building's beams and columns could be used to create a soothing melody, while the wind passing through the structure could create a rhythmic sound.",
    "Musical Instrument Fabrication: Invent new musical instruments using unconventional materials, such as fabric, wood, or even algae. These instruments could be played by manipulating the materials in unique ways, creating a wide range of sounds and tones.",
    "Sound-Activated Light Installations: Develop light installations that change color and pattern based on the volume and tone of the music being played. These installations could be used in public spaces, creating an immersive and interactive musical experience for passersby.",
    "Acoustic Amplification: Create a device that amplifies sound without using electricity. This device could be powered by natural forces like wind, water, or even body heat, allowing music to be enjoyed in areas without access to electricity."
