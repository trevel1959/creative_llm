    "**Wearable Headset**: Integrate a wearable headset with voice commands and augmented reality (AR) technology that allows the user to interact with the vacuum cleaner remotely. This would provide hands-free operation and the ability to monitor and control the vacuum cleaner from a distance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Replace the vacuum cleaner's battery with a rechargeable, eco-friendly option to reduce its environmental impact. This could also include using sustainable materials in the construction of the vacuum cleaner.",
    "**Customizable Attachments**: Offer a range of interchangeable attachments that can be easily swapped out to tackle different cleaning tasks. This could include a carpet cleaner, crevice tool, dust brush, and a wet/dry vacuum attachment.",
    "**Smart Navigation**: Implement advanced navigation technology that allows the vacuum cleaner to map its surroundings and avoid obstacles while cleaning. This could be achieved through the use of LiDAR sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Design**: Combine the vacuum cleaner with other home cleaning appliances, such as a steam cleaner or air purifier, to create a single device that can handle multiple cleaning tasks. This would save space and reduce the need for multiple devices."
