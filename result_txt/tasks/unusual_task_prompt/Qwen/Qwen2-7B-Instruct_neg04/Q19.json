    "**Candle Art Sculptures**: Create a unique piece of art using candles. You can sculpt various objects like animals, flowers, or even abstract shapes. The key to this idea lies in finding the right type of wax (which melts at different temperatures) and using a heat source like a hairdryer to shape it while it's still soft. This can be an excellent way to add a touch of creativity and personalization to any space.",
    "**Candle Infused Scented Oils**: Infuse your own scented oils into candles by adding essential oils during the candle-making process. Choose from a wide variety of scents like lavender, peppermint, or citrus. This not only allows for customization but also ensures that the scent lasts longer and is more concentrated than traditional scented candles. ",
    "**Candle-Driven Lighting System**: Design a system where candles are used as a light source. For instance, create a lantern-like structure that holds multiple candles arranged to cast interesting patterns on walls. This can be both aesthetically pleasing and functional for areas without electricity, such as camping trips or outdoor events.",
    "**Interactive Candle Making Workshops**: Host workshops where participants learn how to make their own candles. You could teach them about different types of waxes, wicks, fragrances, and colorants. This could include making scented candles, drip candles, or even creating custom designs with colored wax. It's a fun activity that promotes creativity and personal involvement.",
    "**Candle-Themed Fashion Accessories**: Combine candles with fashion by creating accessories like necklaces, bracelets, or earrings made from candle components. For example, you could use candle molds as pendants or attach melted candle pieces to jewelry. This could also include incorporating scented oils into the design, offering a subtle scent that follows the wearer throughout the day."
