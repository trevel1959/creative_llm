    "**Enhanced Sensory Training**: People could undergo intensive training in other senses, particularly hearing, to compensate for the loss of visual input. This might include advanced auditory scene analysis techniques, which help individuals understand their surroundings through sound alone. They might also learn to interpret tactile feedback more precisely, for instance, by using haptic devices that vibrate differently when an object is touched.",
    "**Tactile Navigation Systems**: Development of sophisticated tactile navigation tools could enable individuals to navigate their environment safely without relying on sight. These could be wearable devices that use vibrations, pressure changes, or temperature variations to guide wearers along a path. For example, a user could follow a continuous line of vibrating tiles laid out on the ground to navigate indoors or outdoors.",
    "**Immersive Audio-Visual Aids**: With the absence of glasses and contacts, individuals could utilize advanced audio-visual aids that create virtual images through sound. These systems could project sounds that correspond to different colors, shapes, and sizes, helping people \"see\" the world around them in a new way. For instance, a device might make a high-pitched sound for red objects, a low-pitched sound for blue objects, and so on.",
    "**Collaborative Community Support**: In a society where glasses and contacts are no longer available, communities could form support networks that assist each other in various tasks requiring visual acuity. For example, someone who needs help reading a menu or identifying objects could call upon neighbors or community members who are still able to see clearly. This could lead to stronger social bonds and increased reliance on communal resources.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Leveraging AR and AI technologies, people could use smartphones or dedicated devices to enhance their perception of the world. These devices could overlay visual information onto the real world, allowing users to 'see' through the camera lens. For instance, an app might highlight obstacles or provide text-to-speech descriptions of what's being viewed. AI algorithms could continuously refine these overlays based on user feedback, improving their effectiveness over time. "
