    "**Biome-based Insect Farming**: Establish insect farms that mimic natural biomes, creating a controlled environment for beneficial insects like bees, butterflies, and ladybugs. These insects would pollinate crops and provide a natural form of pest control, replacing chemical pesticides. The farms could also serve as educational centers for people to learn about the importance of these insects.",
    "**Insect-based Nutrient Cycle**: Develop a system where insects are used to break down organic waste, converting it into a nutrient-rich compost. This compost could be used to fertilize crops, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and minimizing waste. Insects like mealworms and crickets could be used for this purpose, as they are efficient decomposers.",
    "**Genetic Engineering for Pest Control**: Utilize genetic engineering to create insects that are resistant to pests, but not to beneficial insects. For example, genetically modifying mosquitoes to be resistant to malaria-carrying mosquitoes, while still allowing beneficial insects like bees to thrive. This approach could be used to control the spread of diseases and pests.",
    "**Artificial Intelligence-powered Pest Management**: Develop AI-powered systems that use sensors, drones, and machine learning algorithms to detect and control pest populations. These systems could identify the type of pest, its population density, and the most effective control methods, allowing for targeted and efficient pest management.",
    "**Insect-based Bioremediation**: Use insects to clean pollutants from the environment. For example, certain insects like cockroaches can break down plastics, while others like beetles can clean up heavy metals. These insects could be used to remediate contaminated soil and water, creating a safer environment for humans and wildlife."
