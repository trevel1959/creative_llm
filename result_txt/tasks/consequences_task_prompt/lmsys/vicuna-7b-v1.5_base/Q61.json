    "Bartering: In the absence of currency, people would have to rely on bartering to exchange goods and services. This could lead to inefficiencies as people would have to find someone who has what they need and wants what they have.",
    "Commodities: People might turn to commodities like gold, silver, or other precious metals as a new form of currency. This could lead to a surge in demand for these commodities, causing their prices to rise and potentially leading to a new form of economic bubble.",
    "Digital Currency: With the disappearance of physical currency, digital currencies like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies could become the new standard. This could lead to a more decentralized and potentially more stable economy, but also raise concerns about security and government control.",
    "Universal Basic Income: In response to the lack of currency, governments could implement a universal basic income, providing all citizens with a certain amount of money each month to cover their basic needs. This could help to alleviate poverty and inequality but could also lead to inflation and a decrease in workforce participation.",
    "Community-based Currency: People could create their own community-based currencies, similar to the LETS (Local Exchange Trading System) model, where people exchange goods and services using their own currency. This could lead to a more localized and sustainable economy but could also lead to a lack of standardization and interoperability."
