    "**Waste-to-Resource Revolution**: Implement a decentralized waste management system where every household has a mini- recycling facility. This would convert organic waste into compost, and non-organic waste into biofuels or raw materials for new products. This would reduce the need for landfills and lower greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "**Smart Waste Bins**: Develop intelligent trash cans that use AI-powered sensors to detect the type and quantity of waste. These sensors would send alerts to the homeowner or local authorities, ensuring that waste is collected efficiently and reducing the likelihood of littering.",
    "**Closed-Loop Communities**: Design sustainable neighborhoods where residents share resources and collaborate on waste management. This could include community composting, shared recycling facilities, and educational programs to promote sustainable practices.",
    "**Biodegradable Alternatives**: Introduce biodegradable alternatives to traditional plastics and packaging materials. This could include edible cutlery, compostable packaging, and biodegradable bags. This would significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and oceans.",
    "**Waste-to-Wealth Economy**: Create a circular economy where waste is seen as a valuable resource. This could involve upcycling or repurposing waste materials into new products, such as furniture, jewelry, or even art. This would not only reduce waste but also create new business opportunities and jobs.
