    "**ECHO (Electronic Companion for Hearing and Orientation)**: A wearable device that utilizes AI-powered audio cues to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating through spaces. ECHO would provide real-time audio feedback on surroundings, such as obstacles, stairs, and doorways, using a combination of sonar sensors and machine learning algorithms. This device would enable users to build a mental map of their environment, enhancing their independence and confidence.",
    "**Tactile Terrain Mapping (TTM)**: A 3D printing technology that creates tactile maps of spaces, allowing visually impaired individuals to explore and understand their surroundings through touch. TTM would utilize a specialized printer that extrudes a raised, textured surface, recreating the layout of a space in a tangible format. This innovative approach would enable users to develop a deeper understanding of their environment, facilitating more efficient navigation and increased accessibility.",
    "**SmartCane**: An intelligent walking stick that integrates various sensors and AI-powered technology to provide real-time feedback to visually impaired individuals. SmartCane would detect obstacles, stairs, and other hazards, alerting the user through a combination of vibrations, audio cues, and haptic feedback. This device would also include a built-in GPS and mapping system, enabling users to navigate complex routes with greater ease and confidence.",
    "**Audio Augmented Reality (AAR)**: A platform that utilizes AR technology to create immersive, audio-based experiences for visually impaired individuals. AAR would use machine learning algorithms to analyze a user's surroundings and generate a rich, 3D audio landscape, complete with spatial audio cues and real-time feedback. This innovative approach would enable users to build a mental map of their environment, facilitating more efficient navigation and increased independence.",
    "**Oculus Orb**: A wearable, spherical device that provides a 360-degree, audio-based representation of a user's surroundings. Oculus Orb would utilize AI-powered audio cues to recreate the layout of a space, allowing visually impaired individuals to build a mental map of their environment through sound. This innovative device would also include a built-in GPS and mapping system, enabling users to navigate complex routes with greater ease and confidence.
