    "Smart Mailbox: Create a mailbox that uses AI technology to sort and prioritize mail. The mailbox could have different compartments for different types of mail, such as bills, letters, and packages. It could also use facial recognition to identify the sender and prioritize mail from important contacts.",
    "Augmented Reality Mailbox: Develop a mailbox that uses augmented reality technology to display information about the mail inside. For example, the mailbox could use AR to display the sender's name, the contents of the package, or the urgency level of the mail. This would make it easier to quickly identify important mail without having to open each envelope.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Mailbox: Design a mailbox that can harness energy from the environment to power its functions. For example, the mailbox could have solar panels on the roof or a wind turbine on the side to generate electricity. This would make the mailbox self-sustaining and reduce its carbon footprint.",
    "Personalized Mailbox: Create a mailbox that can be customized to fit the individual's preferences. For example, the mailbox could have different colors, shapes, or designs to match the owner's style. It could also have personalized features such as a built-in scale to weigh packages, or a built-in alarm to notify the owner when mail is delivered.",
    "Interactive Mailbox: Develop a mailbox that allows users to interact with the mail carrier or other mailbox owners through a touchscreen or voice assistant. For example, the mailbox could have a video chat feature that allows the mail carrier to communicate with the owner, or a social media feed that allows owners to connect with other mailbox owners in the area. This would make the mailbox feel more like a community hub than just a storage container."
