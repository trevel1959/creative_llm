    "**Creating a Shelter**: One of the first priorities would be to create a shelter to protect oneself from the elements. This could be done by using available materials like branches, leaves, and vines to build a simple hut or lean-to. The structure should be elevated off the ground to avoid water accumulation and to deter predators.",
    "**Water Collection**: Access to clean drinking water is crucial for survival. You can collect rainwater in large containers made from natural materials such as coconut shells or hollowed-out logs. Another method is digging a shallow well or pit and using a siphon to extract water. If available, you could also purify seawater by boiling it, as the heat kills bacteria and makes it drinkable.",
    "**Food Sources**: Finding food would be your next priority. You can start by identifying edible plants, fruits, and nuts. Learning to identify which plants are safe to eat is crucial. Additionally, catching fish and other marine life can provide protein. Using a spear made from a long, sturdy stick and sharpened with rocks, or even setting traps, could help catch fish and small animals. ",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: To attract attention and signal for rescue, you could create smoke signals by burning dry leaves or branches. Building a large fire not only provides warmth but also sends out visible smoke that might be noticed by passing planes or ships. Alternatively, you could create a distress signal using mirrors or shiny objects to reflect sunlight and make a flash pattern.",
    "**Improvising Tools**: Improvisation will be key to surviving on a deserted island. For instance, you can use a conch shell as a whistle to send signals. Making tools such as a fishing net from vines, or a digging tool from a sharp stone attached to a handle, can help you gather resources more efficiently. Also, learning basic survival skills like starting a fire without matches (using friction) or purifying water can greatly increase your chances of survival."
