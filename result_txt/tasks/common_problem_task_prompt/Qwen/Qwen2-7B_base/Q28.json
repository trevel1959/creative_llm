    "Limited Resources: Another problem could be a shortage of resources, including recycling bins, signage, and education materials. The city may not have enough resources to distribute these items to all the neighborhoods, making it challenging to encourage participation.",
    "Insufficient Awareness: People may not understand the importance of recycling, or they may not be aware of how to properly sort their waste. Education campaigns and outreach initiatives are essential to raise awareness and encourage participation in the recycling program.",
    "Resistance to Change: Some people may be resistant to change and may not want to participate in the recycling program. They may believe that it is too much effort or not worth it.",
    "Enforcement: Without proper enforcement, people may not comply with the recycling program. This could lead to littering and recycling being mixed with regular waste, which could harm the environment and negate the benefits of the program.",
    "Inadequate Processing Capacity: The city may not have the proper processing capacity to handle the increased amount of recyclable materials generated by the program. This could lead to overflowing landfills and a backlog of unrecycled materials."
