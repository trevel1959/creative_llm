Users can put on a VR headset and be transported to a virtual garage where they can see and interact with the different components of a tire, including the tread, sidewall, and valve stem. They can also practice removing the old tire and installing a new one, all while learning about the proper techniques and safety precautions.",
    "Tire Traveler: Develop an augmented reality app that allows users to see where their tires have been and where they are going.
