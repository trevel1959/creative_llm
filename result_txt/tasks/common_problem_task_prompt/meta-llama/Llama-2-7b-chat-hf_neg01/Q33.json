    "Build a Treehouse Village: Utilize the abundant resources on the island to construct a series of interconnected treehouses, each with its own unique design and purpose. Create a self-sustaining community with gardens, fishing areas, and storage facilities. The treehouses could be connected by rope bridges, vines, or suspension bridges, creating a cozy and secluded environment.",
    "Island-made Crafts: Use the island's natural materials to create a variety of crafts, such as woven baskets, driftwood sculptures, and seashell jewelry. Utilize the island's resources to create a sustainable business, selling the crafts to passing ships or trading with other survivors on the island.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Filtration System: Use the island's abundant sunlight to create a solar-powered water filtration system, capable of purifying seawater into fresh drinking water. This would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, allowing the survivor to stay hydrated and healthy.",
    "Island Wildlife Sanctuary: Utilize the island's diverse wildlife to create a sanctuary for injured or orphaned animals. Care for and rehabilitate the animals, and when possible, release them back into the wild. This would provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as a potential source of food and companionship.",
    "Floating Garden: Create a floating garden using a combination of driftwood, vines, and other natural materials. This would provide a way to grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs, even in the absence of soil. The floating garden could be anchored to the sea floor or suspended from the trees, providing a unique and sustainable source of food."
