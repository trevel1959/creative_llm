    "Anti-Frizz Glider: Another creative idea for improving a hairbrush is to add a smooth gliding edge, which can help reduce the appearance of frizz and split ends. The gliding edge could be made of a smooth, heat-resistant material, such as ceramic or titanium, to ensure the hair is treated gently as it is brushed.",
    "Memory Function: Another potential improvement for a hairbrush could be the addition of a memory function. This feature could be used to store commonly-used settings, such as hair type and brushing intensity. By doing so, users would not have to spend time adjusting the hairbrush each time they use it, making the brushing experience more efficient and convenient.",
    "Sensor-Activated Brush: Another creative idea for improving a hairbrush is to add sensors that can detect when the brush is being used and automatically trigger specific functions, such as turning on LED lights or adjusting brushing intensity. This would make the hairbrush more user-friendly and responsive, and could help reduce the risk of damage to the hair or scalp.",
    "Portable Power Bank: Another way to improve a hairbrush is to incorporate a built-in power bank, which can be used to charge mobile devices on the go. This would be especially useful for users who spend a lot of time traveling or who need to stay connected while they're out and about.",
    "Voice Control: One creative way to improve a hairbrush could be to include voice control capabilities. Users could simply speak their desired settings or functions into the hairbrush, and it would automatically adjust to their needs. This would make the hairbrush even more intuitive and user-friendly, and could help reduce the risk of damage to the hair or scalp."
