    "Design a satellite that is shaped like a human hand. It could be used to measure the temperature and pressure of the Earth's atmosphere and relay the data back to a central location.",
    "Create a satellite that is designed to be launched into space by aorium. This would involve using a giant slingshot to propel the satellite into space.",
    "Build a satellite that is equipped with a large camera that can capture high-resolution images of the Earth's surface. The satellite could be used to monitor natural disasters and track changes in the environment.",
    "Design a satellite that is powered by a nuclear reactor. The satellite could be used to provide energy to remote locations on Earth, such as small villages or isolated research stations.",
    "Create a satellite that is designed to be launched into space by a team of astronauts. The satellite could be used to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and could be used to test new technologies for space exploration."
