    "**Adjustable Size Hanger**:    Create a hanger with adjustable arms that can expand or contract to fit various sizes of clothing, from small tank tops to oversized jackets. This would reduce the need for multiple hangers of different sizes and ensure that clothes are hung properly, preventing stretching or damage.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Air Freshener**:    Develop a hanger that includes a compartment for air fresheners or essential oils. This would help keep clothes smelling fresh while they hang in the closet. Users could refill the compartment with their favorite scents, providing a customizable aromatic experience that also combats musty odors.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hanger**:    Invent a hanger that features additional tools such as a built-in lint roller, a mini fabric shaver, or even a small mirror. This would make it convenient for users to quickly prepare their outfits by removing lint or fuzz before they wear them, making the dressing process more efficient.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Hanger**:    Create a hanger made from biodegradable materials that can decompose over time. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce plastic waste. The design could also include seeds embedded in the material, allowing users to plant the hanger after use, contributing to environmental sustainability.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated LED Lighting**:    Design a hanger that has integrated LED lights that illuminate the clothing when the closet door is opened. This feature would enhance visibility, making it easier to find specific items in dark closets and adding a modern touch to wardrobe organization."
