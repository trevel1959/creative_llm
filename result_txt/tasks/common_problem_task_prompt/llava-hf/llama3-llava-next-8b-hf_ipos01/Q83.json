    "Limited communication: Communication with the surface may be limited due to the depth and pressure, making it difficult to send and receive messages, and potentially delaying the mission's progress.",
    "Water hazards: The ocean is home to a wide variety of marine life, some of which can be dangerous. Encounters with sharks, jellyfish, or other potentially harmful creatures could pose risks to the mission's crew.",
    "Environmental impact: Pioneering a mission to the bottom of the ocean could have a significant impact on the marine ecosystem. The mission could potentially disturb habitats, damage coral reefs, or introduce invasive species.",
    "Equipment failure: The extreme conditions at the bottom of the ocean can put a strain on equipment, increasing the likelihood of failure. This could lead to difficulties in navigating, communication, and even survival.",
    "Time constraints: The depth and distance of the mission could make it difficult to complete within a reasonable timeframe. This could lead to increased risks, limited resources, and a longer duration of exposure to the harsh conditions."
