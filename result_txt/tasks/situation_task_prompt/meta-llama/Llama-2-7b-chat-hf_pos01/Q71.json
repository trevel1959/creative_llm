    "Hydroponics: One creative solution to plant a garden when the ground is too hard to dig into is to use hydroponics. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This system can be set up indoors or outdoors and can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs.",
    "Vertical Gardening: Another creative solution is to use vertical gardening techniques to plant a garden. This involves growing plants up a wall or trellis, using a system of hooks, nets, or pockets to support the plants. This method can be especially useful in small spaces or areas with limited sunlight.",
    "Geodesic Dome Greenhouse: A more ambitious solution is to build a geodesic dome greenhouse. This structure is made up of a series of interconnected triangles and can be covered with a transparent material to allow for sunlight to enter. The dome shape provides optimal growing conditions for plants, as it distributes the sunlight and heat evenly throughout the structure.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a system that combines hydroponics with aquaculture. In this system, fish are raised in a tank and their waste is used as fertilizer for plants grown in a separate tank. This system can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs.",
    "Bamboo Garden: A creative solution for planting a garden in hard ground is to use bamboo as a support system. Bamboo can be used to create a trellis or a series of bamboo stakes that can be used to support plants. This method can be especially useful for plants that have a long vining habit, such as tomatoes or peas."
