    "**Wearable Sensory Feedback Device**: Create a wearable device, like a wristband or belt, that utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects and provide feedback through vibrations or temperature changes. For instance, if an object is detected within a certain range, the device would vibrate to alert the user. Different vibration patterns could indicate the distance and size of the object, helping users understand their environment better and avoid obstacles while walking.",
    "**Interactive Smart Cane**: Innovate a smart cane that integrates GPS, obstacle detection, and voice assistance. This cane could feature a built-in speaker that provides auditory cues and directions, while also using haptic feedback to alert users to nearby obstacles. Additionally, it could connect to a smartphone app to track routes, share locations with family members, and receive updates on nearby services like public transport or rest areas.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation App**: Develop an AR app designed for visually impaired users that can be used with smartphones or AR glasses. The app would use the phone's camera to analyze the environment and overlay information about the surroundings in an audio format. Users could receive details about their environment, such as the layout of a room, location of furniture, or even social cues in public spaces, helping them interact more effectively with their surroundings.",
    "**Smart Home Integration System**: Create an assistive technology system that integrates with smart home devices to help visually impaired individuals manage their home environment. This system would allow users to control lights, appliances, and security systems through voice commands or tactile interfaces. Additionally, it could include a smart assistant that provides audio feedback on the status of various devices, enhancing the user's ability to live independently and safely.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Reading Device**: Design a reading device that allows visually impaired individuals to access books and written content through multiple sensory channels. This device could convert text into braille, audio, or tactile graphics, enabling users to engage with content in a way that suits their preferences. It could also feature a scanning function to read printed text aloud, providing a versatile tool for learning and leisure."
