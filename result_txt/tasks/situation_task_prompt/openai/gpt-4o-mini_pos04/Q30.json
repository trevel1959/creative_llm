    "**Insect Protein Production**:    Shift dietary focus towards insect farming, which is a sustainable source of protein and essential nutrients. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are rich in vitamins B12, D, and various minerals such as iron and zinc. By developing innovative recipes and products, such as insect protein bars or powders, we can incorporate these nutrients into our diets in palatable ways.",
    "**Synthetic Nutrient Capsules**:    Invest in advanced biotechnology to create synthetic nutrient capsules that mimic the nutrient profiles of fruits and vegetables. These capsules could be engineered to release vitamins and minerals at optimal times for absorption. The capsules would be designed to be taken with meals, ensuring that individuals receive a complete array of nutrients without needing to consume actual produce.",
    "**Cultivating Edible Fungi**:    Focus on expanding the cultivation of edible fungi, such as mushrooms, which are not only a great source of B vitamins, selenium, and copper but also have unique compounds like ergothioneine, which has antioxidant properties. By developing mushroom-based products—like mushroom powders, broths, and meat substitutes—we can create a diverse range of flavors and nutrients to replace lost fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Algal Biofortification**:    Explore the potential of biofortifying common food staples with algae extracts. For example, rice or wheat could be enriched with powdered seaweed, which is high in iodine, calcium, and various trace minerals. This could be done through innovative agricultural practices, ensuring that even basic foods can provide a broad spectrum of nutrients that would typically come from fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Lab-Grown Nutrient-Rich Foods**:    Invest in food technology that allows for the lab cultivation of nutrient-rich food products, such as cultured meat or plant-based alternatives. These products can be engineered to include essential vitamins and minerals typically found in fruits and vegetables. For instance, a lab-grown burger could be infused with vitamin C and potassium, making it a complete meal replacement."
