    "**Global Sea-Level Rise**: The most immediate consequence would be a catastrophic sea-level rise of approximately 60-70 meters (200-230 feet) in a matter of hours. This would inundate coastal cities, low-lying areas, and entire nations, displacing hundreds of millions of people and causing unprecedented destruction. The loss of coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangroves, and salt marshes, would have devastating effects on marine biodiversity.",
    "**Disruption of Global Weather Patterns**: The sudden loss of polar ice caps would disrupt global weather patterns, leading to extreme and unpredictable weather events. This could include intense hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, as the polar ice caps play a crucial role in regulating global temperature and precipitation patterns.",
    "**Loss of Freshwater Sources**: The melting of polar ice caps would release massive amounts of freshwater into the oceans, causing a significant increase in sea levels and altering global ocean currents. This could lead to the loss of freshwater sources, including glaciers, ice sheets, and snowpack, which are essential for human consumption, agriculture, and industry.",
    "**Collapse of Global Food Systems**: The implications of a polar ice cap meltdown would be felt across the globe, with severe consequences for food production and distribution. Rising sea levels would contaminate freshwater sources, damage agricultural land, and disrupt global supply chains, leading to widespread food shortages and economic instability.",
    "**Human Migration and Conflict**: The sudden displacement of hundreds of millions of people due to sea-level rise and extreme weather events would lead to unprecedented human migration and conflict. This could result in the breakdown of social structures, economies, and governments, as well as the loss of cultural heritage and identity."
