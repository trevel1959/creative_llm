    "Collaborate with an author: One way to overcome jealousy is to collaborate with another author on a book. This can be a great opportunity to learn from someone who has already published successful books and gain valuable insights into the writing process.",
    "Focus on your own progress: Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress. Keep track of how much you've written each day, week, or month, and celebrate your achievements.",
    "Seek feedback: Seek feedback from other writers, editors, or beta readers to help you improve your writing. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas where you need to improve and make progress.",
    "Take breaks: Taking breaks can help you recharge and come back to your writing with fresh ideas. Use this time to read other books, watch movies, or engage in other activities that inspire you.",
    "Practice self-compassion: Practice self-compassion by acknowledging that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Instead of focusing on how others finished their tasks, focus on your own journey and celebrate your progress along the way."
