    "**Customizable Yoga Mat**: Create a yoga mat that comes with interchangeable top layers. These layers could feature different textures, grips, or even designs for various types of practice. Users could swap out layers based on their preference or the specific type of yoga they're doing, such as a smooth surface for Vinyasa flow or a textured one for restorative practices.",
    "**Heated Yoga Mat**: Introduce a heated yoga mat that can be adjusted to different temperatures. This feature would be particularly beneficial in cooler environments or during colder seasons, ensuring comfort and flexibility for the user. It could also help prevent injuries by keeping muscles warm.",
    "**Sustainable Yoga Mat**: Produce a yoga mat made from eco-friendly materials like natural rubber, recycled plastics, or plant-based compounds. These mats would not only reduce environmental impact but also appeal to consumers who prioritize sustainability. Additionally, ensure the mat is biodegradable at the end of its life cycle.",
    "**Inflatable Yoga Mat**: Design an inflatable yoga mat that can be easily packed and transported. This would be especially useful for travelers or those who need to set up a temporary yoga space. The mat could be deflated for easy storage and re-inflated when needed, making it convenient for on-the-go yoga sessions.",
    "**Odor-Resistant Yoga Mat**: Develop a yoga mat infused with antimicrobial agents that inhibit the growth of odor-causing bacteria and fungi. This feature would help maintain the freshness of the mat over time, eliminating the need for frequent cleaning and reducing the use of harsh chemicals."
