    "**A Cure for Disease**: I would draw a cure for a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. This could be a cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, or any other disease that causes significant suffering. The reason for this is that a cure for a disease would save countless lives and improve the quality of life for those affected.",
    "**A Solution to World Hunger**: I would draw a device that could produce food in areas where food is scarce. This could be a device that uses the sun's energy to convert seawater into fresh drinking water, or a device that can convert inedible plant materials into nutritious food. The reason for this is that world hunger is a significant problem that affects millions of people, and finding a solution to it would help to save lives and improve the quality of life for those affected.",
    "**A Piece of Art**: I would draw a piece of art that has the power to inspire and uplift people. This could be a painting, sculpture, or other form of art that represents hope, love, or peace. The reason for this is that art has the power to inspire and uplift people, and a piece of art that has the power to make people feel good would be a wonderful addition to the world.",
    "**A Device to End Pollution**: I would draw a device that could remove pollutants from the air and water. This could be a device that uses nanotechnology to capture pollutants at the molecular level, or a device that uses the power of nature to clean up pollution. The reason for this is that pollution is a significant problem that affects the environment and human health, and finding a solution to it would help to improve the quality of life for people and the planet.",
    "**A Solution to Climate Change**: I would draw a device that could reverse the effects of climate change. This could be a device that uses the power of the sun to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or a device that uses geoengineering techniques to cool the planet. The reason for this is that climate change is a significant problem that affects the planet and human life, and finding a solution to it would help to save lives and improve the quality of life for people."
