    "Once, in a vibrant sky, a rainbow named Ray felt a strange emptiness. As the sun shone brightly, Ray noticed his colors fading one by one. Red whispered goodbye, followed by orange, yellow, and so on, until only a dull arch remained. Heartbroken, Ray searched for the lost hues, discovering they had traveled to a world where dreams bloomed. To reclaim his colors, Ray learned to share joy and kindness, painting the world around him with laughter. With each act of love, a color returned, until finally, Ray sparkled again, brighter than ever. Now, he shines to remind others of the beauty in sharing.",
