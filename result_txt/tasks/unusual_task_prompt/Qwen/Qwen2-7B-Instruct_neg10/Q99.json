    "Hair Clip as a Personal Organizer: Design the hair clip with compartments for storing small items like keys, coins, or IDs. It can be used as a quick-access organizer for daily essentials when carrying a purse or backpack is not convenient.",
    "Hair Clip as a Security Tool: Create a hair clip that doubles as a concealed weapon by integrating a hidden spring-loaded mechanism with a small blade. It would offer a discreet option for personal protection, particularly for women who might prefer to carry a weapon without drawing attention.",
    "Hair Clip as a Reading Light: Incorporate a small LED light strip into the hair clip, allowing users to read in dimly lit environments hands-free. This could be especially useful for bedtime reading or for individuals with low vision.",
    "Hair Clip as a Magnifying Glass: Attach a magnifying lens to the hair clip, enabling it to function as a portable magnifier for tasks like threading or examining small objects up close. This could be particularly helpful for individuals with poor eyesight or for activities requiring fine detail.",
    "Hair Clip as a Microphone Stand: Design a hair clip that can be easily attached to a person's head or hair, serving as a makeshift microphone stand for video calls or online presentations. This could be especially useful for those without a dedicated microphone setup or for outdoor events where a traditional stand is not practical."
