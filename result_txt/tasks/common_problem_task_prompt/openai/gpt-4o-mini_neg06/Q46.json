    "**Community Resistance**: Residents may resist changes to the transportation system due to fears of increased costs, disruptions during construction, or concerns that the new system will not meet their needs. Effective communication and community engagement are crucial to address these concerns and ensure public buy-in.",
    "**Displacement of Existing Services**: Revamping the transportation system could inadvertently displace existing services that are vital to certain communities, such as local bus routes or informal transport options. This could create accessibility issues for low-income or marginalized populations who rely on these services for their daily commutes.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While the goal of overhauling the transportation system is often to reduce emissions and promote sustainability, the construction phase can have negative environmental impacts. This includes increased pollution, disruption to local wildlife, and potential damage to green spaces. Careful planning and environmental assessments are needed to mitigate these effects.",
    "**Technological Integration Challenges**: Implementing new technologies, such as smart ticketing systems or real-time tracking, can present numerous challenges. These include ensuring compatibility with existing systems, training staff, and managing the transition for users who may not be tech-savvy. Technical failures during implementation can lead to public frustration and decreased usage.",
    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: Overhauling a public transportation system often involves navigating a complex web of regulations at local, state, and federal levels. Delays in obtaining necessary permits or approvals can stall progress, and non-compliance with regulations can lead to legal challenges or additional costs."
