    "**Augmented Reality Display**: Develop a wristwatch with a small projection system that can display augmented reality (AR) information on any surface. For example, when the user points their wrist at a wall, it could project the time, weather updates, or even notifications from their phone. This feature could enhance multitasking by allowing users to access information without looking at their watch directly.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Redesign the wristwatch to include a solar panel embedded in the watch face or band. This feature would allow the watch to charge itself through exposure to sunlight, significantly extending battery life and reducing the need for regular charging. The solar cells could be made to blend seamlessly with the design, maintaining the watch's aesthetic appeal.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Color Change**: Incorporate a color-changing feature based on the wearer’s mood or stress levels. Using sensors that detect physiological changes (like heart rate variability), the watch could shift colors to indicate the wearer’s emotional state. This could serve as a conversation starter or even a subtle way to communicate feelings without words.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Equip the wristwatch with a built-in AI assistant that learns the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could provide reminders, schedule appointments, and even suggest personalized wellness activities based on the user’s lifestyle. It could use voice recognition to allow for hands-free operation, making it a truly personal companion.",
    "**Interchangeable Modular Design**: Create a wristwatch with interchangeable modules that allow users to customize their watch according to their needs or fashion preferences. Users could swap out different bands, watch faces, or even functional modules (like fitness tracking or GPS) depending on the occasion, making the watch adaptable for various situations—from formal events to workouts."
