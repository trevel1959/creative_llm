    "**Eco-Friendly Carpet Tiles for Indoor Gardens**: Create a series of carpet tiles that are not only stylish but also biodegradable and made from natural materials such as recycled cotton or bamboo fibers. These tiles can be used to create an indoor garden setting in commercial spaces like cafes or offices. They could be designed with patterns that mimic nature, such as leaf prints or forest scenes, adding a touch of greenery and freshness indoors.",
    "**Therapeutic Sound Carpet**: Develop a carpet that incorporates technology to produce soothing sounds when stepped on or walked over. The carpet could be embedded with microphones that pick up sound waves and convert them into vibrations through the floor. This could be particularly useful in hospitals, clinics, or even in residential settings for individuals who need calming environments to help with anxiety or stress relief.",
    "**Interactive Learning Carpet for Children**: Design a carpet that doubles as an interactive learning tool for children. The carpet could be divided into sections, each representing different subjects like science, history, or languages. When a child touches a specific section with a special device (like a stylus), it triggers animations, sounds, and interactive stories related to that subject. This would be a fun and engaging way for kids to learn while playing.",
    "**Heated Floor Carpet for Winter Comfort**: In areas where winters are harsh, develop a carpet that can be heated from underneath. This carpet could have a thin layer of electric wires woven into its base, which can be controlled by a thermostat. It would provide warmth directly to the feet, making it a cozy addition to bedrooms, living rooms, or home offices during cold seasons.",
    "**Scented Carpet for Aromatherapy**: Create a carpet that releases a subtle fragrance when stepped on. The carpet could have a layer of fabric infused with essential oils or other fragrances. The pressure of walking or standing on the carpet would release these scents into the air, creating a pleasant aroma that can enhance mood and concentration in places like yoga studios, meditation rooms, or personal workspaces."
