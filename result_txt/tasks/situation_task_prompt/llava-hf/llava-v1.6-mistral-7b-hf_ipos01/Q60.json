    "**Time Banking**: Time banking is a system where individuals exchange time and skills instead of money. This could be a practical solution for trading goods and services in a currency-less world. For example, a plumber could offer to fix a leak in exchange for an hour of teaching or mentoring from a local business owner.",
    "**Resource Sharing**: In a world without currency, people could trade resources directly. For example, a farmer could trade fresh produce for tools or equipment from a carpenter. This would require a strong sense of community and trust among the people involved.",
    "**Skill Exchange**: Another option would be to trade skills directly. A chef could offer cooking lessons in exchange for a dentist's dental services. This would require a database or platform to facilitate the exchange of skills and ensure that both parties are satisfied with the trade.",
    "**Mutual Credit Systems**: A mutual credit system is a form of alternative currency where transactions are recorded on a ledger and settled on a periodic basis. This would require a robust digital infrastructure and a trusted third party to manage the ledger and ensure that credits are fairly distributed.",
    "**Gift Economy**: In a gift economy, people give and receive goods and services without the expectation of reciprocation. This would require a strong sense of community and a shared understanding of what is considered fair and reasonable."
