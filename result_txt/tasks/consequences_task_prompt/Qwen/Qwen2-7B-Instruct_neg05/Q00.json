    "**Economic Shifts:** The immediate consequence of losing the ability to sleep would likely be a massive economic disruption. Industries that depend on human labor during night hours, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, would be severely impacted. Businesses would need to adapt by implementing new work schedules or increasing automation, which could lead to significant job losses in sectors that can't operate around the clock.",
    "**Healthcare Revolution:** Without sleep, maintaining overall health becomes a critical challenge. Medical research and practices would have to evolve dramatically to address the new realities of life without sleep. This could include developing new technologies for monitoring and managing sleep deprivation, creating sleep supplements, and potentially even exploring genetic modifications to help individuals function without sleep. This shift could lead to a boom in healthcare-related industries and innovations.",
    "**Social and Mental Health Impacts:** Sleep loss has profound impacts on mental health and interpersonal relationships. Families and communities would face challenges in maintaining social bonds due to the lack of shared rest periods. Schools and workplaces might see increased absenteeism and decreased productivity as people struggle to cope with the lack of sleep. Mental health services would need to expand to deal with the expected rise in stress-related disorders.",
    "**Cultural and Religious Revisions:** Cultures and religions heavily rely on the concept of sleep and its importance in daily life and spiritual practices. Losing this ability could lead to a reevaluation of these beliefs and practices. For instance, religious rituals that involve periods of fasting or meditation during sleepless times might become central, leading to new forms of worship and community gatherings centered around these activities.",
    "**Technological Breakthroughs:** In an attempt to compensate for the lack of sleep, humans might turn to advanced technology for survival. This could lead to the development of sophisticated brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence that mimics human sleep patterns, and personalized sleep enhancement devices. These innovations could transform our relationship with technology and lead to a future where sleep is no longer a biological necessity but rather a luxury. However, this could also raise ethical concerns about the potential misuse of such technology and its long-term effects on human autonomy and privacy."
