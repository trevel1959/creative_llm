    "Develop a system of using solar panels to power vehicles: This idea involves using solar panels to generate electricity that can be used to power electric vehicles. This can be done by installing solar panels on the roofs of buildings or on the sides of highways. The electricity generated can be used to charge electric vehicles, which can then be used to power cars and trucks.",
    "Use hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles: Hydrogen fuel cells are a clean and efficient way to generate electricity. This idea involves using hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles. The fuel cells would be installed in the vehicle and would generate electricity that could be used to power the wheels.",
    "Develop a system of using wind turbines to power vehicles: This idea involves using wind turbines to generate electricity that can be used to power electric vehicles. The wind turbines would be installed on the sides of highways or in other locations where the wind is strong enough to generate electricity.",
    "Use electric bicycles to power vehicles: This idea involves using electric bicycles to power vehicles. The bicycles would be equipped with batteries that could be charged using electricity generated by the bicycles. The bicycles could then be used to power cars and trucks.",
    "Develop a system of using geothermal energy to power vehicles: Geothermal energy is a clean and efficient way to generate electricity. This idea involves using geothermal energy to power electric vehicles. The electricity would be generated using geothermal power plants and could be used to charge electric vehicles."
