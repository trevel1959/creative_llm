    "Multi-Functionality: Adding additional features to the spatula, such as a built-in whisk or a serrated edge for more precise cutting, could make it a more versatile tool. This would allow users to complete multiple tasks with a single utensil, saving time and effort in the kitchen.",
    "Non-Stick Surface: Incorporating a non-stick coating on the spatula could prevent food from sticking to its surface, making it easier to flip and serve food. This would be particularly useful for delicate items that might otherwise fall apart when handled with a spatula.",
    "Heat-Resistant Material: To enhance durability and safety, the spatula could be made from heat-resistant materials that can withstand high temperatures without warping or melting. This would be particularly useful for tasks involving hot cookware or ovens.",
    "Collapsible Design: A spatula with a collapsible design would be convenient for storage and transportation, as it would take up less space when not in use. This could be especially helpful for people with limited kitchen storage.",
    "Eco-Friendly Material: To make the spatula more environmentally friendly, consider using sustainable materials in its construction, such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This would reduce the environmental impact of the product and make it more appealing to consumers who are conscious of their carbon footprint."
