    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Incorporate an AR display into the camera viewfinder or screen, allowing photographers to see overlays of useful information while composing their shots. This could include grid lines, rule of thirds, exposure adjustments, and even real-time feedback on how to improve composition. The AR could also simulate various filters and effects before taking the shot, providing a more interactive experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Source**: Design a camera that uses a combination of solar panels and kinetic energy harvesting to charge its battery. This could involve solar cells integrated into the camera body and a mechanism that generates power through movement, such as a small generator activated by the userâ€™s hand movements while shooting. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional batteries but also appeal to environmentally conscious photographers.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular camera system that allows users to customize their cameras based on their specific needs. Different modules could include varying sensor sizes, additional storage, enhanced audio recording capabilities, or even special effects modules for artistic photography. This would allow both amateur and professional photographers to tailor their gear to suit different shooting conditions and styles.",
    "**AI-Powered Photo Assistant**: Integrate an AI assistant within the camera that helps users with real-time advice on photography techniques. This assistant could provide tips on framing, suggest optimal settings for specific conditions, and even analyze the scene to recommend the best time of day for shooting. It could also learn from the user's shooting habits over time to provide personalized feedback and suggestions.",
    "**Gesture Control and Voice Commands**: Enhance the user interface of the camera by incorporating gesture control and voice command capabilities. Users could change settings, zoom in or out, and take photos simply by waving their hands or using voice commands. This feature would be particularly useful for photographers in challenging situations where they cannot easily reach the camera buttons, such as when shooting in tight spaces or when wearing gloves."
