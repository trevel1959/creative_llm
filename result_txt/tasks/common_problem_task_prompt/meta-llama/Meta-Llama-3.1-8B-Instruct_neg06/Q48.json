    "**Aerius**: A high-flying sport that combines elements of trampolining, parkour, and freestyle basketball. Players would jump on trampolines to propel themselves into the air, using parkour moves to navigate the court, and perform acrobatic stunts to score points. The twist: each player would have a unique \"aerial signature\" â€“ a specific move that would grant them a temporary advantage or penalty.",
    "**Submerge**: An underwater sport that requires players to hold their breath and navigate an underwater obstacle course while carrying a weighted ball. The objective: score points by tossing the ball into goals placed throughout the course. To add an element of strategy, players could use special abilities like \"dive bombs\" or \"current boosts\" to gain an advantage.",
    "**EchoPulse**: A team-based sport that involves players wearing special vests with embedded sensors. The objective: create a chain reaction of sound waves by running, jumping, or performing specific actions, causing the sensors to resonate and create a \"pulse\" that would attract or repel opponents. The team with the most \"pulses\" in their favor at the end of the game would win.",
    "**Fracture**: A high-intensity sport that takes place on a court with a unique, fractal-patterned surface. Players would wear specialized shoes with adjustable grip settings, allowing them to manipulate their movement speed and agility. The twist: the court's fractal design would create localized \"gravity pockets\" that would affect player movement, requiring them to adapt and strategize on the fly.",
    "**Spectra**: A futuristic sport that involves players wearing special suits with embedded LED lights and sensors. The objective: create a mesmerizing light show by performing specific movements and actions, which would be reflected in the player's suit. The team with the most cohesive and impressive light display at the end of the game would win, with bonus points awarded for creativity and originality.
