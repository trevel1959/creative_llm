    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Developing solar-powered batteries that can absorb and store energy from the sun, allowing devices to run without traditional batteries. These batteries could be designed with special solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy, providing a sustainable and renewable source of power.",
    "Electromagnetic Induction Charging: Creating a charging system that utilizes electromagnetic induction to transfer energy wirelessly between devices. This technology would involve creating a charging coil in each device and a transmitter coil in the charging station, allowing for efficient and contactless charging.",
    "Thermal Energy Harvesting: Developing devices that can harness thermal energy from the environment to power their functions. This could involve using thermoelectric materials to convert heat into electrical energy, or using phase-change materials to store thermal energy and release it as needed.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Designing devices that use hydrogen fuel cells to generate power. Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This technology could provide a clean and efficient source of power for devices, with the potential to replace traditional batteries entirely.",
    "Biometric Energy Harvesting: Creating devices that can harness the energy of the human body to power their functions. This could involve using piezoelectric materials that generate electricity from body movement, or using thermoelectric materials that convert body heat into electrical energy. This technology could provide a sustainable and unobtrusive source of power for wearable devices and other applications."
