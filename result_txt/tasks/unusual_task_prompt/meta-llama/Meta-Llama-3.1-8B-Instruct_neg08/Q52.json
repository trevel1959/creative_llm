    "**Task-Triggered Envy**: A social experiment where individuals are given a series of tasks to complete in a public setting. Unbeknownst to them, their progress is being monitored and tracked by observers. As they near completion, their reactions to seeing others finish their tasks are recorded and analyzed.
