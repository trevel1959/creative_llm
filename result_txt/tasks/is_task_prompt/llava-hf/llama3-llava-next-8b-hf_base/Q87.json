The owl listened to Charlie's story and told him that the secret to running was not in his legs, but in his heart. Charlie realized that he had been so focused on his physical limitations that he had forgotten the joy of running for its own sake. He decided to embrace his unique abilities and started to run with all his heart, and to his surprise, he found that he could run faster than ever before.",
