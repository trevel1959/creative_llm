    "**Day and Night Cycle Alteration**: The concept of day and night would be completely transformed. Instead of a 24-hour cycle, one side of the Earth would experience constant daylight for six months, followed by six months of darkness. This would disrupt ecosystems, as plants and animals are adapted to a regular cycle of light and dark. Photosynthesis would be affected, leading to a collapse of food chains and biodiversity.",
    "**Geographical Changes**: The Earth’s shape is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation. If the Earth stopped rotating, this bulge would gradually flatten out, leading to significant geological shifts. The redistribution of water would create new ocean basins and potentially submerge land areas, leading to drastic changes in geography and habitat.",
    "**Loss of the Coriolis Effect**: The Coriolis effect, which causes moving air and water to turn and twist in predictable patterns, would cease. This would disrupt ocean currents and wind patterns, leading to unpredictable weather and climate shifts. The oceans would become stagnant, affecting marine life and disrupting the global climate system.",
    "**Impact on Human Life**: Human life would be dramatically affected as well. Agriculture would face challenges due to the extreme temperature fluctuations and altered daylight hours. Urban planning would need to adapt to the new climate realities, with some regions becoming uninhabitable. Additionally, the psychological effects of living in perpetual light or darkness could lead to increased mental health issues.",
    "**Gravity Redistribution**: The centrifugal force generated by the Earth’s rotation counteracts gravity slightly at the equator. If the Earth stopped rotating, this force would disappear, causing a slight increase in effective gravity. This could lead to structural failures in buildings and infrastructure, as they would not be designed to handle the increased gravitational forces."
