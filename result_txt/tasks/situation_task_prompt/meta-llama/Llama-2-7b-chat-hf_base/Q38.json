    "evolve natural cleaning methods: One approach to maintaining hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to revert to traditional, natural methods. For instance, using ash and water to create a homemade cleanser, or using plant-based ingredients like baking soda, clay, or essential oils to create a natural cleaning solution. These methods would require some experimentation and trial-and-error, but they could be effective and environmentally friendly.",
    "Use microbial agents: Another option for maintaining hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to use microbial agents like bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target and kill harmful bacteria. These agents could be used to clean surfaces and disinfect environments without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "Invest in UV light technology: Ultraviolet (UV) light has been shown to have disinfecting properties, and could be used to clean surfaces and eliminate bacteria without the need for soap or other cleaning products. UV light technology is already used in some hospitals and healthcare settings to disinfect surfaces and equipment, and could be adapted for use in homes and other environments.",
    "Develop new materials for cleaning: Another approach to maintaining hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to develop new materials that are specifically designed for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. For example, researchers could develop materials that are impregnated with antimicrobial agents, or that use nanotechnology to effectively clean and disinfect surfaces.",
    "Use robotic cleaning devices: Finally, one way to maintain hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to use robotic cleaning devices that can autonomously clean and disinfect surfaces. These devices could be programmed to navigate and clean specific areas, and could be equipped with sensors and other technology to detect and eliminate bacteria and other microorganisms."
