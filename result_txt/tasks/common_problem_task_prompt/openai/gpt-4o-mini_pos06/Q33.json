    "**Exposure to Elements**: Surviving on a deserted island means facing the elementsâ€”sun, rain, wind, and temperature fluctuations. Prolonged exposure can lead to sunburn, hypothermia, or heat exhaustion. Building a shelter using natural materials such as palm fronds or driftwood can provide protection from rain and wind while also offering shade from the sun.",
    "**Wildlife Encounters**: Depending on the island's ecosystem, there may be dangerous wildlife, such as snakes, insects, or even larger predators. Understanding which animals are harmful and taking precautions, such as avoiding certain areas during dusk or dawn when animals are more active, can help minimize risks. Additionally, creating noise or using fire can deter unwanted wildlife.",
    "**Mental Health Struggles**: Isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and despair. Maintaining a positive mindset is crucial for survival. Creating a daily routine, practicing mindfulness, or even talking to oneself can help manage mental health. Finding ways to keep the mind engaged, such as building structures or creating art from natural materials, can also provide a sense of purpose.",
    "**Injury or Illness**: Injuries from falls, cuts, or insect bites can become serious if not treated properly, especially in a remote location. The absence of medical supplies increases the risk of infection. It's essential to learn basic first aid skills and utilize natural remedies from the island, such as using certain plants for antiseptic properties. Keeping the environment clean and avoiding risky behaviors can also help prevent injuries.",
    "**Navigation and Rescue Challenges**: If the goal is to be rescued, the lack of navigational tools and knowledge can be problematic. Without a clear understanding of the island's geography, it can be easy to become lost or miss potential rescue opportunities. Creating large signals, such as SOS signs made from rocks or logs on the beach, can attract attention from passing ships or aircraft."
