    "**Solar-Powered Light Domes**: Communities could install transparent domes made of solar-collecting materials that harness sunlight even through cloudy skies. These domes would have photovoltaic cells integrated into their structure, capturing diffuse sunlight and converting it into energy. Inside the domes, a carefully designed ecosystem could thrive, allowing people to experience a miniaturized version of the outdoors. The light collected could be used to power LED lights that simulate the sun’s rays, providing warmth and light to the surrounding area.",
    "**Cloud-Reflecting Mirrors**: To maximize the little sunlight that breaks through the clouds, cities could employ large, movable mirrors that track the sun’s position and reflect sunlight into public spaces and homes. These mirrors would be designed to adjust their angle based on the cloud cover and sun position, redirecting light to create bright, inviting environments. The mirrors could also have a dual purpose, collecting solar energy to power nearby facilities or streetlights.",
    "**Sunlight Simulating Wearables**: Develop wearable technology that mimics the effects of sunlight on the human body. These devices could be equipped with LEDs that replicate the spectrum of natural sunlight and are worn like a bracelet or a necklace. They would provide a personal light source that can be adjusted for intensity and duration, helping individuals maintain their circadian rhythms and mood stability even in perpetual cloudiness.",
    "**Indoor Sunlight Gardens**: Create innovative indoor gardens that use advanced hydroponics and grow lights to simulate sunlight. These gardens could be integrated into homes and offices, providing not only fresh produce but also a vibrant, sunlit atmosphere. The lights would be programmed to adjust throughout the day, mimicking the natural progression of sunlight, thus helping people feel more connected to nature despite the cloudy weather outside.",
    "**Cloud-Color Changing Paint**: Imagine a paint that can be applied to buildings and public spaces that changes color based on the amount of sunlight available. During overcast days, the paint could shift to warmer, brighter colors, creating an illusion of sunlight and improving the mood of those who see it. This could be paired with ambient lighting systems that provide a warm glow during the darker hours, enhancing the feeling of light and brightness in urban environments."
