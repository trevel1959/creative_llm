    "Odor Neutralizer: Incorporate an odor neutralizing feature, such as activated carbon filters or essential oil-infused compartments, to eliminate the smell of dirty laundry. This would be especially useful in shared living spaces or for people who want to avoid strong laundry odors.",
    "Eco-Friendly Liner: Replace the traditional plastic laundry basket liner with a reusable, washable, and biodegradable material made from natural fibers like bamboo or jute. This would be an environmentally friendly alternative to disposable plastic liners.",
    "Aroma Diffuser: Integrate an aroma diffuser into the laundry basket that releases a pleasant scent, such as fresh laundry or lavender, when the basket is full. This would create a more enjoyable laundry experience.",
    "Mobile Laundry Station: Create a portable laundry basket that can be easily moved and stored away when not in use. This would be particularly useful for people who live in small spaces or frequently travel.",
    "Multi-Functional Design: Design the laundry basket with multiple compartments, allowing users to separate and organize their laundry by type, color, or size. This would improve efficiency and organization during the laundry process."
