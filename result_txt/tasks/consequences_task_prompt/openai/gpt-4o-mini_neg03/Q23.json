    "**Enhanced Wildlife Observation**: With the ability to see in the dark, humans would develop a deeper connection with nocturnal wildlife. Researchers and enthusiasts could explore natural habitats at night without disturbing the animals, leading to new discoveries in animal behavior and ecology. This heightened awareness could foster conservation efforts, as people would be more inclined to appreciate and protect the diverse ecosystems that thrive after sunset.",
    "**Shift in Sleep Patterns**: The ability to see in the dark might alter human circadian rhythms. People could become more nocturnal, leading to a cultural shift in work and leisure activities.
