However, this option may not be feasible for everyone, as it may require significant financial resources and technical expertise.",
    "Move to a different continent: Another option is to move to a different continent that is not affected by rising ocean levels. This would allow people to escape the rising ocean levels and continue to live in their current location. However, this option may not be feasible for everyone, as it may require significant relocation and disruption to their lives.",
    "Use drones to monitor the ocean: People could also use drones to monitor the ocean and predict the rising levels. This would allow them to plan their relocation accordingly and avoid being caught off guard by the rising waters."
