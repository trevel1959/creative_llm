    "**Immersive Storytelling with Augmented Reality**: Develop an AR app that allows users to interact with a virtual rubber duck in a 3D environment. The app could be designed to tell a story, where the user's actions influence the narrative. For example, if the user taps on the duck, it might quack and start swimming in a virtual pool. The story could be a playful, whimsical tale that explores themes of friendship, adventure, or growth. The app could also include interactive elements, such as puzzles or mini-games, to keep users engaged.",
