    "**Smart Ergonomic Chair**: Integrate smart technology into the chair that monitors posture and provides real-time feedback. Using sensors, the chair could detect when a user is slouching or sitting incorrectly and vibrate gently or send a notification to a connected app to remind them to adjust their position. Additionally, it could track sitting time and suggest breaks to promote healthier habits.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Chair**: Create a chair made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites. This chair could also incorporate a modular design, allowing for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of its life. To further enhance its eco-friendliness, the chair could feature a built-in plant holder or a small garden space, promoting indoor greenery and improving air quality.",
    "**Multi-Functional Chair**: Design a chair that serves multiple purposes, such as a chair that transforms into a small table or storage unit. For instance, the seat could lift to reveal storage space for books or games, while the backrest could fold down to create a flat surface for working or dining. This would be especially useful in small living spaces where maximizing functionality is essential.",
    "**Interactive Learning Chair**: Develop a chair specifically for children that incorporates interactive technology to promote learning and creativity. The chair could have built-in touch screens or projection capabilities that allow kids to engage with educational games or activities. It could also feature a sound system that plays music or storytelling, making learning more fun and engaging.",
    "**Adaptive Reclining Chair**: Create a chair that automatically adjusts its recline angle based on the user's position and comfort level. Using a combination of pressure sensors and motors, the chair could sense when someone is leaning back or shifting forward and adjust accordingly. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility issues or those who spend long hours sitting."
