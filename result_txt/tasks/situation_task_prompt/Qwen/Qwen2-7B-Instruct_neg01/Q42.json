    "**Building a Sustainable Food Source**:    You'd start by building a shelter for protection from the elements. After that, focus on creating a sustainable food source. You could build a fish trap using local materials to catch fish. For plants, you might construct a simple irrigation system using rainwater to cultivate fruits or vegetables like coconuts, yams, or taro. This system ensures a reliable food supply, which is crucial for survival.",
    "**Creating Tools for Self-Protection**:    With your basic tools, you can create a spear or a bow and arrows for hunting larger animals that may be necessary for protein in your diet. Additionally, crafting a makeshift fishing net or harpoon can increase your chances of catching fish. These tools not only help with food but also provide self-protection against potential threats such as wild animals.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification**:    Water is essential for survival. To collect water, you could build a large funnel-like structure that collects rainwater into a reservoir. For purification, you could boil the water or use natural methods like sand filtration if you find a nearby stream or river. Knowing how to purify water effectively will prevent dehydration and potential waterborne diseases.",
    "**Signal Fire and Distress Signals**:    Building a fire for warmth, cooking, and signaling rescue planes or ships is critical. Construct a large fire pit, gather plenty of dry wood, and use natural materials like branches and leaves to keep it burning. You can also make distress signals during the day using smoke (if there's enough fuel) or by creating a large SOS message with rocks or other visible items on the beach.",
    "**Crafting a Communication Device**:    Given the limited resources, you could try to create a simple communication device using materials found on the island. For example, you could build a large kite to attract attention from passing aircraft or boats. Alternatively, if you have metal or reflective surfaces, create a mirror to reflect sunlight or light signals for long-distance communication. "
