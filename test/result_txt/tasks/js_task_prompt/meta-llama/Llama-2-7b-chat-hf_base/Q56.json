    "A World Without Wars: I would want to see a future where wars have become a thing of the past.

    "A World of Endless Imagination: If I could see the future, I would want to see a world where imagination knows no bounds. I would want to see a world where people are free to explore their creativity and imagination, without the constraints of reality holding them back. I would want to see a world where technology and innovation have enabled people to create and invent new and amazing things, beyond anything we can currently imagine. I would want to see a world where imagination is the only limit to what is possible."
