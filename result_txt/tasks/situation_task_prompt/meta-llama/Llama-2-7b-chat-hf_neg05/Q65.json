    "Glowing Plants: In a world without lamps or lighting fixtures, glowing plants could be used to light up a room at night. These plants could be genetically engineered or naturally occurring, with the ability to produce a soft, ambient light. This would provide a soft, natural light source that would illuminate the room without the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Solar-Powered Windows: Solar-powered windows could be developed to harness the energy of the sun during the day and convert it into light at night. These windows would be equipped with photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity, which would power a lighting system within the window. This would provide a sustainable and renewable light source that would not require any external power sources.",
    "Bioluminescent Paint: Bioluminescent paint could be used to light up a room without the need for any additional light sources. This paint would emit a soft, glowing light when exposed to oxygen, providing a gentle and subtle light source. This would be a convenient and low-maintenance solution for lighting a room, as it would not require any batteries or electricity.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Mirrors could be used to reflect light from one area of a room to another, creating a natural and efficient lighting system. By placing mirrors strategically around the room, light from one area could be reflected and amplified, illuminating the entire space without the need for additional light sources.",
    "Smart Light Bulbs: Smart light bulbs could be developed that are powered by artificial intelligence. These bulbs would be able to sense the ambient light levels in the room and adjust their brightness accordingly. This would ensure that the lighting in the room is always optimal, providing the right amount of light for the task at hand without wasting energy. Additionally, these bulbs could be programmed to adjust their color temperature based on the time of day, providing a more natural and comfortable lighting environment."
