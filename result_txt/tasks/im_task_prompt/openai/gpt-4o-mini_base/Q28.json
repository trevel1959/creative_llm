    "**Adaptive Ventilation System**: Develop a helmet with adjustable ventilation that can respond to temperature changes. Using smart materials or sensors, the helmet could automatically open or close vents based on the rider's body temperature and environmental conditions. This would help maintain comfort during long rides, especially in varying climates.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**: Create a helmet with built-in LED lights that can change color or blink based on the rider's movements. For instance, the lights could signal turns or stops, enhancing visibility to other road users. Additionally, the helmet could feature a rear light that activates when the cyclist brakes, further improving safety during night rides.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Innovate the helmet's interior padding using advanced materials like graphene or memory foam that not only provide better shock absorption but also adapt to the shape of the rider's head over time for a custom fit. This could reduce the risk of injury during accidents and improve overall comfort.",
    "**Personalized Fit System**: Design a helmet that incorporates a customizable fit system using a series of inflatable bladders that can be adjusted via a smartphone app. This would allow riders to easily fine-tune the helmetâ€™s fit for maximum comfort and safety. The app could also track the helmet's fit over time and suggest adjustments as needed.",
    "**Environmental Sensors**: Equip the helmet with environmental sensors that can detect air quality, UV levels, and temperature. The helmet could alert the rider when conditions are unsafe, such as high pollution levels or excessive UV exposure, prompting them to take precautions or choose alternative routes."
