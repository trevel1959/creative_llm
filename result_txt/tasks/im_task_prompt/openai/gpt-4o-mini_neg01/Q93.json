    "**Bowling Ball Tracker**: Develop a small, lightweight tracking device that can be embedded within the bowling ball. This device would collect data on the ball's speed, spin, and trajectory, and then sync with an app to analyze performance. Bowlers could receive insights on how to adjust their throws for better accuracy and scoring.",
    "**Customizable Weight Distribution**: Create a bowling ball with adjustable weight distribution. Using a simple mechanism, bowlers could change the internal weight placement to alter the ball's balance and performance characteristics. This feature would allow bowlers to tailor their ball for different lane conditions or personal preferences.",
    "**Integrated LED Light System**: Design a bowling ball with an embedded LED light system that activates when the ball is rolled. The lights could change colors based on speed or spin, providing visual feedback for the bowler and enhancing the entertainment aspect of bowling, especially during night games or special events.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Coaching**: Pair the bowling ball with AR glasses that display real-time data and coaching tips while the bowler is on the lane. The glasses could show the optimal release point, ideal stance, and even a virtual guide for targeting the pins, creating an immersive training experience.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Enhancements**: Rethink the traditional shape and material of the bowling ball to create a more ergonomic design. This could include a softer outer layer for better grip and comfort, as well as an asymmetrical shape that aids in achieving different spin techniques without straining the wrist."
