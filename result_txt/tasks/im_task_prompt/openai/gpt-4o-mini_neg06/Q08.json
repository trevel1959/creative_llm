    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light to sanitize the interior surfaces of the refrigerator. This technology could activate periodically or when the door is closed for a certain period. The UV-C light can eliminate bacteria and mold, keeping the fridge hygienic without the need for harsh chemicals, thus promoting a healthier food storage environment.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Cooling Zones**: Design the refrigerator with customizable cooling zones that allow users to adjust the temperature of different sections based on the type of food stored. For example, a dedicated zone for fruits and vegetables could maintain higher humidity levels, while another zone for meats could be kept at a lower temperature. This would enhance food preservation and minimize spoilage.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Incorporate an AR interface that allows users to visualize their food inventory using their smartphones or smart glasses. By simply pointing their device at the fridge, users could see information about whatâ€™s inside, including expiration dates, nutritional information, and recipe suggestions. This interactive feature would make it easier to manage food supplies and encourage healthier eating habits.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration and Dispensing System**: Enhance the refrigerator with an advanced water filtration system that provides clean, filtered water and ice. This system could be connected to a water source and allow users to customize the temperature and flavor of their water, with options like sparkling water or infused flavors. This would encourage hydration and reduce the need for bottled water.",
    "**Flexible Shelf Design**: Create adjustable and flexible shelving that can be rearranged or collapsed to accommodate larger items like party platters or bulky containers. This design could include sliding or foldable shelves that allow users to maximize space and organize their fridge according to their needs. Additionally, transparent materials could be used for the shelves to enhance visibility and accessibility."
