    "**Rainwater Collection System:** Design a sustainable rainwater collection system for your home or community. This involves setting up large containers to collect rainwater from rooftops, which can then be filtered through sand or gravel to remove impurities before storing in a clean reservoir. This method ensures that you always have access to clean drinking water even when other sources are contaminated.",
    "**Portable Water Filtration Device:** Invent a portable water filtration device that utilizes a combination of advanced technologies such as reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and UV light to purify water on the go. This device could be lightweight and compact enough to carry with you during outdoor activities, ensuring access to clean water when traditional sources are unavailable or unsafe.",
    "**Aquaponics and Rainwater Harvesting:** Create an integrated aquaponics system where fish farming and vegetable cultivation work together to provide clean water and nutrients for both plants and fish. The fish waste is used as a natural fertilizer for the plants, while the plants filter the water for the fish. Rainwater can be collected and used to irrigate the plants, providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Biological Filtration Ponds:** Build a series of interconnected biological filtration ponds to treat contaminated water. These ponds use natural bacteria and plants to break down pollutants and remove contaminants from the water. The treated water can then be used for various purposes, including irrigation and household consumption. This approach mimics natural ecosystems and promotes self-sustainability.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Distillation System:** Develop a solar-powered water distillation system that harnesses the sun's energy to boil contaminated water and condense the steam back into pure water. This system would be especially useful in remote areas without access to electricity or conventional water treatment facilities. It would require minimal maintenance and could provide a reliable source of clean drinking water for communities in need."
