    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Incorporate AR technology that allows viewers to interact with content in real-time. For instance, during a cooking show, viewers could see a 3D overlay of the recipe ingredients on their kitchen counter, or while watching a nature documentary, they could visualize the animal habitats in their living room. This immersive experience would revolutionize how we consume content and make it more engaging.",
    "**Mood Lighting Synchronization**: Design a television that integrates with smart home lighting systems to adjust the ambient lighting based on the content being viewed. For example, during a horror movie, the lights could dim to create a spooky atmosphere, while during a nature documentary, they could brighten to mimic daylight. This feature would enhance the viewing experience by creating a more immersive environment.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Experience**: Create a television that can emit scents or vibrations to complement the viewing experience. For instance, during a scene set in a bakery, the television could release a warm, sweet aroma of freshly baked goods, or during an action scene, it could emit subtle vibrations to mimic the feeling of explosions. This would engage more senses and create a richer, more memorable experience.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Features**: Introduce a mode where viewers can influence the storyline of certain shows or movies. By using their remote or a mobile app, viewers could make choices that affect the plot's direction, leading to multiple endings. This feature would turn passive watching into an active experience, encouraging family and friends to gather around and participate together.",
    "**Health and Fitness Integration**: Design a television that connects with fitness apps and devices to provide viewers with personalized workout suggestions based on their activity levels and preferences. During commercial breaks or between episodes, the television could suggest quick workouts or stretching routines. This would encourage a more active lifestyle while enjoying screen time."
