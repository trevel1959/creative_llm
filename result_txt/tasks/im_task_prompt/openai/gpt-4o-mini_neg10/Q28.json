    "**Modular Helmet Design**: A helmet that allows for modular attachments based on the rider's needs. For instance, different visors could be added for sun protection, rain shields, or even a built-in light system for nighttime riding. The interior could be customizable with different padding options for comfort or even built-in cooling systems for hot days, making it versatile for various cycling conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: A helmet made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites, could appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists. Additionally, the helmet could incorporate a recycling program where old helmets can be returned for proper disposal or repurposing, creating a circular economy around bicycle safety gear.",
    "**Built-in Communication System**: A helmet that features an integrated communication system allowing cyclists to talk to each other via Bluetooth. This could be especially useful for group rides, where cyclists can communicate about road conditions, obstacles, or simply chat without needing to stop. The system could also include noise-cancellation technology to ensure clarity even in windy conditions.",
    "**Personalized Fit Technology**: Utilizing 3D scanning technology, this helmet could create a custom fit for each rider's head shape. The helmet could be adjusted with air bladders that inflate or deflate to ensure maximum comfort and safety. This technology could also help in distributing impact forces more evenly, enhancing protection during an accident.",
    "**Safety Light and Signal Integration**: A helmet equipped with built-in LED lights that can signal turns or stops would greatly enhance visibility and safety for cyclists. Riders could control the lights via a handlebar-mounted remote or even a gesture system. The lights could also be programmed to flash in emergency situations, alerting drivers and pedestrians to the cyclist's presence."
