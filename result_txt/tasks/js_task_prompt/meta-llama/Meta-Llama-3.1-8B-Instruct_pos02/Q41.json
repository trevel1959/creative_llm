    "**Global Time Banking System**: Establish a universal time banking system where every individual contributes 2 hours of their time daily to help others, and in return, they receive 2 hours of time credits that can be redeemed for services or goods from other contributors. This would foster a culture of mutual support, community engagement, and a sense of shared responsibility.",
    "**Environmental Protection Tax**: Introduce a global tax on all activities that harm the environment, such as pollution, deforestation, and carbon emissions.

This would facilitate global understanding, cooperation, and exchange of ideas, breaking down cultural and linguistic barriers that often hinder international relations and progress.",
