    "Space Tourism: With no more planes, space tourism could become the go-to mode of intercontinental travel. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are already working on commercial spacecraft, making it possible for individuals to travel to space and experience breathtaking views of the Earth from orbit. This mode of travel would not only be faster than traditional planes but also provide a unique and unforgettable experience.",
    "High-Speed Trains: Another option for long-distance travel would be high-speed trains. These trains could reach speeds of over 300 km/h and could cover vast distances in a relatively short time. For example, the Shanghai Maglev Train in China reaches speeds of up to 431 km/h, making it possible to travel from one end of the country to the other in just over 5 hours.",
    "Submarine Travel: With the advancement of underwater travel technology, submarines could become a viable mode of transportation for long-distance travel. Submarines could travel through the ocean at speeds of up to 20 knots (around 37 km/h), making it possible to travel between continents in a relatively short time. This mode of travel would provide a unique and immersive experience, allowing passengers to observe marine life and explore the underwater world.",
    "Hydrofoil Boats: Hydrofoil boats are high-speed boats that use wings, or foils, to lift the hull of the boat out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. These boats could be used for intercontinental travel, reducing travel time between destinations by several days. For example, the current hydrofoil record holder, the Spirit of Australia, can travel at speeds of up to 115 knots (213 km/h), making it possible to travel from one continent to another in just over 24 hours.",
    "Solar-Powered Aircraft: With advancements in solar panel technology, solar-powered aircraft could become a viable mode of transportation for long-distance travel. These aircraft would use solar panels to generate electricity, which would power electric motors and propellers, providing a clean and sustainable mode of transportation. While the current range of solar-powered aircraft is limited, advancements in technology could make"
