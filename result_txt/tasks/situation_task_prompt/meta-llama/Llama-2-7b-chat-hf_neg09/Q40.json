    "Solar-Powered Battery Chargers: Create portable solar-powered battery chargers that can be used to charge devices when batteries are no longer available. These chargers could be designed to capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which could then be used to charge devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets.",
    "Pneumatic Power: Develop a pneumatic power source that uses compressed air to power devices. This could involve creating a small compressor that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, allowing devices to be powered without batteries.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop bio-batteries that use organic materials, such as bacteria or algae, to generate electricity. These batteries could be designed to harness the metabolic energy of the microorganisms to produce electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable source of power.",
    "Thermal Energy Harvesting: Create devices that can harness thermal energy from the environment to power devices. This could involve using thermoelectric materials to convert heat into electrical energy, or designing devices that can capture and convert kinetic energy from moving fluids or vibrations.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Clothing: Develop clothing that can harness energy from the wearer's movements and convert it into electrical energy. This could involve using piezoelectric materials or electrically conductive fibers to generate electricity from the wearer's movements, allowing devices to be powered without batteries."
