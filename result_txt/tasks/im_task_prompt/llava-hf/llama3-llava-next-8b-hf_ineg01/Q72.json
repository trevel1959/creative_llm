This would be especially useful for surfers who want to improve their performance or those who venture into unfamiliar waters.",
    "**Surfboard Surf Aid**: Develop a small, compact surf aid that attaches to the surfboard's deck, providing additional buoyancy and support for beginner surfers. The aid could be made of lightweight, durable materials and have a quick-release mechanism for safety.",
    "**Surfboard Surf School Tool Kit**: Create a portable, multi-tool kit that includes various accessories, such as a surfboard wax scraper, fin key, and leash repair kit, all stored in a compact, waterproof case. This would be a convenient addition to any surf school or rental facility."
