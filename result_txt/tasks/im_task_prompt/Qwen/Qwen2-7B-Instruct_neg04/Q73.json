    "**Smart Keychain System**: Design a keychain that uses Bluetooth technology to connect with your smartphone. If you misplace your keys, your phone will vibrate and play a loud sound. This system can also help in finding your phone when it's lost. Additionally, the keychain could be programmed to lock your car if it detects the phone is out of range.",
    "**Emergency Key Recovery Device**: Develop a device that can send a signal to your car's alarm or start the engine remotely, even if the keys are lost. This device would be worn on a necklace or wristband, allowing for easy access in case you need to retrieve your car from a locked garage or a remote location.",
    "**Interactive GPS Tracking Keychain**: Create a keychain that integrates GPS tracking technology. It not only allows you to locate your keys on a map but also sends notifications when the keys move outside of a designated safe zone, such as your home or office. This can be particularly useful for families with children who may lose their keys.",
    "**Keyless Entry System Upgrade**: Offer an upgrade service that replaces traditional mechanical car keys with a wireless fob or smartphone-based entry solution. This could include facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or voice activation, eliminating the need for physical keys altogether. It would also incorporate features like automatic unlocking upon approach and locking upon departure.",
    "**Customized Keyholder with Removable NFC Tags**: Produce a keyholder with embedded Near Field Communication (NFC) tags. Each tag could be linked to specific tasks or information (e.g., a grocery list, a note to pick up a child from school). By touching the keychain to a smartphone, the user can access these details instantly, making it easier to remember important tasks and items."
