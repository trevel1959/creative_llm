    "foreseeing reflections: If all mirrors vanished, people might resort to using still water sources like lakes, rivers, or oceans to see their reflections. People could use a small stone or a leaf to create a small ripple on the water's surface, allowing them to gaze into the reflection.",
    "inner light: In a world without mirrors, people might turn inward to see their reflections. They could use the light from within themselves to illuminate their faces and study their features. They could stare into their own eyes, using the light from their irises to see their reflection.",
    "shadow puppetry: People could use their shadows to create a makeshift mirror. They could stand in front of a light source and manipulate their shadows to form the image of their face. This would allow them to see their reflection in a new and creative way.",
    "fire reflection: In a world without mirrors, people might use fire to see their reflections. They could hold a lit candle or torch near their face and observe the flickering flame's reflection on a flat surface. The dancing light would create an eerie but effective mirror-like effect.",
    "mind's eye: In a world without mirrors, people might turn to their imagination to see their reflections. They could close their eyes and visualize their face in their mind's eye, using their memory of their appearance to create a mental image of themselves. This would allow them to see themselves in a new and creative way, without the need for physical mirrors."
