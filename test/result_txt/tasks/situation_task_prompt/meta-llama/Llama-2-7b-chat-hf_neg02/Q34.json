    "Build an Automated Irrigation System: Create a self-sustaining irrigation system that uses solar power and a water collection mechanism to provide plants with the necessary water. This system could be designed to collect and store rainwater, and then use a series of tubes and valves to distribute the water to the plants.",
    "Use a Humidifier: Invest in a humidifier that can add moisture to the air around the plants. This would help to create a more humid environment, which can be beneficial for plant growth, especially for plants that thrive in humid climates.",
    "Create a Greenhouse: Build a greenhouse that can be used to grow plants year-round, regardless of the weather outside. This would provide a controlled environment where plants could receive the necessary amount of water and sunlight, even during times of drought.",
    "Use a Drip Irrigation System: Implement a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants. This system would use less water than traditional irrigation methods and would be more efficient in watering plants.",
    "Harvest Rainwater: Install a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for use in watering plants. This system could be connected to the gutters of the house or building, and the collected rainwater could be stored in a tank or cistern for later use."
