    "Create an app that connects riders with local transit providers to offer personalized recommendations based on their location, destination, and schedule. The app could also include real-time updates on bus or train schedules, delays, and cancellations.",
    "Implement a bike-sharing program that allows users to rent bikes for short periods of time using a mobile app. The program could be supported by solar-powered charging stations located throughout the city, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable transportation.",
    "Develop a shuttle service that operates exclusively during rush hour, transporting passengers from popular job centers to residential neighborhoods. This would reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality in the city.",
    "Implement a smart parking system that uses sensors and cameras to detect available parking spaces and guide drivers to them. This would help reduce traffic congestion caused by drivers circling around looking for parking, and make it easier for people to access public transportation.",
    "Create a community-driven initiative that encourages residents to volunteer as transportation ambassadors, helping new residents navigate the public transportation system and providing feedback to local officials on how to improve it. This would help build a sense of community and promote greater engagement in civic life."
