    "Hot Air Balloon: One creative solution to travel if all roads became impassable would be to use hot air balloons. These balloons could be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines, making them a sustainable mode of transportation. Passengers could travel in comfort and safety, enjoying the scenic views from above.",
    "Submersible Vehicles: Another option would be to use submersible vehicles that could travel underwater. These vehicles could be powered by electricity or even hydrogen fuel cells, making them a more eco-friendly option. They could also be used for transportation of goods and supplies, as well as for scientific research and exploration.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could be used to travel over land or through tunnels. These trains would use magnetic fields to lift and propel the train, eliminating the need for wheels and tracks. This would make them more efficient and reduce the need for maintenance.",
    "Personal Air Vehicles: Personal air vehicles, such as hoverbikes or jetpacks, could be used for short-distance travel. These vehicles would use fans or jet engines to generate lift and propulsion, allowing passengers to travel quickly and easily over short distances. They could be powered by electricity or even hydrogen fuel cells, making them a more eco-friendly option.",
    "Space Elevators: For longer distances, a space elevator could be used. A space elevator is a structure that extends from the surface of the Earth to geosynchronous orbit, allowing passengers and cargo to be lifted up and down the structure without the need for rockets. This would make space travel much more accessible and efficient, as well as reduce the amount of fuel needed for transportation."
