    "Build a rainwater collection system: You could construct a system that captures and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. This could involve installing a rain barrel or a larger storage tank under the ground, and connecting it to your plants' irrigation system. This way, you can collect and use the rainwater directly for watering your plants, reducing your reliance on potable water.",
    "Use graywater: Graywater is the wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines. You could collect and treat graywater and use it for irrigation purposes. This would help reduce the amount of potable water used for irrigation, while still providing your plants with the necessary moisture.",
    "Implement a drip irrigation system: Drip irrigation is a water-efficient method of irrigation that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants, reducing evaporation and runoff. By using a drip irrigation system, you can make the most of the water you have, and minimize waste.",
    "Use a misting system: A misting system can be used to deliver a fine spray of water to your plants, providing them with a gentle and consistent supply of moisture. This can be especially useful in areas with low humidity, where plants may require more moisture to thrive.",
    "Harness the power of the sun: You could use solar-powered irrigation systems that use the sun's energy to pump water from a storage tank to your plants. This would provide a reliable and sustainable source of water for your plants, without relying on electricity from the grid."
