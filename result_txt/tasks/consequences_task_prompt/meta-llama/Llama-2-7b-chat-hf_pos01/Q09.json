    "Human civilization would experience a massive overhaul: With half the gravity, buildings would collapse, and skyscrapers would be replaced by structures that could withstand the new gravitational forces. This would lead to a complete transformation of cities, with tunnels and elevated walkways becoming the norm. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "The atmosphere would be affected: With less gravity, the atmosphere would expand, and the weather patterns would drastically change. Storms would become more intense, and the jet stream would shift, leading to extreme climate fluctuations. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "The Earth's magnetic field would be impacted: Halving the gravity would cause the Earth's magnetic field to weaken, exposing the planet to harmful solar radiation. This would lead to mass extinctions and a significant impact on the planet's ecosystem. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "The ocean's tides would change: With less gravity, the ocean's tides would become weaker, and the sea levels would decrease. This would lead to a loss of coastal land and habitats for marine life. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Time and space would be altered: With half the gravity, time dilation would occur, and the passage of time would slow down. This would lead to a significant impact on the planet's rotation, causing days and nights to become longer or shorter. Confidence score: 0.8"
