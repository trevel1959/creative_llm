    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerants**: Innovate air conditioners to use advanced eco-friendly refrigerants that have a minimal impact on the environment. These new refrigerants would be designed to provide efficient cooling while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, manufacturers could promote recycling programs for old refrigerants to ensure they donâ€™t contribute to global warming.",
    "**Integrated Air Quality Monitor**: Incorporate a built-in air quality monitoring system that detects pollutants, allergens, and humidity levels in the home. The air conditioner could then adjust its filtration and ventilation systems accordingly, improving indoor air quality. Users would receive real-time feedback through a connected app, allowing them to take proactive measures to maintain a healthy living environment.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Filters**: Develop air conditioners with self-cleaning filter technology that utilizes UV light or electrostatic methods to eliminate dust, allergens, and bacteria. This would not only improve air quality but also reduce the need for regular maintenance, saving time and ensuring optimal performance. A notification system could alert users when the cleaning cycle is complete.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Sound Features**: Transform air conditioners into multi-functional devices by adding mood lighting and sound features. Users could choose different colors and intensities of LED lights that sync with their environment or personal preferences. Additionally, integrated speakers could play calming sounds or music to enhance relaxation while cooling the room.",
    "**Portable Air Quality Pods**: Create small, portable air conditioning units that can also act as air quality pods. These units could be easily moved from room to room, providing localized cooling and air purification wherever needed. They could be powered by rechargeable batteries, making them perfect for outdoor events, camping, or emergency situations."
