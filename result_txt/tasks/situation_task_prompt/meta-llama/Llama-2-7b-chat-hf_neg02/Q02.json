    "Community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs: If supermarkets were to close down, individuals could join a CSA program, where they would receive a weekly box of fresh, locally-grown produce directly from the farmers. This way, people would have access to fresh, healthy food without relying on a centralized grocery store.",
    "Urban agriculture: Cities could implement urban agriculture initiatives, such as rooftop gardens, community gardens, and vertical farms, to provide fresh produce to residents. These spaces could be managed by the community or by local organizations, ensuring that food is produced and distributed locally.",
    "Food hubs: A food hub is a centralized facility that aggregates and distributes locally produced food to various locations. In the absence of supermarkets, food hubs could serve as a vital link between farmers and consumers. They could also provide educational programs and resources to help people learn about sustainable food systems.",
    "Online food marketplaces: With the rise of e-commerce, it's possible to create online platforms that connect farmers directly with consumers. These platforms could offer a wide range of fresh, locally-produced food items, including meat, dairy, and prepared foods. This way, people could still access a variety of food products without relying on traditional grocery stores.",
    "Bartering and sharing: In a post-supermarket world, people could rely on bartering and sharing systems to obtain food. Neighborhoods could organize potlucks or food swaps, where individuals bring their excess food to share with others. This way, people could access food without relying on a centralized system. Additionally, communities could establish time banks, where individuals contribute their time and skills to help others in exchange for food or other necessities."
