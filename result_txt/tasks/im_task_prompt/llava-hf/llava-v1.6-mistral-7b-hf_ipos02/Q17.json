    "**Eco-Friendly Washing Machine**: Design a washing machine that uses less water and energy than traditional models. This could include features like a high-efficiency spin cycle, cold-water wash options, and a sensor that detects when a load is too small and adjusts the cycle accordingly.",
    "**Multifunctional Washing Machine**: Create a washing machine that can also function as a dryer. This would save space in the home and reduce the need for a separate dryer. The machine could have adjustable temperature settings for drying and could also include a timer to prevent over-drying.",
    "**Washing Machine with Built-In Laundry Sorting**: Design a washing machine with compartments for sorting laundry into different categories (whites, darks, lights, etc.). This would streamline the laundry process and make it more efficient.",
    "**Washing Machine with Voice Control**: Integrate voice control technology into the washing machine so that users can start, stop, and control the washing process without touching the machine. This could be particularly useful for individuals with mobility issues or those who prefer hands-free operation.",
    "**Washing Machine with Integrated Ironing System**: Combine a washing machine with an ironing system, allowing users to iron their clothes directly after washing. This would save time and effort, as the ironing process would be seamlessly integrated into the laundry routine."
