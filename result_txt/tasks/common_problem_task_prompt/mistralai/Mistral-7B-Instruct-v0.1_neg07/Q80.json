    "Using recycled materials for decorations: One creative way to plan an eco-friendly wedding is by using recycled materials for decorations. This could include using old jars and bottles as vases, vintage tablecloths, and repurposed furniture. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique and personal touch to the wedding.",
    "Choosing a sustainable venue: Selecting a venue that is eco-friendly is an important step in planning an eco-friendly wedding. Look for venues that use renewable energy sources, have recycling programs, and use sustainable materials in their construction.",
    "Using biodegradable products: Another way to reduce waste is by using biodegradable products such as plates, cups, and utensils. These products are made from sustainable materials and will decompose naturally after the wedding, reducing the impact on the environment.",
    "Incorporating local and seasonal foods: Choosing local and seasonal foods for the wedding reception is not only eco-friendly but also supports the local economy. This can be done by working with local farmers and choosing foods that are in season.",
    "Planting a tree as a wedding favor: As a way to give back to the environment, consider planting a tree as a wedding favor. This can be done by partnering with a local tree-planting organization or by purchasing trees and planting them on the wedding day. This not only benefits the environment but also creates a lasting memory for the couple and their guests."
