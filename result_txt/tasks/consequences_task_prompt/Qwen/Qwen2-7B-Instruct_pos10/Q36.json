    "**Enhanced Evolutionary Adaptability**: The ability to regenerate limbs would significantly influence evolutionary processes. Organisms might evolve more quickly, as regeneration could provide a survival advantage, leading to faster adaptation to changing environments or threats. This could also result in more complex and versatile life forms that can repair or replace limbs after injury or loss.",
    "**Medical Advancements**: Regenerative medicine would see a massive leap forward, with the potential for treating limb injuries through regrowth rather than traditional amputation and prosthetics. This could reduce disability rates, improve quality of life for patients, and lead to the development of new treatments for diseases affecting limb growth and regeneration.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Research and Treatment**: With the power to regenerate limbs, ethical considerations surrounding cloning and genetic modification would become more pressing. Questions about animal welfare, consent, and the moral implications of creating \"perfect\" organisms might arise. There could be debates on the use of this technology in enhancing human abilities beyond what is naturally possible.",
    "**Impact on Human-Alien Relations**: If humans were able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could change the dynamics of interactions between humans and alien species. Aliens with different regenerative capabilities might perceive humans differently, possibly leading to a new level of respect or even a shared understanding of life's fundamental processes. This could potentially open up new avenues for cooperation and scientific exchange.",
    "**Environmental and Economic Shifts**: Regenerating limbs could alter how humans interact with their environment. For instance, if people could regenerate limbs damaged by environmental hazards, there might be less pressure on protective gear and medical interventions. This could lead to a shift in economic sectors, with increased demand for technologies supporting regeneration and reduced spending on traditional medical treatments for injuries. Additionally, this ability could influence conservation efforts, as it might become easier for endangered species to recover from injuries, potentially impacting biodiversity management strategies."
