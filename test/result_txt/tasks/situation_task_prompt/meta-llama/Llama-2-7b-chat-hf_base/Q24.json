    "Glasses-free vision correction with nanotechnology: One creative solution would be to develop nanotechnology-based vision correction methods. Nanoparticles could be embedded in the eyes to correct refractive errors, such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. These nanoparticles could be designed to self-assemble into a 3D structure within the eye, providing a customized and precise correction for each individual. This approach would eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses.",
    "Virtual vision enhancement with brain-computer interfaces: Another creative solution would be to develop brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can enhance vision. BCIs use sensors to detect electrical signals in the brain and translate them into visual images. With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, BCIs could be used to enhance vision by amplifying or correcting visual information. This could be especially helpful for people with severe vision impairment, such as those with retinal degenerative diseases.",
    "Artificial retina implants: Artificial retina implants are already being developed to restore vision in people with severe vision loss. These implants use a microchip to convert light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. In the absence of glasses or contact lenses, artificial retina implants could provide a reliable and long-lasting vision correction solution.",
    "Contact lenses with built-in vision correction: If glasses and contact lenses were to disappear, contact lenses could be redesigned with built-in vision correction capabilities. This could involve embedding tiny lenses or mirrors within the contact lens that could correct refractive errors. This approach would eliminate the need for separate glasses or contact lenses for vision correction.",
    "Virtual reality vision correction: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, virtual reality technology could be used to provide vision correction. Virtual reality headsets could be designed to project a corrected visual image onto the retina, providing a 3D visual experience that is free from refractive errors. This approach would require advanced technology and computational power, but it could potentially provide a highly effective and convenient vision correction solution."
