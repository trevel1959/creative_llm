    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard Material**:    - Develop a surfboard made from biodegradable or recycled materials, such as bio-resins and hemp fibers. This innovation would appeal to environmentally conscious surfers and reduce the ecological impact of traditional surfboard production. Additionally, the surfboard could be designed to decompose safely after its lifecycle, leaving no harmful residues.",
    "**Customizable Modular Design**:    - Create a surfboard with a modular design that allows surfers to easily swap out different fins, tail shapes, and nose designs based on their preferences and surfing conditions. This would provide versatility, allowing surfers to adapt their board to various waves and styles without having to invest in multiple boards.",
    "**Built-in Hydration System**:    - Integrate a hydration system within the surfboard that allows surfers to easily access water while out on the waves. This could include a small, insulated compartment that holds a water bottle, equipped with a retractable straw. This would be especially beneficial for long sessions on hot days, helping surfers stay hydrated without needing to return to shore.",
    "**Adaptive Stability Technology**:    - Implement a technology that adjusts the surfboard's stability based on the rider's skill level and wave conditions. Using gyroscopic sensors and small actuators, the board could alter its shape slightly to provide more stability for beginners or enhance maneuverability for advanced surfers. This could help improve safety and performance for all skill levels.",
    "**LED Wave Interaction Lights**:    - Equip the surfboard with LED lights that react to wave movements and the surfer's maneuvers. These lights could change colors and patterns based on the intensity of the waves or the speed of the surfer, creating a visually stunning display while surfing at dusk or dawn. This feature would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also improve visibility for safety during low-light conditions."
