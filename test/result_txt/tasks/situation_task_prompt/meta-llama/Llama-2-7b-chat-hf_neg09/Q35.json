    "Pedal-Powered Public Transit: Create a network of pedal-powered buses or trains that run on designated routes, using human-powered generators to charge electric vehicles or power electric trolleys. This would provide a reliable and eco-friendly mode of transportation for short to medium distance commutes.",
    "Personal Flotation Devices: Develop inflatable or modular personal flotation devices that can be worn like a backpack or attached to a person's clothing. These devices would provide buoyancy and stability for users to navigate waterways or coastal areas, allowing them to commute to work or run errands without relying on a car.",
    "Hoverbikes: Design and manufacture hoverbikes that use electromagnetic fields or air pressure to create a cushion of air around the vehicle, allowing it to hover above the ground. These hoverbikes could be powered by electric motors, making them a sustainable and efficient alternative to cars for short-distance commutes.",
    "Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Trikes: Develop VTOL trikes that can take off and land vertically like a helicopter but are designed for personal transportation. These trikes would use electric motors and advanced aerodynamics to provide a smooth and efficient ride, allowing users to navigate through congested city streets or traverse hilly terrain.",
    "Personal Submarines: Create personal submarines that can be worn like a backpack or carried in a small vehicle. These submarines would use advanced propulsion systems, such as electric motors or even hydrogen fuel cells, to provide a clean and efficient means of transportation through waterways. This would allow users to commute to work or run errands without contributing to water pollution or relying on a car."
