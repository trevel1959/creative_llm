    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: In a world without mirrors, augmented reality (AR) glasses could be developed to project a virtual reflection of oneself. Users could wear these glasses to see a digital overlay of their appearance, which could be customized with different outfits, hairstyles, and accessories. This technology would not only allow for personal grooming but could also serve as a platform for social interaction, where friends could share their virtual reflections and give feedback on their looks.",
    "**Reflective Clothing**: Designers could innovate by creating clothing made from materials that reflect light in unique ways. These garments could be embedded with tiny reflective fibers that allow wearers to catch glimpses of their own appearance as they move. This would transform the fashion industry, as people would choose outfits not just for style but also for the ability to see their reflection while on the go, encouraging self-expression and confidence.",
    "**Smartphone Reflection Apps**: With the absence of mirrors, smartphones could develop apps that use the front-facing camera to create a reflection-like experience. These apps could provide features like virtual mirrors with filters, lighting adjustments, and makeup simulations. Users could take selfies that mimic the experience of looking in a mirror, while also allowing for creative expression through digital enhancements.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces in Architecture**: Urban design could adapt by incorporating reflective materials into buildings and public spaces. Architects might use polished metals or glass panels that create reflective surfaces, allowing individuals to see their reflections as they walk through city streets. This could lead to the creation of \"reflection parks,\" where strategically placed reflective elements encourage people to pause, admire their reflections, and engage with their surroundings.",
    "**Self-Reflective Art Installations**: Artists could create immersive installations that serve as self-reflective spaces. These could include rooms filled with reflective sculptures, interactive screens, or even holographic displays that allow visitors to see their likeness in a multitude of artistic forms. This would not only provide a unique way to view oneself but also encourage deeper introspection and connection to art."
