    "**Innovative Wheelchair Cushion**: Develop a custom cushion that utilizes advanced materials and pressure distribution technology to alleviate pressure sores and enhance comfort for wheelchair users. The cushion can be designed with multiple layers, each with varying degrees of density and elasticity, allowing for personalized adjustments based on individual user needs. It may also incorporate air cells or gel to provide even more support and pressure relief.",
    "**Intelligent Wheelchair Navigation System**: Create an AI-powered navigation system that assists wheelchair users in finding their way through complex environments, such as busy public spaces or unfamiliar buildings. The system could use GPS, augmented reality, and voice commands to guide the user from point A to point B, avoiding obstacles and offering alternative routes if necessary. This would greatly improve independence and mobility for wheelchair users.",
    "**Portable Power Station for Wheelchairs**: Design a compact, rechargeable power station that can be easily attached to a wheelchair frame. This device would allow users to charge electronic devices, such as smartphones or tablets, while on the go, providing essential connectivity and entertainment options. Additionally, it could be equipped with a small fan or heater, depending on the climate, to ensure user comfort during different weather conditions.",
    "**Smart Bracing System for Wheelchair Users**: Develop a lightweight, adjustable brace that integrates with a wheelchair to assist with stability and balance. The brace could be controlled by sensors and artificial intelligence, automatically adjusting to provide additional support when needed, such as during transfers or when navigating uneven terrain. This would help wheelchair users maintain better posture and reduce the risk of injury.",
    "**Customizable Ergonomic Wheelchair**: Offer a range of customization options for wheelchair frames, including adjustable armrests, footrests, and backrests, as well as various seat widths and depths. Allow users to select materials, colors, and even patterns to personalize their wheelchairs, making them not only functional but also a reflection of the user's unique style and personality. This approach could increase user satisfaction and motivation to use their wheelchair regularly."
