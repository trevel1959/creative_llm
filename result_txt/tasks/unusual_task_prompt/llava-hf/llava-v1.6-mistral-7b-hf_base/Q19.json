    "Room freshener: Place a candle in a bowl of water along with a few drops of your favorite essential oil or scented oil, creating a DIY room freshener. As the candle melts, the fragrant oils will be released into the air, providing a natural and soothing aroma.",
    "Mood lighting: Use a candle to create a warm, ambient glow, adding a touch of romance or coziness to any setting. You can use a candle in the shape of a letter or number to spell out words or create designs in the wax.",
    "Organizing tool: Make a homemade organizer by melting down old candles and pouring the wax into ice cube trays or silicone molds. Once set, you can use these wax cubes or shapes to organize small items like jewelry, makeup, or office supplies.",
    "Wax seal stamps: Craft a homemade wax seal stamp by attaching a decorative object to a cork on the top of a bottle. Dip the cork in melted candle wax and press it onto letters, envelopes, or any other items that you want to seal.",
    "Lip balm container: Empty lip balm containers can be repurposed to hold other small items like cotton swabs, bobby pins, or mini razors. Simply remove the old lip balm, and fill the container with your chosen item. This upcycling idea is a great way to reduce waste and give old containers a new life."
