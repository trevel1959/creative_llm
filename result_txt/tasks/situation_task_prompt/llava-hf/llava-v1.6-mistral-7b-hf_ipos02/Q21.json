    "**Local Networks**: Local networks, such as intranets, could still function in the absence of a global internet. These networks are designed to share information within a specific community or organization and could continue to operate during a server crash. This would require a person to be connected to a local network that has the information they need.",
    "**Direct Communication**: Direct communication between individuals, such as face-to-face conversations or phone calls, could be used to share information. This would require people to be physically present or have access to a working phone line. This method is less efficient than the internet but could still be effective in sharing basic information.",
    "**Community Hubs**: In the absence of a global internet, community hubs could serve as centralized locations for sharing information. These hubs could be set up by organizations or communities and would provide access to resources, such as books, computers, and databases. This would require people to be in proximity to the hub and have the necessary credentials to access the resources.",
    "**Alternative Internet**: In some cases, alternative internet systems could be set up to replace the global internet. These systems could be designed to operate independently of the existing infrastructure and could provide a limited but functional version of the internet. This would require significant investment and infrastructure development.",
    "**Offline Applications**: Offline applications, such as mobile apps or software, could be used to access information. These applications could be pre-loaded onto devices and would provide access to a limited amount of information. This would require people to have the necessary devices and the appropriate applications installed."
