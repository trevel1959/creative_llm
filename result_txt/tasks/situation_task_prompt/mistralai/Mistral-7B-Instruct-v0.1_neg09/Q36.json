    "I would lay down on the floor and close my eyes to meditate.",
    "I would climb a tree and sit on a branch.",
    "I would sit on a log in the middle of a forest.",
    "I would sit on a rock near a river and watch the water flow.",
    "I would sit on a bench in a park and watch the world go by."
