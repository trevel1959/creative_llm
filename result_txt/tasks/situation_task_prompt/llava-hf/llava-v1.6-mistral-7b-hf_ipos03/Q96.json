    "**Beach Art Park**: The absence of sand would create a unique canvas for artists to express themselves. Artists could use the beach's surface as a blank slate to create temporary installations, sculptures, and murals that would be visible only at low tide.",
    "**Sandless Beach Olympics**: A beach without sand could host a series of sandless beach games. Instead of traditional beach sports like beach volleyball and frisbee, new games could be invented using the natural elements like water, wind, and the contours of the shoreline.",
    "**Sandless Surfing**: The beach's smooth surface could become a haven for sandless surfing. Surfers could use bodyboards or stand-up paddleboards to ride the waves that would be unaffected by the missing sand.",
    "**Eco-friendly Beach**: The absence of sand could lead to a cleaner and more sustainable beach environment. The lack of sand would reduce the amount of waste generated by beachgoers and would encourage people to respect and preserve the natural beauty of the coastline.",
    "**Seaside Meditation Retreat**: The serene and uncluttered beach would provide the perfect setting for a seaside meditation retreat. The calming sound of waves and the soothing sea breeze would create an ideal environment for mindfulness and relaxation."
