    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates a small solar panel to power LED lights. This bell would not only emit sound but also flash bright lights when activated, enhancing visibility for cyclists during night rides or in low-light conditions. The solar panel would keep the battery charged, reducing the need for frequent replacements.",
    "**Multi-Function Bicycle Bell**: Create a bell that serves multiple purposes. In addition to its primary function, it could include a built-in mini speaker for playing music or audio alerts, a small flashlight for emergencies, and a GPS tracker to help locate the bike if stolen. This all-in-one device would appeal to tech-savvy cyclists looking for convenience and safety.",
    "**Personalized Sound Options**: Develop a bicycle bell that allows users to record their own sounds or select from a library of unique sounds, including nature sounds, animal calls, or humorous noises. This feature would give cyclists the ability to express their personality and make their rides more enjoyable while ensuring they still have a functional warning device.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell**: Introduce a bell that interacts with other cyclists and pedestrians through a simple gesture. For example, it could be equipped with sensors that detect when a cyclist raises their hand to signal a turn or stop, automatically triggering a light or sound alert to notify others of their intentions. This would enhance communication and safety on the road.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals, with an emphasis on eco-friendliness. Additionally, it could feature a minimalist design that reduces weight and enhances aerodynamics. The packaging could also be made from recycled materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers."
