    "**Island Exploration and Mapping**: Upon arrival, I would thoroughly explore the island to understand its layout, geography, and potential resources. I'd create a mental or physical map of the island, noting the location of water sources, edible plants, sheltered areas, and any potential hazards. This would help me navigate the island efficiently and make informed decisions about resource gathering and shelter construction.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Using the materials I've identified during my exploration, I would construct a sturdy shelter that provides protection from the elements and potential wildlife threats. I'd consider building a lean-to using fallen branches, palm fronds, or other natural materials. This would serve as a temporary solution until I can gather more materials or find a more suitable location.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification**: I would focus on finding a reliable source of clean drinking water. If the island has a stream or river, I'd collect water from that source and use natural methods to purify it, such as boiling or using sand and charcoal filtration. If no natural water sources are available, I'd collect dew or rainwater and store it in a container made from natural materials.",
    "**Food Procurement**: I would identify edible plants, fruits, and nuts on the island, making sure to avoid any poisonous or allergenic species. I'd also search for shellfish, crabs, or other seafood, using makeshift tools like spears or nets. If possible, I'd build a fish trap or create a simple fishing line to catch fish. To supplement my diet, I'd consider hunting small game like birds or rodents, using makeshift traps or spears.",
    "**Signal Fire and Communication**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire during the day, using dry wood and other flammable materials. I'd also create a smoke signal during the day to attract attention from potential rescuers. To enhance my communication efforts, I'd create a makeshift flag using natural materials like palm fronds or leaves, and use a combination of visual and auditory signals to convey my presence and location to potential rescuers."
