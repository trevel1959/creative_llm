    "**Integrated Temperature Control**: Design a yoga mat with built-in temperature control technology. This could include materials that retain warmth for practices in cooler environments or cooling gel layers for hot yoga sessions. Users could adjust the temperature through a mobile app, enhancing comfort and performance during practice.",
    "**Smart Yoga Mat with Sensors**: Create a smart yoga mat embedded with sensors that track alignment, pressure points, and balance during poses. This mat could connect to an app that provides real-time feedback, personalized recommendations, and progress tracking, making it ideal for beginners and advanced practitioners alike.",
    "**Modular Design**: Introduce a modular yoga mat that can be connected with other mats to create a larger practice space. Each section could have unique textures or designs catering to different yoga styles (e.g., a firmer section for balance poses, a softer section for restorative practices). This flexibility allows users to customize their practice environment.",
    "**Aromatherapy Infusion**: Incorporate a feature that allows users to infuse their yoga mat with essential oils. This could be achieved through a small compartment in the mat where users can place scent pads. As they practice, the mat would release a gentle aroma, enhancing relaxation and focus during yoga sessions.",
    "**Interactive Yoga Mat**: Design an interactive yoga mat with built-in LED lights that guide users through poses. The lights could change colors or patterns to indicate correct alignment, transitions, or even the timing for breath. This would be especially beneficial for beginners who may struggle with proper form or timing."
