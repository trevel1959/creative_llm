    "**A water feature**: A water feature, such as a pond or a series of pools, can be incorporated into the habitat to provide a source of water for the animals while adding an attractive element for visitors. The water feature should be designed to mimic local landscapes for a natural and soothing effect on the animals and onlookers alike.",
    "**A rock garden**: Incorporating rocks and boulders into the habitat can create a unique and picturesque landscape. These rocks should be chosen for their texture, size, and appeal to the target animal, and can provide a natural environment for burrowing and nesting.",
    "**A forested area**: Creating a small forest within the habitat can provide a wide range of ecosystem benefits. This area should include a variety of trees and foliage native to the region, allowing the habitat to support a diverse group of animals.",
    "**A waterfall or stream**: Adding a waterfall or stream to the habitat can create a natural water source and also provide visual interest to visitors. The sound of flowing water can also attract animals and provide a tranquil atmosphere.",
    "**An open-air observation deck**: This idea involves constructing a platform or pavilion that allows visitors to observe the animals both from above and on the ground level. The platform can be designed to integrate with the landscape and enhance the visitor experience by providing a unique perspective on the habitat."
