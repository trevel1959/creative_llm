    "forests would become more diverse: Without animals, the ecosystem would shift to prioritize plants and insects. This could lead to a more diverse and resilient ecosystem, with more complex food webs and ecological relationships.",
    "Insects could become a sustainable food source: Insects are already a common food source in many cultures around the world, and could become a more significant source of protein in a world without animals. With proper farming and processing techniques, insects could be raised sustainably and provide a nutritious and environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional livestock.",
    "Biotechnology could be used to control pests: With the absence of animals, biotechnology could be used to develop new methods for controlling pests, such as genetically modified insects that are unable to reproduce or cause damage to crops. This could help to maintain a balance between the ecosystem and agricultural productivity.",
    "Integrated pest management systems: In a world without animals, integrated pest management (IPM) systems could be developed and implemented to control pests. IPM involves using a combination of techniques, such as crop rotation, biological control, and cultural controls, to manage pest populations in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way.",
    "Redesigning our cities and buildings: In a world without animals, cities and buildings could be redesigned to reduce the need for pest control measures. For example, buildings could be designed with integrated pest management systems, such as green roofs and walls, to provide habitat for beneficial insects and reduce the need for pesticides. Cities could also be designed with more efficient waste management systems, reducing the attractiveness of urban areas to pests."
