    "**Modular Lens System**:    - Create a camera with a modular lens system that allows users to easily swap out different lens elements rather than entire lenses. This could include options for varying focal lengths, aperture settings, and even specialized filters. Users could mix and match components to customize their shooting experience on the fly, making it easier to adapt to different shooting conditions without carrying multiple lenses.",
    "**Smart Environmental Adaptation**:    - Develop a camera that can automatically adjust its settings based on the environment it detects. Using AI and machine learning, the camera could analyze the scene's lighting, motion, and even subject type (like landscapes, portraits, or action shots) and adjust shutter speed, ISO, and aperture accordingly. This would simplify the shooting process for users and help them capture the best possible images without manual adjustments.",
    "**Integrated Drone Functionality**:    - Imagine a camera that can detach and fly as a mini-drone for aerial photography. This would allow photographers to capture unique perspectives without the need for a separate drone. The camera could automatically return to its base after taking a series of shots or could be controlled via a mobile app, giving users the freedom to explore new angles and heights effortlessly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design with Solar Charging**:    - Design a camera that incorporates sustainable materials and features a solar charging panel. This would allow photographers to charge their camera on-the-go using sunlight, making it perfect for outdoor adventures and eco-conscious users. Additionally, the camera could include a built-in recycling program, encouraging users to send in old equipment for refurbishment or recycling.",
    "**Real-Time Collaboration Feature**:    - Introduce a camera that allows multiple users to connect in real-time for collaborative shooting experiences. Photographers could link their cameras via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, enabling them to share live views, settings, and even capture synchronized shots. This would be particularly useful for group projects, events, or workshops, fostering creativity and teamwork."
