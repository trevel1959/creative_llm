    "Build a Floating Bridge: Create a bridge made of interconnected inflatable rafts or boats that can be easily assembled and disassembled. These rafts can be designed to hold heavy loads and can be propelled using oars or paddles. This bridge will provide a safe and flexible crossing option for people to cross the river.",
    "Develop a Tunnel System: Design a network of interconnected tunnels that can be built under the river. These tunnels can be made of durable materials like concrete or steel and can be equipped with ventilation systems, lighting, and safety features. People can use these tunnels to safely and efficiently cross the river.",
    "Create a Suspension Bridge: Design a suspension bridge that uses cables and towers to span the river. This bridge can be built using materials like steel or concrete and can be anchored to the riverbed or the surrounding cliffs. The cables can be designed to absorb shocks and stresses, making the bridge safe for pedestrians and vehicles.",
    "Develop a Ferry System: Establish a ferry service that uses boats or ships to transport people and vehicles across the river. These boats can be designed to accommodate large loads and can operate during all weather conditions. This ferry system can provide a reliable and efficient way to cross the river, especially during times of flooding or other natural disasters.",
    "Build a Ramp System: Design a series of ramps that can be built along the riverbanks, allowing people to drive or walk up and down the river. These ramps can be made of durable materials like concrete or steel and can be equipped with safety features like handrails and guardrails. This ramp system can provide a safe and accessible way to cross the river, especially for people with mobility issues."
