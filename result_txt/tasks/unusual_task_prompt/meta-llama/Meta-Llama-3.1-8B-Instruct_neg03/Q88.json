    "**Tissue Box with a Twist**: Design a tissue box that doubles as a planter for a small succulent or herb plant. The box would have a removable lid, and the tissue compartment would be replaced by a small potting area. The user can place a small plant inside and enjoy the aesthetic of having a living, breathing decoration. The tissue box would also have a built-in watering system, ensuring the plant stays hydrated.",
    "**Tissue Box for the Visually Impaired**: Create a tactile tissue box with Braille labels and raised patterns on the surface. The box would have a distinct shape and texture, making it easily identifiable by touch. The Braille labels would indicate the number of tissues left, and the raised patterns would help users navigate the box without relying on sight.",
    "**Tissue Box with a Hidden Compartment**: Design a tissue box with a hidden compartment that can store small items like keys, coins, or a phone charger. The compartment would be accessed by pressing a hidden button or sliding a panel, providing a secure and convenient place to stash personal belongings.",
    "**Tissue Box with a Built-in Air Purifier**: Develop a tissue box that incorporates a small air purifier, helping to remove allergens and bacteria from the air. The air purifier would be powered by a small battery or USB connection, and the tissue box would have a built-in filter that needs to be replaced periodically.",
    "**Tissue Box with a Social Aspect**: Create a tissue box that connects to a social media platform, allowing users to share their tissue usage and connect with others who have similar habits. The box would have a built-in sensor that tracks tissue usage and sends updates to the user's social media account. Users could then share their progress, compete with friends, or join tissue-related challenges."
