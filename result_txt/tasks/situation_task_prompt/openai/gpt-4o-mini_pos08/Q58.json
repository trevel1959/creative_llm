    "**Community Insect-Farming Initiatives**: Establish community programs that promote insect farming as a means of pest control. People could raise beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and praying mantises, which naturally prey on harmful pests. Workshops would teach participants how to create habitats and care for these beneficial species, fostering a sense of community and encouraging sustainable practices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Insect Repellents**: Develop a line of eco-friendly insect repellents made from essential oils and plant extracts that are non-toxic to humans and pets. These repellents could be marketed as a natural alternative to chemical pesticides. They would not only repel harmful insects but also attract beneficial ones, creating a balanced ecosystem in gardens and homes.",
    "**Insect Deterrent Gardens**: Promote the idea of insect deterrent gardens that utilize specific plants known to repel pests. For example, marigolds can deter nematodes, while basil can repel flies and mosquitoes. By designing gardens with these plants, individuals can create a natural barrier against pests while enhancing their outdoor spaces. Workshops and community events could help educate people on how to design and maintain these gardens.",
    "**Ultrasonic Pest Control Devices**: Innovate ultrasonic pest control devices that emit sound waves at frequencies that are uncomfortable for pests but inaudible to humans and pets. These devices could be solar-powered and designed for outdoor use, providing a humane and environmentally friendly way to keep pest populations in check without harming the ecosystem.",
    "**Insect-Resistant Crops**: Invest in research and development of insect-resistant crops through natural breeding techniques. These crops would be less appealing to pests due to their natural defenses, reducing the need for pest control measures. Collaborating with agricultural communities, these crops could be distributed to promote sustainable farming practices while addressing the issue of pest management."
