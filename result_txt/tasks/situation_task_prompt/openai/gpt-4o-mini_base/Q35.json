    "**Personal Hoverboards with Vertical Takeoff**: Envision personal hoverboards that not only glide over surfaces but also have the capability to lift off the ground for short distances. These boards would use advanced magnetic levitation technology to provide a smooth ride while avoiding traffic congestion. Riders could simply activate the vertical takeoff feature to bypass obstacles and reach their destination faster. Safety features like automatic landing and collision avoidance systems would ensure a secure ride for everyone.",
    "**Community-based Electric Scooter Sharing**: In the absence of bicycles, electric scooters could take center stage in urban mobility. A community-based sharing program would allow residents to access electric scooters stationed at various points throughout the city. Users could unlock scooters via a mobile app, track their rides, and return them to designated areas. This system would promote a culture of shared mobility, reduce carbon footprints, and encourage social interactions among community members as they navigate the city together.",
    "**Modular Personal Transport Pods**: Picture a fleet of small, modular transport pods that can be connected or detached as needed. These pods would be electric and capable of carrying one or two passengers, with the option to connect multiple pods for larger groups. They would operate on designated paths, reducing traffic congestion. The pods would also be equipped with augmented reality displays that provide information about the surroundings, local events, and even personalized entertainment during the ride.",
    "**Smart Walking Paths with Interactive Features**: With the disappearance of bicycles, cities could transform pedestrian pathways into smart walking paths. These paths would incorporate interactive features like LED lights that change colors based on the time of day or weather conditions. They could also have embedded sensors that track foot traffic and provide real-time data on the best routes to avoid congestion. Additionally, fitness stations along the way would encourage people to engage in physical activities while commuting.",
    "**Autonomous Personal Rovers**: Imagine a fleet of small, autonomous rovers designed for personal transport. These rovers would navigate city streets using AI and advanced sensors, allowing them to pick up passengers from their location and drop them off at their desired destination. Users could summon a rover through a mobile app, selecting their preferred route and travel companions. The rovers would be eco-friendly, powered by renewable energy, and designed to operate in harmony with pedestrians and other vehicles."
