    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that can harness solar energy to generate power. This battery would use a special solar panel to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which would then be stored in the battery for use with devices.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Create a battery that uses living organisms as the power source. This could involve using microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast to generate electricity through chemical reactions. The organisms would be contained in a specialized chamber within the battery, and their energy would be harnessed and stored for use with devices.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a battery that uses thermal energy to generate power. This battery would use a specialized material that can store thermal energy, such as heat, and convert it into electrical energy when needed. This could involve using a phase-change material that changes state (i.e., melts or freezes) when heated or cooled, releasing energy as it changes state.",
    "Wave Power: Develop a battery that harnesses the power of ocean waves to generate electricity. This battery would use a specialized device that converts the up-and-down motion of waves into electrical energy, which would then be stored in the battery. This could involve using a pendulum-like device that oscillates back and forth with the waves, or a device that uses the wave motion to generate electricity through piezoelectric materials.",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Create a battery that uses compressed air to generate power. This battery would use a specialized valve that allows air to enter the battery and create a pressure difference, which would then drive an electrical current. This could involve using a small air compressor to pump air into the battery, or using a specialized membrane that allows air to enter the battery at a controlled rate."
