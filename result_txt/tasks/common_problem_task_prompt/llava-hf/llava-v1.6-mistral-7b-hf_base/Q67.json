    "Weather conditions: Organic farming is highly dependent on the weather, and unpredictable weather patterns can lead to crop failures or lower yields. Drought, floods, or extreme temperatures can damage crops and make it difficult to maintain a healthy farm.",
    "Pest infestations: Organic farming relies on natural methods of pest control, which may not be as effective as chemical pesticides. This can lead to crop damage and lower yields.",
    "Soil degradation: Organic farming practices, such as monoculture, can lead to soil degradation over time. This can reduce the fertility of the soil and make it difficult to maintain a healthy farm.",
    "Market demand: Organic produce is in high demand, but the supply may not always meet the demand. This can lead to fluctuations in prices and make it difficult for farmers to make a consistent income.",
    "Regulatory compliance: Organic farming is subject to strict regulations and certification requirements. Farmers need to ensure that their farming practices meet these standards, which can be time-consuming and costly."
