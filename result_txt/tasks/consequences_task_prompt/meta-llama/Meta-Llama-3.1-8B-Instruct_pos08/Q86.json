    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: The sudden loss of sunlight would cripple photosynthesis, leading to a catastrophic collapse of food chains. Herbivores would struggle to find sustenance, causing a ripple effect throughout the food web. This would have devastating consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, potentially driving many species to extinction.",
    "**Global Temperature Drop**: Without the sun's radiation, Earth's average temperature would plummet, potentially dropping by as much as 10°C (18°F). This would lead to a dramatic increase in the number of days spent in sub-zero temperatures, making it difficult for humans and other organisms to survive. The polar ice caps would expand, causing sea levels to rise, and coastal cities would be inundated.",
    "**Disruption of Global Climate Patterns**: The sun's disappearance would disrupt global climate patterns, leading to extreme and unpredictable weather events. Without the sun's energy, atmospheric circulation patterns would collapse, causing massive storms, droughts, and temperature fluctuations. This would have far-reaching consequences for agriculture, human settlements, and global economies.",
    "**Effects on Human Health**: The sudden loss of sunlight would have severe consequences for human health. Vitamin D production would cease, leading to widespread deficiencies and related health issues, such as rickets, osteomalacia, and increased risk of infections. The lack of sunlight would also disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to sleep disorders, depression, and other mental health issues.",
    "**Impact on Space Exploration**: The sun's disappearance would have significant implications for space exploration. Without the sun's energy, solar panels would be useless, and spacecraft would struggle to maintain power. This would hinder our ability to communicate with Earth, navigate through space, and conduct scientific research. The lack of sunlight would also make it difficult for astronauts to survive on long-duration space missions."
