    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature using ultrasonic technology that vibrates at a frequency to break down mineral deposits and other residues inside the kettle. Users could simply fill the kettle with water and a cleaning solution, activate the self-cleaning mode, and let the kettle do the work, ensuring it remains hygienic without manual scrubbing.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Design the kettle with a built-in water filtration system that uses activated carbon and UV light to purify water before boiling. This would not only improve the taste of the water but also ensure that harmful bacteria and contaminants are eliminated, making it ideal for areas with poor water quality.",
    "**Multifunctional Base Station**: Create a base station that serves multiple purposes, such as a wireless charger for smartphones, a Bluetooth speaker, or even a smart hub for controlling other kitchen appliances. This would reduce counter clutter and enhance the utility of the kettle, allowing users to enjoy music or charge devices while waiting for their water to boil.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Incorporate an interactive LED display on the kettle that provides real-time information such as water temperature, boiling time, and even recipes for beverages that can be made with hot water. Users could touch the screen to select different settings or learn about the health benefits of various teas and infusions.",
    "**Portable Power Bank Feature**: Equip the kettle with a detachable battery that can double as a power bank for charging devices on the go. This would be especially useful for camping trips or outdoor activities where electricity may not be readily available, allowing users to boil water and charge their devices with one appliance."
