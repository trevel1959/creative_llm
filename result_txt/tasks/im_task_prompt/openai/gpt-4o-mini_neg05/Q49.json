    "**Self-Cleaning Toothbrush**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes UV-C light to sanitize the bristles after each use. This would not only ensure that the toothbrush remains hygienic but also reduce the need for manual cleaning. Users could simply place the toothbrush in a docking station that activates the self-cleaning feature, making it more convenient and ensuring better oral health.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads with Specialized Functions**: Create a line of interchangeable brush heads designed for specific dental needsâ€”such as gum care, whitening, or sensitive teeth. Users could easily switch out the heads based on their current oral health goals. Each brush head could come with unique bristle patterns and materials tailored to different functions, ensuring a customized brushing experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Toothbrush**: Design an electric toothbrush made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, with a focus on reducing environmental impact. Additionally, the toothbrush could have a rechargeable battery that lasts longer and can be replaced rather than disposed of, further minimizing waste. An eco-conscious branding strategy could appeal to environmentally aware consumers.",
    "**Integrated Floss Dispenser**: Innovate an electric toothbrush that includes a built-in floss dispenser. This would allow users to floss immediately after brushing without needing to reach for a separate product. The dispenser could be designed to hold a refillable spool of floss, and the toothbrush could even have a small mechanism to help guide the floss between teeth effectively.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience for Kids**: Create an electric toothbrush designed specifically for children that incorporates gamification elements. The toothbrush could feature a built-in timer that plays fun music or sounds, and an app that rewards kids with points for brushing their teeth properly. The app could also include fun challenges, characters, and stories that engage children, making brushing a fun and enjoyable routine."
