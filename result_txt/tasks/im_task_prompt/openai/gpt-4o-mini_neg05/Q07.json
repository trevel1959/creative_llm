    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, corn starch, or recycled paper. This toothbrush would not only reduce plastic waste but could also come with seed-infused bristles that can be planted after use, allowing users to grow their own herbs or flowers, thereby promoting sustainability and a greener lifestyle.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Develop a toothbrush that incorporates a small UV light chamber in the handle. After brushing, users can place the brush in the chamber, which uses UV-C light to kill 99.9% of bacteria and germs. This feature would ensure that the toothbrush remains hygienic and safe to use, especially in environments where bacteria can thrive.",
    "**Toothbrush with Adjustable Bristle Firmness**: Create a toothbrush that allows users to adjust the firmness of the bristles based on their preference or dental needs. A dial or slider mechanism on the handle could allow users to switch between soft, medium, and firm bristles, making it suitable for those with sensitive gums or those needing a more vigorous cleaning.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flosser**: Innovate a toothbrush that combines brushing and flossing in one device. The toothbrush would have a built-in water flosser that releases a gentle stream of water while brushing, effectively cleaning between teeth and promoting healthier gums. This two-in-one solution would save time and encourage better oral hygiene practices.",
    "**Toothbrush with Aromatherapy Feature**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates an aromatherapy feature, where users can insert small pods containing essential oils. As they brush, the toothbrush releases a light mist of the chosen essential oil, providing a refreshing experience while also promoting relaxation or invigoration, depending on the oil used. This could enhance the overall brushing experience and make it more enjoyable."
