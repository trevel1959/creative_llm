    "**Modular Growth**: This plant species would have the ability to grow and regenerate its own branches and leaves in a modular fashion. This would allow it to adapt to different environmental conditions and repair itself when damaged. The modular growth could also be used for a variety of applications, such as producing food, medicine, or even materials for construction.",
    "**Edible Fruit with Multiple Health Benefits**: This plant species would produce a fruit that is not only delicious but also packed with a wide range of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. The fruit could have unique properties, such as being high in antioxidants, low in calories, and able to help improve digestion.",
    "**Nutrient-Extracting Roots**: This plant species would have specially adapted roots that can extract a variety of nutrients from the soil, including minerals and trace elements that are not typically found in most plants. These nutrients could be used to create a range of natural fertilizers and supplements.",
    "**Air-Purifying Leaves**: This plant species would have leaves that can absorb pollutants and toxins from the air, much like some existing plants. However, this plant would have an additional feature where it could break down these pollutants into harmless compounds, thus improving air quality in urban environments.",
    "**Drought-Resistant Stem**: This plant species would have a stem that can store a large amount of water, allowing it to survive and thrive in arid environments. The stem could also be used as a source of water for other plants in the area, promoting biodiversity in drought-prone regions."
