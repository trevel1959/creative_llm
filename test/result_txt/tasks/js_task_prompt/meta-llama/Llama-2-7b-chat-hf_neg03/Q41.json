    "A universal \"Kindness Day\" - Everyone in the world would have to perform at least one act of kindness on a designated day each month. This could be something small like buying a stranger's coffee or holding the door for someone, or something larger like volunteering at a local charity or donating to a good cause. The idea is to encourage people to prioritize kindness and compassion in their daily lives, fostering a more empathetic and supportive global community.",
    "A \"Mental Health Pledge\" - People would be required to take a mental health day once a year, where they are allowed to disconnect from work, social media, and other responsibilities to focus on their own well-being. This would help reduce stress and promote self-care, encouraging individuals to prioritize their mental health and seek help when needed.",
    "\"Eco-Friendly Innovation Fund\" - A global fund would be established to support innovative ideas and technologies that promote sustainable living and reduce carbon emissions. This could include projects like developing alternative energy sources, creating biodegradable packaging, or implementing eco-friendly transportation systems. By investing in these initiatives, we can work towards a more environmentally conscious future.",
    "\"Cultural Exchange Programs\" - Governments and organizations would be required to establish programs that promote cultural exchange and understanding between different countries and communities. This could involve student exchanges, language classes, or cultural immersion programs. By fostering greater empathy and understanding between nations, we can help build a more harmonious and peaceful world.",
    "\"Universal Basic Income\" - A guaranteed basic income would be provided to every citizen of the world, ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. This would help reduce poverty, inequality, and social unrest, promoting greater economic stability and social justice. By providing a safety net for all, we can help create a more equitable and prosperous society."
