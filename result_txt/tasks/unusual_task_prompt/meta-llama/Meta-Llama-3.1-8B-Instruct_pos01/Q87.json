    "What are some potential ways to address the growing concern of plastic pollution in our oceans and waterways?",
    "**Seaweed-Based Bioremediation**: Utilize seaweed to absorb and break down plastic pollutants in the ocean. Certain species of seaweed have been shown to have high levels of plastic-degrading enzymes, which can be harnessed to create a natural bioremediation system. This approach can be combined with traditional cleanup methods to enhance their effectiveness.",
    "**Plastic-Eating Algae**: Develop genetically engineered algae that can consume and break down plastic waste in the ocean. This algae can be designed to thrive in marine environments and can be deployed in large quantities to target specific areas of high plastic pollution. The broken-down plastic can then be absorbed by the algae, making it easier to remove from the ecosystem.",
    "**Underwater Cleanup Robots**: Design and deploy autonomous underwater robots that can collect and remove plastic waste from the ocean floor. These robots can be equipped with advanced sensors and navigation systems to target specific areas of high plastic pollution. They can also be programmed to avoid sensitive marine habitats and ecosystems.",
    "**Circular Economy-Driven Beach Cleanups**: Organize community-driven beach cleanups that focus on collecting and recycling plastic waste, rather than just disposing of it. Participants can be encouraged to collect specific types of plastic waste, such as bottles or bags, and then recycle them into new products. This approach can help create a circular economy that reduces plastic waste and promotes sustainable consumption."
