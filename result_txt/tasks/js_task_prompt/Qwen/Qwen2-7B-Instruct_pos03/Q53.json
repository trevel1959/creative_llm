    "**Gravity Flip**: This sport would involve two teams competing on a large, gravity-flipping arena where players have to switch between playing in normal gravity and experiencing artificial low gravity. The goal is to score goals by navigating through obstacles and avoiding opponents in both conditions. The unique challenge of adapting to changing gravity levels adds an element of surprise and strategy, requiring quick thinking and agility.",
    "**Airborne Evasion**: Players would be equipped with lightweight, jetpacks that they can use to soar through the air, dodging opponents while trying to catch or evade incoming projectiles. The game would combine elements of aerial combat and tactical evasion, with players needing to master the use of their jetpacks for optimal flight control and energy management.",
    "**Magnetic Marbles**: A board game where players use magnetic marbles to navigate a grid filled with obstacles, aiming to reach the end first. Each player has a set of marbles with varying magnetic strengths, allowing them to attract or repel each other and the obstacles. Strategy comes into play as players must plan their moves to avoid getting stuck behind stronger magnets or to strategically position themselves for the final push to the finish line.",
    "**Tidal Tennis**: Set up on a beach with a tennis court, this sport would involve players hitting a ball back and forth across a net, but with a twist. The tide would periodically rise and fall, affecting the distance between the players and the speed at which the ball travels. Players would need to adapt their tactics based on the current tide level, requiring a mix of skill, timing, and quick decision-making.",
    "**Temporal Tag**: Imagine a sport played across multiple time periods, from ancient to futuristic eras. Players would travel through a series of interconnected stages, each representing a different era, completing challenges that require knowledge and skills appropriate to that time. For example, in one stage, players might need to solve puzzles using ancient tools, while in another, they might use advanced technology to complete tasks. The goal is to be the first team to successfully navigate all stages and return to the starting point. This concept combines history, adventure, and teamwork in a dynamic, time-traveling experience."
