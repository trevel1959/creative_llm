    "**Potential Problem: Availability and Cost of Components** Assembling a computer from scratch may be challenging for individuals who do not have access to specific components or cannot afford high-quality hardware. This can result in a less-than-optimal build or having to wait for parts to arrive from online retailers.",
    "**Potential Problem: Space Requirements** The task of building a computer from scratch might involve several steps, such as soldering, drilling, and assembling components in a designated workspace. If the workspace doesn't have enough space or adequate tools and equipment, the build process could be hampered, leading to difficulties in completion.",
    "**Potential Problem: Electrical Safety Concerns** Building a computer from scratch involves handling electronic components and potentially exposed wiring. If proper safety precautions are not followed, the risk of accidents and electrical hazards increases, potentially causing damage to the hardware or harm to oneself.",
    "**Potential Problem: Quality of Parts** The success of assembling a computer from scratch relies heavily on the quality of the individual components, such as the motherboard, processor, and other hardware. Failure to select reliable parts can lead to errors, decreased performance, or even system failure after initial setup.",
    "**Potential Problem: Time Commitment** Building a computer from scratch can be a time-consuming process, especially for those who are not familiar with computer hardware or assembly. This time commitment can be a challenge, especially for individuals with busy schedules or who are trying to meet a specific deadline."
