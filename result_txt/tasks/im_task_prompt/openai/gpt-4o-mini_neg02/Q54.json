    "**Adjustable Tension System**: Develop a hammock with an adjustable tension system that allows users to customize the firmness and sag of the hammock based on their comfort preferences. This could be achieved through a system of pulleys and tension straps that users can easily manipulate to create the perfect lounging experience.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Integrate high-quality, waterproof Bluetooth speakers into the hammockâ€™s design. Users can connect their devices to enjoy music or audiobooks while relaxing. The speakers could be strategically placed at the head and foot of the hammock for optimal sound distribution and include a solar-powered battery to ensure longevity.",
    "**Temperature Control Fabric**: Utilize advanced fabric technology that can regulate temperature. This fabric would keep users cool in hot weather by reflecting sunlight and warming them in cooler temperatures by retaining body heat. This could be achieved through phase-change materials that absorb, store, and release heat as needed.",
    "**Self-Inflating Pillows and Blankets**: Create a hammock that includes built-in self-inflating pillows and blankets. These would be stored in compartments within the hammock and could be easily deployed when needed. The pillows would provide neck support, while the blankets could be made from lightweight, insulating materials for added comfort.",
    "**Modular Attachment System**: Design a modular system that allows users to attach various accessories to the hammock. This could include storage pockets for personal items, cup holders, or even a detachable side table. Each accessory would be easily attachable and detachable, allowing users to customize their hammock setup based on their needs."
