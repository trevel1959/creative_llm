    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Design a leash that includes a discreet compartment for waste bags, complete with a built-in dispenser. This would eliminate the need for owners to carry a separate bag holder, streamlining walks and ensuring that owners are always prepared for clean-up without fumbling around.",
    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Create a leash that can be easily adjusted in length with a simple sliding mechanism. This would allow owners to switch between a longer leash for open spaces and a shorter one for crowded areas or training sessions. The adjustment could be done with one hand, making it convenient during walks.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Incorporate reflective materials and LED lights into the leash for enhanced visibility during nighttime walks. This would help ensure the safety of both the dog and the owner by making them more visible to passing vehicles and pedestrians, reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "**Comfort Grip with Ergonomic Design**: Develop a leash with an ergonomic handle that is designed to fit comfortably in the hand, reducing strain during long walks. The grip could be made from soft, breathable materials and could even feature a slight vibration or heating function to soothe the owner's hand during extended use.",
    "**Detachable Training Handle**: Design a leash that includes a detachable secondary handle positioned closer to the collar. This would provide better control during training sessions or when encountering distractions, allowing owners to quickly regain control of their dog without having to switch leashes."
