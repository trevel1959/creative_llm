    "**Community Timekeeping**: In a community setting, people could establish a shared timekeeping system. They could agree on specific times of the day when they will meet for certain activities, such as meals or work sessions. This would help them coordinate their activities and maintain a sense of order and structure in their day.",
    "**Use of Technology**: Although watches and clocks have disappeared, technology could still be used to keep track of time. People could use smartphones or smartwatches to check the time. Alternatively, they could use voice-activated assistants like Siri or Alexa to set reminders and schedule their day.",
    "**Time-Based Activities**: People could schedule their day based on the type of activities they want to accomplish. For example, they could dedicate specific periods of the day for work, exercise, and relaxation. They could also use the changing seasons and weather patterns to plan their day.",
    "**Sense of Timelessness**: In a world without watches and clocks, people might develop a greater sense of timelessness. They could focus more on the present moment and the experiences they have, rather than constantly checking the time.",
    "**Community Clock Tower**: In some cultures, clock towers have historically been used to keep track of time. In the absence of personal timekeeping devices, communities could build and maintain clock towers to help people schedule their day."
