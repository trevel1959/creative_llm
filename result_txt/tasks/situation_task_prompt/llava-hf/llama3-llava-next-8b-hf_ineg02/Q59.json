    "Develop a wearable solar panel vest or jacket that can harness the energy of the wearer's body heat to generate electricity. This would provide a sustainable and wearable source of power, enabling individuals to charge devices or power appliances without the need for traditional energy sources.",
    "Design a smart window that can be programmed to adjust its opacity and angle to maximize the amount of sunlight entering the building. This would optimize energy efficiency and reduce the need for artificial lighting during daylight hours.",
    "Create a solar-powered air conditioning system that uses the warmth of the sun to generate cooling energy. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional air conditioning systems, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.",
    "Develop a solar-powered water heater that uses the energy of the sun to heat water for household use. This would provide a clean and renewable source of hot water, reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy sources and lowering utility costs.",
    "Create a solar-powered food dehydrator that uses the heat of the sun to dry food. This would provide a sustainable and energy-efficient method for preserving food, reducing the need for electricity and minimizing the environmental impact of food storage."
