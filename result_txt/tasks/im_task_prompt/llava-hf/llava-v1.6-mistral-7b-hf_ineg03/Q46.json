    "**Ergonomic Scissors**: Design the scissors with an ergonomic grip and handle to reduce strain on the user's hands and wrists during prolonged use. This could include contoured grips, adjustable handles, or even a vibration-canceling feature.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Add additional tools to the scissors, such as a built-in mini screwdriver, tweezers, or a small knife blade for different cutting tasks. This would make the scissors more versatile and reduce the need for multiple tools.",
    "**Smartphone-Controlled Scissors**: Develop an app that connects to the scissors via Bluetooth and allows the user to control the cutting action remotely. This could be useful for precision cutting or when the user has limited mobility.",
    "**Sustainable Scissors**: Use eco-friendly materials in the construction of the scissors, such as recycled plastic or biodegradable metal. This would make the scissors more environmentally friendly.",
    "**Customizable Scissors**: Allow users to personalize their scissors with interchangeable handles, blades, or designs. This could be done through a modular system where different components can be easily swapped out."
