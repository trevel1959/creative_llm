    "Token-based commerce: If money disappears, people might use unique tokens, such as digital or physical tokens, to trade. These tokens could represent goods, services, or resources, and could be linked to specific industries or sectors. This would require the development of new protocols and platforms to manage and exchange the tokens, but it could offer a new way to trade without relying on traditional money.",
    "Resource credit banking: Another possibility is the use of resource credit banking, where individuals and organizations could be credited with points or credits based on their resources, skills or labor. These points could then be used to purchase goods and services from other individuals and organizations, eliminating the need for traditional currency. This would require a new system for tracking and managing resource credits, but it could offer a more sustainable way to trade without money.",
    "Local exchange systems: If all currency disappears, a decentralized exchange system could be established based on local resources. For example, one individual or organization might exchange fish for vegetables, or one might exchange entertainment for maintenance services. This way, goods and services would be traded based on the value of the resources that are available in each community, and it might lead to more sustainable and local economies.",
    "Time-based currency: A time-based currency could be another option for trading after the loss of traditional money. This would involve people or organizations offering their time and labor for trades or exchanges. These exchanges could be for goods, services or resources, and could help establish a more equitable and sustainable trading system. However, this would require a new system for organizing and tracking time-based credits.",
    "Skill-based currency: Another option for trading without money could be a skill-based currency, where people or organizations are awarded credits based on their skills and abilities. These credits could then be exchanged for goods and services, and this would encourage people to develop new skills and improve their abilities. This would require a new system for matching skills with needs, but it could offer a more equitable and efficient way to trade without the need for traditional currency."
