    "**Radiation Exposure**: Space is filled with harmful cosmic radiation that can affect both the crew and the spacecraft's electronics. Designing adequate shielding is essential, which can add weight and complexity to the spacecraft. Innovative materials like polyethylene or water-based shielding could be explored, and strategic design choices, such as using certain areas of the ship as radiation shelters during solar events, should be incorporated.",
    "**Structural Integrity Under Stress**: The spacecraft will experience various stresses during launch, space travel, and re-entry. Designing for structural integrity is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. This can involve using advanced materials like carbon fiber composites and conducting extensive simulations to predict how the structure will respond to different stresses and vibrations.",
    "**Resource Management**: Long-duration missions require efficient resource management, including food, water, and energy. The design should include systems for recycling water and waste, as well as hydroponic gardens for food production. Implementing smart resource management software that tracks usage and suggests optimal resource allocation could help ensure sustainability.",
    "**Crew Dynamics and Mental Health**: Long missions in confined spaces can lead to psychological stress and interpersonal conflicts among crew members. Designing the spaceship with communal spaces, private quarters, and areas for recreation can help maintain morale. Regular psychological assessments and the inclusion of virtual reality environments for relaxation and recreation can also support mental health.",
    "**Communication Delays**: In deep space missions, communication with Earth can experience significant delays. This can complicate decision-making processes in emergencies. To mitigate this, the spaceship could be equipped with advanced AI systems that can make autonomous decisions based on pre-programmed protocols. Crew training in crisis management and emergency protocols would also be essential."
