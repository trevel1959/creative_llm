    "**Innovative Surfboard Design for Enhanced Maneuverability**:    - **Idea**: Create a surfboard with a modular design where the tail section can be adjusted or swapped out according to the surfer's preference and the conditions of the waves. This could include different levels of curvature, thickness, and volume to cater to various surfing styles (e.g., longboarding, shortboarding, wave sliding).",
    "**Solar-Powered Surfboards for Sustainable Surfing**:    - **Idea**: Develop surfboards equipped with solar panels that can charge an onboard battery, providing power for devices like waterproof speakers, lights, or even small electric propulsion systems to aid in returning to shore against the current.",
    "**Interactive Surfboard Feedback System**:    - **Idea**: Design surfboards with embedded sensors that provide real-time feedback to the surfer about their performance. This could include metrics such as speed, balance, wave catch angles, and rotation, displayed on a wearable device or smartphone app.",
    "**Inflatable Surfboards for Eco-Friendly Travel**:    - **Idea**: Create lightweight, inflatable surfboards that are compact for easy transport and storage. These boards can be made from eco-friendly materials, such as biodegradable foam cores and plant-based fabrics, reducing their environmental footprint.",
    "**Customizable, 3D-Printed Surfboards**:    - **Idea**: Offer a service where customers can design and customize their surfboards using 3D modeling software. The designs are then printed on-site using advanced materials, allowing for precise control over dimensions, shapes"
