    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses with Biodegradable Frames**: To address environmental concerns, sunglasses could be made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or plant-based composites. These frames would not only reduce plastic waste but also offer a unique aesthetic appeal. Additionally, a recycling program could be established, allowing customers to return old pairs for proper disposal or recycling.",
    "**Personalized Lens Tinting Technology**: Instead of standard lens colors, imagine sunglasses that allow users to customize the tint of their lenses on-demand. Utilizing a small electronic mechanism, users could adjust the tint intensity or switch between different colors based on lighting conditions or personal preference. This feature would be especially useful for athletes or outdoor enthusiasts who experience varying light environments.",
    "**Built-in UV and Light Sensors**: Sunglasses could be enhanced with sensors that detect UV levels and ambient light intensity. When harmful UV rays are detected, the sunglasses could provide alerts to the wearer through vibrations or notifications. This feature would help users protect their eyes more effectively, especially during outdoor activities when they may forget to reapply sunscreen or seek shade.",
    "**Foldable and Compact Design**: To improve portability, sunglasses could be designed to fold into a compact size without compromising style or durability. Using flexible materials and innovative hinge designs, these sunglasses could easily fit into pockets or small bags, making them convenient for travelers and everyday users. They could also come with a stylish carrying case that doubles as a cleaning cloth.",
    "**Integrated Bluetooth Audio**: Sunglasses could feature built-in Bluetooth speakers that allow users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for additional headphones. The speakers would be discreetly embedded in the frames, providing a comfortable fit while ensuring sound quality. This feature would be perfect for outdoor activities, allowing users to enjoy music or podcasts while staying aware of their surroundings."
