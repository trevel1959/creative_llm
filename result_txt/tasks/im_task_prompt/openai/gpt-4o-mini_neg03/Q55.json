    "**Interchangeable Nib System**: Design a fountain pen with a modular nib system that allows users to easily switch between different nib sizes and materials (e.g., gold, steel, stub, flex). This could be done with a simple twist-lock mechanism. Writers could customize their writing experience based on their mood or the type of writing they are doing, whether it be calligraphy, journaling, or sketching.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Ink Cartridges**: Create refillable ink cartridges made from biodegradable materials. Additionally, offer a variety of eco-friendly inks that are non-toxic and made from natural dyes. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainable writing practices.",
    "**Built-in Ink Mixer**: Incorporate a small, battery-operated ink mixer within the pen that allows users to blend different ink colors directly inside the cartridge. This feature would enable users to create unique shades and gradients on the go, fostering creativity and personalization in their writing.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Develop a fountain pen with a customizable ergonomic grip that can be adjusted for different hand sizes and writing styles. This could involve interchangeable grip sections made from various materials (like silicone, rubber, or cork) that provide comfort and reduce hand fatigue during long writing sessions.",
    "**Integrated Digital Notetaking**: Combine the traditional fountain pen with digital technology by adding a small sensor that captures handwritten notes and transfers them to a connected app on a smartphone or tablet. This feature would allow users to keep a digital record of their notes while enjoying the tactile experience of writing with a fountain pen."
