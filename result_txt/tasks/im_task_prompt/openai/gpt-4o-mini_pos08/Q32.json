    "**Smart Mobile Integration**: Create a printer that seamlessly integrates with mobile devices through an app that not only allows printing but also includes features like document scanning, editing, and organizing. Users could take a picture of a document, make edits on their mobile device, and print directly from the app. The app could also provide printing statistics, reminding users when they are running low on ink or paper, and suggest eco-friendly printing options.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Introduce voice-activated functionality that allows users to command the printer using smart assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Users could say things like \"Print my shopping list\" or \"Print the recipe for lasagna,\" and the printer would respond accordingly. This feature would make printing more accessible, especially for those with mobility issues or when hands are busy.",
    "**Modular Printer Design**: Design a modular printer that allows users to upgrade specific components without having to replace the entire unit. For instance, users could swap out the ink cartridge system for a more efficient one or upgrade the printing head for higher resolution. This not only extends the life of the printer but also reduces electronic waste, making it a more sustainable option.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Printing**: Incorporate AR technology into the printer experience. Users could scan a QR code on a printed document with their smartphone, which would then overlay digital content related to the document. For example, a printed educational poster could come to life with videos or animations when viewed through an AR app, enhancing the learning experience and making printed materials more interactive.",
    "**Built-in Document Organizer**: Equip the printer with a built-in scanner and organizer that automatically categorizes scanned documents into folders on a connected cloud service. Users could scan receipts, contracts, or important documents, and the printer would use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to identify and sort them. This feature would help users manage their documents more efficiently and reduce clutter."
