    "Unscientific Design: Another potential problem in designing a spaceship is the unscientific approach. It is crucial to have a deep understanding of the principles of physics and engineering, as well as to be knowledgeable about the latest research in the field. If the design team doesn't have the right knowledge and experience, they may make decisions that could lead to problems during the space travel, such as the ship not being able to withstand high levels of radiation, temperature changes or other cosmic factors.",
    "Reusability: The design of the spaceship must be able to accommodate the needs of reusable space transportation. The spaceship must be easy to assemble, disassemble, and maintain. If it's not reusable, it could lead to significant costs and waste of resources. For instance, if the spaceship is not designed with reusability in mind, it may require constant upgrades and maintenance, making it expensive and inefficient.",
    "Safety and Reliability: The most vital aspect of the design is safety and reliability. It should be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space travel and able to function without major malfunctions. The design must be able to ensure the crew's safety and the ship's ability to perform its intended tasks. If it doesn't meet these requirements, it could lead to disasters and the loss of life.",
    "Human Factors: The design should take into consideration the human factors that will be present during the spaceship travel. For instance, it has to consider factors such as ergonomics, lighting, temperature control, and atmospheric pressure, to ensure the comfort and well-being of the crew during their journey. If the design fails to take these factors into account, it could lead to discomfort, fatigue, and other health issues among the crew.",
    "Environmental Impact: The design of the spaceship must also take into consideration the environmental impact of its construction, operation, and disposal. The ship must be designed in such a way that it doesn't contribute to any harm to the environment, such as polluting space or harming other celestial bodies. If it does, it could lead to a lot of problems and even a ban on space travel for a while."
