    "Light-emitting materials: Scientists could develop light-emitting materials that can generate light through chemical reactions. These materials could be integrated into buildings, streetlights, or even personal devices to provide illumination even when sunlight is scarce.",
    "Artificial satellite sunlight: Satellites could be equipped with solar panels that capture sunlight from the sun, even when it's not visible from the Earth's surface. These satellites could then beam the sunlight down to Earth, providing a continuous source of sunlight regardless of the cloud cover.",
    "Underground tunnels with skylights: To create an environment with plenty of natural light, underground tunnels could be constructed with large skylights at the surface. These skylights would allow sunlight to enter the tunnels, providing a well-lit space for people to work, play, and live.",
    "Artificial suns: Engineers could create artificial suns that can replicate the sunlight's effects on Earth. These artificial suns could be powered by nuclear reactors or other energy sources and emit light and heat similar to the sun.",
    "Advanced window coatings: Scientists could develop advanced window coatings that can generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. These coatings could be applied to windows in buildings, allowing them to harness the sunlight and convert it into electricity, even when the sky is cloudy."
