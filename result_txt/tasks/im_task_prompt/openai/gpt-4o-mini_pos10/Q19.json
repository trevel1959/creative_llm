    "**Adaptive Tint Technology**: Incorporate photochromic technology that allows the lenses to automatically adjust their tint based on lighting conditions. For example, the lenses could darken in bright sunlight to protect the eyes and become clear indoors. This feature could be further enhanced with customizable settings via a smartphone app, allowing users to select their preferred tint levels for different environments.",
    "**Personalized Frame Fit**: Create glasses with a customizable frame fit that can adapt to the wearer’s facial structure. Using advanced 3D scanning technology, users could scan their faces and receive frames that are tailored to their unique measurements. Additionally, frames could be designed with adjustable components (like temples and nose pads) that can be fine-tuned for maximum comfort throughout the day.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Design glasses that incorporate health-monitoring sensors capable of tracking vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, and even blood oxygen levels. This data could be displayed on a small screen on the side of the frame or synced with a smartphone app. The glasses could also provide reminders for hydration, exercise, or medication based on the user’s health metrics.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**: Innovate lenses that utilize a hydrophobic and oleophobic coating to repel water, dirt, and smudges. This technology could keep the lenses cleaner for longer periods, reducing the need for frequent cleaning. Additionally, a built-in UV light could help sterilize the lenses periodically, ensuring they remain hygienic and clear.",
    "**Integrated Audio Technology**: Create glasses that feature bone conduction speakers embedded in the frame. This technology would allow users to listen to music, podcasts, or take phone calls without needing additional headphones. The sound would be transmitted through the bones of the skull, keeping the ears free and aware of their surroundings while enjoying audio content."
