    "**Inadequate Financial Planning**: Brewing beer requires significant upfront costs for equipment, ingredients, and licensing. Not having a solid financial plan in place can lead to cash flow problems, making it difficult to pay bills, invest in marketing, or cover unexpected expenses like repairs or legal fees. Poor financial management can jeopardize the brewery's survival.",
    "**Quality Control Issues**: Maintaining consistent quality across batches is essential for customer satisfaction and loyalty. Without strict quality control measures, customers might experience inconsistent flavors or alcohol content, leading to dissatisfaction and potentially negative reviews. This could deter new customers and damage the brewery's reputation.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: Dependence on suppliers for ingredients such as hops, grains, and yeast can create vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Natural disasters, economic fluctuations, or supplier errors can disrupt the delivery of necessary materials, causing delays in production and increased costs. Managing a resilient supply chain is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency.",
    "**Compliance with Regulations**: Brewing beer involves navigating complex local, state, and federal regulations related to production, labeling, packaging, and distribution. Non-compliance can result in fines, legal penalties, and reputational damage. Regularly updating knowledge of the regulatory landscape and investing in compliance training are necessary to avoid these issues.",
    "**Employee Management and Training**: Hiring and retaining skilled staff, including brewers, cellar workers, and front-of-house personnel, can be challenging. Ensuring they receive adequate training and support is crucial for maintaining high-quality products and providing excellent customer service. Neglecting employee development can lead to high turnover rates, impacting productivity and morale."
