    "Create a giraffe-themed amusement park with a twist: Instead of the typical giraffe-watching exhibits, the park features rides and attractions that allow visitors to experience what it's like to have a short neck. For example, a rollercoaster with a steep drop that simulates the sensation of bending down to reach a low-hanging branch, or a virtual reality experience that makes visitors feel like they're navigating a world where their neck is too short. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Develop a line of giraffe-inspired fashion accessories: Create a collection of clothing and accessories that incorporate the colors and patterns of giraffes, but with a twist. For example, a scarf with a giraffe print, but instead of the usual spots, the pattern is made up of tiny mirrors that reflect the wearer's surroundings. Or a pair of earrings shaped like giraffe hooves, but made from a lightweight, flexible material that can be bent and twisted. Confidence score: 0.7",

For example, a dish called \"Neck Bones\" (beef short ribs), or \"Tall-ulent\" (a towering dessert made with layers of cake, frosting, and fruit). Decorate the table with giraffe-inspired centerpieces and serve the meal on dishes shaped like giraffe hooves. Confidence score: 0.6",
