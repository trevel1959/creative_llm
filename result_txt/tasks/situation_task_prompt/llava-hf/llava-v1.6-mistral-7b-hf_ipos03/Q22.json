    "**Flying Cars**: Another option could be the widespread use of flying cars, which would allow people to travel over the city without the need for roads. This would require the development of a robust air traffic control system to ensure safe and efficient flight paths, as well as the necessary infrastructure for take-off and landing.",
    "**Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure**: With the loss of roads, the town or city could focus on developing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, such as wider sidewalks, bike lanes, and pedestrian bridges. This would encourage more people to walk or cycle, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.",
    "**Underground Tunnels**: To maintain a connection between different parts of the town or city, underground tunnels could be built. These tunnels would provide a reliable mode of transport, allowing people to travel between locations without the need for roads or other infrastructure.",
    "**Water-Based Transportation**: In areas with a significant amount of water, such as canals or rivers, the town or city could develop water-based transportation systems, such as water taxis or water buses. This would provide a unique and efficient way to travel around the city, particularly in areas where roads are not feasible.",
    "**Green Spaces**: The town or city could invest in creating more green spaces, such as parks and gardens, to provide recreational areas and improve air quality. This would also help to create a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban environment."
