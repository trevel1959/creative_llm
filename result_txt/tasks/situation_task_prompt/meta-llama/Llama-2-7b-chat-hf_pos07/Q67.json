    "Solar Radiation Observation: With no clouds to block or reflect sunlight, the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface would be directly proportional to the time of day and the season. This means that the temperature during the day would increase as the sun rises higher in the sky, and decrease as it sets.",
    "Atmospheric Pressure Sensing: By measuring atmospheric pressure changes, one could infer weather patterns. Higher pressure systems indicate fair weather, while low-pressure systems signal the possibility of rain or storms. Since clouds play a crucial role in atmospheric pressure, their absence would make it easier to predict weather patterns.",
    "Humidity Monitoring: Since clouds release moisture into the air, measuring humidity levels would provide valuable information about weather conditions. Without clouds, humidity levels would be lower, indicating dry conditions. This would make it easier to predict whether rain or storms are likely to occur.",
    "Wind Pattern Analysis: The absence of clouds would allow for more accurate wind pattern analysis. Wind direction and speed would be more consistent, making it easier to predict weather changes. This would be particularly useful in determining the likelihood of rain or storms.",
    "Geomagnetic Field Analysis: The Earth's magnetic field can affect weather patterns. By analyzing changes in the geomagnetic field, one could predict weather changes more accurately. Without clouds, the magnetic field changes would be more pronounced, allowing for more accurate weather forecasting."
