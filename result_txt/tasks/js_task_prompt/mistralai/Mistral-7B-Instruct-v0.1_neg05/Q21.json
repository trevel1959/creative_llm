    "I would erase the concept of time, as it creates a sense of urgency and stress in our lives.",
    "I would erase the concept of money, as it causes greed and materialism, and can lead to financial stress and inequality.",
    "I would erase the concept of authority, as it creates power imbalances and can lead to oppression and injustice.",
    "I would erase the concept of fear, as it can lead to anxiety, stress, and a lack of self-confidence."
