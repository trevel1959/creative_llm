    "**Hammock with Integrated Solar Charging**: Design a hammock with built-in solar panels on the fabric or attached as a canopy. This would allow users to charge their devices while relaxing outdoors. The solar charging system could power USB ports, enabling users to charge their phones, tablets, or other devices, making it perfect for camping trips or beach days.",
    "**Modular Hammock System**: Create a modular hammock that can be customized for different environments and activities. Users could add or remove sections to adjust the length or shape of the hammock. Accessories like mosquito nets, sunshades, or storage pockets could be attached via zippers or Velcro, allowing for a personalized experience based on the user's needs.",
    "**Hammock with Built-in Speakers and Ambient Lighting**: Incorporate Bluetooth speakers and LED ambient lights into the hammock design. The speakers could provide soothing nature sounds or music, while the lights could change colors to match the time of day or user preferences. This would create a serene atmosphere for relaxation, stargazing, or even a cozy outdoor movie night.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hammock from Recycled Materials**: Develop a hammock made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or old fabric. This would not only promote sustainability but also create unique patterns and textures. Additionally, the hammock could come with a planting kit, encouraging users to plant trees or shrubs in their local area for every hammock sold.",
    "**Hammock with Adjustable Height and Angle**: Design a hammock that allows users to adjust the height and angle of the fabric. This could be achieved through a pulley system or adjustable straps, giving users the ability to find their perfect lounging position. Whether they prefer to lie flat or at an incline, this feature would enhance comfort and usability."
