    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Viewfinder**: Integrate an AR viewfinder that overlays real-time information and suggestions onto the camera's display. This could include grid lines for composition, exposure levels, and even creative suggestions based on the scene, such as \"Try a low angle shot\" or \"Capture the reflection in the water.\" This feature would enhance the user experience by guiding photographers in making creative decisions.",
    "**Dynamic Image Stabilization**: Introduce a camera with advanced dynamic image stabilization that uses gyroscopic sensors and AI to predict and counteract movements. This would allow for smoother video recording and clearer photos, especially in challenging environments like while walking or in low light. The camera could also offer different stabilization modes tailored for various activities, such as sports or travel.",
    "**Customizable Smart Modes**: Create a camera that allows users to customize shooting modes based on their preferences and shooting style. Users could create presets for different scenarios (like night photography, landscape, or street photography) that adjust all settings—ISO, aperture, shutter speed—automatically. This would empower photographers to focus more on their creative vision rather than technical settings.",
    "**Integrated Social Sharing Platform**: Develop a camera with built-in social media capabilities, allowing users to edit and share photos directly from the camera. This could include basic editing tools, filters, and the ability to tag locations or people before uploading to platforms like Instagram or Facebook. This feature would streamline the sharing process, making it easier for users to connect with their audience instantly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Design a camera using sustainable materials and energy-efficient components. The camera could be powered by solar panels or kinetic energy generated from movement. Additionally, a recycling program could be established where users can send back old cameras for refurbishment or recycling, promoting environmental responsibility within the photography community."
