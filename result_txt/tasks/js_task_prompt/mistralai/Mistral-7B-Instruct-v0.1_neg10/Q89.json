    "The language could be a language of emotions, where words are based on emotions and feelings. For example, the word \"happy\" could be \"joy\" and the word \"sad\" could be \"sorrow.\"",
    "The language could be a language of actions, where words are based on actions and movements. For example, the word \"run\" could be \"jog\" and the word \"jump\" could be \"leap.\""
