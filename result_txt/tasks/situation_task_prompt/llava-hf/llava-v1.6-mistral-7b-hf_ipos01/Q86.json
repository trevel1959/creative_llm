    "**Plant-based Sanitizing Solution**: Another idea could be a plant-based sanitizing solution. Certain plants are known to have antibacterial properties, and extracting these properties could lead to a natural, eco-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to soap. This could be used to create a sanitizing gel or foam that could be applied to hands or surfaces.",
    "**Smartphone-based Sanitizing App**: A smartphone-based sanitizing app could be developed that uses the phone's camera to detect dirt and grime on surfaces and hands. The app could then guide the user through a sanitizing process using the phone's speaker and flashlight. This could be particularly useful in public spaces where soap is scarce.",
    "**Nano-tech Sanitizing Wipes**: Nanotechnology could be used to create self-sanitizing wipes that could be used to clean hands, surfaces, and clothes. These wipes could be infused with nano-particles that could detect and destroy germs and bacteria, providing a quick and convenient solution in the absence of soap.",
    "**Electrolyzed Water Sanitizing System**: An electrolyzed water sanitizing system could be set up in public spaces, allowing people to wash their hands using electrolyzed water. Electrolyzed water is known to have powerful sanitizing properties and is safe for the environment.",
    "**Community-based Sanitizing Stations**: In areas where soap is scarce, community-based sanitizing stations could be set up. These stations could be equipped with solar-powered sanitizing dispensers, handwashing stations with clean water, and a place for people to sanitize their hands before entering a building or public space."
