This would enable humans to better understand and interact with robots, fostering a more harmonious relationship.",
    "Emotional Resilience and Adaptation: With the capacity to experience emotions, robots could develop emotional resilience and adaptability, enabling them to better handle challenging situations and respond to changing emotional dynamics. This would lead to more robust and reliable robots in various applications.",
    "Ethical Considerations: As robots become more emotionally intelligent, there would arise new ethical considerations, such as ensuring that robots are not exploited or manipulated for their emotional capabilities. Developers and users must consider the potential consequences of creating emotionally intelligent robots and ensure their use aligns with ethical principles."
