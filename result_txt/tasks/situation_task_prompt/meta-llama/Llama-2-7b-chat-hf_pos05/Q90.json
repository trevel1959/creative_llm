    "Build a rainwater harvesting system: One solution would be to build a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for various uses. This system could include a roof-based collection system, where the rainwater is collected and directed into a storage tank. The water can then be used for irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable purposes.",
    "Use a solar-powered water still: Another option would be to use a solar-powered water still, which uses the heat of the sun to evaporate water from a source, such as seawater or contaminated water. The evaporated water can then be collected and condensed, providing a clean and reliable source of water.",
    "Create a fog collection system: In areas where fog is prevalent, a fog collection system can be used to collect water from the atmosphere. This system involves a network of nets or mesh that are placed in areas where fog is most common, such as near coastal areas or in mountainous regions. The fog is collected on the nets and then directed into a storage tank for use.",
    "Develop a water-absorbing material: Scientists have developed materials that can absorb and retain water, providing a potential solution for water collection in areas where rain is scarce. These materials, known as super-absorbent polymers, can be placed in the ground or in a container to collect water, which can then be released as needed.",
    "Use a water-collecting drone: In areas where access to water is limited, a water-collecting drone could be used to collect water from remote locations. The drone would be equipped with a water collection system, such as a net or a tank, and would be able to fly over areas where water is available, such as lakes, rivers, or wetlands. The collected water could then be transported to areas of need."
