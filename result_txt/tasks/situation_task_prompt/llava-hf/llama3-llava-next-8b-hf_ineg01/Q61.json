    "Utilizing a drone: A small, lightweight drone could be programmed to fly between flowers and transfer pollen using a specially designed pollination module. The drone could be equipped with sensors to detect the location of the stigmas and move the pollen accordingly.",
    "Pollination robots: Small robots could be designed to move between flowers and transfer pollen using a small, precision tool. These robots could be equipped with sensors to detect the location of the stigmas and adjust their position accordingly.",
    "Using a small, remote-controlled vehicle: A small, remote-controlled vehicle could be designed to move between flowers and transfer pollen using a small, precision tool. The vehicle could be equipped with sensors to detect the location of the stigmas and adjust its position accordingly.",
    "Pollination using a handheld device: A handheld device could be designed that allows gardeners to transfer pollen between flowers. The device would have a small compartment to hold the pollen and a nozzle to direct it onto the stigma of the receiving flower.",
    "Using a pollination module: A small, portable module could be designed that contains the necessary tools and materials for pollination. The module could be taken to the plants and used to transfer pollen using a small, precision tool."
