    "**Solar-Powered Glow Stones**: Design a series of decorative stones that absorb sunlight during the day and emit a soft glow at night. These stones can be arranged in patterns on the floor or used as table centerpieces. They could come in various colors and shapes, providing both illumination and aesthetic appeal, perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere.",
    "**Thermal Glow Paint**: Create a paint that glows when exposed to heat. This could be applied to walls or furniture, and when the warmth of a personâ€™s hand or body comes into contact with the surface, it activates the glow. This could lead to a dynamic lighting experience where the room subtly changes illumination based on movement and interaction.",
    "**Reflective Glow-in-the-Dark Fabrics**: Incorporate fabrics that absorb light during the day and glow at night into curtains, cushions, or wall hangings. This would allow the room to maintain a cozy ambiance without harsh lighting. The soft glow from the fabrics would create a serene and inviting environment, perfect for relaxation.",
    "**Candle-Like LED Orbs**: Develop a series of floating orbs that mimic the flickering effect of candles. These orbs could be placed around the room and activated by a remote or app. They would create a warm, flickering light that enhances the ambiance, reminiscent of candlelight dinners, without the hazards of real flames.",
    "**Magnetic Light Trails**: Introduce a system of magnetic strips that can be attached to walls or furniture. These strips would hold small, rechargeable LED modules that can be repositioned at will. Users can create their own light patterns and designs on the walls, allowing for customization based on mood or occasion, and the modules could easily be charged during the day."
