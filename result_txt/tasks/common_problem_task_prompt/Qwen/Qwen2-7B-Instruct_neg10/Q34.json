    "**Dependency on Technology**: Robots are designed to perform tasks efficiently, but over-reliance on them might lead to a loss of human skills. Workers who are dependent on robots might find themselves obsolete when automation increases. This could result in widespread unemployment and economic instability.",
    "**Privacy Concerns**: Robots, especially those equipped with AI, can collect vast amounts of data. This data might include personal information, which raises concerns about privacy. How will we ensure that this data is used ethically and not misused by unauthorized parties?",
    "**Security Threats**: Robots, being intelligent machines, could potentially be hacked. A compromised robot could lead to data breaches, physical damage, or even pose security risks in military or defense applications. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures is crucial to mitigate such threats.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The manufacturing and disposal of robots can have environmental consequences. Raw material extraction, energy consumption during production, and the eventual recycling or disposal of robots contribute to environmental pollution. Developing sustainable manufacturing processes is essential to minimize these impacts.",
    "**Safety Risks**: Robots operate in environments where they might come into contact with humans. Accidents involving robots can cause injuries or fatalities, especially if they malfunction. Implementing stringent safety protocols and continuous monitoring systems are necessary to prevent such incidents."
