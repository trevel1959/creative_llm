    "**Multi-Function Spatula with Built-in Timer**: Design a spatula that includes a digital timer on its handle. This would allow cooks to set cooking times for different food items directly on the spatula, eliminating the need for a separate timer. The timer could feature an audible alarm and a vibration alert to remind the user when to flip or remove food from the heat, making cooking more efficient and less stressful.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Adjustable Handle**: Create a spatula with an adjustable handle that can be customized for different grip sizes and angles. This would enhance comfort and reduce wrist strain, particularly for those with arthritis or limited mobility. The handle could also feature a non-slip grip and be made from materials that are easy to clean, ensuring both functionality and hygiene.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Recipe Guide**: Incorporate a small, waterproof digital screen on the spatula handle that displays recipes and cooking instructions. This would allow users to follow recipes step-by-step without needing to reference a separate device. The spatula could also have voice command capabilities, enabling hands-free operation for added convenience while cooking.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Develop a spatula with a self-cleaning feature using UV-C light technology. After cooking, the user could place the spatula in a designated cleaning station that uses UV light to sanitize the surface, killing bacteria and food particles. This would not only save time on cleaning but also promote food safety in the kitchen.",
    "**Interchangeable Head Spatula**: Design a spatula with interchangeable heads that can be swapped out depending on the cooking task. Different heads could be designed for flipping, spreading, or scraping, allowing users to have a single spatula that serves multiple purposes. The heads could be made from various materials (silicone, metal, etc.) to accommodate different cooking surfaces and food types."
