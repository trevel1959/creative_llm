    "**Vocal Instrumentation**: Using the human voice as a primary instrument, create a wide range of sounds and timbres by experimenting with different vocal techniques, such as: \t* Vocal percussion: Create rhythmic patterns using mouth sounds, tongue clicks, and other articulations.",
    "**Environmental Instrumentation**: Harness the sounds of nature and urban environments to create music. This could involve: \t* Field recordings: Capture and manipulate sounds from various ecosystems, such as rainforests, oceans, or city streets.",
    "**Body Percussion**: Explore the human body as a percussive instrument, using: \t* Body slapping: Create rhythmic patterns by slapping different parts of the body, such as the arms, legs, or torso.",
    "**Theremin-like Instruments**: Develop novel instruments that utilize electromagnetic fields or other technologies to create sound. For example: \t* Electro-magnetic field instruments: Design instruments that respond to electromagnetic fields, allowing players to control pitch and volume.",
    "**Mathematical Music**: Focus on the mathematical structures underlying music, using algorithms and computational methods to generate sound. This could involve: \t* Algorithmic composition: Use mathematical formulas to generate musical patterns, such as fractals or geometric shapes."
