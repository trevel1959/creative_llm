    "Create a virtual assistant that can take voice commands and turn them into physical Post-it Notes. Users can say things like \"remind me to call John at 2pm tomorrow\" and the virtual assistant will write a Post-it Note on their calendar with the reminder.",
    "Develop a mobile app that allows users to take photos of their notes and turn them into digital versions. This would make it easy to search through notes and find specific information, and users could also share their notes with others through the app.",
    "Create a Post-it Note printer that can print notes in any color or pattern. This would allow users to personalize their notes and make them more visually appealing.",
    "Create a Post-it Note holder that can be attached to any surface, such as a wall or door. This would make it easier for users to keep their notes organized and accessible.",
    "Develop a Post-it Note app that allows users to collaborate on notes with others in real-time. This would make it easier for teams to work together on projects and share ideas."
