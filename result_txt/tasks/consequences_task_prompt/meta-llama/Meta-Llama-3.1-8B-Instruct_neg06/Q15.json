    "**Eco-Cities of the Future**: Imagine a world where cities are designed to thrive without oil. Buildings are constructed with sustainable materials, and energy is generated through renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Transportation is transformed with electric and self-driving vehicles, reducing emissions and increasing efficiency. In this future, cities become hubs for innovation, sustainability, and community-driven initiatives.",
    "**Global Cooperation and R&D**: In a world without oil, nations would be forced to collaborate and share knowledge to develop alternative energy sources. This would lead to a surge in scientific research, breakthroughs, and innovation. Governments, corporations, and individuals would work together to create new technologies, such as advanced nuclear power, fusion energy, or even harnessing the power of the sun and the ocean.",
    "**Post-Scarcity Economy**: With the depletion of oil, traditional economic models would be turned upside down. Resources would become abundant, and the concept of scarcity would be redefined. People would focus on creative pursuits, personal growth, and community development, rather than competing for limited resources. This would lead to a more equitable society, where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.",
    "**Renaissance of Local Communities**: In a world without oil, local communities would experience a resurgence. People would focus on building strong, self-sufficient neighborhoods, where they could grow their own food, generate their own energy, and develop local economies. This would lead to a more connected, resilient, and vibrant society, where people prioritize relationships and community over material wealth.",
    "**The Great Migration**: As oil becomes scarce, people would be forced to adapt and migrate to areas with more abundant resources. This would lead to a massive shift in population, with people moving from urban centers to rural areas or to regions with more favorable climates. This migration would bring about new cultural exchanges, economic opportunities, and a redefinition of what it means to live in a community."
