    "Establish a Community Health Network: A network of community health volunteers would be formed to support each other in maintaining health. These volunteers would share knowledge, provide emotional support, and collaborate on solutions to health-related challenges.",
    "Foster a Culture of Prevention: Encourage a culture of prevention, where individuals take responsibility for their health. This could involve regular exercise, healthy eating habits, stress management techniques, and maintaining a clean and hygienic environment.",
    "Create a Health and Wellness App: Develop a user-friendly app that provides access to health-related information, self-care resources, and community support. The app could include a symptom checker, a medication guide, and a directory of local resources for health and wellness.",
    "Invest in Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring: While medical facilities may be gone, telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies can still be utilized to access medical advice and track vital signs. This would require a network of trained volunteers to monitor and report health data to a central hub.",
    "Build a Health Insurance Cooperative: In the absence of medical facilities, a cooperative health insurance model could be established. Members would contribute to a shared fund to cover health expenses, and a network of volunteers would be trained to provide support and guidance."
