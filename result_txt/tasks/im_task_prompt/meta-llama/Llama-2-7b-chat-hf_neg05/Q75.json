    "AI-Powered Smart Sandwich Toaster: Create a smart sandwich toaster that uses artificial intelligence to detect the type of bread and filling placed inside, and automatically adjusts the toasting time and temperature accordingly. This toaster could also use image recognition to detect the presence of specific toppings, such as cheese or meats, and adjust the toasting time and temperature accordingly.",
    "Augmented Reality Sandwich Building: Develop an AR-enabled sandwich building experience that allows users to see a virtual representation of their sandwich as they build it. Users can select from a variety of breads, fillings, and toppings, and the AR display will show the final product before they even take a bite. This could be especially useful for people who are trying new sandwich combinations or want to experiment with different ingredients.",
    "Personalized Sandwich Recommendations: Create a sandwich toaster that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend personalized sandwich combinations based on the user's preferences and dietary needs. The toaster could analyze the user's past sandwich choices and suggest new combinations that they might enjoy. This could be especially helpful for people who are trying to eat healthier or have specific dietary restrictions.",
    "Smart Sandwich Slicer: Design a smart sandwich slicer that uses sensors and AI to detect the thickness and type of bread, and automatically adjusts the slicing speed and blade angle to ensure perfectly even slices every time. This could be especially useful for people who make sandwiches regularly, such as for a lunch business or catering service.",
    "Sandwich-Making Game: Create a sandwich-making game that challenges players to create the perfect sandwich within a set time limit. Players can choose from different breads, fillings, and toppings, and must carefully balance the ingredients to create a sandwich that meets the game's requirements. The game could be a fun and interactive way to learn about different sandwich combinations and develop sandwich-making skills."
