    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: One possible solution to power vehicles without oil is through hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen can be extracted from various sources such as water, biomass, or even air using electrolysis. The hydrogen can then be used to generate electricity in a fuel cell, which can power electric vehicles. This method produces only water and heat as byproducts, making it a clean and efficient source of energy.",
    "Solar Power: Another option is to harness the power of the sun to generate electricity. Solar panels can be installed on vehicles, homes, or even roads to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This can be stored in batteries or used directly to power electric vehicles. Solar power is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power can also be used to generate electricity without oil. Nuclear reactors can be designed to produce electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions, making them a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. Additionally, nuclear power can be used to produce hydrogen through electrolysis, which can then be used as a fuel source for vehicles.",
    "Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure: A more practical solution to power vehicles without oil is to invest in a comprehensive electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This can include setting up charging stations in homes, public spaces, and along highways. By providing easy access to charging stations, people can easily switch to electric vehicles without worrying about running out of charge on the go.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are another alternative to oil that can be used to power vehicles. These are fuels made from organic matter such as plants, algae, or even agricultural waste. Biofuels can be produced through various methods such as fermentation, gasification, or anaerobic digestion. They can be used in conventional internal combustion engines or in specialized engines designed to run on biofuels. Biofuels offer a sustainable and renewable source of energy that can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."
