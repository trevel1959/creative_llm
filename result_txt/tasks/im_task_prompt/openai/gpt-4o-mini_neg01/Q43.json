    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate advanced self-cleaning technology that uses high-temperature steam to sanitize the oven interior after cooking. This system would not only eliminate the need for harsh chemical cleaners but also reduce the time and effort required for regular maintenance. Users could activate the self-cleaning mode with a simple button press or through a mobile app.",
    "**Multi-Zone Cooking**: Design an oven with multiple cooking zones that can operate independently at different temperatures. This feature would allow users to cook various dishes simultaneously without the flavors mixing or needing to adjust the cooking times for each dish. Each zone could be controlled via a touchscreen interface, enabling users to monitor and adjust settings easily.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cooking Assistant**: Equip the oven with an AR interface that overlays cooking instructions and timers onto a smart device or glasses. Users could see visual guides for how to arrange their dishes inside the oven or receive real-time feedback on cooking progress. This interactive feature would enhance the cooking experience, making it more engaging and informative.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Heat Management**: Develop an oven that uses smart heat management technology to optimize energy consumption. This could involve sensors that detect the type of dish being cooked and adjust the heating elements accordingly, ensuring that energy is not wasted. The oven could also be programmed to enter a low-energy mode when not in use, significantly reducing electricity bills.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Technology**: Introduce a flavor infusion system that allows users to add herbs, spices, or marinades directly into the cooking chamber. The oven could have a compartment where users can place their flavoring agents, and during cooking, it would release these flavors into the oven, enhancing the taste of the food. This would provide a unique cooking experience and elevate the overall flavor profile of dishes."
