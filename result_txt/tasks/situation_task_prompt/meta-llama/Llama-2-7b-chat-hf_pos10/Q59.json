    "Install Solar-Powered Skylights: Develop skylights that harness solar energy and convert it into electricity. These skylights would be made of specialized photovoltaic panels that can absorb sunlight even when the sky is cloudy. The electricity generated could power homes, businesses, or even entire cities, providing a reliable source of energy without relying on traditional methods.",
    "Cloud-Busting Technology: Develop advanced weather-modification technologies that can break up clouds and create openings in the sky. This could involve using advanced laser technology, particle accelerators, or even artificially-created storms to disperse the clouds and allow sunlight to reach the ground.",
    "Sun-Gathering Drones: Create small, autonomous drones that can fly high above the clouds and gather sunlight on their solar panels. These drones could be programmed to fly in formation, creating a large, floating array of solar panels that could harness the sun's energy even when the sky is cloudy. The drones could then transmit the energy back to the ground via wireless transmission.",
    "Cloud-Based Energy Storage: Develop advanced energy storage systems that can store excess energy generated from solar panels or other renewable sources during sunny periods. These systems could be integrated into the clouds themselves, using advanced materials and technologies to create a network of energy storage nodes that can release energy as needed when the sky is cloudy.",
    "Sunlight-Emitting Paint: Develop a specialized paint that can absorb sunlight during clear periods and release it back into the environment when the sky is cloudy. This paint could be applied to buildings, streets, or even entire cities, providing a constant source of sunlight even when the sky is overcast. The paint could be made from a combination of photoluminescent materials and nanotechnology, allowing it to absorb and emit light with maximum efficiency."
