    "**Expandable Hanger Design**: Create a clothes hanger that can expand or contract based on the type of clothing being hung. For instance, it could have adjustable arms that widen for thicker garments like coats and contract for lighter items like t-shirts. This feature would help prevent clothes from slipping off and would reduce the risk of stretching or damaging delicate fabrics.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Hanger with Storage**: Design a hanger that incorporates small storage compartments for accessories like belts, ties, or jewelry. This would help keep the wardrobe organized and reduce clutter. The compartments could be detachable and customizable, allowing users to choose what to store based on their personal style and needs.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated Drying System**: Develop a clothes hanger that has built-in drying technology, such as gentle heating elements or a fan that circulates air. This would allow users to dry delicate garments without risking damage from traditional drying methods. It could be especially useful for people living in small spaces without access to outdoor drying areas.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Plant-Based Materials**: Create a clothes hanger made entirely from sustainable, biodegradable materials. This hanger could feature a stylish design while promoting environmental consciousness. It could also include a built-in seed paper tag that encourages users to plant it after the hanger reaches the end of its life cycle, contributing to reforestation efforts.",
    "**Color-Changing Hanger for Laundry Sorting**: Introduce a clothes hanger that changes color based on the fabric type or care instructions. For example, it could turn blue for machine-washable items, red for dry-clean-only garments, and green for delicate fabrics. This visual cue would help users sort laundry more effectively and prevent accidental damage to their clothes."
