    "**Pest and Disease Control**: Organic farms are often susceptible to pests and diseases since they cannot use synthetic pesticides. This requires farmers to develop a comprehensive pest management plan, which may include introducing beneficial insects, using natural repellents, and implementing crop diversity. However, finding the right balance can be challenging, and farmers may experience crop losses due to pest infestations or disease outbreaks, especially in the initial years before a robust ecosystem is established.",
    "**Market Access and Competition**: New organic farmers may struggle to find reliable markets for their produce. While there is a growing demand for organic products, competition can be fierce, especially from established organic farms and larger agricultural businesses. Farmers must invest time in marketing, building relationships with local grocers, restaurants, and consumers, which can divert focus from actual farming activities and increase operational stress.",
    "**Certification Process**: Obtaining organic certification can be a daunting and lengthy process, often taking several years. Farmers must comply with stringent regulations and maintain detailed records of their farming practices. This bureaucratic hurdle can deter potential farmers from pursuing organic farming, and even after certification, they may face audits that require significant time and resources, potentially impacting their financial stability.",
    "**Water Management**: Access to clean water is crucial for any farm, but organic farms often have stricter regulations regarding water use and quality. Farmers may encounter issues related to irrigation, such as water scarcity or contamination from nearby non-organic farms. Developing sustainable water management practices, like rainwater harvesting or drip irrigation, can be expensive and requires initial investments in infrastructure.",
    "**Labor Shortages**: Organic farming can be labor-intensive, particularly during planting and harvest seasons. Farmers may struggle to find skilled labor willing to work under the often physically demanding and lower-paying conditions typical of organic farms. This can lead to delays in planting or harvesting, ultimately affecting crop yields and profitability."
