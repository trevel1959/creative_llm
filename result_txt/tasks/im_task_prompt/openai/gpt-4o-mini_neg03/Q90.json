    "**Smart Guitar Picks**: Develop a line of smart guitar picks equipped with sensors that track the player’s strumming patterns, speed, and pressure. These picks would connect to an app that provides feedback on technique, suggesting adjustments to improve sound quality. The picks could also have customizable settings for different genres, offering tailored advice for rock, jazz, or classical styles.",
    "**AI-Powered Composition Tool**: Introduce an AI assistant that helps guitarists compose music. This tool could analyze a player’s existing riffs and suggest chord progressions, melodies, or harmonies that complement their style. Users could input their mood or desired genre, and the AI would generate suggestions, making songwriting more accessible and inspiring for musicians of all levels.",
    "**Wearable Finger Position Tracker**: Create a wearable device that attaches to the player’s hand or fingers. This tracker would monitor finger placement and movement, providing real-time feedback through a connected app. It could help beginners develop muscle memory by guiding them to maintain proper finger positioning, and it could offer challenges to advance their skills over time.",
    "**Customizable Guitar Body Shapes**: Design a modular guitar with interchangeable body shapes and materials. Musicians could easily switch out the body for different styles, such as a classic acoustic, electric, or even a resonator design. This would allow players to experiment with tone and aesthetics without needing to invest in multiple guitars, catering to diverse musical needs and preferences.",
    "**Smart Capo with Tuning Assistance**: Invent a smart capo that not only clamps onto the guitar neck but also includes a built-in tuner and pitch guide. This capo could automatically adjust its tuning based on the key selected by the player and provide visual feedback on the tuning accuracy through an LED display. This would simplify the process of changing keys and ensure the guitar is always in tune, especially for live performances."
