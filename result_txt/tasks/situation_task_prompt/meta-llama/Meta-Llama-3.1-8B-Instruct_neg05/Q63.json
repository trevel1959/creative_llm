    "**Biometric Locks**: In a world without keys, I'd rely on advanced biometric locks that use facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or even vein recognition to secure my belongings. These locks would be integrated into my home, car, and other personal items, ensuring that only I can access them. ",
    "**Smart Home Automation**: I'd utilize smart home automation systems that can detect and respond to my presence, voice commands, or even my emotions. For instance, my home would automatically lock doors, adjust lighting, and play soothing music when I'm feeling stressed. ",
    "**DNA-Encoded Containers**: I'd use containers with DNA-encoded locks that can only be opened by someone with a specific DNA sequence. This would provide an additional layer of security, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized individuals to access my belongings. ",
    "**Neural Interface**: I'd develop a neural interface that allows me to control and secure my belongings with my mind. This technology would read my brain signals and respond accordingly, eliminating the need for physical keys or biometric scans. ",
    "**Augmented Reality Secure Zones**: I'd create augmented reality (AR) secure zones that use AR glasses or contact lenses to project a virtual barrier around my belongings. Only I would be able to see and interact with the virtual lock, ensuring that no one else can access my secured items. "
