    "Building Codes and Permits: Another potential problem would be dealing with stringent building codes and obtaining necessary permits. It may take a significant amount of time to complete the necessary paperwork, and this delay could slow down the installation process, thus increasing the overall cost of the project.",
    "Accessibility: Ensuring that solar panels are accessible to the elderly and individuals with disabilities might be a challenge. The design and installation of the panels should be considerate of easy accessibility for those who may have difficulty reaching or maintaining the panels.",
    "Environmental Impacts: Although solar panels are generally environmentally friendly, there may be concerns about the environmental impact of manufacturing and installing them. This factor might create an additional layer of scrutiny and can slow down the implementation process if extensive environmental assessments are needed.",
    "Funding: One of the largest challenges could be the financial aspect of the project. Installing solar panels in every home requires the necessary funds, which might not be readily available. In this context, the city may need to consider innovative financing methods, such as energy savings programs or subsidies for low-income households, to make solar panels more accessible.",
    "Public Education: There might be a lack of public education or awareness about the benefits of solar energy. This issue could slow down the adoption rate, as people might not be convinced about the benefits of solar panels for their homes. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs about the advantages of solar energy could help alleviate this problem."
