    "**Self-Watering Planter**: Cacti are drought-resistant and can be used innovatively as self-watering planters. Create a planter with a water reservoir at the bottom. The cactus can absorb water as needed, reducing the frequency of watering. This is especially useful for people who travel frequently or forget to water their plants.",
    "**Sustainable Kitchen Scrubber**: Dried cactus pads, particularly from the prickly pear cactus, can be used as eco-friendly kitchen scrubbers. Once dried and cleaned, they provide a natural abrasive surface that can effectively scrub pots and pans without scratching them, making them a sustainable alternative to synthetic sponges.",
    "**Cactus-Infused Drinks**: Use the pads or fruits of cacti to create unique beverages. Blend cactus pads into smoothies for added nutrition, or infuse water with cactus fruit (like prickly pear) for a refreshing, hydrating drink. The vibrant colors and flavors can make for an interesting addition to summer gatherings.",
    "**DIY Skin Care Products**: Cactus is rich in antioxidants and vitamins, making it a great ingredient for homemade skin care products. Create soothing gels or creams using cactus extract to hydrate and nourish the skin. This could be marketed as a natural remedy for sunburn or dry skin, tapping into the growing trend of organic beauty products.",
    "**Artistic Wall Decor**: Use dried cactus skeletons or preserved cactus plants as unique wall art. These can be arranged in shadow boxes or mounted directly on the wall, creating a natural and textured aesthetic. This would appeal to those looking for sustainable and low-maintenance decor options that bring a touch of nature indoors."
