    "**Emergency Solar Power System**: Develop a system that can harness solar energy even during cloudy days or at night. This could involve creating a portable solar panel with an integrated battery storage unit that can be charged during daylight hours and used to power essential devices such as lamps, phones, and medical equipment in the absence of electricity.",
    "**Water Filtration and Storage**: With no electricity, access to clean water becomes crucial. You could create a manual water filtration system using natural materials like sand, charcoal, and biological filters. Additionally, set up a rainwater harvesting system to collect water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning purposes.",
    "**Manual Communication Network**: Establish a network of manually operated communication points where people can send messages to each other. This could involve using semaphore flags, Morse code, or simple hand signals. By setting up these stations across different locations, you ensure that important information can still be shared effectively, helping communities coordinate their survival efforts.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Farming Techniques**: Utilize ancient farming methods like permaculture and traditional agriculture to grow food without relying on machinery or electricity. Implement vertical gardening, aquaponics, and hydroponics systems that require minimal input. Teach survival skills such as foraging, hunting, and preserving food to ensure a stable food supply.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Building Design**: Design a temporary shelter that minimizes heat loss and maximizes natural light and ventilation. Use materials that are locally sourced and sustainable, such as bamboo, straw bales, or recycled timber. Incorporate passive solar heating and cooling strategies to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the shelter, reducing the need for artificial heating or cooling systems."
