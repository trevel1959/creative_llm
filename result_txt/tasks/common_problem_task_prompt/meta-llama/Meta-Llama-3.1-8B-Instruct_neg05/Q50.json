    "**Eco-Pod Village**: Design a self-sufficient village consisting of interconnected, spherical Eco-Pods. Each pod is equipped with a miniature ecosystem, including a vertical garden, solar panels, and a water harvesting system. The pods are arranged in a honeycomb pattern to maximize space and minimize waste. The village is powered by a community-owned solar farm and features a shared community center for social gatherings and workshops.",
    "**Aquatic Arcology**: Create an underwater community that utilizes advanced bioluminescent technology to create a vibrant, sustainable environment. The community is built into the sides of coral reefs, with transparent domes allowing residents to observe marine life while maintaining a safe distance. The community is powered by ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) and features a unique, adaptive architecture that responds to changing ocean conditions.",
    "**TerraVerde**: Develop a futuristic, vertical farming community that utilizes advanced hydroponics and aeroponics to cultivate a wide variety of crops. The community is built into a massive, spiraling tower with a central core containing a massive greenhouse. The tower is covered in a latticework of solar panels and wind turbines, generating enough energy to power the entire community. Residents live in modular, vertically-stacked apartments with access to a rooftop garden and community spaces.",
    "**BioMorph**: Design a community that utilizes advanced biotechnology to create a living, breathing structure. The community is built into a massive, curved structure that resembles a living organism, with a network of branching tendrils and roots that absorb and process nutrients from the surrounding environment. The community is powered by a combination of solar, wind, and bio-energy harvesting, and features a unique, adaptive architecture that responds to changing environmental conditions.",
    "**Nexus**: Create a community that serves as a hub for sustainable innovation and collaboration. The community is built into a series of interconnected, modular units that can be easily reconfigured to accommodate changing needs and priorities. The community features a shared makerspace, a community garden, and a range of sustainable energy-generating technologies, including solar, wind, and bio-energy harvesting. Residents live in modular, adaptable apartments with access to a range of community resources and amenities. [/INST] "
