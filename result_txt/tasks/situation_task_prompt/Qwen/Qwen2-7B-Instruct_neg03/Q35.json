    "**Bicycle Rentals and Sharing Programs**: Imagine a city-wide bicycle rental system that functions like a bike-sharing program. Users can rent bikes from designated stations throughout the city for short periods, which can range from hourly to daily. The bikes could be equipped with GPS tracking systems to prevent theft, and there could be mobile apps to easily locate and reserve available bikes.",
    "**Portable Electric Bicycles**: Develop lightweight, foldable electric bicycles that can be easily carried on public transportation or stored in small spaces. These bikes could have removable batteries for convenience and safety, allowing users to swap them out at designated stations. They could also feature compact folding mechanisms, making them easy to store and transport.",
    "**Human-Powered Transportation Network**: Create a network of human-powered transportation options such as pedal-powered boats, carts, and even hoverboards. For example, cities could have designated waterways where pedal-powered boats are used, or areas with uneven terrains might benefit from pedal-powered carts or wagons. This encourages a more eco-friendly and community-driven approach to transportation.",
    "**Personalized Electric Skates**: Design customizable electric skateboards or longboards that are tailored to individual preferences, such as varying levels of speed, stability, and maneuverability. These could be rented or shared through an app, providing an alternative to traditional bicycles that may be more suitable for specific types of terrain or personal skill levels.",
    "**Smart Mobility Solutions**: Develop smart mobility solutions that integrate various modes of transportation, including walking, running, and using existing infrastructure (like stairs or escalators) in creative ways. For example, a mobile app could suggest the fastest route to a destination, factoring in pedestrian routes, stairs, and other non-bicycle modes. This promotes a more holistic approach to urban navigation, encouraging people to explore their surroundings on foot or by other means when necessary."
