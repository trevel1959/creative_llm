    "**Personalized Tissue Box Organizer**: Design a tissue box that can be personalized for each individual user. This could include adding unique designs or custom messages to the outside of the box. Inside, it can be divided into sections based on personal needs like allergies, colds, etc. The idea would also include a small compartment for storing other essentials like lip balm, hand sanitizer, or cough drops.",
    "**Sustainable Tissue Box**: Create an eco-friendly version of a tissue box by using biodegradable materials. The design could incorporate a compostable or recyclable box made from materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or corn starch. The idea could also include the use of natural, plant-based tissues inside, which are more sustainable and kinder to the environment.",
    "**Interactive Tissue Box**: Develop a tissue box that has an interactive feature. For instance, you could attach QR codes on each tissue box that, when scanned, take the user to a website with health tips, seasonal greetings, or even music playlists related to relaxation. This idea could also include augmented reality features where the box itself becomes a game or a storytelling tool when scanned.",
    "**Smart Tissue Box**: Design a tissue box that integrates technology for convenience. It could have a built-in sensor that automatically dispenses a single tissue upon opening the lid. Additionally, it could sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth to track usage, alert you when you're running low, and suggest healthier habits based on usage patterns. ",
    "**Tissue Box with Built-In Humidifier**: Develop a tissue box that doubles as a mini humidifier. This idea could be especially beneficial during winter months or in dry environments. It could use ultrasonic technology to add moisture to the air around the user, while simultaneously dispensing tissues. The design could include a water reservoir and a fan to distribute the mist evenly, creating a comfortable environment for those who often use tissues due to allergies or dryness."
