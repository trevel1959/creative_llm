    "Night vision glasses - With the ability to see in the dark, night vision glasses would become a must-have item for people who work or travel at night. These glasses would use advanced technology to enhance visibility in low light conditions, allowing individuals to see details that are normally impossible to detect without specialized equipment.",
    "Dark-adapted animals - Humans with night vision would be able to observe how animals adapt to living in darkness. By studying these adaptations, scientists could gain insights into how different species have evolved to survive in challenging environments.",
    "Improved safety measures - With increased visibility in the dark, it would be easier to identify potential hazards and take appropriate safety measures. This could include better lighting in streets and buildings, as well as improved traffic signals and other safety features.",
    "New forms of entertainment - The ability to see in the dark would open up new opportunities for entertainment, such as watching movies and TV shows in complete darkness. It could also allow for new forms of immersive experiences, such as virtual reality games and simulations.",
    "Medical applications - Night vision technology could be used to improve medical procedures, such as surgery and diagnostic imaging. For example, surgeons could use special cameras to see inside the body during operations, while diagnostic scans could provide more detailed images of internal organs and tissues."
