    "**Rapid Sea Level Rise**: The sudden melting of the polar ice caps would lead to an unprecedented sea level rise, inundating coastal cities, low-lying areas, and islands. This would displace millions of people, causing widespread devastation and disrupting global food supplies.",
    "**Global Weather Chaos**: The massive amount of freshwater released into the oceans would alter global ocean currents, leading to unpredictable and extreme weather patterns. This could result in catastrophic storms, droughts, and temperature fluctuations, making it difficult for humans to adapt.",
    "**Mass Extinction Event**: The sudden change in ocean chemistry and temperature would have a profound impact on marine ecosystems. Many species, such as coral, fish, and other marine life, would struggle to survive, potentially leading to a mass extinction event.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: The loss of polar ice caps would have severe economic consequences, including the destruction of infrastructure, loss of property, and disruption of global trade. This could lead to a global economic collapse, making it challenging for governments to respond to the crisis.",
    "**Human Migration and Conflict**: The displacement of millions of people would lead to a massive migration crisis, putting a strain on resources, infrastructure, and social services. This could result in conflict, social unrest, and the breakdown of social cohesion.
