    "**Smart Vacuum Cleaner with Personalized Cleaning**: Design a vacuum cleaner that learns from the user's cleaning habits over time. It can adapt its cleaning patterns based on which areas are cleaned more often, how frequently certain rooms are used, and adjust the suction power accordingly. It could also recognize different types of dirt and adjust its cleaning intensity accordingly. The vacuum cleaner could send notifications to the user when it needs maintenance or if there is an issue.",
    "**Vaccuum Cleaner for Outdoor Use**: Create a specialized vacuum cleaner designed specifically for outdoor use, like for cleaning up leaves, debris, and sand in gardens, parks, or beaches. This could have larger capacity dust bags, stronger suction capabilities, and possibly even be water-resistant for cleaning wet messes. It could also come with attachments for cleaning hard-to-reach areas or specific tasks like cleaning cars or boats.",
    "**Vacuum Cleaner as Home Health Monitor**: Integrate health monitoring features into the vacuum cleaner. As it cleans, it could detect allergens, pet dander, or other particles in the air and alert the user about the quality of indoor air. The vacuum cleaner could also monitor the dust levels in the home over time, alerting the user when it might be necessary to replace air filters or undertake deeper cleaning.",
    "**Interactive Vacuum Cleaner for Kids**: Develop a child-friendly vacuum cleaner that not only cleans but also entertains kids. This could feature colorful designs, interactive games or challenges, and even educational content. For instance, while cleaning, the vacuum could teach children about different types of dirt or how to properly clean various surfaces. It could also have a reward system, such as points for each area cleaned, to encourage regular cleaning habits.",
    "**Portable Vacuum Cleaner for Small Spaces**: Design a compact, portable vacuum cleaner that can be easily carried around, ideal for small spaces or tight corners where traditional vacuums struggle. It could have powerful suction in a smaller form factor, with lightweight design, and a long-lasting battery. The vacuum could also include innovative features like a retractable hose or a built-in blower function for quick cleanup tasks. It could be particularly useful for car interiors, small apartments, or office spaces."
