    "Once upon a time in the mystical land of Eldoria, there lived a dragon named Zephyr. Unlike other dragons, Zephyr had a peculiar problemâ€”he was perpetually sneezy! Every time he tried to breathe fire, a massive \"ACHOO!\" would erupt instead, sending colorful clouds of glitter into the sky. The villagers adored him for this, as his sneezes brought good luck. However, Zephyr felt embarrassed, wishing to breathe fire like his friends. One day, he discovered that his sneezes could create rainbows. Embracing his uniqueness, Zephyr became the protector of joy in Eldoria, proving that sometimes, being different is truly magical.",
