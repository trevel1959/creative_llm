    "**Sustainable Venue**: Choose a venue that has been restored or repurposed from an old building, such as a historic barn, a converted church, or a repurposed warehouse. This reduces the need for new construction and minimizes waste. Consider partnering with a local non-profit organization that focuses on preserving historic buildings or promoting sustainability.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Opt for a catering service that offers plant-based, locally sourced, and organic food options. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with meat production and transportation. Consider a \"food waste-free\" approach by composting food scraps and using them to create nutrient-rich soil for local gardens.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Use locally sourced, biodegradable, or recycled materials for decorations. Consider using flowers, greenery, or potted plants instead of traditional floral arrangements. Repurpose old items, such as vintage doors, windows, or lanterns, to create unique decorative pieces.",
    "**Carbon Offset**: Calculate the carbon footprint of your wedding and offset it by investing in renewable energy projects, such as wind farms or solar panels. This can be done through a carbon offsetting program or by donating to a local organization that promotes sustainability.",
    "**Community Involvement**: Incorporate local artisans, musicians, and vendors into your wedding celebration. This not only supports the local economy but also promotes community engagement and cultural exchange. Consider hosting a post-wedding brunch or reception at a local community center or park, which can help to build relationships with the community."
