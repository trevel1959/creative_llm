    "**Color-Changing Notes**: Develop a line of Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or UV exposure. For example, a note left in the sun could change from yellow to orange, serving as a visual reminder that the note needs attention. This could also be used for color-coded priority levels, where a note turns red when itâ€™s overdue.",
    "**Interactive Notes with QR Codes**: Create Post-it Notes that come with a QR code printed on them. When scanned, the code could link to additional resources, such as videos, websites, or digital documents related to the note's content. This would bridge the gap between physical and digital information, making notes more interactive and informative.",
    "**Post-it Notes with Built-in Reminders**: Design Post-it Notes that have a small digital display at the top, allowing users to set reminders or alarms directly on the note. Users could press a button to record a voice memo or a short reminder that plays at a set time, combining the benefits of physical notes with the functionality of digital reminders.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Plantable Notes**: Introduce a line of biodegradable Post-it Notes made from seed paper. Once users are done with their notes, they can plant them in soil, and the notes will decompose while sprouting flowers or herbs. This would promote sustainability and give a second life to what would otherwise be waste.",
    "**Mood Indicator Notes**: Create Post-it Notes that feature an integrated mood indicator, such as a color scale or emoji faces. Users can choose a note that reflects their current mood, which can serve as a fun and expressive way to communicate feelings in a collaborative environment, such as offices or classrooms."
