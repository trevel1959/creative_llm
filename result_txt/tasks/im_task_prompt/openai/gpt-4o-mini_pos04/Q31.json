    "**Integrated AR Overlay**:    Incorporate augmented reality (AR) capabilities directly into the camera viewfinder or screen. This feature could overlay helpful information, such as grid lines, exposure levels, and even artistic filters in real-time. Users could visualize how different settings will affect their shot before taking the picture. Additionally, this AR system could suggest composition improvements and highlight areas of interest based on the rule of thirds or other photography principles.",
    "**Multi-Sensor Fusion**:    Develop a camera that utilizes multiple sensors with different capabilities (e.g., RGB, infrared, and depth sensors) to create a more comprehensive image. This multi-sensor fusion could enable advanced features like better low-light performance, improved dynamic range, and the ability to capture more detailed textures and colors. It could also facilitate advanced post-processing options, such as selectively editing different aspects of the image based on sensor data.",
    "**Modular Design**:    Introduce a modular camera design that allows users to easily swap out components such as the lens, sensor, or even the body. This customization would enable photographers to tailor their camera setup to specific shooting scenarios, such as wildlife photography, portraiture, or astrophotography. Users could upgrade individual parts as technology advances without needing to buy an entirely new camera.",
    "**AI-Powered Editing Assistant**:    Equip the camera with built-in AI editing software that can analyze photos as they are taken and provide real-time suggestions for edits. For example, it could suggest cropping, color correction, or exposure adjustments based on the scene. After capturing images, users could choose to apply these edits directly from the camera, saving time and enhancing the overall quality of their photos.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Source**:    Create a camera made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals, to reduce environmental impact. Additionally, integrate solar panels or kinetic energy converters that allow the camera to recharge while in use. This would promote eco-conscious photography, allowing users to capture images without worrying about battery life or contributing to electronic waste."
