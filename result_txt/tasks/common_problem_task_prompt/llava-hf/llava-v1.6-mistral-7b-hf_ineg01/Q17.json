    "**Accommodation crunch:** The sheer number of athletes, spectators, officials, and support staff would require an extraordinary amount of accommodation. This would create a demand for housing, and it might be challenging to provide comfortable and secure lodgings for everyone, which could lead to overcrowding or unsatisfactory living conditions.",
    "**Transportation challenges:** Organizing public transportation to efficiently accommodate both locals and visitors would be another substantial challenge. It would involve coordinating with existing public transport systems, implementing alternative transportation solutions, and ensuring that there is enough vehicle capacity to move everyone to their destinations in a timely manner.",
    "**Waste management and pollution:** Hosting an event of such scale would generate a significant amount of waste, both during the actual competition and before and after. This would necessitate a comprehensive waste management strategy and, possibly, investments in sustainable materials and technologies to minimize environmental impact.",
    "**Cultural and language barriers:** The Olympics are a global event that brings together people from all walks of life and from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. The potential for misunderstandings and miscommunications could lead to tension and negative experiences for some attendees. Supporting services to aid in cross-cultural understanding and communication would be essential.",
    "**Community impact:** Hosting the Olympics could change the economic, social, and environmental landscape of the host city. This would require careful planning to ensure that the community remains resilient and that the balance between economic development and preservation of its cultural and ecological integrity is maintained."
