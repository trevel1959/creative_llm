    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often come with hefty budgets, and managing finances can be tricky. Unforeseen expenses such as special effects, location changes, or extended shooting schedules can lead to budget overruns. This may result in creative compromises, such as cutting scenes or reducing marketing efforts, ultimately affecting the film's quality and box office potential.",
    "**Creative Differences**: Directors often have a specific vision for their film, but they must collaborate with producers, screenwriters, and other stakeholders who may have differing opinions. This can lead to tension on set, where creative differences could slow down production or lead to a final product that feels disjointed or unsatisfactory to the director.",
    "**Weather and Location Challenges**: Filming on location can bring a host of challenges, especially when dealing with unpredictable weather. Rain, snow, or extreme temperatures can halt production and require rescheduling. Additionally, logistical issues such as securing permits, accommodating local regulations, or managing the crew's safety can complicate the shooting process.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: Blockbuster films often come with high expectations from audiences, especially if they are part of a beloved franchise. The pressure to deliver a compelling story and engaging characters can lead to anxiety among the creative team. If the final product does not meet these expectations, it can result in backlash from fans and critics alike, impacting box office performance.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: The success of a blockbuster movie is heavily influenced by its marketing strategy. Coordinating promotional events, trailers, and social media campaigns requires careful planning and execution. Missteps in marketing—such as revealing too much of the plot or failing to connect with the target audience—can diminish excitement and lead to lower ticket sales."
