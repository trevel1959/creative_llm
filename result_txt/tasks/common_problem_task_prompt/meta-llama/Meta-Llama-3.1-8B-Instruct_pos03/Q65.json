    "**Aurora Display**: Integrate a dynamic, color-shifting display that changes hues and patterns based on the user's surroundings, mimicking the breathtaking beauty of the aurora borealis. This display would not only be visually stunning but also serve as a subtle ambient light source, reducing the need for separate lighting fixtures in a room. The display would be powered by a proprietary algorithm that analyzes environmental factors like time of day, weather, and geographical location to create an immersive and adaptive visual experience.",
    "**EcoCycle**: Develop a smartphone with a self-sustaining ecosystem that recycles and reuses its own components. The phone's casing would be made from a specially designed, biodegradable material that can be easily disassembled and repurposed. The battery would be replaceable and rechargeable using a proprietary wireless charging system, reducing electronic waste and promoting a more circular economy. Additionally, the phone's AI-powered software would optimize energy consumption, prolonging battery life and minimizing the device's carbon footprint.",
    "**SmartSkin**: Create a smartphone with a cutting-edge, shape-shifting design that adapts to the user's needs and preferences. The phone's body would be composed of a flexible, electroactive polymer (EAP) that can change shape, color, and texture in response to user input, environmental conditions, or even emotional state. This dynamic design would enable users to personalize their device's appearance, create unique visual effects, or even use the phone as a wearable device that conforms to their body.",
    "**HoloLens**: Develop a smartphone that seamlessly integrates augmented reality (AR) capabilities, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds. The phone would feature a high-resolution, see-through display that overlays digital information, objects, and experiences onto the real world. Users could interact with virtual objects, access information, and control their surroundings using a combination of hand gestures, voice commands, and eye-tracking technology.",
    "**BioSync**: Design a smartphone that utilizes advanced biometric sensing and AI-powered health monitoring to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of their physical and mental well-being. The phone would feature a non-invasive, wearable bio-sensor that tracks vital signs, detects health anomalies, and offers personalized recommendations for improvement. The AI-driven health assistant would analyze user data, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights to promote a healthier lifestyle and prevent chronic diseases."
