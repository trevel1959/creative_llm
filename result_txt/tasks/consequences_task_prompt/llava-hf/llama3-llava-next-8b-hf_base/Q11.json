    "Laying on Earth's sides or at the poles: The additional gravitational pull of a second moon would cause the equator to bulge outward, resulting in the shape of the Earth becoming slightly ellidal. This could lead to the rotation axis of the planet shifting, possibly resulting in areas near the poles or the equator experiencing extreme tidal forces and changes in climate.",
    "Changes in Tidal Patterns and Coastal Landform Formation: As the Earth rotated more slowly and with a different tidal rhythm due to having two moons, the tides would no longer move predictably, causing disruptions in coastal ecosystems and altering the distribution of coastal landforms.",
    "Impact on Space Travel: The presence of a second moon could affect the stability of artificial satellites or space missions that rely on Earth's rotation for communication or power generation.",
    "Increased Energy Production Potential: Having two moons could provide a consistent, alternative source of thermal energy, allowing for the exploitation of geothermal energy for heating and power generation in regions that cannot take advantage of Earth's natural heat.",
    "Increased Resources and Mining Opportunities: The presence of two moons could provide new sources of mineral resources, such as helium-3 for energy production, as well as valuable rare-earth elements dispersed across the moon's surfaces."
