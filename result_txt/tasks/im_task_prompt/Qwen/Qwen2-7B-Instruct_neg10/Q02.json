    "**Electrically-Assisted Bicycle (E-Bike) with Solar Panels**: Design an E-Bike that features solar panels integrated into its frame or handlebars. This would enable the bike to recharge its battery while being ridden, making it more eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run. Additionally, this feature could power onboard amenities like lights or a small fan for comfort during hot rides.",
    "**Modular Bicycle Frames for Personalization**: Create a line of bicycles with interchangeable parts that allow riders to customize their bikes according to their preferences. This could include different wheel sizes, seat styles, handlebar configurations, and even color options. This would make each bike unique and tailored to the rider's specific needs and style.",
    "**Bicycle as a Fitness Trainer**: Develop a bicycle equipped with sensors and AI algorithms that analyze the user's pedaling rhythm, strength, and technique. The bike could provide real-time feedback and personalized workout programs designed to optimize fitness goals. It might also offer virtual training sessions, allowing users to ride alongside professional cyclists or participate in simulated races.",
    "**Portable Bicycle with Inflatable Frame**: Create a lightweight, compact bicycle that inflates into shape when needed. This would make it easy to store and transport, particularly for those living in urban areas with limited space. The inflatable design could also be made from eco-friendly materials, reducing environmental impact.",
    "**Bicycle with Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Implement AR technology in the bicycle's helmet or a dedicated device attached to the handlebars. The system would overlay maps, directions, and other useful information onto the rider's view, enhancing safety and navigation during rides."
