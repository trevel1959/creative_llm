    "**Eco-Art Initiative**: Establish a program that combines art and environmental conservation. Invite local artists to create installations and sculptures using recycled materials found within the park. These installations can serve as interactive exhibits, educating visitors about the park's unique ecosystem and the importance of preserving it. The artwork can also be designed to be dismantled and reused, promoting a closed-loop system.",
    "**Wildlife Corridor Restoration**: Collaborate with local conservation organizations and government agencies to restore and expand wildlife corridors within the park. These corridors can be designed to connect fragmented habitats, allowing animals to migrate and interact freely. The restoration process can involve reforestation, habitat creation, and the removal of invasive species.",
    "**Sustainable Tourism Initiative**: Develop a program that promotes eco-friendly tourism practices within the park. This can include offering guided tours that focus on sustainable practices, such as reducing waste, conserving water, and respecting wildlife habitats.",
    "**Citizen Science Program**: Launch a program that empowers visitors to contribute to park conservation efforts. This can include projects such as monitoring water quality, tracking wildlife populations, and identifying plant species.",
    "**Indigenous Cultural Revitalization**: Collaborate with local indigenous communities to develop programs that promote cultural revitalization"
