The inhabitants, whimsical creatures called Scoopians, harvested sprinkles from the candy cane forests. One day, a dark cloud loomed, threatening to melt their world.

Upon reaching the peak, Gelato unleashed the Freeze Ray, saving their planet and turning the dark cloud into a rainbow of flavors. ",
