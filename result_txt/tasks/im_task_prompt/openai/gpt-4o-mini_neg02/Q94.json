    "**Eco-Friendly, Reusable Candle Holders**: Create a line of candle holders made from biodegradable materials that can be refilled with wax. After the candle burns down, users can send the holder back to the company for a refill at a discount. This promotes sustainability and reduces waste, while also allowing users to choose different scents and colors for their refills.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Design a candle that incorporates a small, discreet aromatherapy diffuser within the base. As the candle burns, the heat activates essential oils in the diffuser, enhancing the ambiance with additional scents. This dual-functionality allows for a more complex aromatic experience and can help with relaxation and mood enhancement.",
    "**Interactive Candle with Storytelling Feature**: Create a candle that plays a short story or soundscape as it burns. Using embedded speakers, the candle could narrate a tale related to its scent (like a beach-themed candle telling a story about summer adventures). This adds an auditory element to the candle experience, making it more engaging and memorable.",
    "**Customizable Layered Candles**: Offer a line of candles that can be layered with different colors and scents. Users can choose their preferred scents and colors, which are then poured in layers. As the candle burns, each layer reveals a new scent and color, creating a dynamic and evolving sensory experience. This customization allows for personal expression and makes the candle a unique centerpiece.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Candles**: Develop candles that change color based on the room's temperature or humidity, creating a visual representation of the environment. For instance, a candle could glow blue in cooler temperatures and red in warmer conditions. This feature not only adds an aesthetic element but also provides a subtle way to monitor room conditions, enhancing the ambiance based on the atmosphere."
