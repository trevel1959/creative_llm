    "**Sound Wave Displacement System**: This innovative alarm system utilizes sound waves to create a unique and interactive experience for the user. The alarm sounds in the form of an array of different sound waves that change based on the time of day or specific user preferences. For instance, during morning hours, the alarm could emit high-frequency tones that stimulate the brain to wake up. In the evening, it might use lower frequencies to help wind down. Users can customize their settings, such as preferred frequency ranges, volume levels, and even add personalized sound patterns. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Scented Alarm System**: Instead of relying solely on auditory stimuli, this system incorporates scent delivery into its mechanism. When the alarm goes off, it not only emits sound but also releases a pleasant scent that can be customized by the user. This can be particularly effective for individuals who are hard of hearing or those who need an extra sensory cue to wake up. The scent can vary depending on the situation, like lavender for relaxation or peppermint for energy boosts. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75.",
    "**Visual and Tactile Alarm**: This concept combines visual and tactile elements to wake someone up effectively. The alarm would consist of a series of vibrating plates that can be placed around the bed. As the alarm goes off, the plates start vibrating in a specific pattern that changes each time. This not only wakes the person up through vibrations but also engages their sense of touch, making it harder to ignore. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Dream Interference Alarm**: Using sleep science, this system works by subtly interfering with the user's dreams just before they are about to wake up. It could employ methods like sudden loud noises, flashing lights, or mild vibrations that occur at the optimal time to disrupt a dream without fully waking the person. This would make the alarm more effective because it catches users in a state where they are already processing information from their dreams, thus making them more responsive to waking up. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6.",
    "**Interactive Smart Mirror Alarm**: This innovative alarm system is integrated into a smart mirror. The alarm appears as a holographic projection directly onto the mirror, providing a futuristic and engaging experience. Users can interact with the projected alarm by swiping or tapping to snooze, view the time, or access additional features like weather updates or news briefs. This not only serves as an alarm but also"
