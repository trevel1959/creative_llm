    "Use natural elements such as the sun, moon, and stars to determine the time of day. For example, the position of the sun in the sky can indicate morning, noon, or evening, while the phases of the moon can be used to mark the days of the week.",
    "Create a system of signs and signals that could be used to communicate the time. This could involve using hand gestures or physical objects to represent different hours of the day.",
    "Develop a device that could measure the passage of time based on changes in temperature, humidity, or other environmental factors. For example, a thermometer could be used to indicate when it's hot enough for a meal, or a hygrometer could be used to tell when it's time to water plants.",
    "Use music or other forms of art to create a sense of rhythm and structure that could be used to mark the passing of time. For example, a particular song or piece of music could be played every hour, or certain visual elements could be displayed on a screen to indicate the current time.",
    "Create a system of stories or myths that could be used to track the passage of time. For example, a particular story or legend could be associated with each hour of the day, or a series of interconnected stories could be used to represent the passage of time from one season to another."
