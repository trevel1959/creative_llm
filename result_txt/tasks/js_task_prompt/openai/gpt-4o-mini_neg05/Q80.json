Additionally, her views on the cultural exchanges between Egypt and Rome could enrich our understanding of historical interactions and their impact on modern globalization.",
    "**Nikola Tesla**: Tesla's return would be a game-changer for modern science and technology. As a visionary inventor, he had ideas about wireless energy transfer and renewable energy long before they became mainstream. Engaging with Tesla could lead to breakthroughs in energy efficiency and sustainability, potentially accelerating the transition to clean energy. His perspective on the ethical implications of technology would also be crucial in today's context, as we grapple with issues related to AI, privacy, and environmental impact.",

His wisdom on conflict resolution and reconciliation could be invaluable in addressing the polarization and divisiveness seen in many societies today.",
    "**Ada Lovelace**: The world's first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, could bring fresh perspectives on technology and gender in STEM fields. Her vision for computing as a creative process rather than just a mechanical one could inspire new generations of innovators. Lovelace could also provide insights into the ethical implications of technology, especially in areas like AI and data privacy. By reviving her, we could spark conversations about increasing female representation in tech and encourage young women to pursue careers in science and technology."
