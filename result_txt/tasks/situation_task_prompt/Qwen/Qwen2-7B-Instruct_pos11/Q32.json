    "**3D-Printed Teeth**: Develop and promote 3D printing technology for creating customized dental tools and appliances.

    "**AI-Driven Oral Health Apps**: Develop advanced AI-powered apps that monitor oral health through smartphone cameras or other sensors. These apps could analyze the health of teeth, gums, and overall oral health, alerting users to potential issues and providing personalized advice on treatment options.",
    "**Educational Workshops**: Organize regular educational workshops in schools, workplaces, and communities on oral health maintenance. This could include interactive sessions on brushing techniques, diet tips, and the importance of regular check-ups. Encouraging a self-sustained approach to oral hygiene could significantly reduce the need for professional dental care."
