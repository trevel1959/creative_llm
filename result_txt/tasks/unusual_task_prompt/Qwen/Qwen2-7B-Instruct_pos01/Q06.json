    "**Tire-powered Electric Vehicle**: Invent a new type of electric vehicle that uses discarded tires as its primary energy storage system. The tires would be filled with a superconductive material, allowing them to store and release energy efficiently. When the vehicle is in motion, the kinetic energy from the tires would be converted into electrical energy and stored for later use. This idea has a high confidence score (0.9) because it combines the renewable nature of tire disposal with the growing interest in sustainable transportation.",
    "**Tire-based Urban Gardens**: Create a system where old tires are used as planters for vertical gardens in urban areas. The inner part of the tire can be filled with soil, and plants can grow inside, creating green spaces in densely populated cities. This solution could help improve air quality and provide local communities with fresh produce. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8, as it addresses environmental and health concerns while utilizing waste materials.",
    "**Tire-Powered Lighting Systems**: Develop a solar-powered street lighting system that incorporates used tires. The tires can be repurposed as reflectors or lenses to enhance the efficiency of the solar panels. This concept not only reduces light pollution but also minimizes the need for new materials in lighting infrastructure. The confidence score for this innovation is 0.7, considering its potential impact on sustainability and aesthetics in public spaces.",
    "**Tire-Driven Water Recirculation System**: Design a water purification and recirculation system that uses the spinning motion of tires to agitate water, helping to remove contaminants. This system could be particularly useful in rural areas without access to advanced water treatment facilities. The confidence score is 0.6, given the potential benefits in addressing global water scarcity issues.",
    "**Tire-Made Sustainable Furniture**: Utilize discarded tires to create unique furniture pieces such as chairs, tables, and benches. These items can be designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, offering a new market for recycled goods. The confidence score for this creative idea is 0.5, reflecting the novelty of transforming waste into desirable home decor items."
