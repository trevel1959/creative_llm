    "No Atmosphere: Without gravity to hold gases close to a planet, there would be no atmosphere. This would make life on Earth impossible, as we rely on the atmosphere for oxygen and protection from harmful UV rays.",
    "No Planetary Formation: Planets form due to the gravitational pull of a star. Without gravity, stars would not have the necessary force to attract and hold together the dust and gas that form planets.",
    "No Life: Gravity plays a crucial role in the development of life. For example, gravity helps to distribute nutrients in the soil and keeps the oceans in place. Without gravity, life as we know it would not exist.",
    "No Technology: Many technologies, such as satellites and spacecraft, rely on gravity for their operation. Without gravity, these technologies would not function properly.",
    "No Art: Gravity has been a source of inspiration for artists throughout history. Without gravity, art would be fundamentally different, as it would not be influenced by the way objects move and interact with each other."
