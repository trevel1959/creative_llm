    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Incorporate solar panels into the laptop's lid, allowing for supplementary charging when the device is used outdoors. This would be particularly beneficial for users who travel or work in remote locations, providing them with an eco-friendly power source that reduces reliance on traditional electricity.",
    "**AI-Powered Performance Optimization**: Integrate an AI system that learns the userâ€™s habits and optimizes performance accordingly. For example, if a user often runs graphic-intensive applications, the AI could allocate more resources to those tasks while minimizing background processes. This would ensure that the laptop runs efficiently, enhancing user experience without requiring manual adjustments.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Features**: Revamp the laptop's design to include features that promote better ergonomics, such as an adjustable keyboard angle, a detachable wrist rest, and a built-in screen riser. This would help reduce strain on the wrists and neck during prolonged use, making it more comfortable for users who spend long hours working on their devices.",
    "**Enhanced Connectivity Options**: Introduce a docking station that can wirelessly connect to multiple devices, allowing users to easily switch between their laptop and other peripherals like monitors, printers, and external storage. This could include a universal docking system that works with various brands and types of devices, making it easier to set up a productive workspace.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Shift towards using sustainable materials in the laptop's construction, such as recycled aluminum, biodegradable plastics, and renewable resources. This would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also set a standard in the tech industry for responsible manufacturing practices."
