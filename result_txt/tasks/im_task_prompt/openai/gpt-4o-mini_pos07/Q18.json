    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Panels**: Integrate solar panels into the car’s design, particularly on the roof and hood, to supplement power for electrical systems or even charge the battery. This would reduce reliance on charging stations and improve the car's overall energy efficiency. The solar cells could be made from transparent materials that don’t compromise aesthetics, allowing for a sleek look while harnessing solar energy.",
    "**Augmented Reality Dashboard**: Replace traditional dashboards with an augmented reality (AR) interface that projects essential information onto the windshield. This could include navigation directions, speed, and alerts, allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road. The AR system could also provide real-time hazard detection by highlighting pedestrians, obstacles, or traffic signs in the driver’s line of sight.",
    "**Modular Vehicle Design**: Create a car with a modular design that allows for easy upgrades and customizations. For instance, users could swap out parts like the battery, wheels, or even the body panels to suit their needs or preferences. This would promote sustainability by reducing waste and allowing consumers to keep their vehicles up-to-date without buying a new car entirely.",
    "**AI-Powered Safety Features**: Implement advanced AI systems that learn the driving habits of the user and predict potential hazards. For example, the system could analyze traffic patterns and recommend the best routes, while also providing real-time alerts for potential accidents or road conditions. This proactive approach could significantly enhance safety and reduce the likelihood of collisions.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate a health monitoring system into the car that tracks the driver’s vital signs, such as heart rate and stress levels. If the system detects abnormalities or signs of fatigue, it could suggest taking a break or even activate self-driving mode if necessary. This would not only prioritize driver safety but also promote a healthier driving experience."
