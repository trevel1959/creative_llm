    "**Global Temperature Drop**: Without the sun's energy, the Earth's average temperature would plummet, potentially dropping by as much as 10°C (18°F) in the first week. This would lead to widespread crop failures, as plants would be unable to undergo photosynthesis, and food production would grind to a halt.",
    "**Atmospheric Circulation Disruption**: The sun's radiation drives global atmospheric circulation patterns, including trade winds and ocean currents. Without it, these patterns would collapse, leading to extreme weather events, such as massive storms and temperature fluctuations. This would make navigation and transportation nearly impossible.",
    "**Disruption of Earth's Magnetosphere**: The sun's radiation also helps maintain the Earth's magnetosphere, which protects us from harmful solar and cosmic radiation. Without it, the magnetosphere would weaken, allowing more radiation to penetrate and potentially causing widespread damage to electronic systems and human health.",
    "**Impact on Marine Ecosystems**: The sun's energy is essential for the health of marine ecosystems, including phytoplankton, which form the base of the ocean's food web. Without it, these ecosystems would collapse, leading to a devastating impact on marine life, including fish populations and the entire food chain.",
    "**Effects on Human Health**: The sun's UV radiation is essential for the production of vitamin D in humans. Without it, people would be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to a range of health problems, including rickets, osteoporosis, and increased susceptibility to infections. Additionally, the lack of UV radiation would also affect the human circadian rhythm, leading to sleep disorders and other health issues. "
