    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize their boards based on their riding style. For example, different decks, wheels, and trucks could be swapped out easily, catering to street skating, cruising, or downhill riding. This modularity would appeal to a broader range of skaters and promote creativity in board design.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This eco-friendly board would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also include features like biodegradable grip tape and natural varnishes, making it a sustainable choice for skaters who want to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Equip the skateboard with built-in safety features such as LED lights on the sides and a horn for alerting pedestrians. The board could also have reflective materials to enhance visibility at night. Additionally, an emergency brake system could be integrated, which would engage automatically if the rider loses balance or falls.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-in Speakers**: Design a skateboard with Bluetooth speakers embedded into the deck. This would allow riders to enjoy their favorite music while skating without the need for headphones. The speakers could be water-resistant and come with a companion app that lets users control the music and adjust the volume while riding.",
    "**Augmented Reality Skateboarding Experience**: Create an augmented reality (AR) app that pairs with the skateboard, providing an interactive experience for riders. Users could see virtual obstacles, challenges, or even training tutorials overlaid on their environment through their smartphone or AR glasses. This would enhance the learning experience for beginners and make skating more engaging for experienced riders."
