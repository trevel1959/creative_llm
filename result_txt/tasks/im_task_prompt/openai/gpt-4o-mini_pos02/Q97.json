    "**Retractable Leash with Automatic Tension Adjustment**: Design a retractable leash that automatically adjusts its tension based on the dog's behavior. For instance, if the dog pulls ahead, the leash could gently tighten to discourage pulling, while allowing more slack when the dog is walking calmly. This would help train dogs to walk properly without constant manual adjustments from the owner.",
    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Accessories**: Create a leash that includes built-in accessories such as a collapsible water bowl, a treat dispenser, and a flashlight for evening walks. This all-in-one design would be perfect for on-the-go pet owners, allowing them to have everything they need in one convenient tool, reducing the need to carry multiple items.",
    "**Reflective and Glow-in-the-Dark Features**: Develop a leash that incorporates reflective materials and glow-in-the-dark threads for enhanced visibility during nighttime walks. This would increase safety for both the dog and the owner, making it easier for passing cars and pedestrians to see them in low-light conditions.",
    "**Customizable Length and Material Options**: Introduce a modular leash system where owners can customize the length and material based on their dog's size and behavior. For example, a longer leash for dogs that are well-trained and can roam freely, or a shorter, sturdier leash for more energetic dogs. This would allow for a more personalized experience and better control during walks.",
    "**Interactive Leash with Training Features**: Design a leash that incorporates training features such as a built-in clicker or vibration feedback. When the dog exhibits good behavior, the owner can click the leash or use a vibration to reward the dog. This interactive element would help reinforce positive behaviors during walks and make training more engaging for both the dog and the owner."
