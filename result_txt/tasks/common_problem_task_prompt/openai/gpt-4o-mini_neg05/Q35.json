    "**Public Safety and Interaction**: Zoos often have to balance animal safety with visitor interaction. An issue may arise if visitors attempt to feed or touch animals, leading to potential injuries or stress for the animals. To mitigate this, zoos can create designated interaction zones with strict guidelines and supervision, as well as educational programs that inform visitors about the importance of respecting animal boundaries.",
    "**Conservation Messaging and Education**: Many zoos are involved in conservation efforts, but a challenge may be effectively communicating these messages to the public. If visitors leave without understanding the zoo's role in conservation, it could undermine the mission. To combat this, zoos can develop engaging multimedia exhibits, host interactive workshops, and partner with local schools to provide educational outreach programs that highlight conservation success stories.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Running a zoo can be expensive, and financial sustainability is a common issue. Revenue may fluctuate due to seasonality, economic downturns, or unexpected expenses. To enhance financial stability, zoos can diversify income streams by offering unique experiences such as behind-the-scenes tours, animal sponsorship programs, and hosting special events like “Zoo Nights” with live entertainment and food trucks.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: The success of a zoo heavily relies on the expertise and dedication of its staff. A potential problem is high turnover rates or inadequate training, which can affect animal care and visitor experiences. To address this, zoos can invest in comprehensive training programs, mentorship opportunities, and employee wellness initiatives that foster a supportive work environment and encourage long-term commitment.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Zoos often face challenges with invasive species that may disrupt local ecosystems or compete with native wildlife. This can pose ethical and ecological dilemmas. To tackle this issue, zoos can collaborate with conservation organizations to develop strategies for managing invasive species, including educational programs for visitors on the importance of biodiversity and the threats posed by invasive species."
