    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Safety Features**: Design a bicycle helmet with integrated safety features such as a built-in GPS tracker, collision detection system, and a panic button that sends alerts to emergency contacts. The helmet could also include a small display screen to show essential information like speed, distance, and navigation directions. The integration of these features would enhance the overall safety and convenience of cycling.",
    "**Modular Helmet with Interchangeable Visors**: Create a modular bicycle helmet with interchangeable visors that cater to different weather conditions, riding styles, or personal preferences. The visors could be designed to provide optimal visibility, protection from the elements, or even serve as a fashion statement. This innovative design would allow cyclists to customize their helmets to suit their specific needs and tastes.",
    "**Aerodynamic Helmet with Integrated Wind Turbine**: Develop a bicycle helmet with an integrated wind turbine that generates electricity while in motion. The turbine would be designed to optimize airflow and reduce drag, while also providing a sustainable power source for devices such as smartphones, GPS, or lights. This eco-friendly feature would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists and help reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Helmet with Integrated Communication System**: Design a bicycle helmet with an integrated communication system that allows riders to communicate with other cyclists, pedestrians, or even emergency services. The system could include a built-in microphone, speaker, and a small display screen to show incoming messages or calls. This feature would enhance social interaction and safety while cycling.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Helmet with Adaptive Technology**: Create a shape-shifting bicycle helmet that adapts to different riding conditions and environments. The helmet could change its shape, size, or color to provide optimal protection, visibility, or aerodynamics. The adaptive technology could be achieved through the use of advanced materials, such as shape-memory alloys or electroactive polymers, that respond to environmental stimuli. This innovative design would offer unparalleled flexibility and convenience for cyclists.
