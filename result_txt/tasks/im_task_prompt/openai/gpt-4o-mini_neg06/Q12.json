    "**Modular Wallet Design**: Create a wallet with a modular design that allows users to customize the compartments based on their needs. For example, users could attach or detach sections for cash, coins, cards, or even a small power bank for charging devices on the go. This would cater to different lifestyles and preferences, allowing for a more personalized wallet experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a wallet made from sustainable, eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastics, vegan leather, or organic cotton. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a more sustainable lifestyle. Additionally, the wallet could include a recycling program where users can return old wallets for a discount on new ones.",
    "**Built-in Digital Business Card**: Integrate a digital business card feature into the wallet that allows users to share their contact information via NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. By simply tapping their wallet against another person's phone, users can instantly share their name, phone number, email, and social media profiles without the need for physical cards.",
    "**Augmented Reality Wallet Organizer**: Design a wallet that pairs with an augmented reality (AR) app, allowing users to visualize and organize their cards and cash. When users point their phone camera at the wallet, the app can highlight which card is which, helping them find what they need quickly. The app could also remind users of important dates related to their cards, like renewal dates for memberships or expiration dates for gift cards.",
    "**Integrated Health Tracker**: Create a wallet that features a small health tracker that monitors the userâ€™s steps, heart rate, and other fitness metrics. This tracker could sync with a smartphone app to provide insights into the user's health and wellness. The wallet could also have a section dedicated to storing health insurance cards and medical information, making it a comprehensive health accessory."
