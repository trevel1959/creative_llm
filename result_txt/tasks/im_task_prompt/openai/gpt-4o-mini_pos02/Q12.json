    "**Modular Wallet System**: Create a wallet that consists of interchangeable modules. Each module could serve a different purposeâ€”such as a card holder, cash compartment, coin pouch, or even a portable charger. Users can customize their wallets based on their needs for the day, making it more versatile and reducing bulk when not all compartments are necessary.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wallet**: Develop a wallet made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or vegan leather. Incorporate plant-based dyes and minimal packaging to enhance its eco-friendliness. Additionally, a portion of the profits could go to environmental conservation efforts, appealing to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Wallet with Integrated Digital Currency Features**: In response to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, design a wallet that includes a digital currency compartment. This could feature a secure digital wallet interface for managing cryptocurrencies, QR code scanning for transactions, and a way to convert between traditional and digital currencies seamlessly.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Wallet App**: Create a companion app that uses AR to visualize the contents of the wallet. By pointing a smartphone camera at the wallet, users can see their cards, cash, and other items displayed on the screen, making it easier to locate specific items without rummaging through the wallet.",
    "**Health Monitoring Wallet**: Incorporate health-tracking technology into the wallet. It could have built-in sensors to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, or stress levels, syncing with a mobile app. This would appeal to health-conscious consumers who want to keep track of their wellness on the go, making the wallet not just a financial tool but also a health companion."
