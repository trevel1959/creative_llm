    "Solar Panel-Equipped Umbrellas: Design umbrellas with built-in solar panels that can harness the sun's energy during the brief periods of clear sky. These umbrellas could be easily foldable and portable, allowing individuals to carry them with them wherever they go.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting Systems: Develop a lighting system that utilizes the cloud cover to provide natural lighting. This system would involve strategically placed mirrors and lenses that reflect and concentrate sunlight from the cloud cover, providing a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "Sun-Powered Windows: Invent windows that can harness the sun's energy through specialized glass panes. These windows would be able to convert sunlight into electricity, providing a reliable source of power for homes and buildings.",
    "Cloud-Based Water Collection Systems: Develop a system that collects and stores water droplets from the clouds, providing a sustainable source of clean water. This system could involve a network of specialized collectors that are placed in areas with high cloud cover, and the collected water could be stored in tanks or purified for consumption.",
    "Sun-Powered Transportation: Create vehicles that are powered by the sun, such as solar-powered cars, bicycles, or even airplanes. These vehicles would be equipped with specialized solar panels that would convert sunlight into energy, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation."
