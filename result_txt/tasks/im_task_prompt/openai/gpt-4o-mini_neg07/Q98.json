    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    A common issue with juicers is the tedious cleaning process. Introducing a self-cleaning mechanism would revolutionize the juicing experience. This could be achieved through a combination of high-pressure water jets and a special cleaning solution that circulates through the juicer after use. Users would simply press a button, and the juicer would clean itself, making it more convenient and encouraging more frequent use.",
    "**Portable Juicer with Solar Charging**:    For health enthusiasts on the go, a portable juicer equipped with solar panels would be a game-changer. This juicer could be compact and lightweight, designed for outdoor use such as picnics, camping, or beach days. Users could simply place it in the sun to charge while they prepare their ingredients, ensuring they have fresh juice wherever they are without relying on electricity.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Attachment**:    To enhance the juicing experience, a flavor infuser attachment could be developed. This attachment would allow users to add herbs, spices, or flavor extracts to their juice while itâ€™s being processed. For instance, a sprig of mint or a dash of ginger could be infused into the juice for added flavor without altering the juicing process. This feature would encourage users to get creative with their juices and expand their flavor profiles.",
    "**Nutrient Extraction Technology**:    A new juicer could incorporate advanced nutrient extraction technology that not only juices but also breaks down the cellular structure of fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient absorption. This juicer could use a combination of low-speed masticating and high-speed blending techniques, ensuring that users get the most out of their ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that are often lost in traditional juicing methods.",
    "**Juice Storage and Dispensing System**:    A built-in juice storage and dispensing system would allow users to make larger batches of juice and store them for later use. The juicer could have a temperature-controlled compartment that keeps juice fresh for several days. Additionally, it could feature a dispensing mechanism that allows users to pour out just the right amount of juice without needing to transfer it to another container, reducing waste and maintaining freshness."
