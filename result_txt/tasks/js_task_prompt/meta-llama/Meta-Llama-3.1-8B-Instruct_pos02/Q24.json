    "**Sustainable Energy Harvesting Infrastructure**: The city would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources, including solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power. To maximize energy efficiency, the city would be designed with green roofs, green walls, and vertical gardens that not only provide insulation but also help to purify the air and reduce urban heat island effects.",
    "**Intelligent Transportation System**: The city would feature a self-driving public transportation system that utilizes autonomous vehicles, hyperloops, and elevated walkways to reduce congestion, emissions, and travel times. This system would be integrated with a smart traffic management system that optimizes traffic flow in real-time, minimizing delays and accidents.",
    "**Advanced Water Management**: The city would employ a closed-loop water management system that collects, treats, and recycles rainwater and greywater for non-potable uses such as flushing toilets, irrigation, and industrial processes. This system would also include advanced water purification technologies to ensure the water is safe for drinking.",
    "**Innovative Waste Management**: The city would implement a zero-waste policy by implementing a closed-loop waste management system that collects, sorts, and recycles waste into valuable resources such as energy, nutrients, and raw materials. This system would include advanced recycling technologies, composting facilities, and anaerobic digestion plants.",
    "**Holistic Urban Planning**: The city would be designed with a focus on social equity, community engagement, and environmental sustainability. This would involve the creation of vibrant public spaces, community gardens, and cultural centers that foster a sense of community and social connection among residents. The city would also prioritize affordable housing, accessible transportation, and inclusive economic development."
