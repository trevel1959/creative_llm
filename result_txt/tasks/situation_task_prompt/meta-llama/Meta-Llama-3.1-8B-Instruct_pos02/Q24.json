    "**Adaptive Technology Revolution**: The sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses would accelerate the development of adaptive technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) glasses and smart contact lenses, which could provide real-time visual assistance. These technologies would utilize AI-powered image processing, object recognition, and predictive analytics to enhance vision, making them a viable alternative for people with poor vision. Companies would invest heavily in research and development, leading to a rapid evolution of these technologies.",
    "**Vision Restoration through Gene Editing**: Scientists would focus on gene editing technologies like CRISPR to develop treatments that could restore or improve vision. Gene editing would allow for the correction of genetic mutations that cause inherited vision disorders, such as inherited blindness. This could be achieved through gene therapy, where a healthy copy of the gene is introduced into the affected cells, or through somatic gene editing, where the genes in specific cells are modified to restore vision.",
    "**Virtual Assistants and AI-powered Vision Aids**: People with poor vision would rely heavily on virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant, which could be integrated with AI-powered vision aids. These virtual assistants would use machine learning algorithms to recognize and describe visual information, such as text, objects, and people, allowing individuals to navigate their surroundings more easily. This would require significant advancements in natural language processing and computer vision.",
    "**Bionic Vision and Prosthetics**: The demand for bionic vision and prosthetic devices would skyrocket, driving innovation in the field. Companies would develop advanced prosthetic eyes that can restore some level of vision, using technologies like retinal implants or epiretinal implants. These devices would be designed to interact with the brain, allowing individuals to perceive visual information and perform daily tasks more independently.",
    "**Environmental Modifications and Assistive Tools**: Cities and public spaces would undergo significant transformations to accommodate people with poor vision. Buildings, streets, and public areas would be designed with accessibility in mind, featuring features like tactile signage, audio signals, and haptic feedback. Assistive tools like canes with built-in sensors, smart wheelchairs, and wearable devices that provide real-time feedback on surroundings would become ubiquitous, enabling individuals to navigate their environment with greater ease."
