    "Temperature Extremes: The ocean's temperature at the bottom can be extremely cold, which poses risks to the survival of humans and the functionality of equipment. Cold temperatures can cause equipment to malfunction, and human bodies can be severely impacted by exposure to extreme cold.",
    "Darkness and Visibility: The ocean's depths are shrouded in darkness, making it difficult to navigate and identify potential hazards. This can make it challenging for the mission to safely explore the ocean floor.",
    "Communication and Navigation: In the deep ocean, communication with the surface can be challenging due to the absence of radio waves and the bending of light, which can interfere with sonar navigation. This can make it difficult for the mission to stay connected with the surface and navigate safely.",
    "Biological Hazards: The ocean floor is home to many unknown and potentially dangerous organisms. These creatures could pose a threat to the mission's crew and equipment.",
    "Time and Resource Constraints: A mission to the bottom of the ocean requires a significant amount of time and resources. The mission must plan for the necessary supplies, including food, water, and oxygen, as well as the logistics of launching and retrieving the vehicle."
