    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable, solar-powered generator that can provide electricity for essential needs like lighting, charging devices, and powering a water filtration system. This generator could be built using a combination of solar panels, batteries, and a small gasoline engine.",
    "Utilize Natural Lighting and Ventilation: Design a living space with ample natural lighting and ventilation. Install skylights, larger windows, and vents to allow for maximum airflow. This will help reduce the need for artificial lighting and heating/cooling, which can be particularly energy-intensive.",
    "Create a Composting Toilet System: Develop a composting toilet system that can convert human waste into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. This system would use a combination of microorganisms and heat to break down waste, reducing the need for water and electricity for flushing.",
    "Build a Rainwater Harvesting System: Develop a rainwater harvesting system that can collect and store rainwater for use in irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable purposes. This system could include a series of gutters, downspouts, and storage tanks, and could be integrated with a greywater system to further reduce water consumption.",
    "Implement a Community-Led Food Production System: Create a community-led food production system that allows for the shared cultivation and distribution of food. This could involve the creation of community gardens, greenhouses, and beehives, as well as the establishment of a system for sharing and distributing produce among members of the community. This would not only provide a reliable source of food but also foster a sense of community and cooperation."
