    "**Modular Piano Design**: Design a piano that can be customized with modular components. For example, players could swap out different key types (weighted, synth-action, etc.) or add extra octaves as needed. This would allow musicians to create a personalized instrument that suits their specific playing style and preferences, making the piano more versatile and appealing to a wider range of players.",
    "**Interactive Projection System**: Implement a projection system that displays sheet music or visual aids directly onto the piano or surrounding area. This system could highlight the keys to press in real-time as the player performs, making it easier for beginners to learn songs. Additionally, it could offer interactive lessons and tutorials that adapt to the player's skill level, turning practice into a more immersive experience.",
    "**Sustainable Piano Materials**: Develop a piano made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled wood. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of piano manufacturing but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. The design could incorporate innovative finishes and natural aesthetics, creating a beautiful instrument that aligns with modern sustainability values.",
    "**Integrated Soundscapes and Effects**: Enhance the piano with built-in soundscapes and effects that can be easily accessed through a user-friendly interface. Players could layer sounds like strings, synths, or percussion, allowing for more creative expression. Additionally, effects such as reverb, delay, and modulation could be applied in real-time, transforming the piano into a versatile tool for composition and performance.",
    "**Piano with Adaptive Learning Features**: Introduce a piano that connects to an app designed to adapt to the playerâ€™s learning style. This app could include gamified lessons, challenges, and rewards to motivate players. By tracking progress and providing tailored exercises, the app would help users improve at their own pace while keeping practice fun and engaging."
