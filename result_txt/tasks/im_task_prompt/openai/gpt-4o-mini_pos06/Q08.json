    "**Adjustable Climate Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable climate zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For instance, fruits and vegetables could be stored in a high-humidity zone, while meats could be kept in a lower-humidity, colder zone. This feature would ensure optimal freshness for various food types, extending their shelf life.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism using UV light or ozone to sanitize the interior surfaces of the refrigerator regularly. This feature would help eliminate bacteria and odors, keeping the fridge hygienic without the need for manual cleaning, thus enhancing food safety.",
    "**Energy Harvesting**: Incorporate solar panels or kinetic energy harvesters that can power some of the refrigerator's functions. This could include powering LED lights or smart displays, reducing overall energy consumption and making the appliance more eco-friendly.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional controls with an interactive touchscreen that allows users to manage settings, view recipes, and access nutritional information about the food stored inside. The screen could also feature a digital calendar for meal planning, grocery lists, and reminders for when to use items nearing expiration.",
    "**Multi-Functional Door Design**: Create a refrigerator with a door that can transform into a countertop or a serving station. This would be particularly useful for small kitchens, allowing users to have extra space for meal prep or serving without taking up additional room. The door could also include a built-in wine rack or pull-out shelves for easy access."
