    "Create a Water Filtration System: Design a water filtration system that can filter out impurities from any water source. This could be a portable device that people can carry around to purify water in remote areas or a larger-scale system for cities.",
    "Build a Desalination Plant: If there are no freshwater sources available, consider building a desalination plant to extract saltwater into drinkable water. This could be a costly solution but could provide a reliable source of clean water for years to come.",
    "Use Hydrogen Peroxide: Hydrogen peroxide is a natural disinfectant that can kill bacteria and viruses. Mix hydrogen peroxide with water and use it as a cleaning agent for water sources.",
    "Harvest Rainwater: Collecting rainwater is an easy way to obtain clean drinking water. Install rain barrels or other collection systems to capture rainwater from rooftops and use it for irrigation or washing purposes.",
    "Recycle Greywater: Greywater is wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines. By treating greywater through a simple filtration process, it can be used for watering plants, flushing toilets, or even for drinking if properly treated."
