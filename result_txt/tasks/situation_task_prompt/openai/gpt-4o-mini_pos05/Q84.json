    "**Smart Robotic Exoskeleton**: A wearable robotic exoskeleton could be designed to assist individuals who can no longer stand. This exoskeleton would be lightweight and made from flexible materials, allowing for easy movement. Equipped with sensors that detect the userâ€™s intentions, it would help them walk, climb stairs, or even navigate uneven surfaces. The exoskeleton could also feature a battery that lasts for a full day of use, with a charging station that can be integrated into the home environment, allowing for seamless transitions between sitting and moving.",
    "**Self-Propelling Wheelchair with AI Navigation**: A high-tech wheelchair that utilizes AI and GPS for autonomous navigation would be a game-changer. This wheelchair would have a sleek design and be able to understand verbal commands or pre-set routes. Users could simply tell the wheelchair where they want to go, and it would navigate through indoor and outdoor environments, avoiding obstacles and adjusting its speed based on the surroundings. Additionally, it could be equipped with a built-in health monitoring system, alerting caregivers if any concerning health metrics are detected during use.",
    "**Hoverboard with Adaptive Technology**: Envision a hoverboard designed specifically for those who cannot stand, featuring a reclined seat that allows users to lie back comfortably. This hoverboard would utilize magnetic levitation technology to glide effortlessly above the ground. Users could steer using a joystick or tilt their body slightly to direct movement. With safety features like automatic speed regulation and emergency stop mechanisms, this innovative mode of transport would provide a fun and efficient way to move around.",
    "**Smart Floor Tiles**: A futuristic approach to mobility could involve smart floor tiles embedded with motion sensors and guidance systems. These tiles would be installed in homes or public spaces and could detect the presence of a person using a mobility aid. The tiles would then light up to create a path, guiding the user toward their destination. Additionally, the tiles could communicate with smart devices to provide real-time information about the environment, such as the location of nearby elevators, restrooms, or exits.",
    "**Remote-Controlled Personal Transport Pods**: These small, enclosed pods would be designed for individuals who cannot stand. Users could operate the pods remotely using a smartphone or tablet, allowing them to travel short distances independently. The pods would be equipped with safety features like seatbelts and automatic doors, ensuring a secure ride. They could also include entertainment systems, charging ports for devices, and even climate control, making travel not just functional but enjoyable."
