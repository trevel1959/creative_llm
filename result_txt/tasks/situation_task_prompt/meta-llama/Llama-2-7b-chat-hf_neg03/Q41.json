    "Nature-Inspired Decor: With paint gone, I would turn to nature for inspiration. I would use natural elements like branches, rocks, and shells to create a unique and earthy aesthetic. I would arrange these elements in creative ways to form patterns, shapes, and designs on walls, floors, and ceilings. For example, I could use branches to create a trellis-like pattern on a wall, or use rocks to create a mosaic on a floor.",
    "Light Installations: Since paint is no longer an option, I would focus on using light to create a visually striking decor. I would install LED lights, neon signs, and other lighting elements to create a variety of effects. For example, I could use colored LED lights to create a gradient effect on a wall, or use neon signs to spell out words or phrases.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: With paint gone, I would turn to textiles to add color and pattern to my home. I would use a variety of fabrics, such as wool, cotton, and silk, to create wall hangings, throw pillows, and other decorative elements. I could also use embroidery, beading, or other textile techniques to add intricate details and designs.",
    "Natural Dyes: I would experiment with natural dyes to create a unique and earthy color palette for my home. I could use plants, flowers, and other natural materials to create a variety of colors and shades. For example, I could use beets to create a deep red color, or use turmeric to create a warm yellow shade.",
    "Mirror and Reflection-Based Decor: Since paint is no longer an option, I would focus on using mirrors and reflection to add depth and visual interest to my home. I would hang mirrors in strategic locations to create the illusion of a larger space, or use mirrored surfaces to bounce light around the room. I could also use reflection to create the illusion of movement or activity, such as using a mirror to reflect a nearby window or a moving object."
