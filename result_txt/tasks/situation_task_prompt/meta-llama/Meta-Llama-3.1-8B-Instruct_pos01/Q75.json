    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Develop a system to extract water from the atmosphere, even in arid regions, using advanced nanomaterials and condensation techniques. This water would then be split into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis, with the hydrogen being used as a clean fuel source for vehicles. This system would not only provide a sustainable energy source but also help alleviate water scarcity issues. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Bio-Electrochemical Systems (BES) for Vehicle Power**: Implement BES technology, which harnesses the power of microorganisms to break down organic matter and generate electricity. This could be achieved through the use of microbial fuel cells, where microorganisms convert organic waste into electricity. This system would not only provide a renewable energy source but also help manage waste disposal. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Solar-Powered Super Capacitors**: Develop advanced solar panels that can charge super capacitors, which would store energy for vehicles. This system would utilize the excess energy generated during the day to power vehicles during periods of low sunlight or at night. This would eliminate the need for traditional batteries and provide a more efficient energy storage solution. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Algal Biofuels and Bio-Electrochemical Systems**: Cultivate algae in large-scale photobioreactors to produce biofuels, which would then be used to power vehicles. This system would utilize the waste CO2 from power plants and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The algae would also be used to generate electricity through BES technology, providing a dual-purpose energy solution. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power and Microwave Energy Transmission**: Develop a space-based solar power system that collects solar energy in orbit and transmits it back to Earth as microwave energy. This energy would then be used to power vehicles through advanced microwave receivers. This system would provide a constant and reliable energy source, unaffected by weather or time of day. (Confidence: 0.95)"
