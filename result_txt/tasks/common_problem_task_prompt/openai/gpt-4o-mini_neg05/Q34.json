    "**Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance**: Designing a robot that can navigate through complex environments poses significant challenges. Issues can arise from sensor limitations, such as inaccurate distance measurements or poor performance in low-light conditions. To address this, developers could implement advanced algorithms for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or incorporate multiple types of sensors (e.g., LIDAR, ultrasonic, and infrared) to improve obstacle detection and navigation capabilities.",
    "**Software Integration and Programming Complexity**: The software that controls the robot is crucial and can become complex, especially when integrating multiple systems (e.g., movement, sensing, and communication). A common problem is ensuring that the software is robust enough to handle real-time processing and unexpected scenarios. Utilizing modular programming and employing simulation environments can help test various scenarios before deploying the robot in the real world, reducing the likelihood of software failures.",
    "**Human-Robot Interaction**: As robots are increasingly designed to work alongside humans, ensuring safe and effective interaction is vital. Potential issues include misunderstanding commands, causing accidents, or failing to communicate effectively. Implementing user-friendly interfaces, voice recognition, and machine learning to adapt to user behavior can enhance interaction. Additionally, safety protocols must be established to prevent harm during collaborative tasks.",
    "**Material Selection and Durability**: Choosing the right materials for the robotâ€™s construction is critical for its performance and longevity. Problems may arise from using materials that are too heavy, leading to reduced mobility, or too fragile, resulting in frequent breakdowns. Conducting thorough research on materials, such as lightweight composites or durable plastics, and testing them under various conditions can help mitigate these issues.",
    "**Cost Management and Budget Constraints**: Creating a robot can be an expensive endeavor, and staying within budget is often a challenge. Costs can escalate due to unexpected technical issues, high-quality components, or extensive research and development. To address this, developers can prioritize features, seek funding or partnerships, and consider open-source solutions to minimize costs while still achieving a functional prototype."
