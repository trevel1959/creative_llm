    "**Floral Power Plant**: This unique plant species would be designed to harness solar energy, converting it into nutrients through photosynthesis. It would have large, solar panel-like leaves that capture sunlight during the day. At night, these leaves would release a gentle glow, providing light for nocturnal creatures or even for human use as a natural nightlight. The plant would require minimal maintenance, only needing water and occasional pruning.",
    "**Insect Repellent Garden**: Given the growing concern over pesticide use, this plant species would naturally repel insects using its scent and oils. It would have small, delicate flowers that emit an unpleasant odor when touched by insects. The plant would also produce sticky secretions on its leaves that deter pests from landing or crawling on them. This would make it an attractive addition to gardens, parks, and farms, reducing the need for harmful chemicals.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Tree**: To address water scarcity issues, this tree species would have deep root systems that can efficiently extract moisture from the ground. Its leaves would be designed to capture rainwater, which would then be stored in a reservoir located within the trunk. This reservoir could be accessed by farmers or communities nearby, providing a sustainable source of drinking water or irrigation during dry seasons. The tree would also have a high rate of transpiration, helping to maintain humidity levels in arid environments.",
    "**Autumn Chromatic Leaf**: This plant would feature leaves that change color in response to seasonal changes. In the spring, the leaves might appear green and vibrant, transitioning to shades of orange and red in autumn. The colors would vary depending on the amount of sunlight, temperature, and humidity, creating a dynamic visual display. This plant could serve as a striking landscape feature, offering aesthetic value and educational opportunities about climate change and seasonal cycles.",
    "**Compost-Recycling Flower**: This flower species would incorporate a built-in composting mechanism within its structure. As the flower blooms, it would attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. After the petals fall off, the remaining parts of the flower would decompose, enriching the soil around it with nutrients. This would encourage healthier growth for neighboring plants and potentially improve local ecosystems. The flower could also be designed to produce a pleasant aroma, making it a delightful addition to gardens while benefiting the environment."
