    "Solar System-in-a-Bottle: Redesigning the solar system to fit within a glass bottle, with each planet and celestial body scaled down to fit inside. The bottle would be equipped with a special lamp to simulate the sun's light, and a series of tiny mirrors to mimic the orbits of the planets. This design would allow for a unique and intimate viewing experience, as visitors could observe the solar system up close and personal.",
    "Intergalactic Theme Park: Create a theme park that takes visitors on a journey through the solar system, with each planet and celestial body represented as a unique attraction. For example, the planet Mercury could be themed as a high-speed rollercoaster, while Venus could be transformed into a luxurious spa experience. The park could also feature interactive exhibits and educational displays, allowing visitors to learn about the solar system in a fun and engaging way.",
    "Solar System Sculpture Garden: Design a sculpture garden that incorporates scale models of the solar system's planets and celestial bodies. Each sculpture would be created by a different artist, with each piece reflecting their unique interpretation of the planet or body they were assigned. The garden could also feature interactive installations, such as a \"touchscreen\" that allows visitors to learn more about each planet by touching its corresponding sculpture.",
    "Solar System-Inspired Architecture: Design a building or complex that incorporates elements and designs inspired by the solar system. For example, the building could have a \"sunroom\" with a large glass dome that allows natural light to flood in, just like the sun's rays. The building could also feature a \"Moon Room\" with a soft, glowing light that mimics the moon's luminosity. Other design elements could include a \"Jupiter-inspired\" lobby with a large, sweeping staircase, or a \"Saturn-inspired\" exterior with a ring-shaped courtyard.",
    "Virtual Reality Solar System Tour: Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore the solar system from the comfort of a state-of-the-art VR headset. Visitors could \"travel\" to each planet and celestial"
