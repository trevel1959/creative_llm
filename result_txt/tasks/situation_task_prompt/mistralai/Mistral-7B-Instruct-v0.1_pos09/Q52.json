    "Grill Meal: If all cooking equipment disappeared, I would prepare a meal by grilling my food. I would use a grill pan or a portable grill to cook my protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates. Grilling is a simple yet effective way to cook food, and it requires minimal equipment.",
    "Fire Pit Meal: Another option would be to build a fire pit and cook food over an open flame. I could roast marshmallows, cook hot dogs or sausages, and even make a simple pizza using a cast iron skillet and some toppings. Fire pits are a great way to enjoy a camping-like experience in your own backyard.",
    "Slow Cooker Meal: If all cooking equipment disappeared, I would still be able to cook food using a slow cooker. I could put in my ingredients, set the timer, and let the slow cooker do the work for me. Slow cookers are great for preparing hearty stews, soups, and casseroles.",
    "BBQ Meal: If I had access to a grill, I would prepare a BBQ meal. I could grill steaks, chicken, and vegetables, and even make a simple BBQ sauce using ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. BBQ meals are perfect for outdoor gatherings and picnics.",
    "One-Pot Meal: If all cooking equipment disappeared, I would still be able to cook a meal using a single pot. I could make a simple one-pot meal using rice, vegetables, and protein. One-pot meals are a great way to save time and effort in the kitchen."
