    "**Rule to Promote Universal Literacy**: If I could make one rule that everyone in the world had to follow, it would be that every child must receive a minimum of 12 years of education. This rule would not only guarantee access to information and knowledge but also empower individuals by equipping them with skills necessary for personal development and societal contribution. It would break the cycle of poverty, foster critical thinking, and promote global understanding and cooperation.",
    "**Global Recycling Initiative**: Another rule I would enforce is a universal recycling program that mandates all waste to be sorted and recycled. This would significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and oceans, helping to mitigate environmental degradation. By making recycling mandatory, we can encourage innovation in sustainable practices, foster a culture of responsibility towards the environment, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.",
    "**Universal Healthcare Access**: A rule that ensures every individual has access to affordable healthcare services would dramatically improve public health worldwide. This would include preventative care, regular check-ups, and treatments for both chronic and acute conditions. By addressing health disparities and ensuring equal access to medical care, this rule could lead to a significant reduction in mortality rates, increased life expectancy, and a healthier global population.",
    "**Digital Detox Day**: Given the increasing reliance on technology, enforcing a day of digital detox for everyone would promote mental well-being and social interaction. A designated day where all electronic devices are turned off or put away would encourage face-to-face communication, reflection, and relaxation. This could help reduce the negative effects of excessive screen time, such as eye strain, sleep disorders, and social isolation, while fostering a healthier balance between technology and human interaction.",
    "**Global Carbon Tax**: Implementing a global carbon tax on industries that emit greenhouse gases would incentivize companies to reduce their carbon footprint and transition to more sustainable practices. This rule would level the playing field among countries, encouraging environmental responsibility and promoting the development of clean energy sources. By financially penalizing carbon emissions, we can accelerate the shift towards a low-carbon economy, mitigate climate change, and protect our planet's ecosystems for future generations."
