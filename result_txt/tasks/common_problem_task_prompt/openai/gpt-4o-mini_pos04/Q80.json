    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples can opt for digital invitations to reduce their carbon footprint. If they prefer physical invites, they can choose recycled paper or plantable invitations that grow into flowers or herbs after use. Furthermore, ensuring that the RSVP process is online can minimize paper waste and streamline communication.",
    "**Sustainable Attire Choices**: Finding eco-friendly wedding attire can be difficult, as many wedding dresses and suits are made from non-sustainable materials. Couples can explore options such as renting outfits, buying second-hand, or choosing designers who use sustainable fabrics like organic cotton, hemp, or Tencel. Additionally, they can encourage their wedding party to wear outfits they already own or choose versatile pieces that can be worn again.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Catering is often a significant source of waste at weddings, from food leftovers to single-use utensils. Couples can work with caterers who specialize in zero-waste practices, such as composting food scraps, using seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients, and offering a menu that minimizes excess food. They can also consider buffet-style service, which allows guests to serve themselves and reduces food waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Traditional wedding decor often involves a lot of single-use items that contribute to landfill waste. Couples can focus on decorations that are reusable, rented, or made from sustainable materials. For example, they can use potted plants instead of cut flowers, which guests can take home as favors, or create centerpieces from items they already own. Additionally, they can incorporate natural elements like stones, branches, and leaves to enhance the venueâ€™s beauty without excessive waste.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Coordinating transportation for guests can lead to increased carbon emissions if not planned properly. Couples can encourage carpooling or provide shuttle services to minimize the number of vehicles on the road. They can also choose a venue that is easily accessible by public transport or within walking distance of hotels where guests are staying, making it easier for everyone to reduce their carbon footprint."
