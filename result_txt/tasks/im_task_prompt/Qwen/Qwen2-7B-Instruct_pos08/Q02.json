    "**Bicycle-Based Entrepreneurship Challenge**: Create a business model where bicycles are not just modes of transportation but also tools for solving real-world problems. For example, a bicycle rental service that specializes in delivering goods to local businesses during off-peak hours or a community service that provides bicycles for people in need, like those without access to reliable transportation. This idea challenges the traditional view of bicycles and encourages innovation by leveraging them for social and economic impact.",

By engaging students in practical learning experiences, this program aims to foster a deeper understanding of the importance of sustainable living and the role bicycles can play in promoting a greener future.",
    "**Bicycle Art Installation Project**: Organize a public art project where bicycles are transformed into large-scale sculptures or installations. This could be a community-led effort where participants contribute old bicycles to create a unique piece of art for a public space. The project not only encourages creativity and collaboration but also raises awareness about recycling and repurposing materials. It's an opportunity for the community to see bicycles in a new light and appreciate their artistic value.",
    "**Bicycle Tourism Development Plan**: Create a comprehensive tourism strategy that promotes bicycle travel as a means of experiencing different destinations. This plan could involve developing bike-friendly routes, creating informative guides, and collaborating with local businesses to offer accommodations and services tailored to cyclists. By encouraging tourists to explore destinations on two wheels, this initiative can enhance the local economy, reduce traffic congestion, and promote eco-tourism. It also challenges the conventional modes of transportation and offers travelers a unique, immersive experience."
