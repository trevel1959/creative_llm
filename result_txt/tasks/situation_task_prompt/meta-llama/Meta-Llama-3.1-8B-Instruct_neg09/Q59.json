    "**Solar Energy Harvesting Umbrellas**: Develop umbrellas with built-in solar panels that can harness energy from the sun even when it's cloudy. The energy generated could be stored in a battery or used directly to power small devices like smartphones or laptops.",
    "**Cloud-Penetrating Solar Sails**: Design solar sails that can be deployed in the atmosphere to capture sunlight, even when it's cloudy. These sails would be made of a thin, lightweight material that can absorb and convert sunlight into electricity.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that can extract water vapor from the air, even on cloudy days, and use it to generate electricity through a process called humidification-dehumidification. This method could be powered by a small turbine or generator.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: Create a network of bio-luminescent organisms that can produce light, even in low-light conditions. These organisms could be engineered to thrive in a variety of environments and could potentially be used to illuminate entire cities.",
    "**Advanced Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Systems**: Design CSP systems that can focus sunlight onto a small area, even when it's cloudy, to generate high temperatures and produce electricity. These systems could be powered by a network of mirrors or lenses that track the sun's movement. [/INST] "
