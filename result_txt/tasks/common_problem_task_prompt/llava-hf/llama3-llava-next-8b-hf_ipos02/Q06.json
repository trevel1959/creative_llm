    "Water: Mars is known to have water, but it is frozen and not readily available for human consumption. Establishing a reliable source of water for drinking, cooking, and other uses is vital. This can be achieved through melting ice caps, extracting water from Martian soil, or importing water from Earth.",
    "Gravity: Mars has only about one-third of Earth's gravity. This could cause challenges in maintaining balance and mobility for humans. Designing and constructing habitats that accommodate the reduced gravity is crucial for the well-being of the inhabitants.",
    "Temperature Extremes: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night, with temperatures ranging from -125°C to 20°C. Building structures and vehicles that can withstand these conditions is essential for survival.",
    "Radiation: Mars lacks a protective magnetic field, making it vulnerable to harmful radiation from the sun and deep space. Shielding structures and vehicles from radiation is necessary to protect the inhabitants from potential health risks.",
    "Communication: Due to the vast distance between Mars and Earth, communication with Earth becomes more challenging. Establishing reliable communication systems that can transmit information quickly and efficiently is critical for maintaining contact with Earth and receiving necessary supplies and support."
