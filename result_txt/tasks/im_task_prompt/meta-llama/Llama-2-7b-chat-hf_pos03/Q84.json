    "Smart Coat Rack: Create a coat rack with built-in technology to help you manage your belongings more efficiently. This smart coat rack could have sensors that detect when a coat or other item is placed on it, and it could automatically send notifications to your phone or other device. You could also use it to track your belongings, so you can easily locate them in a crowded room or find out who borrowed your coat without returning it.",
    "Multifunctional Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could have a built-in shoe rack, a place for hanging bags or backpacks, and even a small storage compartment for other items like keys or wallets. This would help you keep everything organized and in one place, making it easier to find what you need when you need it.",
    "Adjustable Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that can be adjusted to fit different sizes of coats and other items. This could be useful for people with a variety of coats or jackets of different lengths, or for families with multiple members who need to hang their belongings in the same space. The adjustable coat rack could have interchangeable arms or hooks that can be moved up or down as needed.",
    "Coat Rack with Built-in Lights: Design a coat rack with built-in lights to help you find what you need more easily in the dark. This could be especially useful for people who enter their home or office after dark or for those who have difficulty seeing in low light conditions. The lights could be positioned on the coat rack in a way that provides illumination without creating shadows or glare.",
    "Magnetic Coat Rack: Create a coat rack with magnetic hooks that can hold your belongings without damaging them. This would be useful for people who have delicate or expensive items that they want to keep safe from scratches or damage. The magnetic hooks could be positioned at different heights or angles to accommodate different sizes of coats and other items."
