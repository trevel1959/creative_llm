    "**Lack of Proper Tools and Equipment**: Building a computer from scratch requires various tools and equipment such as screwdrivers, pliers, thermal paste, and anti-static wristbands. Without these tools, it can be difficult to assemble the components properly and securely, potentially causing damage or malfunction.",
    "**Insufficient Technical Knowledge**: Assembling a computer from scratch requires a certain level of technical knowledge. If the individual building the computer does not have the necessary skills or experience, they may struggle with the assembly process, leading to errors or damage to the hardware.",
    "**Electrical and Thermal Issues**: Building a computer from scratch also involves handling electrical components, which can be dangerous if not handled properly. Additionally, improper thermal management can lead to overheating, which can damage the hardware and shorten its lifespan.",
    "**Cost Management**: While building a computer from scratch can be cost-effective, it can also be expensive if the individual does not have access to the necessary components at a reasonable price. Moreover, they may also inadvertently spend more than expected if they are not careful about comparing prices and features of different components.",
    "**Time Management**: Building a computer from scratch can be a time-consuming process, especially for those who are not familiar with the assembly process. If the individual does not manage their time properly, they may end up spending more time than expected on the project."
