    "**Life Support Systems**: Maintaining a sustainable environment for astronauts is crucial. Problems could arise from the failure of life support systems, which manage air quality, temperature, and water recycling. Engineers need to design robust redundancy systems to handle any malfunctions. Innovative approaches like bio-regenerative life support systems that utilize plants for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange could be explored, but these systems require extensive research and testing to ensure they function effectively over long durations.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: In deep space, navigation becomes a significant challenge due to the lack of reference points. Developing a reliable navigation system that can function without GPS is essential. Additionally, communication delays with Earth can complicate mission operations. Solutions may include autonomous navigation systems using AI and advanced algorithms to analyze stellar positions, as well as establishing relay satellites to enhance communication.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Spacecraft are exposed to cosmic radiation, which can pose severe health risks to astronauts. Designing effective radiation shielding is critical. Innovative materials such as hydrogen-rich compounds or magnetic shielding could be explored. The challenge lies in balancing the weight of these materials with the need for effective protection, as excessive weight can impact fuel efficiency and overall mission feasibility.",
    "**Energy Supply and Management**: Spacecraft require a reliable energy source for propulsion, life support, and onboard systems. Relying solely on solar panels may not be sufficient for missions that travel far from the sun. Therefore, exploring alternative energy sources, such as nuclear power or advanced battery technologies, is essential. Additionally, efficient energy management systems must be developed to prioritize energy use and storage, ensuring that critical systems remain operational during emergencies.",
    "**Psychological Well-being of Crew**: Long-duration space missions can lead to psychological stress among crew members due to isolation and confinement. Designing a spacecraft that includes areas for recreation, social interaction, and personal space is vital. Implementing virtual reality systems for relaxation and entertainment, as well as ensuring regular communication with loved ones on Earth, could help maintain morale and mental health during extended missions."
