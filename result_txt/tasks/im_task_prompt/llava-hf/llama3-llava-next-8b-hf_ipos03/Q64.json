    "Environmental sensors: To enhance the alarm system, add environmental sensors that can detect changes in temperature, humidity, or pressure. This would allow users to monitor their home or office for any unusual conditions, such as a fire or a gas leak.",
    "Smart alarm integration: Integrate the alarm system with smart home devices to create a more comprehensive security solution. This would allow users to control and monitor their home's security from a single interface, such as a smartphone app.",
    "Automated security protocols: Develop automated security protocols that adjust the alarm system's sensitivity based on the time of day. For example, the system could be set to a higher sensitivity during nighttime hours and lower sensitivity during daytime hours when the occupants are likely at home.",
    "Virtual assistant integration: Integrate the alarm system with virtual assistants, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, to allow users to control their security system with voice commands.",
    "Self-powered system: Develop an alarm system that utilizes kinetic energy harvesting technology to power itself. This would make the system more sustainable and eco-friendly, as it would not require any batteries or electricity."
