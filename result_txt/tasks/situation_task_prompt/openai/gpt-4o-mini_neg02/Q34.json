    "**Solar-Powered Fog Nets**: Utilize solar-powered fog nets that capture moisture from the air. These nets would be set up in areas where fog is common, and their fine mesh would trap tiny water droplets that condense and drip down into a reservoir. This method not only conserves water but also harnesses renewable energy to power small pumps that distribute the collected water to your plants.",
    "**Subsurface Irrigation System**: Create a subsurface irrigation system using recycled materials. By burying old pipes or tubes in the soil, you can direct water to the root zones of your plants. These pipes could be connected to a rainwater harvesting system or even a greywater recycling system from your home, allowing you to efficiently use available water resources without relying on rainfall.",
    "**Plant Companion Watering**: Implement a companion planting strategy where certain plants are paired together based on their water needs. Some plants can help retain moisture in the soil, while others may attract water-retaining insects. For example, planting legumes with water-loving crops can create a symbiotic relationship that optimizes water usage. This approach not only supports the plants' hydration but also enhances biodiversity in your garden.",
    "**Aquaponics System**: Set up an aquaponics system that combines fish farming with plant cultivation. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, while the plants filter and clean the water for the fish. This closed-loop system requires minimal external water input and can be a sustainable way to keep your plants thriving without relying on rain.",
    "**Misting Systems with Recycled Water**: Install a misting system that utilizes recycled water from household sources like dishwashing or showering. This system would spray a fine mist over the plants, mimicking rainfall and ensuring even moisture distribution. The misting system could be automated with timers or moisture sensors to optimize water usage and ensure that plants receive just the right amount of hydration."
