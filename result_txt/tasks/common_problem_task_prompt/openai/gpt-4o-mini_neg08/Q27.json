    "**Funding Shortages**: Developing a vaccine requires significant financial resources for research, development, testing, and production. In the case of a new disease, funding may be limited, especially if the disease is not seen as a high priority by governments or investors. This can result in insufficient resources for necessary trials or for scaling up production once the vaccine is developed.",
    "**Public Trust and Acceptance**: Even after a vaccine is developed, public hesitancy can pose a major barrier to widespread adoption. Misinformation, past experiences with vaccines, or distrust in pharmaceutical companies can lead to low vaccination rates, ultimately hindering efforts to control the disease. Engaging communities and addressing concerns becomes critical but challenging.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Once a vaccine is developed, distributing it effectively can be a significant hurdle. Cold chain logistics, particularly for vaccines that require refrigeration, can be difficult to manage, especially in low-resource settings. Additionally, ensuring that the vaccine reaches all populations, including those in remote areas, can be complicated.",
    "**Mutation of the Pathogen**: If the new disease is caused by a virus or bacteria that mutates rapidly, the vaccine may become less effective over time. Researchers must stay ahead of potential mutations to ensure that the vaccine remains relevant, which may require ongoing research and updates to the vaccine formulation.",
    "**Ethical Concerns in Testing**: Conducting clinical trials for a new vaccine raises ethical questions, particularly regarding informed consent and the use of placebos. Researchers must balance the need for rigorous testing with the moral obligation to protect participants, especially if the disease poses a significant risk to certain populations."
