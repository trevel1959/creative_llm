    "Reduced Plastic Waste in Landfills: Rapidly biodegradable plastics would minimize the amount of plastic in landfills, with the reduced demand for non-biodegradable materials, thereby promoting more sustainable practices in industries and consumers.",
    "Aesthetic Transformation: Cities and rural areas would experience more natural beauty, as plastic pollution would be less prevalent. Vegetation and natural landscapes would appear cleaner and healthier, enhancing the overall visual appeal of the environment.",
    "Healthier Oceans and Waterways: Plastic waste, especially from plastic bags and other single-use plastics, would break down before reaching water bodies, such as oceans and lakes, reducing the entry of plastic debris that can harm marine life and ecosystems.",
    "Preservation of Natural Resources: If plastics were biodegradable, the extraction and processing of petroleum-based plastics would be significantly reduced, ultimately conserving non-renewable resources, as well as energy used in plastic production.",
    "Consumer Behavior Change: Biodegradable plastics would encourage responsible waste disposal practices and awareness of plastic pollution issues, inspiring individuals to adopt eco-friendlier habits, leading to overall environmental benefits."
