    "Cellular construction: In a world without natural materials, building a house would require a drastic shift in design and materials. One potential solution is cellular construction, where the structure is made up of interconnected, hollow cells that provide strength and support. These cells could be created using a combination of materials like recycled plastic, metal, and glass fibers. The cells would be connected using a specialized adhesive or bonding agent, creating a strong and durable structure.",
    "Folded plate construction: Another approach to building a house without natural materials is through folded plate construction. Here, thin sheets of metal or plastic are folded and connected to create a series of interlocking plates that form the structure of the house. The plates would be connected using a specialized adhesive or bonding agent, and the structure would be reinforced using internal ribs or frameworks. This method would provide excellent strength and stability, while also allowing for a high degree of customization and design flexibility.",
    "3D printing: In a world without natural materials, 3D printing technology could be used to create entire houses. This process involves layering materials like concrete, plastic, or metal to create a three-dimensional structure. The printer would use a digital blueprint to create the house, allowing for a high degree of precision and customization. The resulting structure would be strong, durable, and energy-efficient, making it an ideal solution for building homes in a world without natural materials.",
    "Geodesic domes: Geodesic domes are a type of structure that are lightweight, strong, and energy-efficient. They are created by connecting a series of interconnected triangles, which provide excellent strength and stability. In a world without natural materials, geodesic domes could be used as a basis for building houses. The domes could be made from a variety of materials, including recycled plastic, metal, or even bioplastics. This approach would provide an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution for building homes.",
