    "Rent a suitcase: If you only need a suitcase for a short trip, consider renting one instead of buying one. This can save you money and reduce clutter in your home. Plus, you can choose a suitcase that suits your needs and style without committing to it.",
    "Upcycle an old suitcase: If you have an old suitcase that you no longer use, consider upcycling it into something new. You can turn it into a coffee table, a bookshelf, or even a storage unit. This can give a new life to an old item and reduce waste.",
    "Use a suitcase as a coffee table: If you have a small living space, consider using a suitcase as a coffee table.
