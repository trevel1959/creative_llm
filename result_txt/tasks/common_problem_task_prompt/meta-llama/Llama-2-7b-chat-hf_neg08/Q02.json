    "Conflicting dietary restrictions: With a large family, there may be individuals with different dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or dairy-free. Ensuring that there is enough food to accommodate everyone's needs without compromising on taste or quality can be a challenge.",
    "Inadequate cooking equipment: Depending on the size of the family, there may not be enough cooking equipment, such as pots, pans, and utensils, to prepare the meal efficiently. This could result in cooking times being extended, or the quality of the food being compromised.",
    "Uncoordinated preparation: With multiple family members helping with the preparation, it's easy for tasks to fall through the cracks or for individuals to work at cross-purposes. Ensuring that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal can be a challenge.",
    "Time management: With so many people involved, it can be difficult to manage the time needed to prepare the meal. It's easy to underestimate the time needed to complete each task, leading to delays and stress.",
    "Overcrowding in the kitchen: As the preparation progresses, the kitchen can become overcrowded with family members, guests, and cooking equipment. This can lead to accidents, spills, and tripping hazards, making the preparation process unsafe and unpleasant."
