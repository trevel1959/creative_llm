    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore the city without being physically present. Users can navigate through the city's streets, buildings, and landmarks using VR goggles and controllers. This would give visitors a unique perspective on the city and allow them to explore areas that may be difficult or impossible to visit in person.",
    "Develop an augmented reality app that overlays the city's 3D model onto the real world. Users can use their smartphone or tablet to scan the city and see the 3D model superimposed onto their surroundings. This would allow visitors to visualize the city's architecture and layout in a new and interactive way.",
    "Create a series of interactive exhibits that use sensors and AI to simulate the city's sounds, smells, and textures. For example, visitors could step into a simulated alleyway and hear the sounds of street performers and vendors, or smell the aroma of food from a nearby restaurant. These exhibits would allow visitors to experience the city in a more immersive and sensory way.",
    "Develop a gamified walking tour of the city that encourages visitors to explore different neighborhoods and landmarks. The tour could use GPS and AR technology to provide visitors with information and challenges as they move through the city. For example, visitors might be asked to find a specific landmark or complete a task at a particular location.",
    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore the city from the perspective of a bird. Users can soar above the city's rooftops, fly over landmarks and parks, and see the city from a completely new angle. This would give visitors a unique perspective on the city and allow them to experience its scale and beauty in a new way."
