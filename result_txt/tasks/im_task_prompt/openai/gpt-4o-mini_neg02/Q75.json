    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Design the sandwich toaster with multiple cooking modes that allow it to perform various functions beyond toasting. These modes could include grilling, baking, and even steaming, enabling users to prepare a wider variety of meals. For instance, a steam mode could be used for healthier sandwiches with vegetables, while a grill mode could be perfect for crispy paninis.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Plates**: Create interchangeable sandwich plates with different textures and designs (e.g., ridged for grill marks, flat for paninis, or patterned for decorative impressions). This would allow users to customize their sandwiches not only in taste but also in presentation, making their meals more visually appealing.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that can store and dispense various fillings, such as cheese, sauces, or vegetables. Users could simply select their desired filling from the interface, and the toaster would automatically add the right amount to their sandwich before toasting. This would streamline the sandwich-making process and reduce mess.",
    "**Voice-Activated Controls**: Add voice-activated controls that allow users to operate the sandwich toaster hands-free. Users could simply say commands like \"start toasting\" or \"add cheese,\" making it more convenient, especially when their hands are busy preparing other ingredients. This feature could also include voice prompts for cooking times and temperatures.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign the sandwich toaster using sustainable and eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing waste. Additionally, a detachable, washable, and biodegradable drip tray could be included to catch excess oil and crumbs, making cleanup easier."
