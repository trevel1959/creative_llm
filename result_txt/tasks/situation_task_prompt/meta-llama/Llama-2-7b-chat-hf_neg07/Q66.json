    "Growable structures: One creative solution to the problem of natural materials disappearing is to design buildings that can grow with the help of plants. This could involve creating structures that are made of a matrix of interconnected cells, similar to a honeycomb, which can be grown using a combination of soil, nutrients, and microorganisms. As the cells grow, they can be expanded or modified to create different parts of the building, such as walls, floors, and roofs.",
    "Biodegradable materials: Another option is to use biodegradable materials that can break down naturally over time, reducing the amount of waste generated during construction and demolition. This could involve using materials like bamboo, straw, or even food waste, which can be combined with natural binders like clay or lime to create strong and durable building materials.",
    "3D printing: With the advent of 3D printing technology, it's now possible to create complex structures using a variety of materials, including recycled plastics, metals, and even food waste. By using 3D printing, it's possible to create buildings that are not only sustainable but also highly efficient and cost-effective, as the process eliminates the need for wasteful cutting and fitting of materials.",
    "Living buildings: Another creative solution is to design buildings that are not just sustainable but also contribute to the surrounding ecosystem. This could involve creating buildings that are covered in green roofs or walls, which can help to purify the air, reduce noise pollution, and provide habitat for local wildlife. The building itself could also be designed to produce its own energy through the use of solar panels, wind turbines, or even algae-based systems.",
    "Space-age materials: Finally, for those who want to push the boundaries of innovation, there are a number of advanced materials that are being developed for use in space exploration that could also be used in building design. These include materials like aerogel, which is a lightweight, highly insulating material that can be used for walls, floors, and roofs, and even materials like graphene, which is a highly durable and conductive material that could be used for a variety of building applications."
