    "**Light Harvesting Drones**: Develop drones that can capture sunlight from areas with less cloud cover and distribute it to urban centers. These drones would be equipped with solar panels and lightweight reflectors to maximize light collection. Once they gather sufficient energy, they could release it in the form of bright LED light in parks or public spaces, creating artificial sunlight zones where people can gather, relax, and enjoy the warmth of \"sunlight.\"",
    "**Cloud-Reflecting Paint**: Invent a special reflective paint that can be applied to rooftops and walls. This paint would have properties that reflect and scatter any available sunlight, creating a brighter atmosphere even on cloudy days. The paint could be embedded with tiny particles that enhance light diffusion, ensuring that spaces feel sunnier. This could be particularly useful in urban areas where sunlight is limited due to tall buildings.",
    "**Bioluminescent Parks**: Design parks that incorporate bioluminescent plants and structures that glow softly in the absence of sunlight. By using genetic engineering, plants could be modified to emit light during the day and night, creating a whimsical and enchanting environment. This would not only provide visual appeal but also encourage outdoor activities regardless of weather conditions, fostering a deeper connection to nature.",
    "**Sunlight Simulation Pods**: Create portable sunlight simulation pods that can be rented or used in homes and offices. These pods would use high-intensity full-spectrum LED lights that mimic natural sunlight, complete with adjustable settings for different times of the day. They could also include features like soundscapes of nature, aromatherapy, and humidity control to create a holistic experience that combats seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and boosts mental well-being.",
    "**Community Light Sharing Program**: Establish a community initiative where individuals can share and exchange light sources. People can donate or lend their high-efficiency light bulbs and fixtures to those who may need extra light during particularly dark and cloudy seasons. This program could also include workshops on energy efficiency and DIY light creation, fostering a sense of community and cooperation while ensuring everyone has access to adequate lighting."
