    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be equipped with solar panels that would convert sunlight into electricity, which would then power the vehicle's electric motor. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions significantly.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option is to switch to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles would use hydrogen as their fuel source and produce only water vapor and heat as emissions. Hydrogen can be produced through various means, including renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. This would provide a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.",
    "Electric Bikes and Scooters: Electric bikes and scooters are another creative solution to power vehicles without oil. These vehicles would be powered by rechargeable batteries, which could be charged using renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. Electric bikes and scooters are already popular in many countries, and their use could significantly reduce carbon emissions from transportation.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Vehicles: Nuclear power could also be used to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared. Nuclear reactors could generate electricity, which could then be used to power electric vehicles. This would provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy for transportation. However, safety concerns and public perception of nuclear power may limit its adoption.",
    "Advanced Biofuels: Advanced biofuels are another option to power vehicles without oil. These fuels are made from renewable sources like algae, agricultural waste, or even carbon dioxide. Advanced biofuels can be used in conventional internal combustion engines, making them a drop-in replacement for fossil fuels. They could also be used in advanced fuel cell vehicles, providing a clean and sustainable source of energy for transportation."
