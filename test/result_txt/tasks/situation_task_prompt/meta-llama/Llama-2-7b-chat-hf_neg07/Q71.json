    "Aerial Gardening: With the ground too hard to dig into, consider using aerial gardening techniques to grow your plants. This involves suspending the plants in the air using a structure made of metal or plastic frames, nets, or even old airplanes. This allows the roots to grow downwards while the leaves and fruits can receive sunlight and nutrients from above.",
    "Geodesic Dome Greenhouses: Design a geodesic dome greenhouse that can be easily assembled and disassembled. The dome shape provides maximum space efficiency and allows for maximum sunlight penetration. The structure can be made of lightweight materials such as PVC pipes and plastic sheeting, making it easy to transport and reassemble in a new location if needed.",
    "Hydroponic Towers: Create a hydroponic tower garden that utilizes the vertical space to grow plants. The tower can be made of a lightweight material such as bamboo or recycled plastic, and can be stacked vertically to maximize space. The plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil, allowing for efficient water usage and maximum growth potential.",
    "Tunnel Greenhouses: Build a tunnel greenhouse that can be easily assembled and disassembled. The tunnel shape provides maximum sunlight penetration and protection from harsh weather conditions. The structure can be made of lightweight materials such as PVC pipes and plastic sheeting, making it easy to transport and reassemble in a new location if needed.",
    "Bio-Dome Greenhouses: Develop a bio-dome greenhouse that utilizes a combination of hydroponics and aeroponics to grow plants. The bio-dome structure is made of a transparent dome-shaped material that allows for maximum sunlight penetration. The inside of the dome is divided into different chambers, each with a different climate and lighting condition, allowing for a wider variety of plants to be grown."
