    "**Dodo Revival with a Twist**: I would choose to bring back the dodo, but with a unique genetic modification. The revived dodo would have a specialized digestive system that allows it to break down and utilize plastic waste as a primary food source. This would not only help to mitigate the issue of plastic pollution but also serve as a symbol of the dodo's resilience and adaptability. The dodo's new role would be that of a \"plastic-eating ambassador,\" educating people about the importance of reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices.",
    "**Giant Ground Sloth as a Climate Change Warrior**: I would choose to bring back the giant ground sloth, a massive herbivore that once roamed the Americas. This massive creature would be reprogrammed to serve as a climate change warrior. Equipped with advanced sensors and communication devices, the giant ground sloth would roam the planet, monitoring and reporting on climate change-related issues such as deforestation, pollution, and extreme weather events. Its massive size and gentle nature would make it an effective ambassador for environmental awareness and conservation.",
    "**Woolly Mammoth as a Regenerative Force**: I would choose to bring back the woolly mammoth, an iconic Ice Age creature. This revived species would be engineered to possess regenerative properties, allowing it to heal damaged ecosystems and restore balance to the natural world. The woolly mammoth would be tasked with regenerating forests, reversing soil erosion, and reintroducing extinct plant species. Its massive size and strength would make it an unstoppable force for good, leaving a lasting impact on the planet.",
    "**Passenger Pigeon as a Symbol of Unity**: I would choose to bring back the passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird species in North America. This revived species would be designed to serve as a symbol of unity and cooperation. With its remarkable ability to form massive flocks, the passenger pigeon would be reprogrammed to bring people together, promoting community building and social cohesion. Its massive migrations would be seen as a celebration of diversity and the beauty of collective action.",
    "**Quagga as a Genetic Engineer**: I was going to choose the quagga, a subspecies of zebra, but I would modify it to have a genetic engineering ability. The quagga would be equipped with a specialized genetic code that allows it to analyze and repair damaged DNA in other species. This would make it a powerful tool for conservation efforts, allowing scientists to study and preserve endangered species. The qu"
