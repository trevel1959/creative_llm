    "Solar-Powered Transportation: The full power of the sun could be harnessed to create solar-powered vehicles that are efficient, clean, and sustainable. This would reduce air pollution and our dependence on fossil fuels for transportation.",
    "Solar-Powered Electricity: With the full power of the sun, we could create a global electricity grid that is entirely powered by solar energy. This would eliminate the need for coal and nuclear power plants, reducing our carbon footprint and providing clean energy to the world.",
    "Solar-Powered Agriculture: Solar-powered irrigation systems and greenhouses could be created to harness the full power of the sun to grow crops and produce food. This would increase food production and provide a sustainable source of food.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification: Harnessing the full power of the sun could be used to create solar-powered water purification systems that could clean polluted water sources and provide clean drinking water to people in need.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination: With the full power of the sun, we could create solar-powered desalination plants that could convert seawater into fresh drinking water. This would provide a sustainable source of water for people living in coastal areas."
