    "Develop a method of harvesting rainwater: This could involve creating a large, elevated surface that collects rainwater, such as a rooftop or a large container. The water can then be filtered and purified using various methods, such as UV sterilization or reverse osmosis.",
    "Use desalination technology: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe for drinking. This could involve using a distillation process or a reverse osmosis system to remove the impurities.",
    "Extract water from food: This could involve extracting water from fruits, vegetables, and other food sources using a process called \"micro-extraction.\" This method involves using a small amount of solvent to extract the water, which can then be purified and used for drinking.",
    "Create a water filtration system: This could involve using a combination of physical and chemical filtration methods to remove impurities from water. This could include using activated carbon, sand, and other materials to remove contaminants, as well as using chemicals such as chlorine or iodine to kill bacteria and viruses.",
    "Develop a new source of water: This could involve exploring alternative sources of water, such as geothermal water or water from underground aquifers. These sources may be less polluted and can be used as a source of clean drinking water."
