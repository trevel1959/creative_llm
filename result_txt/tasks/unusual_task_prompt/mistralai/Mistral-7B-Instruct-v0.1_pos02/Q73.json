    "Lightbulb Idea 1: Create a smart lighting system that uses AI to adjust the color temperature and brightness of the bulbs based on the time of day, weather, and user preferences. This could help people feel more alert and productive during the day and more relaxed in the evening.",
    "Lightbulb Idea 2: Develop a lighting system that uses bioluminescent bacteria to create a natural and sustainable source of light. This could be particularly useful in remote areas or in environments where traditional lighting sources are not available.",
    "Lightbulb Idea 3: Create a lighting system that uses holographic technology to project images onto the walls and ceilings. This could be used to create a more immersive and engaging environment in retail spaces, entertainment venues, and other public areas.",
    "Lightbulb Idea 4: Develop a lighting system that uses infrared technology to detect the presence of people and adjust the brightness and color temperature of the bulbs accordingly. This could help to conserve energy and reduce the need for manual lighting controls.",
    "Lightbulb Idea 5: Create a lighting system that uses solar energy to power the bulbs. This could be particularly useful in areas with limited access to electricity, and could help to reduce the carbon footprint of lighting systems."
