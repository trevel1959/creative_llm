    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of mist collectors and condensers that can capture and condense water vapor from the clouds, generating a steady supply of freshwater. This water could be used for irrigation, drinking, or even as a source of energy through hydroelectric power.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Organisms**: Engineer microorganisms that can produce light through bioluminescence, allowing for the creation of artificial sunlight. These organisms could be integrated into urban planning, providing sustainable lighting for cities and communities.",
    "**Solar Concentrators**: Design and deploy large-scale solar concentrators that can focus and amplify sunlight, even on cloudy days. These concentrators could be installed on rooftops, in public spaces, or even as part of urban infrastructure, providing a reliable source of solar energy.",
    "**Cloud-Sourced Energy**: Develop a system that harnesses the energy generated by cloud formations, such as cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce electrical charges. This energy could be captured and converted into usable power, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources.",
    "**Optical Fiber Networks**: Establish a network of optical fibers that can transmit sunlight from areas with abundant sunlight to regions with limited sunlight. This would enable the distribution of sunlight across the globe, providing a reliable source of energy and illumination. "
