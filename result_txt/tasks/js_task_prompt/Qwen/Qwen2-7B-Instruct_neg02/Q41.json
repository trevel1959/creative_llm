    "**Global Literacy Requirement**: The rule I'd propose is for every person in the world to achieve a basic level of literacy by age 18. This would include reading, writing, and fundamental numeracy skills. The reason behind this rule is that literacy is a foundational skill that empowers individuals, fosters critical thinking, and promotes access to information. By ensuring global literacy, we can significantly enhance education levels, reduce poverty, improve healthcare outcomes, and promote peace and understanding among different cultures.",
    "**Universal Health Coverage**: My second idea would be to mandate universal health coverage for all citizens. This means providing access to affordable healthcare services to everyone, regardless of their income or social status. This rule aims to reduce disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility, improve public health, and ensure that no one has to suffer or die due to lack of medical care. By investing in healthcare, we invest in the well-being of our societies, which ultimately contributes to economic growth and stability.",
    "**Zero Waste Lifestyle**: Another rule I'd suggest is for everyone to adopt a zero waste lifestyle. This would involve minimizing waste production, reusing items as much as possible, and recycling materials effectively. The purpose of this rule is to address the global issue of waste management and environmental degradation. By reducing our reliance on single-use products and adopting sustainable consumption habits, we can help conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.",
    "**Digital Detox Periods**: I propose instituting mandatory digital detox periods for individuals to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the physical world. These periods could be set aside during specific times of the year or after prolonged periods of screen usage. The goal is to reduce the negative impacts of excessive screen time on mental health, relationships, and productivity. By encouraging people to unplug and engage in activities like reading, outdoor exercise, or socializing, we can foster healthier lifestyles and more meaningful connections.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Programs**: Lastly, my idea would be to create comprehensive cultural exchange programs where students, professionals, and retirees from all over the world have the opportunity to live, work, or study in other countries for extended periods. This rule aims to promote cross-cultural understanding, break down stereotypes, and foster global cooperation. By exposing people to diverse perspectives, languages, and ways of life, we can build stronger international relationships, enhance empathy, and create a more unified global community that values diversity and collaboration."
