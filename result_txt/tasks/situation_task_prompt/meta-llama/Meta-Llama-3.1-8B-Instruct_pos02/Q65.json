    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: I would cultivate a specific type of bioluminescent plant, such as the glowing mushroom or the glowing vine, to illuminate the room. These plants would be strategically placed around the space to create a warm and cozy ambiance. As the plants absorb light during the day, they would emit a soft, ethereal glow at night, providing a unique and sustainable lighting solution.",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optics**: I would design a network of glowing fiber optics that crisscross the room, creating a web-like pattern. These fibers would be made from a special material that absorbs and stores light energy during the day, releasing it at night in a soft, pulsing glow. This would create a futuristic and mesmerizing ambiance, perfect for a modern living space.",
    "**Candle-Lanterns with Solar-Powered Wicks**: I would create a series of candle-lanterns that use solar-powered wicks to burn a special type of wax that is infused with a fragrance. The wicks would be made from a sustainable material that is both durable and long-lasting. As the sun sets, the wicks would ignite, casting a warm, golden light throughout the room. This would create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a rustic or vintage-inspired space.",
    "**LED-Crystal Chandeliers**: I would design a stunning LED-crystal chandelier that uses a combination of LED lights and crystals to create a breathtaking display of light and color. The crystals would refract and reflect the light, casting a kaleidoscope of colors throughout the room. This would be a show-stopping centerpiece for any room, adding a touch of luxury and sophistication to the space.",
    "**Glowing River Stones**: I would collect a series of glowing river stones that have been imbued with a special type of luminescent material. These stones would be placed along a winding path or around a seating area, creating a sense of wonder and enchantment. As the stones absorb light during the day, they would emit a soft, blue-green glow at night, casting an ethereal ambiance throughout the room. This would be a unique and captivating way to light up a room, perfect for a nature-inspired or spiritual space."
