Each juice can be tailored to specific health benefits like detoxification, immunity boost, or energy enhancement. This not only provides convenience but also promotes healthy living.",
    "**Smart Juicer with Health Tracking**: Design a smart juicer that connects to a mobile app, allowing users to input their health data (like age, weight, and activity level) to suggest the best recipes for their needs. The juicer could even track nutrient intake over time and send personalized recommendations based on consumption patterns. ",

This adds an element of engagement and education, making the juice buying experience more enjoyable and informative.",
    "**Juice and Superfood Infused Snack Boxes**: Offer pre-packed boxes containing a variety of juices along with superfoods like chia seeds, goji berries, and spirulina.
