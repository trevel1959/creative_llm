    "Environmental damage: As national parks are natural environments, they are often subject to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, and landslides. Managing these risks can be challenging and expensive. A potential solution is to use satellite-based monitoring and early warning systems to predict and prevent disasters, while also developing sustainable and eco-friendly strategies to mitigate the impact of human activities on the environment.",
    "Overcrowding: National parks are often popular tourist destinations, and they can become overcrowded, causing damage to the environment and reducing the quality of visitors' experiences. One solution is to implement a crowd management system that encourages visitors to visit during off-peak hours or that limits the number of visitors in certain areas of the park.",
    "Water pollution: As national parks often have bodies of water, they can be affected by pollution from human activities such as littering and sewage discharges. Another issue is the increasing threat of invasive species, which can outcompete and harm the native fauna. One solution is to invest in water quality monitoring and improvement, as well as implementing educational programs to increase awareness of the impact of pollution on the environment.",
    "Maintenance and preservation: National parks require significant resources to maintain and preserve, including the management of infrastructure such as trails, buildings, and restrooms. Funding shortfalls can limit the ability to carry out necessary maintenance and restoration work, leading to erosion, landslides, and other environmental degradation. Another solution is to seek partnerships with private organizations and pursue alternative revenue sources, such as concession rights or public-private partnerships.",
    "Climate change: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, as they are home to many vulnerable plant and animal species. One solution is to invest in climate adaptation and resilience strategies, such as developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, implementing conservation programs to protect vulnerable species, and promoting sustainable practices among visitors."
