    "**Adjustable Boot Size Technology**: Develop roller skates with a boot that can easily adjust in size to accommodate growing feet or different foot shapes. This could be achieved using a combination of elastic materials and a simple dial or lever mechanism. This innovation would make the skates more versatile and reduce the need for frequent replacements, making them a more sustainable choice.",
    "**LED Light-Up Wheels with Custom Patterns**: Introduce wheels that feature customizable LED lights that can display different colors and patterns while skating. Users could sync the lights with music or select preset patterns through a mobile app. This would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also increase visibility for safety during night skating.",
    "**Interchangeable Wheel Systems**: Create a roller skate design that allows users to easily swap out wheels based on their skating style or terrain. For example, softer wheels for indoor skating and harder wheels for outdoor use. This could be achieved with a simple click-and-lock mechanism, allowing skaters to quickly adapt to different environments without needing specialized tools.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Incorporate small, waterproof Bluetooth speakers into the skates that allow users to listen to music while they skate. This feature could also include a microphone for hands-free calling. The speakers could be designed to provide good sound quality without compromising the weight or balance of the skates, enhancing the overall skating experience.",
    "**Enhanced Ankle Support with Smart Adjustment**: Develop skates that feature an adjustable ankle support system that can be fine-tuned based on the skater's preference and skill level. This could involve a combination of flexible materials and a smart tightening mechanism that can be adjusted via a mobile app, providing optimal support for beginners and advanced skaters alike."
