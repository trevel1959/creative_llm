    "**Gravitational Harness**: Develop a wearable harness that utilizes gravitational manipulation technology to create a localized gravitational field, allowing the user to move around while seated or lying down. This harness would use subtle gravitational waves to propel the user forward, side to side, or even vertically, effectively giving the user a new sense of mobility.",
    "**Aerial Personal Transportation (APT)**: Design an APT system that consists of a network of hovering, AI-powered drones that can be summoned to transport a seated or lying person. These drones would be equipped with advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance systems, ensuring safe and efficient transportation. Users could command their APT drones using voice commands, gestures, or even brain-computer interfaces.",
    "**Smart Walker**: Create a smart walker that uses advanced robotics and AI to provide support and mobility assistance. This walker would be equipped with multiple wheels, allowing it to move smoothly and efficiently, while also featuring advanced sensors and algorithms to detect and adapt to various terrain and obstacles. Users could control the walker using voice commands, gestures, or even neural interfaces.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: Design an exoskeleton suit that provides users with enhanced mobility and support. This suit would be equipped with advanced actuators, sensors, and AI-powered control systems, allowing users to move around with greater ease and precision. The suit could be controlled using voice commands, gestures, or even neural interfaces, and would be tailored to meet the specific needs and abilities of each user.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Mobility Pod**: Develop a Maglev Mobility Pod that uses magnetic levitation technology to transport users through a network of vacuum-sealed tubes. This pod would be designed to accommodate seated or lying users, and would use advanced navigation and control systems to ensure safe and efficient transportation. Users could command their Maglev Mobility Pod using voice commands, gestures, or even brain-computer interfaces. [/INST] "
