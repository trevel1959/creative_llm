    "**Innovative Bicycle Horn Design**: Design a bicycle bell that doubles as a small emergency light or a Bluetooth speaker. The bell could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to choose from different sounds (including their own custom ringtones). The light feature can help increase visibility in low-light conditions, while the speaker can play music or safety messages.",
    "**Therapeutic Bicycle Bells**: Create bicycle bells that emit soothing tones when pressed, designed for people who find the traditional jingle jangle of a bell irritating. These bells could produce calming frequencies, potentially reducing stress for both the rider and those around them.",
    "**Customizable Bicycle Bell Cases**: Develop a system where the bell itself is detachable and replaceable, allowing cyclists to switch out the bell for different designs, colors, or even personalized engravings. This could foster a sense of ownership and customization among cyclists, making each ride unique.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bells**: Design a bicycle bell that harnesses solar energy to operate. It would charge during the day through an integrated solar panel, ensuring it's always ready to sound. This eco-friendly option reduces reliance on batteries and promotes sustainable practices.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bells**: Create a smart bell that not only alerts pedestrians but also interacts with other connected devices. For example, it could send a notification to a nearby traffic light, indicating the presence of a cyclist. Additionally, it could integrate with GPS to alert riders of potential hazards or changes in traffic conditions ahead. "
