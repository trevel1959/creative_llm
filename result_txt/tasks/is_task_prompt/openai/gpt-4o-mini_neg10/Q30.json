    "Once upon a time, in a land where dragons soared high, there lived a peculiar dragon named Ember. Unlike his fiery kin, Ember was terrified of fire. While others breathed flames and lit up the night sky, he hid in the shadows, dreaming of a world where he could fly without fear. One day, a fierce storm threatened his village, and only Ember could save the day. Gathering his courage, he soared into the storm, discovering that his fear was merely a shadow. With a mighty roar, he unleashed a gentle flame, guiding lost villagers home. From that day on, Ember embraced his uniqueness.",
