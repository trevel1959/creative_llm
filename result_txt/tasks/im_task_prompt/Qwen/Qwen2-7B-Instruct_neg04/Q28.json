    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: This innovative helmet would integrate solar panels into its design to charge a built-in battery. The battery can power lights or other safety features on the helmet. The solar panels would be strategically placed on the helmet's surface to ensure maximum exposure to sunlight, enhancing visibility and safety during night rides.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: This helmet would incorporate a BCI system that reads brain signals from the rider. It could translate these signals into commands for the bike's motor, allowing riders to control speed, acceleration, or even make turns by simply thinking about them. It would also monitor the rider's mental state, alerting them when they need to take a break due to fatigue or stress.",
    "**Ergonomically Adjustable Bicycle Helmet**: This helmet would use advanced materials and technologies to adjust its fit and shape based on the rider's head size and position. It would use sensors to detect the rider's head movement and automatically adjust its shape to provide the best possible comfort and safety. This would be particularly beneficial for long-distance cyclists who might need to change their riding position frequently.",
    "**Bike Helmet with Built-in Virtual Reality (VR) Headset**: This helmet would feature a VR headset integrated into it, allowing riders to experience immersive virtual reality content while cycling. The helmet would have speakers for audio, and a display screen for visual content. This could be used for educational purposes, such as virtual tours of different cycling routes, or for entertainment, such as watching movies or playing games.",
    "**Bike Helmet with Built-in Health Monitoring System**: This helmet would include various sensors to monitor the rider's health parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, and even oxygen saturation levels. It would also have GPS capabilities to track the route and distance covered. In case of any emergency, the helmet could send an alert to the rider's contacts or call for help directly from the helmet. This would be especially useful for cyclists who might be alone on longer rides."
