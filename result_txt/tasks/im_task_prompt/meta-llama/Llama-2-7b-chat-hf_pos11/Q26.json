    "Trash Can Time Machine: Create a time-traveling trash can that can transport waste to different eras of history. The can would be equipped with a time-traveling mechanism, and when thrown away, it would transport the trash to a designated time period. For example, if you threw away a plastic water bottle, it would end up in a recycling facility in ancient Egypt.",
    "Smart Trash Can: Develop a trash can that can sort and recycle waste on its own. The can would be equipped with sensors and AI technology that can identify different types of waste and sort them accordingly. For example, it could separate organic waste from non-organic waste, or plastic from glass. This would reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and increase recycling rates.",
    "Trash Can Garden: Create a trash can that doubles as a garden planter. The can would be made of a biodegradable material and would have small plants growing inside. When the trash is thrown away, the plants would continue to grow, providing a natural and sustainable way to dispose of waste.",
    "Interactive Trash Can: Develop a trash can that can engage with people and provide information on waste management. The can would have a touchscreen display that can provide information on recycling, composting, and other sustainable practices. It could also offer tips and suggestions on how to reduce waste and live more sustainably.",
    "Trash Can Music Box: Create a trash can that plays music when it's full. The can would be equipped with a small speaker and a sensor that detects when it's full. When the can is full, it would play a soothing melody, reminding people to empty it and reduce their waste. This would also serve as a fun and creative way to encourage people to recycle and reduce their environmental impact."
