    "**Smart Sound Adaptation**:    Integrate AI technology that analyzes the acoustics of the environment in real-time and adjusts the speakerâ€™s output accordingly. For example, if the speaker is placed in a small room with hard surfaces, it could automatically adjust to minimize echo and optimize sound quality. This feature could be controlled via a mobile app, allowing users to select their preferred sound profile or let the speaker adapt automatically.",
    "**Solar Charging Capability**:    Enhance the portability of the Bluetooth speaker by incorporating solar panels on its surface. This would allow the speaker to charge itself during outdoor use, making it ideal for camping, beach trips, or other outdoor activities. The solar panels could be designed to blend seamlessly with the speaker's aesthetics, ensuring it remains stylish while being functional.",
    "**Integrated Voice Assistant with Custom Commands**:    Instead of just connecting to existing voice assistants, create a built-in voice assistant that allows users to set custom commands for specific functions. For example, users could program phrases to adjust volume, change tracks, or switch between audio sources. This would enhance user experience by providing more intuitive control over the speaker without needing to access a phone or app.",
    "**Multi-User Sound Zones**:    Develop a feature that allows the speaker to create different sound zones in a room. By using multiple drivers and smart technology, the speaker could direct sound in specific directions, enabling different users in the same space to enjoy different audio experiences. This would be particularly useful in shared living spaces, allowing roommates or family members to listen to different music or podcasts simultaneously without interference.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**:    Integrate health monitoring sensors into the speaker that can track ambient noise levels and advise users on optimal listening habits to protect their hearing. The speaker could alert users if the volume is too high for extended periods or provide reminders to take breaks during long listening sessions. This feature could also include a sleep timer that gradually lowers the volume to promote better sleep hygiene."
