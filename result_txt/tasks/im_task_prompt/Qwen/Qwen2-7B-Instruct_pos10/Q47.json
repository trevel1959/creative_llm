    "**Innovative Cleaning Robot Integration**: Create a hybrid vacuum cleaner that can be controlled via an app on your smartphone. This robot can be programmed to clean different areas of your home at specific times or when triggered by certain conditions like dirt sensors or motion detectors. The robot could also have voice recognition capabilities, allowing users to give cleaning commands hands-free.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Vacuum Filters**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that has self-cleaning filters. The vacuum could automatically detect when the filter is dirty and use a combination of vibration, heat, or water (depending on the model) to clean the filter. This would save time and effort for the user, who would no longer need to manually clean or replace the filter.",
    "**Energy-Saving Mode**: Design a vacuum cleaner that adapts its suction power based on the type of floor being cleaned. For instance, on hardwood floors, the vacuum could use less power to avoid damaging delicate surfaces while maintaining high efficiency on carpets. This not only saves energy but also prolongs the life of the vacuum motor.",
    "**Smart Dustbin Integration**: Create a vacuum cleaner that seamlessly connects to a smart dustbin. The vacuum can automatically deposit its contents into the dustbin when full, and the dustbin can alert the user when it's time for emptying or maintenance. This system ensures continuous cleaning without interruption and reduces the need for manual handling of dirty dustbins.",
    "**Wearable Vacuum Cleaner Technology**: Develop a wearable vacuum cleaner that can be worn around the waist or on the back. This device would be lightweight and compact, allowing for easy maneuverability and hands-free cleaning. It could be particularly useful for cleaning stairs, tight corners, or high-up areas where traditional vacuums are cumbersome. The wearable vacuum could also be equipped with sensors to optimize suction strength based on the surface being cleaned."
