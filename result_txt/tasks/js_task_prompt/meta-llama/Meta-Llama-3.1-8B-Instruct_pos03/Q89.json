    "**EchoPulse**: A language that utilizes a unique sound wave pattern, where words are composed of a series of echoes and pulses. The speaker would produce a sound, and then immediately repeat it back, creating a harmonious echo. This would be followed by a brief pause, and then a series of pulses that represent the grammatical structure and meaning of the word. For example, the word \"hello\" might sound like \"hello...hello...da-da-da\". The speaker would adjust the pitch, tone, and duration of the pulses to convey different emotions and nuances.",
    "**Chroma**: A language that uses color as a primary means of communication. Each word would be associated with a specific color, and the speaker would use a combination of colors to convey meaning. For example, the word \"happy\" might be represented by a bright yellow, while \"sad\" would be a deep blue. The speaker would use a palette of colors to paint a picture of the meaning, with the intensity and saturation of the colors conveying different shades of emotion.",
    "**Resonance**: A language that relies on the speaker's physical presence and resonance to convey meaning. The speaker would use their body to create different resonant frequencies, such as tapping their feet on the ground or slapping their hands on their thighs. Each word would have a unique resonant frequency associated with it, and the speaker would adjust their body position and movement to create the desired resonance. For example, the word \"strong\" might be represented by a deep, rumbling frequency, while \"light\" would be a high-pitched, tinkling sound.",
    "**Aerotop**: A language that uses a combination of air pressure and topology to convey meaning. The speaker would use their mouth and tongue to create different air pressure patterns, such as blowing air through their teeth or creating a vacuum with their lips. Each word would be associated with a specific topological feature, such as a hill or a valley, and the speaker would adjust the air pressure and movement to create the desired topological pattern. For example, the word \"fast\" might be represented by a series of sharp, high-pressure blasts, while \"slow\" would be a gentle, low-pressure hum.",
    "**SonicSculpture**: A language that uses sound waves to create three-dimensional sculptures in the air. The speaker would use a combination of frequency, amplitude, and spatial arrangement to create a complex sound wave pattern that would manifest as a tangible, three-dimensional"
