    "One night, a little girl named Lily fell asleep clutching her beloved teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles. As the clock struck midnight, Mr. Snuggles magically came to life! He tiptoed out of the bedroom and into the moonlit garden. There, he met a wise old owl who told him of a hidden treasure buried beneath the ancient oak tree. With the owl's guidance, Mr. Snuggles dug deep and uncovered a chest filled with shimmering stars. He gathered them up and returned to Lily, sprinkling the stars around her room. From that night on, her dreams sparkled brighter than ever. ",
