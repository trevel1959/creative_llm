    "**Funding Constraints**: Launching a satellite into space is an expensive endeavor. Not only does it require substantial investment for the satellite itself, but also for the rocket or launch vehicle, ground support systems, and other associated costs like insurance, legal fees, and research & development. Financial constraints can hinder the project's progress or lead to compromises in quality or scope.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Space launches involve the use of rockets, which release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. There are concerns about the environmental impact of these emissions, including contributing to climate change and potentially affecting wildlife and ecosystems near launch sites.",
    "**Space Traffic Management**: As more satellites are launched, managing space traffic becomes increasingly complex. Ensuring safe distances between satellites, avoiding collisions, and dealing with space debris all pose challenges. Regulations and international agreements on space traffic management need to be developed and enforced effectively.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite requires compliance with numerous regulations from various governmental bodies. These can include safety standards, environmental impact assessments, and international treaties governing the use of outer space. Failure to comply can result in legal penalties, delays, or even cancellation of the launch.",
    "**Communication and Navigation Challenges**: Satellites rely heavily on precise communication and navigation systems to maintain their orbits and perform their functions. Any disruptions in these systems, such as interference from other satellites, Earth's atmospheric conditions, or natural disasters, could lead to operational failures or loss of the satellite."
