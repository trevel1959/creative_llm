    "**Inflation Surge**: The sudden erasure of debt could lead to a massive increase in money supply as governments might print more currency to stimulate their economies. This influx of cash could cause inflation to skyrocket, diminishing the purchasing power of citizens. Prices for goods and services might rise sharply, leading to economic instability and potential social unrest as people struggle to afford basic necessities.",
    "**Loss of Trust in Financial Systems**: If all debt were erased, it could undermine trust in financial institutions and the concept of credit. Investors might become wary of lending money, fearing that their loans could be rendered worthless in a similar event. This could lead to a liquidity crisis, where businesses and individuals find it difficult to secure loans, stifling economic growth and innovation.",
    "**Disruption of Global Trade**: Many countries rely on debt to finance trade and imports. The sudden removal of debt obligations could disrupt established trade relationships, as countries might be unable to purchase necessary goods without credit. This could lead to shortages of essential items, destabilizing economies and potentially leading to geopolitical tensions as nations scramble to secure resources.",
    "**Inequality and Wealth Redistribution**: While erasing debt might seem like a way to promote equality, it could also exacerbate existing inequalities. Wealthy individuals and corporations often hold significant assets that are not tied to debt, meaning they might benefit disproportionately from the economic reset. Conversely, those who rely on credit for basic needs could find themselves worse off, leading to a new cycle of inequality.",
    "**Moral Hazard and Recklessness**: If all debt were forgiven, it could create a moral hazard where countries and individuals might take on excessive risk, believing that they would not have to face the consequences of their financial decisions. This could lead to a culture of recklessness, where fiscal responsibility is disregarded, potentially resulting in future economic crises as governments and individuals overextend themselves without fear of repercussions."
