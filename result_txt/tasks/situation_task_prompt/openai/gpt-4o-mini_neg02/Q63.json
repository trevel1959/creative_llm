    "**Smartphone-Controlled Locks**: Utilize smart locks that can be controlled via a smartphone app. These locks would use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to allow users to lock or unlock their belongings remotely. For added security, the app could send alerts when someone attempts to tamper with the lock, and users could share temporary digital keys with trusted friends or family members. This way, even if traditional keys are gone, you still have control over who can access your belongings.",
    "**Geo-Fencing Security**: Implement a geo-fencing system that creates a virtual perimeter around your belongings. If an item, such as a bike or a suitcase, is moved outside this designated area, an alarm is triggered, and notifications are sent to your smartphone. This technology could be combined with GPS tracking to locate stolen items, providing a proactive approach to securing belongings without the need for physical keys.",
    "**Lockboxes with QR Code Access**: Design lockboxes that can be opened using a QR code system. Users can generate unique QR codes through an app that can be scanned to unlock the box. This system allows for temporary access codes to be shared with others without the need for physical keys. Additionally, the app could log access attempts and allow users to revoke access at any time, enhancing security while remaining keyless.",
    "**Security Furniture**: Create furniture with built-in security features, such as drawers or compartments that can only be accessed through specific patterns of knocks or taps. For example, a coffee table could be designed to recognize a sequence of taps that unlocks a hidden compartment. This not only secures valuables but also adds an element of intrigue and design to your living space.",
    "**Personalized Security Codes**: Implement a system where all belongings are secured with personalized security codes that can be entered on a keypad. Users could choose their own codes, and for extra security, the system could require a combination of actions, such as entering a code and performing a gesture (like a swipe or a tap). This would make it difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access, as they would need to know both the code and the gesture."
