    "**Ecological Domino Effect**: The sudden loss of insects would trigger a chain reaction, affecting various ecosystems. Without pollinators like bees and butterflies, plant reproduction would decline, leading to reduced food sources for herbivores and subsequently carnivores. This would cause a ripple effect, impacting the entire food chain. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Soil Degradation**: Insects play a crucial role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients. Without them, soil would become depleted, affecting plant growth and fertility. This could lead to reduced crop yields, decreased land values, and increased erosion. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Loss of Medicinal Resources**: Many insects, like certain beetles and ants, produce compounds with medicinal properties. The disappearance of these insects would deprive humans of potential treatments for various diseases. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Disruption of Nutrient Cycling**: Insects are essential for breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients. Without them, nutrients would accumulate in ecosystems, leading to an imbalance and potentially causing the death of certain plant and animal species. Confidence: 0.85",
    "**Increased Pest Populations**: Insects often serve as natural predators or competitors to other pests. Without them, populations of pests like rodents, slugs, and snails could explode, causing significant damage to crops and ecosystems. Confidence: 0.9"
