    "The water on the surface of the Earth would not flow as smoothly, as the reduced gravity would make it difficult for water to flow downhill.",
    "The rotation of the Earth would slow down, causing the length of the day to increase.",
    "The atmosphere would be less dense, making it difficult for gases to stay in the air.",
    "The Earth's climate would change, as the reduced gravity would cause the oceans to evaporate and move to the upper atmosphere.",
    "The movement of tectonic plates would be affected, potentially causing more frequent and intense earthquakes."
