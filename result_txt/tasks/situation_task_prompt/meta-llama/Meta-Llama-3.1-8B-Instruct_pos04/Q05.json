    "**Solar-Powered Umbrellas**: Develop an innovative, portable umbrella that harnesses solar energy during the day to store electricity in a battery. This stored energy can then be used to power a built-in LED light source, providing a reliable and self-sustaining light source for users.",
    "**Luminescent Pathways**: Create a network of luminescent pathways made from a specially designed, glow-in-the-dark material that can absorb and store energy during the day. These pathways can be embedded in roads, sidewalks, or other public areas, providing a safe and efficient way to navigate in low-light conditions.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Design an atmospheric water harvester that can collect and condense water vapor from the air, producing a clean and reliable source of drinking water. This system can also be integrated with a water-based solar still, which uses the sun's heat to purify the water, making it safe for consumption.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Walls**: Develop a living wall system that incorporates bioluminescent plants, such as glowing mushrooms or algae, to create a self-sustaining light source. These plants can absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, making them a valuable addition to urban ecosystems.",
    "**Quantum Dot Window Film**: Create a revolutionary window film that incorporates quantum dots, which can absorb and convert sunlight into a usable energy source. This film can be applied to windows, providing a transparent and energy-harvesting surface that can power small devices or charge batteries. In the absence of sunlight, the film can also be used to filter and concentrate available light, making it more efficient for use.
