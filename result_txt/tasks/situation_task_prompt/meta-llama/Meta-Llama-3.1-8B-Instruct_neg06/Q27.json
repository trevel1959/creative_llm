    "**Solar-Powered Radiator**: Design a solar-powered radiator that captures and stores thermal energy during the day. This energy is then released at night to warm the space. The radiator would be a large, south-facing window with a specialized coating that absorbs solar radiation. At night, a heat pump would transfer the stored thermal energy from the coating to the space, maintaining a comfortable temperature.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling with Phase Change Materials**: Develop an evaporative cooling system that incorporates phase change materials (PCMs) to regulate indoor temperature. PCMs would be integrated into a network of pipes or channels, allowing them to absorb and release heat as they change phase. As the air passes through the system, the PCMs would absorb heat, cooling the air, and then release it back into the space as the air passes through.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting from Appliances**: Create a system that captures and converts waste heat from household appliances, such as refrigerators and ovens, into usable thermal energy. This could be achieved through a network of heat exchangers and thermoelectric devices that convert the waste heat into electricity or thermal energy. The system would be integrated into the appliances themselves or as a separate unit.",
    "**Greenhouse-Integrated Passive Heating and Cooling**: Design a hybrid greenhouse system that integrates passive heating and cooling strategies. The greenhouse would be designed with a high thermal mass, allowing it to absorb and release heat slowly. During the day, the greenhouse would be shaded to prevent overheating, and at night, it would be ventilated to release excess heat. The greenhouse would also be equipped with a phase change material-based cooling system to regulate temperature during hot summer days.",
    "**Smart Window Technology with Integrated Insulation**: Develop a smart window system that incorporates advanced insulation materials and thermal energy harvesting capabilities. The windows would be designed with a triple-glazed structure, providing excellent insulation and reducing heat transfer. The windows would also be equipped with thermoelectric devices that convert waste heat from the sun into usable thermal energy, reducing the need for traditional heating and cooling systems.
