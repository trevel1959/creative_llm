    "**Whisk Set with Customizable Heads**: Create a whisk set that includes interchangeable heads tailored for different tasks such as whipping cream, breading foods, making sauces, and mixing dough. Each head would be made from materials suitable for specific uses (e.g., silicone for non-stick surfaces, stainless steel for durability), allowing users to choose the best tool for each job.",
    "**Portable Whisk Stand**: Design a compact, portable stand for the whisk that fits in a kitchen drawer when not in use. This stand would have adjustable arms to hold the whisk at various angles, reducing strain on the wrist and hand while whisking. It could also have built-in slots for storing whisk attachments, keeping everything organized and accessible.",
    "**Whisk with Embedded Spatula**: Combine the functionality of a whisk and spatula into one tool. The handle would be slightly wider than traditional whisks, allowing it to function as a spatula for scraping bowls clean during mixing. This would save space in the kitchen utensil drawer and reduce clutter.",
    "**Ergonomic Whisk Handle**: Improve the comfort and grip of the whisk by incorporating ergonomic design principles. The handle could feature a soft, textured material, an adjustable grip size, and a non-slip base to prevent accidents. Additionally, the handle could be designed to be used with either hand, catering to left-handed users or those who prefer using their dominant hand differently.",
    "**Wireless Charging Base for Whisk**: Integrate a wireless charging station that keeps the whisk powered up and ready to use. Users could simply place the whisk on the charging pad after use, ensuring it's always charged and available when needed. This base could also serve as a drying rack for the whisk, preventing water buildup that could lead to rust or mold."
