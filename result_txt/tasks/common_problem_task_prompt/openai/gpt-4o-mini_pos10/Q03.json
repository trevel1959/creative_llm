    "**Scope Creep**: As the development process unfolds, stakeholders may continually add new features or changes, leading to scope creep. This can result in project delays, budget overruns, and a diluted focus on the core functionalities of the software. To combat this, establish a clear project scope at the outset and implement a change management process that evaluates the impact of any proposed changes on the timeline and resources.",
    "**Technical Debt Accumulation**: In the rush to meet deadlines, developers may take shortcuts in coding or design that lead to technical debt. This can manifest as poorly structured code, lack of documentation, or reliance on outdated technologies. Over time, this can make the software harder to maintain and update. To prevent this, encourage a culture of code reviews and regular refactoring sessions, ensuring that quality is prioritized alongside speed.",
    "**Inadequate Testing**: Rushing the testing phase to meet a launch date can result in software that is riddled with bugs or security vulnerabilities. Inadequate testing can damage the productâ€™s reputation and lead to costly post-launch fixes. Implement a robust testing strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, and allocate sufficient time for these processes within the project timeline.",
    "**Lack of Clear Communication**: Poor communication among team members, stakeholders, and users can lead to misunderstandings about requirements and expectations. This can result in a product that does not align with business goals or user needs. Establish regular check-ins, updates, and collaborative tools that facilitate open communication, ensuring everyone is on the same page throughout the development process.",
    "**Ignoring Scalability**: Designing a software product without considering its scalability can lead to significant issues as user demand grows. If the software cannot handle increased loads or data, it may crash or perform poorly, leading to user frustration. To address this, incorporate scalability into the architecture from the beginning, using cloud services and modular design principles that allow for easy upgrades and expansion."
