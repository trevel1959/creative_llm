    "Tape measure with built-in level: Create a tape measure that has a built-in level feature, allowing users to quickly and easily check the level of a surface or object. This could be especially useful for DIYers, contractors, and carpenters who often need to ensure that surfaces are level before starting a project. The level feature could be accessed by a small button or switch on the tape measure, and could provide a digital readout or a simple visual indication (e.g. a series of lines or a single line) to indicate when the surface is level.",
    "Tape measure with magnetic tip: Design a tape measure with a magnetic tip that can be easily attached to metal surfaces, allowing users to measure the distance between two points without having to physically touch the tape measure to the surface. This could be particularly useful for measuring distances on metal pipes, beams, or other metal structures. The magnetic tip could be made of a strong neodymium magnet, and could be attached to the tape measure using a small screw or clip.",
    "Tape measure with LED light: Create a tape measure with an integrated LED light that can be used to illuminate dark spaces or surfaces. This could be especially useful for measuring in low-light environments, such as basements, attics, or outdoor areas at night. The LED light could be powered by a small battery or solar panel, and could be turned on and off using a button or switch on the tape measure.",
    "Tape measure with data storage: Design a tape measure that can store and recall measurements taken on previous projects. This could be particularly useful for professionals who need to keep track of measurements for multiple projects, such as architects, engineers, and contractors. The tape measure could have a small memory chip or button that allows users to store and recall measurements, and could be designed to transfer data to a computer or other device for easier analysis and organization.",
    "Tape measure with augmented reality display: Create a tape measure that displays augmented reality (AR) measurements and instructions on a small screen or display. This could be especially useful for users who need to measure distances and angles in complex spaces, such as those found in construction, engineering, or interior design. The AR display could show measurements and instructions in real-time, allowing users to quickly"
