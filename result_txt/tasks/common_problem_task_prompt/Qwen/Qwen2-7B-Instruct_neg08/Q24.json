These differences can sometimes cause conflicts or misunderstandings, such as differing dietary preferences, social norms, or expectations regarding personal space. It's essential for both parties to be open-minded and willing to adapt to accommodate these differences.",
    "Educational System Disparity: The educational system in the host country might differ significantly from what the foreign exchange student is accustomed to.

Additionally, the student might face pressure to maintain good grades due to the importance of academic achievements in their home country, which can be stressful.",

They might experience feelings of homesickness, loneliness, or anxiety, which can impact their overall well-being and adjustment process.",
    "Financial Constraints: Hosting a foreign exchange student can put a strain on the host family's finances. The student typically covers accommodation and meals, but other expenses like transportation, entertainment, and additional activities can add up. It's crucial for the host family to consider their financial situation before agreeing to host and ensure they can comfortably accommodate the student without compromising their own lifestyle.",
    "Safety Concerns: Ensuring the safety and well-being of the foreign exchange student is a significant responsibility for the host family. This includes protecting them from physical harm, providing a safe living environment, and being aware of any potential risks in the area.
