    "Communication Issues: Communication is critical during a deep-sea exploration mission, as the team must maintain constant contact with mission control. If communication equipment fail to work properly, it can hinder the team's ability to collect data and navigate the water.",
    "Lack of Oxygen: At great depths, the oxygen levels are low, and the team may need to rely on scuba gear. However, this equipment has limited supply, putting the team at risk of oxygen deprivation if the supply runs out.",
    "Navigation Problems: Deep-sea environments can be murky and difficult to navigate, making it difficult for the team to visually see their surroundings. If their navigation equipment fails, they may become lost or disoriented.",
    "Collisions: The risk of collision is high in such deep-sea environments, and any collision with the ground, rocks, or other obstacles could cause damage to the ship or its equipment, putting the team in danger.",
    "Injuries or Illnesses: Working in a deep-sea environment places a lot of physical demands on the team, and underwater injuries can occur. They may also suffer from illnesses due to prolonged exposure to the cold and the pressure of the deep water."
