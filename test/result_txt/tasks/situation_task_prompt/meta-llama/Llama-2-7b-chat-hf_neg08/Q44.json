    "Hovercrafts: In a world without public transport, hovercrafts could be an innovative solution for long-distance travel. Hovercrafts are vehicles that use air pressure to lift and propel them above the ground, reducing friction and increasing speed. They could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, making them an eco-friendly option. With proper safety measures in place, hovercrafts could provide a safe and efficient way to travel long distances without relying on cars.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains above the track, reducing friction and increasing speed. These trains could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, and could be an effective way to travel long distances without relying on cars. Maglev trains could also be designed with self-sustaining systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to provide a reliable source of energy.",
    "Personal airships: Airships, or dirigibles, are lighter-than-air vehicles that use helium or hydrogen to float above the ground. They could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, and could provide a comfortable and efficient way to travel long distances without relying on cars. Personal airships could be designed with detachable modules for different types of travel, such as a living module for sleeping and a cargo module for carrying luggage.",
    "Bike-share programs: Bike-share programs could be expanded to include electric bikes or other types of eco-friendly bicycles. These bikes could be equipped with advanced features such as GPS tracking, smart locks, and charging stations, making them a convenient and sustainable option for short and medium-distance travel. Bike-share programs could also include electric scooters or other personal transportation devices, providing a range of options for people to choose from.",
    "Hyperloop systems: Hyperloop systems are high-speed transportation systems that use vacuum-sealed tubes and magnetic levitation to propel vehicles at speeds of up to 700 mph (1,127 km/h). These systems could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, and could provide a fast and efficient way to travel"
