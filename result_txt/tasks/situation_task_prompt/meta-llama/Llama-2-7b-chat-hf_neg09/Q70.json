    "Use the position of the sun: Without watches or clocks, you could use the position of the sun to determine the time of day. You could observe the position of the sun in the sky and use that information to estimate the time. For example, if the sun is directly overhead at noon, it's likely to be around 12 PM.",
    "Use a sundial: A sundial is a device that uses the shadow of a vertical stick or object to indicate time. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow of the stick will move, indicating the time of day. This method would be most accurate during the daytime when the sun is directly overhead.",
    "Use a water clock: A water clock, also known as a clepsydra, measures time by the flow of water from one container to another. The amount of time it takes for the water to flow from one container to another is proportional to the time elapsed. This method would be accurate for measuring time during the day and night, as the flow of water is not affected by light.",
    "Use a shadow stick: A shadow stick is a long, thin stick with markings on it that indicate time. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow of the stick will move, and you can use the position of the shadow to determine the time. This method would be similar to using a sundial, but it would be more portable and easier to use.",
    "Use a time-telling plant: Some plants, such as the \"time-telling\" plant (a type of succulent), have leaves that grow longer or shorter depending on the time of day. By observing the length of the leaves, you could estimate the time of day. This method would be most accurate in regions with a consistent climate and light exposure."
