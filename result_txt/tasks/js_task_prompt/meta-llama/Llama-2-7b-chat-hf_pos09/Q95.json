    "Interactive Water Features: Create a water-based habitat that allows animals to engage with water in various ways, such as a splash pool for playful otters, a waterfall for crocodiles to bathe in, or a lazy river for alligators to float along.",
    "Adaptive Lighting: Design a habitat with a lighting system that simulates the changing colors of the sun throughout the day, providing animals with a natural circadian rhythm. This could be especially beneficial for nocturnal animals like owls and bats.",
    "Multi-level Structures: Create a habitat with multi-level structures that mimic the natural hierarchy of animals. For example, a treehouse for monkeys to climb and play, a rocky outcropping for goats to roam, or a sandy dune for burrowing animals like badgers.",
    "Virtual Reality Experiences: Incorporate virtual reality technology to allow animals to experience different environments and stimuli without leaving their habitat. For example, a virtual safari for rhinos to explore the savannah, or a virtual ocean for dolphins to swim in.",
    "Community Garden: Design a habitat that incorporates a community garden, where animals can work together to grow and maintain their own food sources. This could include a vegetable patch for rabbits, a fruit orchard for birds, or a herb garden for bees."
