    "**Modular Gaming PC with a Twist**: Design a modular gaming PC that can be easily upgraded or modified without the need for extensive technical knowledge. This system would consist of a central core with interchangeable components, such as GPU, CPU, and RAM, that can be swapped out with ease. Each component would be connected to the core via a high-speed bus, allowing for seamless transitions between different configurations. This would make it possible for gamers to upgrade their system without having to purchase an entirely new computer.",
    "**Environmental Sensing Gaming PC**: Develop a gaming PC that incorporates environmental sensing technology to create an immersive gaming experience. This PC would be equipped with sensors that track temperature, humidity, and air quality, and use this data to create a dynamic gaming environment. For example, if the temperature in the room rises, the game could adjust the graphics settings to reduce heat generation. This would not only enhance the gaming experience but also make the PC more energy-efficient.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Gaming PC**: Design a gaming PC specifically tailored for VR and AR applications. This system would be equipped with high-performance graphics cards, advanced cooling systems, and specialized software that optimizes VR and AR experiences. The PC would also include a high-resolution display and advanced tracking technology to provide a seamless and immersive experience.",
    "**Sustainable Gaming PC with Biodegradable Components**: Create a gaming PC that incorporates biodegradable components, such as a motherboard made from plant-based materials, and a casing constructed from recycled plastic. This PC would also be designed to be energy-efficient, using a combination of solar panels and advanced power management systems to minimize its carbon footprint. This would not only reduce electronic waste but also provide a more sustainable option for gamers.",
    "**AI-Powered Gaming PC with Predictive Maintenance**: Develop a gaming PC that incorporates AI-powered predictive maintenance technology to extend the lifespan of its components. This system would use machine learning algorithms to analyze system performance, detect potential issues, and schedule maintenance tasks before they become critical. This would reduce downtime, minimize the risk of hardware failure, and provide a more reliable gaming experience. [/INST] "
