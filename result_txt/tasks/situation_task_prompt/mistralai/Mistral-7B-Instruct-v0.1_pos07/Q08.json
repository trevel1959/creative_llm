    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other impurities from seawater to make it safe for drinking. This process can be used to purify polluted water sources as well. It involves the use of a series of filters and membranes that remove contaminants and leave only clean water.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater is another way to obtain clean drinking water. This involves setting up a system to collect and store rainwater from rooftops, surfaces, or ground catchments. The water can then be purified using simple methods such as boiling or using purification tablets.",
    "filters: Fixed-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) filters can be used to remove contaminants from water. These filters use carbon particles to absorb and remove impurities such as organic matter, heavy metals, and chlorine.",
    "Solar still: A solar still is a simple device that can be used to purify water. It involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam into clean water. This process removes most impurities from the water.",
    "Bioremediation: Bioremediation involves using microorganisms to break down contaminants in water. This process can be used to remove organic pollutants such as oil spills and pesticides. It involves adding bacteria or other microorganisms to the water, which then break down the contaminants into harmless compounds."
