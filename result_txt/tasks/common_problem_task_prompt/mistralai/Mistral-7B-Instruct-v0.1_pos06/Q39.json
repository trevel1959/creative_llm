    "Implementing a universal basic income would require significant government funding. One idea could be to implement a progressive tax system, where individuals with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, while those with lower incomes pay a lower percentage. This would allow the government to generate more revenue and fund the universal basic income program.",
    "Another idea could be to implement a carbon tax, where companies are taxed based on the amount of carbon emissions they produce. This revenue could then be used to fund the universal basic income program.",
    "A third idea could be to implement a wealth tax, where individuals with a certain net worth are taxed on their wealth. This revenue could then be used to fund the universal basic income program.",
    "A fourth idea could be to implement a financial transaction tax, where a small fee is charged on every financial transaction. This revenue could then be used to fund the universal basic income program.",
    "A fifth idea could be to implement a luxury tax, where individuals with high-end items such as luxury cars, yachts, and private jets are taxed on their purchases. This revenue could then be used to fund the universal basic income program."
