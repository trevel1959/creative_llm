    "Use a boat or ship - If planes are not available, one could use a boat or ship to travel across the ocean to reach another continent. This method of transportation would be slower than flying, but it would allow for a unique experience of traveling by sea and potentially seeing new sights along the way.",
    "Travel by train - Another option for traveling across continents without planes would be to take a train. Trains can cover long distances quickly and efficiently, and many countries have extensive rail networks that connect major cities and destinations.",
    "Use a hot air balloon - A hot air balloon would be an unconventional but fun way to travel across continents. While it may not be practical for long distance travel, it could be a great way to see new places from above and experience the thrill of soaring through the sky.",
    "Go on foot or bike - For those who are physically fit and adventurous, walking or biking across continents could be a viable option. It would be a slow and challenging journey, but it would also provide an opportunity to connect with nature and experience different cultures up close.",
    "Use a camel caravan - In some parts of the world, camels are still used as a means of transportation. Using a camel caravan to cross continents could be an interesting and unique way to travel, although it would likely be a slower and more difficult journey compared to other options."
