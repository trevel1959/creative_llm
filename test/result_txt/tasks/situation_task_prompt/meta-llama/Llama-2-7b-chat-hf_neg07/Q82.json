    "Gestures and Body Language: In a world without language, people would rely heavily on non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. People could use exaggerated hand gestures to convey simple ideas, like pointing to an object or making a \"waving\" motion to indicate greeting or farewell. They could also use facial expressions to convey emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger.",
    "Drawings and Pictographs: Visual communication would become a crucial aspect of daily life. People could use drawings and pictographs to convey complex ideas and stories. They could draw pictures of objects, animals, or events to help others understand their meaning. For example, a person could draw a picture of a tree to indicate the location of water or food.",
    "Music and Rhythm: Music and rhythm could become a universal language, allowing people to communicate emotions and ideas without words. People could use different rhythms and melodies to convey different meanings, such as a fast-paced rhythm for excitement or a slow, mournful melody for sadness.",
    "Nature and the Environment: People could use the natural environment to communicate. They could use the position of the sun, the direction of the wind, or the colors of plants and animals to convey information. For example, they could use the position of the sun to indicate time of day or the direction of the wind to indicate the location of food or shelter.",
    "Dance and Movement: Dance and movement could become a primary means of communication. People could use different dance moves to convey emotions and ideas, such as a graceful dance to indicate peacefulness or a energetic dance to indicate excitement. They could also use movement to convey spatial relationships, such as pointing to an object or indicating the direction of a path."
