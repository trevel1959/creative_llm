    "**Spacecraft Orchestra**: Design a satellite that can change its shape to create a unique sound-producing mechanism. By manipulating the satellite's structure, it can generate a wide range of sounds, from deep rumbles to high-pitched whistles. The satellite can be programmed to play musical compositions or even respond to external stimuli, creating an immersive experience for listeners on Earth.",
    "**Aurora Painter**: Develop a satellite that can capture and recreate the breathtaking beauty of the aurora borealis (northern lights) in real-time. Equipped with advanced cameras and sensors, the satellite can detect the subtle changes in the aurora's patterns and colors. It can then transmit this data back to Earth, where it's used to create stunning digital artworks that simulate the experience of witnessing the aurora in person.",
    "**Environmental Sentinel**: Design a satellite that can monitor and analyze the Earth's ecosystem in real-time. Equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered algorithms, the satellite can detect subtle changes in the environment, such as shifts in temperature, pH levels, or wildlife populations. It can then provide critical insights to scientists, policymakers, and the general public, enabling informed decision-making and proactive conservation efforts.",
    "**Stellar Time Capsule**: Launch a satellite that can capture and store a snapshot of the universe at a specific moment in time. The satellite can be equipped with advanced cameras and sensors that record the positions, velocities, and properties of celestial objects, as well as the cosmic background radiation. This data can be used to create a detailed, 3D model of the universe, providing a unique perspective on the cosmos and its evolution.",
    "**Space Weather Forecasting**: Develop a satellite that can predict and warn of severe space weather events, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered algorithms, the satellite can detect subtle changes in the sun's activity and provide critical forecasts to scientists, engineers, and the general public. This can help mitigate the effects of space weather on communication systems, power grids, and other critical infrastructure. [/INST] [/INST] "
