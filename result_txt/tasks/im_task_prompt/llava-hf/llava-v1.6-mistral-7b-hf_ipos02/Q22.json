    "**Energy-Efficient Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight with a built-in energy-saving mode that adjusts the light intensity based on the user's needs. This could be a feature that automatically dims the light after a certain period of use to conserve battery life.",
    "**Motion-Sensing Flashlight**: Equip the flashlight with motion sensors that allow it to detect movement and adjust the light intensity accordingly. For example, it could brighten when it senses movement nearby, providing a more secure and responsive flashlight.",
    "**Flashlight with Integrated Camera**: Combine the flashlight with a high-quality camera that can capture photos or videos in low-light conditions. This would be particularly useful for individuals who enjoy night photography or want to record memories in any setting.",
