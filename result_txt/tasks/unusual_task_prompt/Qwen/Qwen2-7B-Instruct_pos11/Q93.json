    "**Eco-Friendly Vase Recycling Project**: Design a series of vases that can be made using materials from discarded plastic bottles, glass jars, or even old newspapers. The project can include a step-by-step guide on how to recycle these materials into beautiful, functional vases. This not only promotes recycling but also encourages creativity in upcycling.",
    "**Interactive Vase Experience**: Create a series of vases where the design allows for interaction with the environment around them. For example, the vase could change color based on temperature, or it could emit different scents based on the type of flowers placed inside. This could be achieved through the use of thermochromic paint or scent-emitting technology embedded within the vase's structure.",
    "**Vase as Art Installation**: Transform vases into large-scale, interactive art installations that can be displayed in public spaces like parks, malls, or community centers. These installations could be designed to change appearance throughout the day, depending on natural light, or they could incorporate motion sensors to trigger changes in their appearance when someone interacts with them.",
    "**Personalized Vase Creation Workshop**: Develop a series of workshops where participants can customize their own vases. This could involve painting, stenciling, or even adding personalized messages or images. By incorporating digital tools, such as 3D printing or laser engraving, participants can create unique designs that are truly one-of-a-kind.",
    "**Vase as a Sustainable Home Decor**: Create a line of vases that serve both decorative and functional purposes in the home. For instance, some vases could double as small planters, others could act as hidden storage solutions (e.g., for jewelry, keys, or small gadgets), or some could even incorporate lighting elements to provide ambient illumination. This approach emphasizes the multifunctionality of the vase, making it a more versatile piece of home decor."
