    "**Detecting Unseen Hazards**: Imagine a situation where you can see through walls to detect unseen hazards such as gas leaks or structural weaknesses in buildings. You could be a guardian of sorts, alerting homeowners, building managers, or emergency services about potential dangers before they cause harm. This would not only prevent accidents but also potentially save lives.",
    "**Enhanced Security Surveillance**: With the ability to see through walls, you could enhance security surveillance significantly. For instance, you could monitor multiple floors or rooms simultaneously, providing real-time monitoring without the need for numerous cameras or personnel. This would be particularly useful in large facilities like airports, malls, or data centers, ensuring maximum security coverage with minimal resources.",
    "**Facilitating Home Renovations**: If you were an architect or interior designer, being able to see through walls could revolutionize your approach to home renovations. You could visualize the entire layout of a property, including any hidden spaces or structural elements, making the design process more efficient and accurate. This could lead to better utilization of space and innovative architectural solutions that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: Imagine using this power to aid medical professionals. Doctors could perform virtual explorations inside patients' bodies without the need for invasive procedures. This could lead to earlier detection of diseases, improved surgical planning, and more personalized treatments. Additionally, it could help in developing new medical devices and techniques that take advantage of the ability to see through biological barriers.",
    "**Historical Preservation**: Historians and archaeologists could benefit from this power by being able to see through walls to uncover hidden historical sites or artifacts without causing damage. This would allow for the preservation of ancient structures and artifacts in their original state, providing invaluable insights into our past. It could also help in the planning and execution of excavations and restorations, ensuring that cultural heritage is protected and respected."
