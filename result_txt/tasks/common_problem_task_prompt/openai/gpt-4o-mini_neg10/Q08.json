    "**Insufficient Resources**: The new curriculum may require resources (books, technology, materials) that the school does not currently possess. To tackle this, the school can initiate a fundraising campaign or apply for grants that specifically support educational innovation, ensuring that all necessary resources are available for effective implementation.",
    "**Inadequate Training**: Teachers may not receive enough training on the new curriculum, leading to inconsistent implementation across classrooms. A comprehensive training program should be developed, including ongoing support and mentorship, to ensure that all educators feel confident and capable of delivering the new content effectively.",
    "**Diverse Learning Needs**: The new curriculum may not adequately address the diverse learning needs of all students, including those with disabilities or different learning styles. To mitigate this issue, the curriculum should be designed with flexibility in mind, incorporating differentiated instruction strategies and resources to support all learners.",
    "**Assessment Challenges**: The new curriculum may require new assessment methods that teachers are not familiar with, creating confusion and inconsistency in evaluating student progress. A clear assessment framework should be established, along with training sessions on how to effectively implement and utilize these new assessment tools.",
    "**Parental Involvement**: Parents may be unaware of the changes and their implications, leading to a lack of support at home. To foster engagement, schools can hold informational sessions and workshops for parents, providing them with resources and strategies to support their childrenâ€™s learning aligned with the new curriculum."
