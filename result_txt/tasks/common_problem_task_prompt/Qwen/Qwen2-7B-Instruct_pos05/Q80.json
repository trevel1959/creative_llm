    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Organize a fleet of hybrid or electric vehicles for transporting guests to and from the venue. This not only reduces carbon footprint but also provides a smooth and efficient travel experience for the attendees. You can also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation by providing discounts on tickets.",
    "**Sustainable Venue**: Opt for a location that is already eco-friendly or has sustainability practices in place. This could include a park, botanical garden, or any place with natural surroundings. If it's not feasible, consider a venue that recycles waste, uses renewable energy sources (like solar panels), or has a commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.",
    "**Seasonal and Local Menu**: Serve dishes made from locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. This not only supports local farmers and reduces the environmental impact of long-distance transportation but also offers a fresher and more flavorful dining experience. Avoid using meat and dairy products from unsustainable farming practices.",
    "**Zero-Waste Wedding**: Implement a comprehensive plan to minimize waste. Use biodegradable or compostable tableware, encourage digital invitations and thank-you cards, and set up recycling stations. For leftover food, donate it to local shelters or charities instead of throwing it away.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Choose decor items made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, reclaimed wood, or recycled glass. Incorporate plants and flowers in the decoration, which are naturally sustainable and add a touch of freshness. Avoid single-use decorations and opt for reusable or recyclable options. "
