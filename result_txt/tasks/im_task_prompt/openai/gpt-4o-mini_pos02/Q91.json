    "**QR Code with Dynamic Information**: Instead of static information, the luggage tag could feature a scannable QR code that directs to a personalized webpage. Travelers can update their contact information, travel itinerary, or special instructions (like \"handle with care\" or \"contains fragile items\") at any time. This allows for easy updates without the need to replace the tag entirely.",
    "**Customizable Digital Display**: Develop a luggage tag with an e-ink display that travelers can customize using a smartphone app. Users can change their name, contact details, or even add fun graphics or quotes. This digital tag could also have a battery life of several weeks, allowing for easy personalization and visibility at baggage claim.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Designs**: Create luggage tags from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, bamboo, or biodegradable materials. Additionally, these tags could feature designs inspired by nature or cultural motifs, appealing to environmentally conscious travelers and promoting a message of sustainability in travel.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tag with Built-in Lock**: Design a luggage tag that doubles as a locking mechanism. The tag could have a small, integrated lock that secures the zipper of the luggage, providing an added layer of security. This would be particularly useful for travelers who want to deter theft while still keeping their identification visible.",
    "**Personalized Sound Alerts**: Introduce a luggage tag that plays a customizable sound or melody when the luggage is nearby. Travelers can select their favorite sound through an app, and the tag would emit the sound when the bag is within a certain proximity, making it easier to locate in crowded areas like airports or train stations."
