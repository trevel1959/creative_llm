    "**Smart Helmet with Augmented Reality Navigation**: This idea combines traditional bicycle helmets with modern technology to enhance the user's navigation experience. The helmet would have built-in AR (Augmented Reality) technology that projects directions onto the cyclist's view, eliminating the need for a separate GPS device. It would also include sensors to detect obstacles in the cyclist's path and provide real-time alerts, enhancing safety.",
    "**Biodegradable Bicycle Helmets**: In response to growing environmental concerns, creating bicycle helmets made from biodegradable materials could be an innovative approach. Using materials like bamboo fibers or plant-based plastics would reduce the environmental impact of the product. This not only appeals to eco-conscious consumers but also addresses the issue of waste management after the product's lifecycle.",
    "**Helmets with Built-in Health Monitoring**: By integrating sensors into the helmet, cyclists can monitor their health in real-time. This could include heart rate monitors, blood oxygen levels, and even stress levels. Data collected can be synced with fitness apps on smartphones, allowing users to track their overall health and performance during rides.",
    "**Personalized Helmet Designs**: Utilizing 3D printing technology, this concept allows for customization of bicycle helmets based on individual preferences. Users could select colors, patterns, and even add personalized designs or logos, making each helmet unique. This adds a personal touch to the product and could appeal to a wider market, including fashion-conscious consumers.",
    "**Interactive Helmet with Social Media Integration**: By incorporating Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, the helmet can allow cyclists to share their location, route, and status updates directly to social media platforms. This feature could enhance the social aspect of cycling, allowing friends and family to follow along and comment on the rider's journey. Additionally, it could potentially serve as a platform for sharing safety tips and encouraging other cyclists."
