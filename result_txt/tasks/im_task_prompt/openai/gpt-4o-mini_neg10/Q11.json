    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology into the water bottle that automatically cleans the interior and neutralizes bacteria and viruses. This feature would be activated with a simple button press, ensuring that the bottle remains hygienic without the need for frequent manual washing.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a detachable chamber within the water bottle that allows users to infuse their water with natural flavors from fruits, herbs, or tea. This chamber would have a built-in filter to keep the infusion ingredients contained while allowing their flavors to permeate the water, making hydration more enjoyable.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular water bottle that can be customized based on user needs. Users could add or remove compartments for items like snacks, supplements, or even a small first-aid kit. This would make the bottle versatile for various activities, such as hiking, gym sessions, or travel.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Develop a water bottle with built-in temperature control features that can keep drinks cold or hot for extended periods. This could be achieved through a double-wall vacuum insulation combined with a temperature-regulating material that can be adjusted via a smartphone app, allowing users to set their preferred temperature.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Seed Integration**: Construct the water bottle from biodegradable materials that include embedded seeds. After the bottle has reached the end of its life, users can bury it in soil, where it will decompose and sprout into a plant. This not only promotes sustainability but also encourages users to contribute to the environment."
