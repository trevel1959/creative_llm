    "Economic boom: If all world debt was erased, there would be an immediate economic boost as countries would no longer have to pay interest on their debts. This would free up resources that could be used for investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, leading to a more prosperous global economy.",
    "Increased competition: With the burden of debt lifted, companies and countries would have more flexibility to compete with each other. This could lead to increased innovation, better products, and lower prices for consumers.",
    "New opportunities for emerging economies: Developing countries that are currently struggling with high levels of debt would have new opportunities to invest in their own growth and development. This could lead to increased prosperity and stability in these regions.",
    "Reduced inequality: The elimination of debt could also help reduce income inequality by providing greater access to credit and reducing the financial burden on low-income households.",
    "Increased global cooperation: With less focus on repayment of debts, countries may be more willing to work together on global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and poverty reduction. This could lead to more effective international cooperation and a stronger global community."
