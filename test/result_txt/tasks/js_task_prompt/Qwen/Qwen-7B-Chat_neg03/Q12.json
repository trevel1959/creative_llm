    "Underwater homes: Imagine living in a house that is completely submerged in water, complete with a glass floor so you can see the ocean life below you. The house would have to be built on stilts or in a man-made structure to prevent it from being flooded. It would also need to have special technology to regulate the air pressure inside the house and keep it habitable for humans.",
    "Aquatic farming: With the increase in demand for seafood, aquatic farming could become a viable alternative to traditional land-based farming. People could grow fish and other sea creatures in underwater farms using artificial reefs or underwater cages. This would not only provide a sustainable source of food but also create new jobs and economic opportunities in coastal areas.",
    "Underwater sports: Water sports like surfing, snorkeling, and scuba diving could be taken to a whole new level with underwater activities like freediving, underwater yoga, and underwater photography. People could explore the beauty of the ocean up close and personal, without having to worry about the dangers of deep-sea diving.",
    "Underwater cities: As the world's population continues to grow, it may become necessary to build underwater cities to accommodate people who cannot live on land anymore. These cities would be equipped with all the amenities of modern society, including hospitals, schools, shopping centers, and entertainment venues. They would also need to have advanced technologies to ensure they are safe and self-sufficient.",
    "Underwater transportation: With the increasing threat of climate change, sea levels are rising and many coastal cities are at risk of flooding. To address this problem, people could design underwater transportation systems that allow them to travel beneath the waves without having to rely on traditional boats or ships. These systems could include submersibles, underwater tunnels, and underwater highways.不仅可以解决海平面上升带来的问题，还可以创造新的旅游和娱乐机会。"
