    "**The Great Leveler**: With everyone suddenly becoming a genius, the concept of intelligence and achievement would be redefined. The distinction between geniuses and non-genius individuals would become negligible, leading to a more egalitarian society. People would be judged based on their character, creativity, and contributions rather than their IQ or academic credentials. This could result in a more harmonious and collaborative global community.",
    "**The Unhinged Utopia**: Overnight geniuses would likely experience an unprecedented surge in creative output, innovation, and problem-solving. However, this could also lead to an explosion of chaotic and destructive ideas, as individuals might prioritize personal gain and self-expression over social responsibility and ethics. The world might witness an era of unbridled creativity, but also a significant increase in conflict, disorder, and potential catastrophes.",
    "**The Great Divide**: While some individuals might thrive in their newfound genius, others might struggle to cope with the pressure and expectations that come with it. This could lead to a widening gap between those who excel and those who struggle, resulting in social and economic disparities. The divide between the haves and have-nots might become even more pronounced, with the former enjoying unprecedented success and the latter feeling increasingly marginalized.",
    "**The Singularity Shift**: With everyone becoming a genius, the global workforce would undergo a radical transformation. Traditional industries and job roles might become obsolete, as individuals would be capable of adapting and innovating at an unprecedented pace. This could lead to a shift towards a post-scarcity economy, where people are free to pursue their passions and interests without the burden of financial constraints. However, this would also require a significant overhaul of societal structures, institutions, and value systems.",
    "**The Lost Generation**: As everyone becomes a genius, the traditional education system would become redundant. The value of formal education would plummet, and the concept of a \"student\" or \"teacher\" would lose its meaning. This could lead to a lost generation, as individuals would struggle to find their place in a world where the rules and expectations have changed. Young people might feel adrift, unsure of how to navigate their newfound abilities and the responsibilities that come with them."
