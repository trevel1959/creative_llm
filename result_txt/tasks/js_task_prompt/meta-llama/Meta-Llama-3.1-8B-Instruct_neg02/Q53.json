    "**Aerius**: A sport that combines elements of parkour, trampolining, and high-flying acrobatics. Players would navigate a large, three-dimensional obstacle course with trampolines and aerial platforms, using their agility and strength to propel themselves through the air and reach the finish line. The twist: the course would be set in a massive, transparent dome, allowing spectators to see the action from all angles.",
    "**Subterra**: An underground sport that takes place in a network of tunnels and caverns. Players would use specialized equipment, such as glow-in-the-dark balls and high-intensity headlamps, to navigate the dark environment. The objective: to collect and return to the surface as many \"sub-terrestrial\" orbs as possible, while avoiding opponents who are trying to steal them. The added challenge: the tunnels would be designed to shift and change layout, requiring players to adapt quickly to new obstacles and paths.",
    "**Luminaria**: A team sport that involves strategy, speed, and light manipulation. Players would be equipped with special wristbands that can control and manipulate light beams, which they would use to create complex patterns and illusions on a large, translucent screen. The objective: to outmaneuver opponents by creating the most intricate and beautiful light designs, while also trying to disrupt their opponents' creations. The twist: the light beams could also be used to create temporary barriers, shields, or even projectiles.",
    "**EchoPlex**: A sport that combines elements of music, dance, and physical performance. Players would wear special suits with built-in sensors that track their movements and translate them into music. The objective: to create the most harmonious and engaging musical composition by working together as a team, using their movements to generate a unique soundscape. The added challenge: the music would be generated in real-time, requiring players to adapt to changing rhythms and melodies.",
    "**Graviton**: A high-speed sport that takes place on a massive, rotating track. Players would wear specialized suits that allow them to manipulate their center of gravity, enabling them to perform incredible feats of acrobatics and agility. The objective: to complete a series of high-speed laps around the track, while also trying to disrupt opponents' trajectories and knock them off course. The twist: the track would be equipped with artificial gravity generators, allowing players to experience varying levels of gravitational force, from zero-G to extreme weightlessness.
