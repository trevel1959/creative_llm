    "**Orbital Ring**: The solar system would feature a series of interconnected rings orbiting the sun. These rings would house a variety of structures, including cities, habitats, and factories, that would harness solar energy and other resources for the benefit of the inhabitants.",
    "**Black Hole Center**: The sun would be replaced by a stable black hole at the center of the system, acting as a gravitational anchor. This would create a unique dynamic where planets and other celestial bodies orbit around the black hole, which could be used to study gravitational physics and create a portal for interdimensional travel.",
    "**Galactic Habitats**: Each planet would be designed to support a specific type of life, ranging from aquatic creatures to terrestrial animals and plants. These habitats would be tailored to the needs of the inhabitants, creating a diverse and thriving ecosystem across the solar system.",
    "**Space Elevators**: The planets would be connected by space elevators, which would allow for easy travel and resource exchange between them. These elevators would be built from advanced materials that could withstand the harsh conditions of space.",
    "**Solar Power Satellites**: A network of solar power satellites would orbit around the sun, harnessing its energy and distributing it to the planets. These satellites would be designed to be self-replicating, ensuring a consistent and reliable energy supply for the entire system."
