    "Move to a high-altitude location: Another option would be to move to a high-altitude location, such as the mountains, where the risk of flooding would be significantly reduced. This would require careful planning and preparation, including building structures that can withstand the extreme weather conditions.",
    "Develop an underground community: Building an underground community would provide a safe haven from the rising ocean levels. This would require advanced engineering and construction techniques to create structures that could withstand the pressure of being submerged in water.",
    "Create a network of interconnected islands: Instead of building a single floating city, a network of interconnected islands could be created to provide a safe and stable living environment. This would require careful planning and infrastructure development to ensure the safety and connectivity of the islands.",
    "Build a massive seawall: A massive seawall could be built to protect coastal areas from the rising ocean levels. This would require advanced engineering and construction techniques to ensure the seawall's durability and effectiveness.",
    "Develop a self-sustaining ecosystem: A self-sustaining ecosystem could be created on land or in a controlled environment, such as a biodome, to provide a safe and sustainable living environment. This would require careful planning and management of resources to ensure the ecosystem's stability and longevity."
