    "**Human-Powered Devices**: Develop devices that harness human energy through movement or physical activity. For example, a treadmill desk for walking meetings, a bicycle-powered laptop, or a kinetic watch. This idea involves creating gadgets that convert kinetic energy into electrical energy. The user's body movement would be used as an alternative source of power.",
    "**Solar-Driven Clothing**: Design clothing that can generate electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells embedded in the fabric. These solar panels could charge a battery pack or directly power electronic devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, or even small electronics like a fitness tracker. This concept combines fashion with technology, making wearable tech more sustainable and practical.",
    "**Sound Energy Harvesting**: Create devices that convert ambient sound energy into electrical power. This could involve microphones integrated into headphones, speakers, or even entire environments where sound is harnessed. By using the vibrations caused by sound waves, these devices can continuously charge their internal batteries or external power sources.",
    "**Water-Powered Gadgets**: Develop gadgets that utilize water currents to generate electricity. For instance, a desk fan powered by flowing water in a river or a desk lamp that converts water pressure from a faucet into energy. This idea focuses on utilizing natural water resources as a renewable energy source for powering electronic devices.",
    "**Biodegradable Batteries**: Innovate with eco-friendly batteries made from biodegradable materials that can be integrated into clothing or other wearable items. These batteries can be charged using body heat or movements and then decompose naturally when no longer needed. This concept promotes sustainability by reducing waste and the environmental impact of traditional batteries."
