    "**Visitor Safety**: Safety is a critical concern in a zoo environment. There is a risk of accidents occurring if visitors get too close to enclosures or if barriers are not properly maintained. Additionally, there may be instances of visitors feeding animals or attempting to interact with them, leading to potential injuries. Implementing strict safety protocols, clear signage, and regular staff training can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Zoos often rely on ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships for funding. Economic downturns, changes in public interest, or competition from other attractions can lead to financial strain. This can affect animal care, facility maintenance, and conservation programs. To combat this, zoos can diversify revenue streams through educational programs, virtual experiences, and partnerships with local businesses.",
    "**Conservation Ethics**: Balancing the zoo's role in conservation with the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity can be challenging. Some critics argue that zoos prioritize entertainment over genuine conservation efforts. To address this, zoos can focus on transparent communication about their conservation initiatives, collaborate with wildlife organizations, and actively participate in breeding programs for endangered species.",
    "**Staffing and Training**: A knowledgeable and well-trained staff is essential for the effective operation of a zoo. High turnover rates, inadequate training, or lack of specialized knowledge can lead to poor animal care and visitor experiences. To mitigate this, zoos can invest in ongoing professional development, create mentorship programs, and foster a positive work culture that encourages staff retention.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Zoos must consider their environmental footprint, including waste management, energy consumption, and land use. Poor practices can lead to pollution, habitat destruction, or negative impacts on local wildlife. To promote sustainability, zoos can implement green initiatives, such as recycling programs, renewable energy sources, and habitat restoration projects."
