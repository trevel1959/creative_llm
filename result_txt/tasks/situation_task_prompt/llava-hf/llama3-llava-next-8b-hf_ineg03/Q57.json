    "Submarine Habitat: Architects and engineers could develop a sophisticated, eco-friendly, and sustainable submarine habitat that could accommodate a large number of people. The habitat would be designed with cutting-edge technology, including air recycling systems, water purification, and energy generation. It would be a revolutionary way to live beneath the ocean's surface, allowing people to coexist with marine life while providing a safe haven from rising sea levels.",
    "Underwater Domes: A team of experts could design and construct large, transparent, and energy-efficient underwater domes that could house entire communities. These domes would be built with durable, lightweight materials that could withstand water pressure, and they would have advanced life support systems, such as air recycling and water purification. The domes would allow people to live and work underwater, providing a unique and sustainable lifestyle while minimizing the environmental impact of coastal communities.",
    "Seawall and Floodgate System: Instead of relocating entire communities, a more practical solution could be to implement a comprehensive seawall and floodgate system that would protect coastal areas from rising ocean levels. This system would include multiple layers of protection, such as barriers, gates, and floodwalls, designed to prevent the inundation of coastal communities. It would also include sophisticated monitoring and control systems that could adjust the gates and barriers in response to changing weather conditions and sea levels.",
    "Artificial Islands: Another solution could be to create artificial islands in the open ocean, far from coastal areas. These islands could be built with sustainable materials, such as sand, rocks, and other natural resources. They could be designed to be self-sufficient, with their own energy generation, water management, and waste management systems. These islands could provide a safe haven for communities while also contributing to the preservation of the natural environment.",
    "Elevated Cities: Instead of relocating communities, architects and engineers could design and construct elevated cities that would be built on stilts or raised platforms. These cities would be designed with advanced infrastructure, including transportation systems, utilities, and green spaces. The elevated cities would be built in areas with relatively stable ground, such as on the coast or near the base of mountains. This would allow coastal communities to remain in their current locations while providing protection from rising ocean levels."
