    "**Time Constraints**: Employees may feel they do not have enough time in their workday to participate in fitness activities. To address this, the program could include short, effective workouts that can be completed in 10-15 minutes, or offer flexible scheduling options, such as lunchtime sessions or after-work classes.",
    "**Insufficient Space**: Limited office space can hinder the implementation of fitness activities. To solve this, the program could utilize outdoor spaces, such as nearby parks, or encourage employees to participate in fitness challenges that can be done individually at their desks or in small groups.",
    "**Health Concerns**: Some employees may have health issues or physical limitations that make traditional exercise difficult. To accommodate this, the program should include options for low-impact exercises, stretching, and provide alternative activities that cater to different fitness levels and health conditions.",
    "**Lack of Incentives**: Without incentives, employees may not feel motivated to participate. The program could introduce gamification elements, such as challenges with rewards, recognition, or team competitions, to encourage participation and foster a sense of community.",
    "**Cultural Resistance**: There may be a workplace culture that does not prioritize physical activity or wellness. To address this, leadership should actively promote the program, share success stories, and create a supportive environment that encourages a healthy lifestyle through workshops, discussions, and testimonials."
