    "Pollen collection and storage: Collect pollen from healthy flowers and store it in a dry and cool place. When needed, use the stored pollen to pollinate plants by gently dusting it onto the female flowers.",
    "Wind-powered pollination: Create a makeshift fan using natural materials like leaves and branches to mimic the wind and disperse pollen from male flowers to female flowers. This method might not be as effective as natural wind pollination, but it could help in some cases.",
    "Insect-assisted pollination: If there are any insects in the area, you could use them to help pollinate the plants by guiding them to the male and female flowers. This method may require setting up a few insect habitats nearby to attract the insects.",
    "Solar-powered pollination: Use a solar-powered fan to disperse pollen from male flowers to female flowers. This method could be less effective than natural wind pollination, but it would be environmentally friendly and harness renewable energy.",
    "Pollen banks: Establish pollen banks by collecting and storing pollen from healthy plants. When needed, use the stored pollen to pollinate plants in the area. This method would require regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure the pollen remains viable."
