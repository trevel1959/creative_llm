    "Increased sea levels: If the polar ice caps melted overnight, the resulting increase in sea levels would have severe implications for coastal communities and low-lying areas around the world. The melting of the ice caps would cause flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, affecting the livelihoods of millions of people. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Disruption of global weather patterns: The melting of the polar ice caps would alter the Earth's climate, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This would have a significant impact on agriculture, causing food shortages and economic losses. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Loss of biodiversity: The melting of the polar ice caps would result in the loss of habitats for many species, leading to a decline in biodiversity. This would have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem, with potential consequences for the food chain and the planet's overall health. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Unpredictable ocean currents: The melting of the polar ice caps would alter the Earth's ocean currents, leading to unpredictable and potentially dangerous changes in sea temperatures and ocean chemistry. This could have a significant impact on marine ecosystems and the creatures that depend on them. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Increased risk of tsunamis: As the polar ice caps melt, the resulting changes in sea levels would increase the risk of tsunamis and coastal flooding. This would be particularly dangerous for communities located in low-lying areas or near coastlines. Confidence score: 0.9"
