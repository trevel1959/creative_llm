    "Smart Frame: A picture frame that can display images wirelessly connected to a user's phone or computer. The frame has a built-in Wi-Fi module and a companion app that allows users to easily transfer photos from their device to the frame. The app also enables users to control the frame's settings, such as brightness, contrast, and orientation.",
    "Interactive Frame: A picture frame that reacts to voice commands or gestures. Users can ask the frame to display a specific photo or create a slideshow, or they can use hand gestures to navigate through their photo library. The frame could also have a built-in speaker for audio playback.",
    "Personalized Frame: A picture frame that learns a user's preferences and displays photos based on their interests. The frame uses machine learning algorithms to analyze a user's browsing history and social media activity to identify their favorite subjects, colors, and styles. It can then display a personalized selection of photos based on these preferences.",
    "Mirror Frame: A picture frame that doubles as a mirror. The frame has a mirrored surface on one side and a digital display on the other. Users can use the mirror to check their appearance, and then switch to the digital display to view their photos. The frame could also have a built-in timer for taking selfies or a built-in mirror light for better visibility.",
    "Augmented Reality Frame: A picture frame that overlays digital information onto real-world objects. Users can place a photo in the frame and then use the frame's augmented reality (AR) capabilities to add virtual objects, such as annotations, filters, or even 3D models, to the image. The frame could also have a built-in camera for capturing AR content."
