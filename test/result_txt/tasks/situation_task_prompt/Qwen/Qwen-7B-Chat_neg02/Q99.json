    "Use texture: One way to differentiate between different objects is by using texture. For example, if two objects have the same color but one has a rougher surface than the other, it may be possible to distinguish them based on touch alone.",
    "Sound: Another way to differentiate between objects is through sound. Objects that are made of different materials or have different shapes may produce different sounds when they are touched or moved.",
    "Smell: If all colors disappeared, it's possible that certain smells could become more pronounced. For example, fruits may have stronger odors, while flowers may have more subtle scents.",
    "Size: Depending on the size of the object, it may be possible to tell it apart from others even if they have the same color. For example, a small ball might be easier to pick up and move around than a larger one.",
    "Shape: Finally, shape can also be used to differentiate between objects. Even if two objects have the same color, their shape may be enough to distinguish them. For example, a round object might look different from a square one, even if they are both black and white."
