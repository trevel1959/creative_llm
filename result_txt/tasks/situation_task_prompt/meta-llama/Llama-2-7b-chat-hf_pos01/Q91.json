    "Develop a wearable alert system: Create a suit with built-in sensors that can detect changes in temperature, pressure, or vibration. If any of these sensors detect an impending injury, the suit would alert the person through a series of vibrations, sounds, or even a mild electrical shock. This would give the person enough time to react and avoid the injury. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Utilize echolocation: Since the person cannot feel physical sensations, they could use echolocation to navigate their surroundings. This involves emitting high-frequency sounds and detecting the echoes that bounce back to determine the distance, shape, and size of objects around them. This would allow the person to avoid obstacles and potential injuries. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Install a force field: Develop a technology that generates a force field around the person, protecting them from any physical contact or impact. This force field could be created using electromagnetic fields or even advanced nanotechnology. The force field would detect any potential threats and adjust its strength accordingly to protect the person. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Use advanced AI-powered prosthetics: Create advanced prosthetic limbs that are equipped with AI-powered sensors and algorithms. These prosthetics would be able to detect potential injuries and alert the person through a series of vibrations, sounds, or even a mild electrical shock. Additionally, the AI algorithms could predict potential injuries based on the person's movements and adjust the prosthetics accordingly. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Develop a telepathic communication system: Create a system that allows the person to communicate with others telepathically, bypassing the need for physical sensations. This system could use advanced brain-computer interfaces or even quantum entanglement to establish a direct neural connection between the person and their communication partner. This would allow the person to communicate and receive information without relying on physical sensations. Confidence score: 0.95"
