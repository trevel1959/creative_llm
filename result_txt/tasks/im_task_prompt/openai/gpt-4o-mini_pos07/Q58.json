    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Dryer**: Design a hair dryer that uses sustainable materials and energy-efficient technology. This dryer could feature a built-in solar panel that charges while not in use, reducing electricity consumption. Additionally, it could use biodegradable components and recyclable packaging to minimize environmental impact.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Hair Dryer**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light or a heat cycle to eliminate dust, lint, and bacteria from the internal components of the hair dryer. This feature would not only maintain the performance of the dryer but also ensure healthier styling by preventing the transfer of dirt to the hair.",
    "**Modular Hair Dryer**: Create a modular hair dryer with interchangeable attachments for different styling needs. Users could switch out the nozzle for a diffuser, a concentrator, or a brush attachment, allowing for versatile styling options without needing multiple devices. The modular design could also make it easier to clean and maintain.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Hair Dryer**: Develop a hair dryer that utilizes sound-dampening technology to significantly reduce noise levels while operating. This would create a more pleasant experience, especially in shared living spaces or for individuals who are sensitive to loud sounds, while still delivering powerful airflow.",
    "**Portable Hair Dryer with Rechargeable Battery**: Design a lightweight, compact hair dryer with a powerful rechargeable battery, allowing users to dry their hair on the go without needing to be near an outlet. This would be ideal for travelers or gym-goers, and the dryer could feature fast-charging capabilities for convenience."
