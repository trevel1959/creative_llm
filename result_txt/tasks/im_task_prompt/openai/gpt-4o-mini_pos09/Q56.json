    "**Multifunctional Bell with Safety Lights**: Design a bicycle bell that also incorporates LED lights for added visibility. The bell could have different modes, such as a steady light for visibility at night, a flashing light to signal turns, and a sound alert when pressed. This would enhance safety by making cyclists more visible to motorists and pedestrians, especially in low-light conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Sound Options**: Create a bicycle bell that uses sustainable materials and offers sound options inspired by nature. Instead of the traditional metallic sound, users could choose from sounds like bird chirps, wind chimes, or even ocean waves. This would not only promote environmental consciousness but also provide a more pleasant auditory experience for both the cyclist and surrounding individuals.",
    "**Personalized Sound Profiles**: Develop a bicycle bell that allows users to record their own sounds or messages. Cyclists could record a friendly “hello” or a playful jingle that reflects their personality. This feature would make each bell unique and could foster a sense of community as cyclists hear each other’s custom sounds while riding.",
    "**Interactive Bell with Gesture Control**: Innovate a bicycle bell that can be activated by gestures. For example, a simple wave of the hand or a specific movement of the handlebars could trigger the bell. This would allow cyclists to keep their hands on the handlebars while still alerting others, improving safety and convenience, especially in busy traffic situations.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bell**: Create a bicycle bell powered by a small solar panel. This bell would harness solar energy during the day to charge a battery, ensuring it remains functional without the need for battery replacements. This eco-friendly option would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists and reduce waste."
