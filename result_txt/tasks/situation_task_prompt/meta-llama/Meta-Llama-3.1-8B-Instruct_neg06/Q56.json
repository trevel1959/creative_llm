    "**Holographic Projection**: In a world without mirrors, I'd use holographic technology to project my own image. I'd wear a small, wearable device that captures my 3D image and projects it back to me, allowing me to see myself from any angle. The device would use advanced algorithms to ensure a realistic and accurate representation of my appearance. I could even customize the projection to show different outfits, hairstyles, or even change my facial expression.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: I'd use smart contact lenses with a built-in camera and display. These lenses would capture my image and display it back to me, allowing me to see my reflection in real-time. The lenses would also have advanced AI-powered image processing, ensuring that my reflection is always clear and accurate. I could even use the lenses to take selfies or video calls with others.",
    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: I'd wear AR glasses that use advanced computer vision and machine learning to track my movements and display my reflection in real-time. The glasses would use a combination of cameras and sensors to capture my image and project it back to me, allowing me to see myself from any angle. I could even use the glasses to try on virtual outfits or see how different hairstyles would look.",
    "**Biometric Scanning**: I'd use a non-invasive biometric scanner that captures my 3D image and projects it back to me. The scanner would use advanced algorithms to ensure a realistic and accurate representation of my appearance. I could even use the scanner to track my physical changes over time, such as weight loss or muscle gain.",
    "**Light Field Display**: I'd use a light field display that projects a 3D image of myself into space. The display would use a combination of lasers and mirrors to create a realistic and accurate representation of my appearance. I could even use the display to create multiple reflections or try on different outfits and hairstyles in real-time. [/INST] "
