    "A Floating City: A self-sustaining city built on a massive, hollowed-out iceberg in the middle of the ocean. The city is powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power generated from the iceberg's melting. The city's inhabitants live in a futuristic, high-tech environment with advanced green spaces, and they use advanced water management systems to collect and recycle rainwater and snowmelt. The city is designed to be a hub for sustainable innovation and education, attracting scientists, entrepreneurs, and innovators from around the world.",
    "A Subterranean Metropolis: A massive underground city built into the sides of mountains, using advanced geothermal energy and natural ventilation systems to power and cool the city. The city is a labyrinth of interconnected tunnels and caverns, with towering ceilings and vast underground gardens. The inhabitants live in sustainable, eco-friendly habitats that are integrated into the natural environment, with advanced systems for recycling and reusing resources. The city is a haven for artists, musicians, and writers, who find inspiration in the unique underground environment.",
    "A Floating Island: A massive, artificial island made from recycled plastic waste and other non-biodegradable materials, designed to be a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional land-based development. The island is powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrogen fuel cells, and is designed to be a hub for sustainable innovation and education. The island is home to a diverse community of artists, entrepreneurs, and innovators, who work together to develop new technologies and solutions for a more sustainable future.",
    "A Vertical Farm: A massive, multi-story vertical farm that uses advanced hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and other crops. The farm is powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal energy, and is designed to be a model for sustainable agriculture and food production. The farm is home to a community of farmers, scientists, and innovators who work together to develop new technologies and techniques for growing food in a more sustainable way.",
    "A Space Colony: A self-sustaining colony on the moon or another planet, designed to be a hub for space exploration and development. The colony is powered by a combination of solar panels, nuclear reactors, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, which use local resources to produce fuel, oxygen, and other essential resources. The colony is home to a diverse community of scientists, engineers, and innovators"
