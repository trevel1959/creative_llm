    "**Incorporating Daylight into Your Sleep Environment**: You can create a sleep environment that takes advantage of natural light. Use blackout curtains to control the amount of light entering your room during the day. Then, use a smart light system that gradually reduces the brightness as night approaches, mimicking the natural decrease in sunlight. This system can also be programmed to turn on in the morning to simulate sunrise and wake you up gently.",
    "**Developing a Light-Responsive Sleep Routine**: Since there are no more nights, you might want to develop a routine that helps your body distinguish between daytime and nighttime based on the ambient light. For instance, you could use a wearable device that measures light exposure and adjusts your sleep schedule accordingly. During the day, ensure you're exposed to bright light for several hours, then reduce light exposure in the evening to signal your body it's time to sleep.",
    "**Creating an \"Inverted\" Day and Night Cycle**: Instead of following the traditional cycle where you sleep at night and are awake during the day, you could create a new cycle where you sleep during the day and work or be active at night. This would require some adjustment, but with proper planning, it could be effective. You'd need to manage your activities and sleep patterns carefully, ensuring you get enough restful sleep during your designated \"night\" hours.",
    "**Utilizing Light Therapy for Sleep Assistance**: Invest in a high-quality light therapy lamp that can help regulate your circadian rhythm. Use it during your designated \"day\" time to mimic natural sunlight and help your body maintain a healthy sleep-wake cycle. You can also use a light alarm clock that wakes you up with a gentle increase in light intensity, helping you to wake up naturally and feeling refreshed.",
    "**Designing a Sleep-Oriented Space**: Create a dedicated space specifically for sleeping, optimized for minimal light exposure. This could include using low-light or non-visible light sources (like red lights) that don't disrupt your sleep. Additionally, incorporate calming elements such as soft, soothing colors, comfortable bedding, and perhaps even aromatherapy to enhance relaxation and promote better sleep quality throughout the day."
