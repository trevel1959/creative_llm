    "**Memory Board**: Instead of just displaying photos, use a picture frame to create a memory board. Attach a corkboard or a magnetic board to the back of the frame. Use push pins or magnets to display postcards, ticket stubs, and other small memorabilia, allowing you to curate a collection of your favorite memories in one stylish piece.",
    "**Artistic Plant Holder**: Create a unique plant holder by removing the glass and backing from the frame and attaching small pots or terrariums directly to the frame's structure. Hang it on a wall for a vertical garden display that adds greenery and art to your living space.",
    "**DIY Chalkboard**: Convert a picture frame into a chalkboard by painting the backboard with chalkboard paint. This allows you to write messages, reminders, or doodles and easily update them as needed. It’s perfect for kitchens, offices, or kids’ rooms.",
    "**Shadow Box for Keepsakes**: Use a deep picture frame to create a shadow box that showcases keepsakes such as baby shoes, wedding mementos, or travel souvenirs. Add decorative paper or fabric as a background and secure the items inside to create a three-dimensional display that tells a story.",
    "**Themed Wall Art**: Instead of traditional artwork, create themed wall art by placing various objects within the frame. For example, fill the frame with dried flowers, feathers, or seashells to create a natural display. This can be a fun way to reflect personal interests or travels."
