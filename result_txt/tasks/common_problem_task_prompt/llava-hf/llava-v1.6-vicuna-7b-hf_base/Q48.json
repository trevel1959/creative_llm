    "Lack of Participation: Another issue that arises when creating a new sport is the lack of participation from people. It's important to have a significant number of participants to make the sport engaging and competitive. Without an adequate number of participants, the new sport may struggle to attract sponsors, partners, or even players.",
    "Lack of Standardized Rules: Different sports have standardized rules that make them appealing to spectators and players alike. When creating a new sport, it's important to have a set of standardized rules to ensure fair competition and consistent gameplay. Without these rules, the new sport may struggle to gain recognition or even players.",
    "Inadequate Facilities: Creating a new sport often requires new facilities, such as fields, courts, or tracks. However, if these facilities are inadequate or not located in areas with high foot traffic, the new sport may struggle to attract players or spectators.",
    "Competition with Existing Sports: It can be challenging to create a new sport when there are already established sports that capture the attention of fans and athletes alike. The new sport may have to find unique ways to differentiate itself and attract players and spectators.",
    "Safety Concerns: When creating a new sport, it's important to address safety concerns for players and spectators. If the sport is too dangerous or not well-regulated, it may struggle to gain acceptance or be considered a legitimate sport."
