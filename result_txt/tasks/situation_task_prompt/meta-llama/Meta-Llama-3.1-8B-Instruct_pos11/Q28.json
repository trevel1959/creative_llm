    "**Augmented Reality Notebooks**: Develop a special notebook that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to record and display information. The notebook would have a unique code or marker that, when scanned with a smartphone or tablet, would unlock a digital version of the notebook. This digital version would allow users to record, edit, and share information, making it easily accessible and editable. The AR notebook would also include features such as voice-to-text, image recognition, and integration with other digital tools.",
    "**3D Printed Data Cubes**: Create 3D printed data cubes that can store and display information in a physical format. Each cube would have a unique shape and design, making it easy to identify and organize different types of data. The cubes could be connected together to form a larger structure, allowing users to visualize complex relationships between different pieces of information. The cubes could also include interactive elements, such as buttons or sensors, to enable users to easily access and manipulate the data.",
    "**Biometric Data Tattoos**: Develop biometric data tattoos that can store and display information using advanced nanotechnology. The tattoos would be designed to be discreet and comfortable to wear, while also providing a secure and tamper-proof way to record important information. The tattoos could be programmed to respond to specific commands or triggers, allowing users to access and share their data as needed.",
    "**Smart Glass Slates**: Create smart glass slates that can record and display information using advanced display technology. The slates would be made from a special type of glass that can be easily etched or scratched to create a surface for writing or drawing. The slates would also include a range of interactive features, such as touchscreens, voice assistants, and camera integration, making it easy to capture and share information.",
    "**Neural Interface Pens**: Develop neural interface pens that can record and transmit information directly from the user's brain. The pens would use advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to detect and interpret neural signals, allowing users to record thoughts, ideas, and memories with ease. The pens could also include features such as voice-to-text, image recognition, and integration with other digital tools, making it easy to share and collaborate on information. [/INST] [/INST] "
