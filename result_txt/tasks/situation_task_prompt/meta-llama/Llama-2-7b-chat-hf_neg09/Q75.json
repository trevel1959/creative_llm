    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to harness the power of the sun through solar panels integrated into the body of the vehicle. These solar panels could be placed on the hood, roof, and trunk of the vehicle, maximizing the surface area for energy collection. The energy generated could be stored in advanced battery technology, providing a reliable and sustainable source of power for the vehicle.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option for powering vehicles without oil would be to use hydrogen fuel cells. These cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which could be used to power electric motors in vehicles. The hydrogen could be produced through various means, such as electrolysis of water or the fermentation of biomass. The only byproduct of this process would be water vapor and heat, making it a clean and efficient source of energy.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: To make electric vehicles a viable option for long-distance travel, advanced battery technology could be developed to provide longer driving ranges and faster charging times. For example, solid-state batteries could replace traditional lithium-ion batteries, offering higher energy density and faster charging capabilities. Additionally, new materials and designs could be used to improve the efficiency of the batteries, such as graphene-based batteries or batteries with nanostructured electrodes.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Vehicles: Another creative solution to power vehicles without oil would be to use nuclear reactors. These reactors could generate electricity through nuclear fission, which could be used to power electric motors in vehicles. The nuclear reactors could be small and lightweight, making them suitable for use in vehicles. The only byproduct of this process would be low-level radioactive waste, which could be safely disposed of.",
    "Bio-Ethanol Vehicles: Bio-ethanol is a renewable fuel source that could be used to power vehicles. It is produced through the fermentation of biomass, such as corn, sugarcane, or switchgrass. The energy generated from the fermentation process could be used to power internal combustion engines or fuel cells in vehicles. The"
