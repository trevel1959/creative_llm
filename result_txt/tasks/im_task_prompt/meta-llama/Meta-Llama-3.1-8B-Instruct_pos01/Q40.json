    "**Galactic Goggles**: A pair of sunglasses with a built-in, holographic display that projects a 3D map of the wearer's surroundings, complete with real-time traffic updates, weather forecasts, and even a virtual tour guide to help navigate unfamiliar cities. The lenses would be made of a special, optically-clear material that allows the wearer to see the real world while still displaying the holographic information.",
    "**MindScape**: A revolutionary new type of sunglasses that uses EEG sensors and AI-powered algorithms to read the wearer's brain activity and display a personalized, immersive audio-visual experience. The glasses could generate a soundscape that complements the wearer's mood, or even create a virtual reality environment that simulates a relaxing beach scene or a thrilling adventure.",
    "**SmartShield**: A pair of sunglasses with a built-in, impact-absorbing material that can detect and respond to potential threats, such as a incoming object or a sudden change in lighting. The glasses would deploy a thin, transparent shield that protects the wearer's eyes from harm, while also providing real-time alerts and warnings to help prevent accidents.",
    "**EcoEye**: A sustainable, eco-friendly pair of sunglasses made from recycled materials and designed to reduce waste. The frames would be 3D-printed from bioplastics, and the lenses would be made from a special, plant-based material that can be composted at the end of their life cycle. The glasses would also come with a built-in, solar-powered charging system that powers a small, LED light that can be used as a makeshift flashlight.",
    "**Aurora**: A pair of sunglasses that use advanced, nanotechnology-based materials to create a dynamic, color-shifting effect that reacts to the wearer's surroundings. The lenses would change color in response to changes in lighting, temperature, or even the wearer's emotions, creating a truly one-of-a-kind visual experience."
