    "\"Gaitrail\": A wearable exosuit that enables starfish to walk on land by mimicking the movement of their oceanic counterparts. The suit uses hydraulics and artificial muscles to replicate the fluid motion of a starfish's movements, allowing them to move efficiently on land.",
    "\"Stellar Stride\": A training program that teaches starfish how to walk on land by simulating various terrain and obstacles. Using a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality, the program helps starfish build strength, balance, and coordination necessary for walking on land.",
    "\"Ocean2Land\": A specialized transportation system that allows starfish to travel from the ocean to land and back again. The system uses a combination of water jets and magnetic levitation to propel the starfish through the water and onto land, ensuring a smooth and comfortable transition.",
    "\"Fins to Feet\": A genetic modification that allows starfish to grow feet in addition to their existing fins. This modification enables starfish to move more efficiently on land and adapt to different environments, such as beaches and forests.",
    "\"Tidal Treads\": A specialized treadmill that simulates the movement of ocean waves, allowing starfish to train and exercise on land. The treadmill uses a combination of water and air resistance to mimic the movement of the ocean, providing a realistic and challenging workout for the starfish."
