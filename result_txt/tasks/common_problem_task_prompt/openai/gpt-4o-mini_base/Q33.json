    "**Food Sources**: Finding food can be challenging. The island may lack edible plants or animals, leading to malnutrition. To address this, one could forage for edible fruits, nuts, and roots while also learning to identify poisonous species. Setting traps or fishing with improvised tools could also provide protein. Creating a small garden using seeds from any found fruits or vegetables can help establish a sustainable food source.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Protection from the elements is vital for survival. Without a proper shelter, exposure to rain, wind, and sun can lead to illness or injury. One could use fallen branches, palm leaves, and other natural materials to build a sturdy shelter. Elevating the structure off the ground can help protect against insects and flooding.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: If rescue is the goal, being lost can lead to prolonged isolation. Without a map or compass, one might struggle to orient themselves. To solve this, one could create a makeshift compass using a magnetized needle floating in water or observe the sun and stars for directional cues. Marking significant landmarks or creating a signal fire can also aid in navigation and attract rescuers.",
    "**Mental Health Struggles**: Isolation can take a toll on mental well-being. Feelings of loneliness, despair, or anxiety can hinder survival efforts. To cope, one could establish a daily routine that includes tasks like gathering food, building shelter, and self-care activities. Keeping a journal or talking to oneself can help process emotions. Engaging in mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can also alleviate stress.",
    "**Injury and Illness**: Injuries from falls, sharp objects, or animal bites can occur, and without medical supplies, infections can be life-threatening. To mitigate this risk, one could learn basic first aid techniques, using natural remedies like honey or aloe vera for wound care. Creating a sterile environment for treating injuries and being cautious when moving around the island can help prevent accidents."
