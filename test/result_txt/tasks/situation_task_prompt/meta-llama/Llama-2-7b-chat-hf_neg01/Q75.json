    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to solar power. Vehicles could be equipped with solar panels on their roofs or hoods, which would convert sunlight into electricity to power the vehicle. This would not only reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, solar panels can be easily installed on existing vehicles, making the transition relatively seamless.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option to power vehicles without oil is through hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen can be extracted from various sources such as water, biomass, or even carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Once extracted, hydrogen can be converted into electricity through a fuel cell, which would power the vehicle. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have several advantages, including zero emissions, a longer driving range than electric vehicles, and faster refueling times.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Advancements in battery technology could also provide a solution to power vehicles without oil. Electric vehicles (EVs) could be equipped with more efficient and longer-lasting batteries, allowing them to travel further on a single charge. This would reduce the need for frequent charging and make EVs a more practical option for long-distance travel. Additionally, advancements in battery technology could lead to the development of more affordable and accessible EVs, making them more accessible to a wider range of people.",
    "Nuclear Powered Vehicles: Nuclear power could also be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. Nuclear reactors could be built near major transportation hubs, providing a reliable and clean source of energy for vehicles to recharge. This would eliminate the need for oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. However, safety concerns and regulatory issues would need to be addressed before nuclear powered vehicles become a reality.",
    "Bio-Electro-Chemical Fuel Cells: Bio-electro-chemical fuel cells are a relatively new technology that could potentially power vehicles without oil. These cells use bacteria to convert organic matter into electricity, which could be used to power vehicles. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to"
