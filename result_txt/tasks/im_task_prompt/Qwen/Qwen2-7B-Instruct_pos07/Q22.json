    "**Innovative Outdoor Lighting Solution**: Develop a rechargeable, waterproof flashlight integrated with solar panels. This flashlight can be used during outdoor activities like camping or hiking. It not only functions as a traditional flashlight but also collects solar energy during daylight hours to charge itself. This ensures it is always ready for use, even in remote areas where electricity may not be available.",
    "**Emergency Preparedness Kit Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that doubles as an emergency preparedness kit. It includes essential items such as a compass, whistle, water purifier tablets, and a small first aid kit. This would be particularly useful in disaster-prone areas, offering immediate assistance during power outages or natural calamities.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Design a smart flashlight that can be controlled through a smartphone app. Users can turn the light on or off remotely, adjust brightness levels, and even change colors. This feature is particularly useful in homes with smart lighting systems, allowing for seamless control of all lights within the home from a single device.",
    "**Interactive Educational Tool**: Develop a flashlight equipped with educational features suitable for children. The flashlight could have a built-in speaker that tells stories, plays music, or recites facts when pointed at different objects or surfaces. For example, pointing it at a tree might tell a story about the treeâ€™s history or point out interesting facts about its species.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bioluminescent Flashlight**: Create a flashlight powered by bioluminescent bacteria. These bacteria produce light when exposed to oxygen and glucose, making this flashlight sustainable and completely renewable. It could be recharged simply by shaking the flashlight or exposing it to light, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional flashlights. This innovation highlights the potential of harnessing natural resources for practical applications."
