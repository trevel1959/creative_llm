    "Invest in fire-resistant home: Building the house with fire-resistant materials, such as non-combustible walls and a fire-resistant roof, could help protect the home from a fire. Fire-resistant windows and doors could also be added for more protection.",
    "Have a water supply ready: Creating a water supply, such as a small pond or a large tank of water on the property, could provide a source of water to extinguish a fire in the home. A hose and a nozzle could be kept nearby for easy access.",
    "Fire-proof storage: Keep flammable materials, such as combustible liquids and fuels, stored in fire-proof cabinets or boxes. This would reduce the risk of a fire starting in the home.",
    "Evacuation plan: Create a detailed evacuation plan for the home, including the location of exits, emergency contact numbers, and a meeting point for family members in case of a fire. This would help ensure that everyone in the home knows what to do in case of a fire emergency.",
    "Teach everyone how to use a fire extinguisher: Keep a fire extinguisher in the home and teach everyone how to use it. This would allow family members to take action to put out small fires before they become uncontrollable."
