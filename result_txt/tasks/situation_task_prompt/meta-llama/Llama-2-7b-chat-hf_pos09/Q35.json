    "Develop a network of community-based bike-sharing programs: In the absence of bicycles, a community-based bike-sharing program could be established to provide an alternative means of transportation. Members could rent bicycles from designated locations within their neighborhoods or communities, and return them to the same location after use. This would ensure that there are always bicycles available for those who need them, while also promoting a sense of community and cooperation.",
    "Utilize skateboards and longboards: With the absence of bicycles, skateboards and longboards could become a viable alternative for short-distance commuting. These boards are already widely used for recreational purposes and could be adapted for transportation purposes with the addition of footrests and handrails for stability.",
    "Implement a car-sharing program: In the absence of bicycles, a car-sharing program could be implemented to provide an alternative means of transportation. This program would allow individuals to rent cars for short periods of time, making it easier to get around without the need for personal vehicles. This would also help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.",
    "Develop electric scooters: Electric scooters could be designed and manufactured as an alternative to bicycles. These scooters would be powered by rechargeable batteries, making them a more environmentally friendly option than gas-powered vehicles. They could be used for short-distance commuting and would be easy to maneuver in tight spaces.",
    "Promote walking and jogging: In the absence of bicycles, walking and jogging could become a more popular means of transportation. By promoting these activities, individuals could get exercise while also getting where they need to go. This could also help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as there would be fewer vehicles on the road."
