    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted to fit the userâ€™s grip comfortably, reducing strain during use. Additionally, the spout could be adjustable in length and angle, allowing users to reach plants in tight spaces or to pour water gently for delicate seedlings without splashing.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration System**: Equip the watering can with a built-in filtration system that can purify tap water before it reaches the plants. This would help remove chlorine and other chemicals that might harm sensitive plants, promoting healthier growth. The filter could be replaceable and easy to clean, ensuring convenience for users.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Design a self-watering mechanism within the can that allows it to store and dispense water gradually. This could work through a wicking system or a slow-release valve that allows moisture to seep into the soil over time, ensuring that plants receive consistent hydration even when the user is away.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering Levels**: Incorporate a color-coded level indicator on the side of the watering can to show how much water is inside. Different colors could represent different levels (e.g., red for empty, yellow for half-full, and green for full), making it easier for users to gauge when they need to refill without lifting the can.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Watering Can with Attachments**: Create a modular watering can that comes with various attachments for different watering needs. For example, users could switch out the spout for a spray nozzle for misting plants, a hose attachment for larger gardens, or a funnel for filling smaller pots. This versatility would make it a one-stop tool for all watering tasks."
