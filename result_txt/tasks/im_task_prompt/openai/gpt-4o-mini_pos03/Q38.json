    "**Mood-Responsive Color Change**: Incorporate thermochromic or photochromic dyes into the fabric of the sweater that change color based on the wearer’s body temperature or sunlight exposure. This feature could not only add a unique aesthetic appeal but also serve as a mood indicator, reflecting the wearer’s emotional state or environmental conditions.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sweater with detachable sleeves, hoods, and collars. This would allow wearers to customize their sweater according to the weather or occasion. For instance, a cozy oversized sweater could be transformed into a lightweight cardigan by removing the sleeves, or a casual look could be elevated with a stylish collar.",
    "**Smart Fabric with Health Monitoring**: Integrate smart textiles that monitor the wearer’s heart rate, body temperature, and activity levels. The data could be synced to a mobile app, providing insights into the wearer’s health and fitness. This feature could be particularly beneficial for athletes or individuals looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a line of sweaters made from fully biodegradable materials that decompose naturally at the end of their life cycle. By using organic cotton, hemp, or innovative bio-fabric technologies, these sweaters would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and help reduce textile waste.",
    "**Interactive Sweater with AR Capabilities**: Create a sweater embedded with AR (Augmented Reality) markers that can be scanned with a smartphone app. When scanned, these markers could display interactive content such as virtual fashion tips, styling suggestions, or even animations that change based on the wearer’s movements. This would create a unique and engaging experience for the user."
