    "Smart Tire System: A tire system that uses sensors and AI technology to monitor tire pressure, tread depth, and overall tire health. It sends alerts to the driver when it's time to rotate, inflate, or replace the tire. It also tracks tire usage and provides personalized recommendations for tire maintenance and replacement.",
    "Eco-Friendly Tire Material: A tire made from sustainable and environmentally friendly materials such as natural rubber, recycled rubber, or bio-based polymers. These tires reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles and help to mitigate the impact of tire waste on the environment.",
    "Self-Charging Tire: A tire that can recharge itself through kinetic energy generated by the movement of the vehicle. This tire uses a built-in mechanism to capture energy from the vehicle's motion and convert it into electricity, which can then be used to charge the tire.",
    "Augmented Reality Tire: A tire with an embedded augmented reality display that provides real-time information about tire pressure, tread depth, and other important tire data. The display can also provide personalized recommendations for tire maintenance and replacement, as well as entertainment content such as games or videos.",
    "Tireless Car: A car that uses a new type of propulsion system that eliminates the need for tires. The car uses magnetic levitation or other advanced technologies to propel itself, allowing it to drive smoothly and efficiently on any surface, including water and air."
