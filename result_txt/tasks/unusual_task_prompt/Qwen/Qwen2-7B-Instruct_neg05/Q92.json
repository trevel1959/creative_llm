    "**Personalized Luggage Tag as a Gift**: Instead of just printing a name or address on a luggage tag, create a custom design that reflects the traveler's personality.

This adds a personal touch to their belongings, making it easier for them to find their luggage at the airport.",
    "**Interactive Luggage Tag Game**: Design a luggage tag that doubles as a game. For instance, create a QR code that leads to a travel quiz when scanned by a smartphone. The quiz could be about famous landmarks, world capitals, or interesting facts about travel. This not only engages travelers but also provides them with educational content.",
    "**Luggage Tag as a Travel Journal**: Create a foldable luggage tag that opens up to reveal a small journal inside.

This can serve as a thoughtful way to document memories from their trip, providing a tangible keepsake.",
    "**Luggage Tag with Weather-Resistant Material**: Develop a luggage tag made of waterproof material, ensuring that even if it gets wet during travel, the information remains legible. This tag could have a special coating that allows it to resist moisture and fading, making it a durable accessory for frequent travelers.",
    "**Luggage Tag as a Sustainable Choice**: Offer a line of eco-friendly luggage tags made from recycled materials like plastic bottles or old tires. These tags could feature designs that promote environmental awareness, such as images of trees, recycling symbols, or quotes about sustainability. By choosing these tags, travelers can make a conscious decision to reduce waste and support environmentally friendly practices while they travel."
