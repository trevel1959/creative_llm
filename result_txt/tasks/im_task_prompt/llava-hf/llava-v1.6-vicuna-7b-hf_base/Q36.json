    "Automatic knife sharpener: Another way to improve a knife is to add an automatic knife sharpener. This would allow the user to keep their knife sharp without having to manually sharpen it every time they use it. This would be especially useful for those who don't know how to properly sharpen a knife or don't have the time to do so.",
    "Retractable blade: A retractable blade would be a useful feature for a knife, as it would prevent accidental cuts and injuries. This could be achieved by adding a spring-loaded mechanism that retracts the blade when not in use.",
    "Knife block with built-in storage: A knife block with built-in storage would be a convenient way to store and organize knives. This could include compartments for different types of knives, such as a compartment for serrated knives and another for paring knives.",
    "Knife with a built-in magnetic strip: A knife with a built-in magnetic strip would be useful for those who want to keep their knives dry and organized. The magnetic strip would hold the knife in place and prevent it from sliding around in the drawer.",
    "Knife with a built-in LED light: A knife with a built-in LED light would be useful for those who want to see what they're cutting in low-light conditions. The LED light would illuminate the cutting surface, making it easier to see and cut food."
