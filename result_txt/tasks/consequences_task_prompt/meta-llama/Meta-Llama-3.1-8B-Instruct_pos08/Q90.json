The absence of debt would force people to rethink their spending habits, leading to a potential shift towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious economy.",
    "**Increased Global Cooperation**: The sudden erasure of debt would create a sense of unity and cooperation among nations. As countries would no longer be burdened by debt, they might be more inclined to work together on global issues, such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. This could lead to a new era of international cooperation and collaboration.",
    "**Rise of Alternative Currencies**: The erasure of debt could lead to the emergence of alternative currencies, as people seek new ways to manage their finances and store value.

It could lead to a sense of liberation, reduced stress, and increased confidence, allowing people to pursue their passions and goals without the weight of debt holding them back.
