    "Utilize natural aromas: We can explore different natural scents that are found in nature, such as flowers, fruits, herbs, and spices. We can create a blend of these natural scents to create a pleasant fragrance. For example, we can mix lavender, rosemary, and lemon to create a refreshing and calming scent.",
    "Use essential oils: Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that have a strong aroma. We can use essential oils to create a fragrance that is both natural and pleasant. For example, we can use peppermint essential oil to create a refreshing and invigorating scent.",
    "Create a DIY candle: We can create our own candle using natural ingredients such as beeswax, essential oils, and dried flowers. We can melt the beeswax and add the essential oils and dried flowers to create a unique and pleasant scent.",
    "Make a fragrance spray: We can create a fragrance spray using natural ingredients such as water, vinegar, and essential oils. We can mix the water and vinegar and add the essential oils to create a natural and pleasant scent.",
    "Use aroma diffusers: We can use aroma diffusers to spread the scent of natural ingredients throughout the room. We can add essential oils to the diffuser and set it to a low or high setting to create a pleasant fragrance."
