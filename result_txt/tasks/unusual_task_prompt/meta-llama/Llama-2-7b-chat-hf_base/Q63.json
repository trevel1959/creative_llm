    "A candle holder with a built-in timer: This candle stick would have a small mechanism that can be set to automatically turn off the candle after a certain period of time, ensuring that the flame doesn't burn for too long and waste wax. The timer could be set using a small dial or button, and could be programmed to turn off the candle after 30 minutes, 1 hour, or any other desired time interval.",
    "A candle stick with a built-in diffuser: This candle stick would have a small chamber inside that holds a small amount of essential oil or fragrance oil. As the candle burns, the heat from the flame would diffuse the fragrance into the air, creating a pleasant scent in the surrounding area. The diffuser could be filled with a variety of different fragrances, such as lavender, vanilla, or peppermint, to create a unique and relaxing atmosphere.",
    "A candle stick with a built-in nightlight: This candle stick would have a small LED light built into the base, which would illuminate the surrounding area when the candle is lit. The nightlight could be adjusted to a low or high intensity, depending on the user's preference, and could be especially useful in dark or dimly lit rooms.",
    "A candle stick with a built-in humidifier: This candle stick would have a small chamber inside that holds a small amount of water or a humidifying solution. As the candle burns, the heat from the flame would evaporate the water or solution, creating a humid environment in the surrounding area. This could be especially useful in dry climates or during the winter months, when the air tends to be drier.",
    "A candle stick with a built-in Bluetooth speaker: This candle stick would have a small Bluetooth speaker built into the base, which could be paired with a user's phone or other Bluetooth device. As the candle burns, the speaker could play music or other audio, creating a relaxing and ambiance atmosphere. The speaker could also be used to take calls or play audio messages, making it a convenient and functional candle stick."
