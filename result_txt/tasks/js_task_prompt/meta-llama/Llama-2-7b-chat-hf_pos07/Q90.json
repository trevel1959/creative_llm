    "Bioluminescent Skin: I would give humans the ability to produce light from their skin, similar to fireflies or glowworms. This would provide an additional means of communication, expression, and self-defense. The light produced could be adjusted to different intensities and colors, allowing individuals to convey emotions, mark territories, or signal for help.",
    "Built-in Solar Panels: I would integrate solar panels into the human body, allowing for continuous energy production. This would eliminate the need for external power sources, such as batteries or charging stations, and provide a sustainable and renewable energy source. The panels could be placed on the skin or integrated into clothing, and could even be foldable or detachable for easy transport.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: I would enhance human senses to provide a more immersive and connected experience of the world. For example, I would give humans the ability to see in low light conditions, hear at greater distances, or smell and taste a wider range of flavors. This would allow individuals to better navigate their environment, communicate with others, and appreciate the world around them.",
    "Shape-Shifting Body: I would give humans the ability to change their body shape and form at will. This could include transforming into different species or creatures, such as a bird for flight or a fish for underwater exploration. The ability to shape-shift would allow individuals to adapt to different environments and situations, providing a unique and exciting experience.",
    "Internal Organs on the Outside: I would reverse the location of internal organs, placing them on the outside of the body. This would provide a more efficient and effective way of organizing internal systems, as organs could be easily accessed and maintained without the need for invasive procedures. The external organs could be protected by a specialized skin or membrane, ensuring their continued function and safety."
