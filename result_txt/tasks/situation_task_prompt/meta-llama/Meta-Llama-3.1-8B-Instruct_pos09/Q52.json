    "**Solar Oven**: Utilize the sun's energy to cook a meal by creating a makeshift solar oven using a clear plastic bag, a metal can, and some rocks. Place the food in the center of the plastic bag, cover it with the metal can, and weigh it down with rocks. As the sun heats up the plastic bag, the food will cook slowly over the course of several hours.",
    "**Rock Grill**: Find a suitable location with a natural rock outcropping and use it as a grill. Clean the rocks thoroughly and arrange them in a way that allows for even heat distribution. Place the food on a makeshift skewer or between two rocks, and cook it over an open flame or by allowing the sun's heat to cook it.",
    "**Trench Cooking**: Dig a shallow trench and line it with large leaves or a piece of bark. Place the food in the center of the trench and cover it with more leaves or bark. Use a stick to create a makeshift chimney, allowing the smoke to escape while the food cooks.",
    "**Sand Oven**: Create a simple oven using a hole dug in the sand and a makeshift dome made from rocks and sand. Place the food in the center of the hole and cover it with the dome. As the sun heats up the sand, it will cook the food slowly over the course of several hours.",
    "**River Rock Cooking**: Use the natural heat of a river rock to cook a meal. Find a suitable rock and place it in the water. As the rock heats up, remove it from the water and use it as a cooking surface. Place the food on the rock and cook it for a short period of time, using the rock's heat to cook the meal."
