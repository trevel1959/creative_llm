    "**Solar-Powered Fire Suppression System**: Design a system that utilizes solar panels to power a network of small, high-pressure water pumps and sprinkler heads. These pumps would be strategically placed around the house, providing a rapid response to a fire. The system would be powered by a battery bank, ensuring a continuous supply of water even during power outages. The pumps would be connected to a central control unit, which would detect heat and smoke levels, triggering the system to activate when a fire is detected.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Materials and Insulation**: Focus on creating a fire-resistant home by using materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete, brick, or stone. These materials would absorb and dissipate heat, reducing the risk of a fire spreading quickly. Additionally, install fire-resistant insulation, like refractory insulation, in attics and walls to prevent heat from spreading. This approach would require careful design and construction, but would provide a safe and durable solution.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Vegetation**: Plant fire-resistant vegetation around the home, such as succulents, cacti, or native plants that are adapted to local fire regimes. These plants would help to create a firebreak, slowing the spread of a fire and giving occupants time to evacuate. The vegetation would also provide a natural barrier, protecting the home from embers and sparks.",
    "**Water-Based Firefighting System**: Develop a water-based system that uses a network of hoses and pumps to distribute water throughout the home. This system would be powered by a manual or electric pump, and would be designed to provide a rapid response to a fire. The system would be connected to a central control unit, which would detect heat and smoke levels, triggering the system to activate when a fire is detected.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Coatings and Paints**: Apply fire-resistant coatings and paints to the home's exterior and interior surfaces. These coatings would be designed to slow the spread of a fire, providing occupants with time to evacuate. The coatings would be made from materials like ceramic, glass, or intumescent paints, which would expand when exposed to heat, creating a fire-resistant barrier."
