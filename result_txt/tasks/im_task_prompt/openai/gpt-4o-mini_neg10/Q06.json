    "**Multi-Functional Umbrella**: Design an umbrella that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could include a detachable canopy that transforms into a picnic blanket, or a built-in flashlight in the handle for nighttime use. Another feature could be a collapsible chair that folds out from the umbrella base, providing a comfortable place to sit while staying dry.",
    "**Artistic Umbrella**: Create customizable umbrellas that allow users to design their own canopies. This could be achieved through a special fabric that can be colored with fabric markers or painted on. The umbrella could also come with a projector that displays customizable patterns or images onto the canopy, allowing for a unique look that can change based on the user's mood or occasion.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo for the frame and recycled plastic for the canopy. This umbrella could also incorporate solar panels to power small LED lights, providing illumination during rainy nights. Additionally, it could feature a built-in water collection system to gather rainwater, which could be used for watering plants.",
    "**Personalized Umbrella with Voice Activation**: Create an umbrella that responds to voice commands. Users could simply say, \"Open umbrella\" or \"Close umbrella,\" and the umbrella would automatically respond. This feature would be especially useful for those carrying bags or other items, making it easier to stay dry without needing to use their hands.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Design an umbrella with a special coating that repels water and dirt, making it self-cleaning. When the umbrella is closed, it could use a built-in mechanism to shake off any excess water, ensuring that it remains dry and clean. This would be particularly appealing for users who often find their umbrellas covered in grime after a storm."
