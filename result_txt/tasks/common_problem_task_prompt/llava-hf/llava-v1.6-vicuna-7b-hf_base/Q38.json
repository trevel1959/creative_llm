The director must manage and coordinate the efforts of various department heads like the director of photography, hair and makeup, costume design, and special effects. This can be challenging as different department heads may have conflicting views or ideas on how a scene should be shot.",

However, directors may face challenges in managing the time effectively to ensure that the movie is completed within the budget and within the stipulated release date. This can lead to rushed or unfinished scenes that may affect the overall quality of the movie.",
