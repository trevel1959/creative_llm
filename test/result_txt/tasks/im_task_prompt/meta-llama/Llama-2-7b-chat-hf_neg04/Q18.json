    "Car-Sharing Platform for Neighborhoods: Create a car-sharing platform that connects neighbors who live in the same area. Users can list their cars on the platform and set availability schedules, making it easy for neighbors to borrow and return cars. This platform would reduce the number of cars on the road, decrease pollution, and promote a more sustainable transportation system.",
    "Smart Car Charger: Develop a smart car charger that can detect when a car is nearby and automatically charge it. This charger would be especially useful for electric vehicles, as it would reduce the need for drivers to search for charging stations and increase the range of their vehicles. Additionally, the charger could be integrated with a smart home system, allowing users to control the charging process remotely.",
    "Personalized Car Safety System: Create a personalized car safety system that uses AI and machine learning to predict and prevent accidents. The system would analyze a driver's habits and behavior, as well as real-time traffic data, to identify potential hazards and provide alerts and recommendations to avoid them. This system would greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road and save countless lives.",
    "Modular Car Design: Design a modular car that can be easily customized and upgraded. The car would be composed of interchangeable modules, such as the engine, transmission, and body, allowing owners to update or replace parts as needed. This design would reduce waste and make car ownership more affordable, as owners could upgrade their car without having to purchase a whole new vehicle.",
    "Solar-Powered Car Roof: Develop a solar-powered car roof that can generate electricity while the car is parked. This roof would be made up of thin solar panels that can be integrated into the car's existing roof structure. The electricity generated would be stored in a battery and used to power the car's systems, reducing the need for traditional fossil fuels and decreasing the car's carbon footprint. Additionally, the roof could be designed to provide shade and improve the car's aerodynamics, making it more energy efficient and comfortable to drive."
