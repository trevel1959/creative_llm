    "Lack of Personal Space: Without the ability to control one's thoughts, personal space would become a rare commodity. Everyone's thoughts would be on display, making it impossible to escape the constant intrusion into one's mental space.",
    "Increased Anxiety and Stress: The constant stream of thoughts could lead to increased anxiety and stress levels as people struggle to keep up with the constant mental stimuli. The pressure to filter and prioritize thoughts could be overwhelming, leading to burnout and mental exhaustion.",
    "Loss of Empathy: With the inability to read nonverbal cues, empathy and understanding would become more challenging. People might struggle to connect with others on a deeper level, leading to a lack of emotional intelligence and a breakdown in communication."
