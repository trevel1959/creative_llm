    "Energy efficiency: Tiny houses are often designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional homes, but this can be a challenge to achieve. Designers must find ways to incorporate energy-efficient features, such as insulation, solar panels, and energy-efficient appliances, without sacrificing style or functionality.",
    "Accessibility: Tiny houses are often designed for one or two people, but this can make them difficult to access for people with mobility issues or disabilities. Designers must find ways to incorporate accessibility features, such as ramps and grab bars, without sacrificing space or style.",
    "Storage: Tiny houses have limited storage space, which can make it difficult to keep the living area organized and clutter-free. Designers must find creative ways to incorporate storage solutions, such as built-in shelves and cabinets, without sacrificing style or functionality.",
    "Plumbing and electrical systems: Tiny houses have limited space for plumbing and electrical systems, which can make it difficult to incorporate all the necessary features, such as a kitchen sink, toilet, and lighting. Designers must find ways to incorporate these systems in a way that is both functional and visually appealing.",
    "Ventilation: Tiny houses can be prone to poor ventilation, which can lead to issues such as mold and mildew. Designers must find ways to incorporate ventilation features, such as windows and vents, without sacrificing style or functionality."
