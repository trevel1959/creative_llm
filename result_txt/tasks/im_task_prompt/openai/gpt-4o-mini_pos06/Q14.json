    "**Smart Aroma Diffuser Alarm**: Integrate an aroma diffuser with the alarm clock that releases specific scents at the designated wake-up time. For instance, a refreshing citrus scent could be used to energize the user, while lavender could be employed for a calming effect. Users could select their preferred scents for different days of the week or occasions.",
    "**Interactive Projection Display**: Instead of a traditional display, create an alarm clock that projects the time and weather onto the ceiling or wall. Users can customize the projection's color, size, and style. The projection could also include motivational quotes or reminders for the day, making waking up a more engaging experience.",
    "**Sleep-Enhancing Soundscape**: Incorporate a soundscape feature that not only plays gentle sounds to wake users but also provides a bedtime routine. The clock could gradually transition from soothing sounds like ocean waves or forest ambiance to the wake-up sounds, allowing for a more natural and peaceful waking experience.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Coach**: Develop an app that connects with the alarm clock to serve as a personal sleep coach. It would provide insights into sleep habits, suggest optimal bedtimes, and offer relaxation techniques like guided meditations or breathing exercises. The clock could remind users to wind down and prepare for sleep at appropriate times.",
    "**Fitness Integration Alarm**: Create an alarm clock that syncs with fitness trackers and smart home devices. When itâ€™s time to wake up, the clock could trigger the smart coffee maker, start a workout playlist, or even turn on smart lights to simulate a sunrise. This would create a holistic morning routine that encourages physical activity and energy."
