    "**Smart Sandwich Maker**: This idea integrates technology into a traditional sandwich toaster. It has a touchscreen interface where you can input your preferred cooking time and temperature for each type of bread or filling. The toaster could also suggest recipes based on the ingredients you have available. Additionally, it could connect to your smartphone via an app, allowing you to control the toaster remotely, set reminders for when your sandwiches are ready, and even order groceries if you run out of ingredients.",
    "**Multi-Level Sandwich Maker**: This model is designed for larger households or offices. It features multiple levels (think of it like a multi-level oven), allowing you to make several sandwiches at once. Each level would have its own adjustable heating elements, so you can customize the heat for each sandwich according to different tastes. It could also have a \"sandwich wrap\" function, which wraps the finished sandwich in foil or parchment paper for easy handling and serving.",
    "**Health-Conscious Sandwich Maker**: This toaster focuses on health and nutrition. It includes a feature that allows you to toast bread without butter or oil by using steam. The toaster also has a selection of pre-programmed options for low-calorie or high-protein sandwiches. It could come with a library of healthy recipes, suggesting ingredient combinations that are both nutritious and tasty. Moreover, it might have a built-in scale to measure portion sizes, helping users maintain their dietary goals.",
    "**Personalized Sandwich Maker**: This toaster is designed to cater to individual preferences. It has a database of common fillings, but it also allows users to store and create their own custom recipes. The machine could suggest ingredients based on user preferences, nutritional needs, or seasonal availability. For example, it might suggest avocado and tomato during summer months. It could also learn from past choices, remembering what types of sandwiches a user likes best and suggesting similar options.",
    "**Portable Sandwich Maker**: This compact, lightweight design is perfect for people who travel frequently or live in small spaces. It has a foldable design, making it easy to store and transport. The toaster is powered by USB or rechargeable batteries, eliminating the need for an electrical outlet. It might include a variety of settings for different types of breads and fillings, and it could come with a few basic ingredients like cheese, ham, and lettuce, so users can enjoy fresh sandwiches anywhere, anytime."
