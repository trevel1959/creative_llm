    "Coffee Flavor Infuser: Create a coffee filter that infuses coffee beans with unique flavors such as matcha, lavender, or orange. The filter would have a series of small pockets or channels that allow the user to add the flavorings, and then the coffee grounds are passed through the filter to extract the flavors.",
    "Smart Coffee Filter: Develop a coffee filter that can detect the quality of the coffee beans and adjust the brewing time and temperature accordingly. The filter could use sensors to measure the density and moisture content of the coffee grounds, and then use this information to optimize the brewing process.",
    "Coffee Filter with Built-in Grinder: Create a coffee filter that includes a built-in grinder for freshly grinding the coffee beans before brewing. This would eliminate the need for a separate grinder and make the brewing process more convenient.",
    "Multi-Functional Coffee Filter: Design a coffee filter that can be used for multiple brewing methods, such as pour-over, French press, and drip brewing. The filter could be made with different materials or designs that accommodate different brewing methods, making it a versatile and convenient option for coffee lovers.",
    "Coffee Filter with Filtration System: Create a coffee filter that includes a built-in filtration system to remove impurities and sediment from the coffee. The filter could use a series of membranes or other filtration materials to remove unwanted particles and improve the taste and quality of the coffee. This would be especially useful for people who are sensitive to bitterness or have difficulty with coffee grounds in their brew."
