    "Difficulty Understanding Spoken Instructions: Another problem could be a lack of understanding of spoken instructions provided by the user. Natural language processing capabilities could be incorporated into the technology to improve the accuracy of voice recognition and provide better feedback based on the user's needs.",
    "Limited User Control: Some visually impaired users may find it difficult to operate touch-screen interfaces, which can reduce the usability of current assistive technologies. To solve this issue, voice recognition and gesture control options could be incorporated into the system to allow for more accessible and intuitive interaction.",
    "Misinterpretation of Images and Objects: An innovative assistive technology could also be used to help the visually impaired identify objects and images. This could involve using AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze visual data and provide accurate descriptions or alternative text, allowing users to better understand the contents of their environment.",
    "Limited Range of Functionality: Some users may require additional assistance beyond basic navigation and object recognition. The development of modular and extensible assistive technology platforms could allow for the addition of new features and capabilities in the future to meet the changing needs of visually impaired users.",
    "Maintenance and Updates: Regular software and hardware updates may be necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the assistive technology. A plan for regular maintenance and updates should be developed to keep the system current and useful to users."
