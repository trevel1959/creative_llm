    "**Air Quality Monitoring System**: Incorporate sensors that not only monitor temperature but also detect humidity levels, pollutants, and allergens in the air. The air conditioner could provide real-time feedback to users via a mobile app, suggesting optimal settings or when to change filters. Additionally, it could automatically adjust its settings to improve air quality, such as increasing ventilation when pollution levels are high.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerant Options**: Develop air conditioners that use natural refrigerants, such as CO2 or ammonia, which have a much lower global warming potential compared to traditional refrigerants. This would not only reduce the environmental impact but also make the units compliant with future regulations regarding greenhouse gases.",
    "**Modular Design for Easy Upgrades**: Create a modular air conditioning unit that allows users to easily upgrade components as technology advances. For example, if a new energy-efficient compressor is developed, users could replace just that part rather than the entire unit. This would reduce waste and allow for continuous improvement of the air conditioning system.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Compatibility**: Design air conditioners that seamlessly integrate with other smart home devices. For instance, it could work with smart thermostats, lighting systems, and window shades to optimize energy usage. If the room is empty, the air conditioner could communicate with smart lights to turn them off, further saving energy.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Filters**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism for air filters using UV light or sonic vibrations to eliminate dust and allergens. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and replacements, ensuring better air quality and reducing maintenance costs for users."
