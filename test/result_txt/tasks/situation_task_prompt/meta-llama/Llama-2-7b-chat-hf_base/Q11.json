    "Create a digital backup: One creative solution to continue work or studies if all computers crashed would be to create a digital backup of all essential files and data. This could involve using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive to store important documents, presentations, and research papers. This way, even if all computers crash, access to the digital backup can be gained from any device with an internet connection.",
    "Use a paper-based system: Another original idea would be to adopt a paper-based system for taking notes, keeping track of assignments, and recording progress. This could involve using a bullet journal, a planner, or even just a simple notebook and pen. By transitioning to a paper-based system, work and studies can continue uninterrupted, even if all computers are down.",
    "Collaborate with others: In the event of a computer crash, collaborating with others could be a lifesaver. By working together, individuals can share resources, knowledge, and expertise to continue their work or studies. This could involve setting up a virtual meeting space using video conferencing tools like Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype. This way, everyone can stay connected and work together, even if they don't have access to their computers.",
    "Use a hotspot or public computer: If all computers are down, but there is access to a hotspot or public computer, individuals can use these resources to continue their work or studies. Many libraries, coffee shops, and other public spaces offer free Wi-Fi, which can be used to access cloud-based services or complete tasks online. This way, even if all personal computers are down, work and studies can continue from a public computer.",
    "Use a handheld device: Finally, an original idea would be to use a handheld device like a tablet or smartphone to continue work or studies. Many tasks can be completed on these devices, including writing, researching, and organizing notes. By using a handheld device, individuals can continue their work or studies even if all computers are down. This could involve using apps like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Evernote to create and edit documents, or using a note-taking app like OneNote or Bear to organize and prioritize tasks."
