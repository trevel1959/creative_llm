    "**Redefining Disability**: The concept of disability would undergo a radical change. Individuals who lose limbs due to accidents or medical conditions would no longer be categorized as \"disabled\" in the same way. Society would need to adjust its perception of ability and functionality, leading to a more inclusive environment where the focus shifts from limitation to adaptability. This could foster greater innovation in design, architecture, and technology to accommodate regenerative capabilities.",
    "**Impact on Employment and Economy**: The ability to regenerate limbs could change workforce dynamics. Employers might be less hesitant to hire individuals with disabilities, knowing they could potentially regenerate lost limbs. This could lead to a more diverse workforce, increase productivity, and reduce unemployment rates. On the economic front, industries related to prosthetics, rehabilitation, and disability services might decline, while new sectors focused on regenerative therapies and biotechnologies could emerge.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas and Regulations**: The capability to regenerate limbs would raise complex ethical questions. For instance, how would society handle cases of individuals who intentionally harm themselves to obtain new limbs? There would be a need for regulations governing the use of regenerative technology to prevent misuse and ensure that it is applied responsibly. Debates around the moral implications of \"playing God\" and the potential for socioeconomic disparities in access to regeneration technology would also arise.",
    "**Changes in Sports and Physical Activities**: The sports industry would be dramatically altered. Athletes who suffer injuries could regenerate limbs, allowing them to return to their sport much quicker than currently possible. This might lead to a new category of extreme sports where participants intentionally challenge their regenerative limits. However, it could also raise questions about fairness in competition, as some athletes might have access to advanced regenerative technologies while others do not.",
    "**Psychological and Emotional Effects**: The psychological impact of limb regeneration would be profound. While many might celebrate the ability to regain lost limbs, others could struggle with identity and self-image issues. The fear of losing a limb might diminish, but anxiety about the regenerative process itself could lead to new forms of mental health challenges. Support systems and counseling would need to evolve to address these unique emotional landscapes."
