    "**Water-Resistant Submarine Vehicles**: These vehicles would be small, one- or two-person submarines designed to travel underwater. They would have a transparent dome for the passengers to view their surroundings, and would be powered by an electric motor for propulsion.",
    "**Inflatable Rafts**: Inflatable rafts could be a popular choice for crossing large bodies of water. They are lightweight, easy to carry, and can be inflated quickly when needed. Passengers would use paddles to navigate the water, and the rafts could be equipped with a small outboard motor for added speed.",
    "**Underwater Scooters**: Similar to jet skis, these underwater scooters would be powered by a jet engine, allowing passengers to glide through the water at high speeds. They would be equipped with a small diving tank for the rider to breathe from, and a flipper for propulsion.",
    "**Water-Walking Shoes**: In a world without ships and boats, people might develop shoes that allow them to walk on water. These shoes would be made from a special material that repels water and provides buoyancy, allowing the wearer to walk across the water's surface.",
    "**Underwater Tunnels**: An extensive network of underwater tunnels could be constructed to connect various points across large bodies of water. These tunnels would be constructed using advanced engineering techniques and would allow people to travel from one place to another without ever setting foot on a boat or ship."
