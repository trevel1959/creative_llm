    "Use a combination lock with a unique code: In the absence of keys, a combination lock could be used to secure belongings. The user could create a unique code that is difficult to guess, and then input it into the lock each time they want to access their belongings. This would provide an additional layer of security and make it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access.",
    "Implement a fingerprint lock: Fingerprint locks use the unique patterns of an individual's fingerprints to grant access to a locked container. This would be a secure option for securing belongings, as it would be difficult for someone else to mimic the user's fingerprints.",
    "Use a smart lock with facial recognition: Smart locks with facial recognition technology can recognize the user's face and grant access automatically. This would eliminate the need for keys or codes, and provide an additional layer of security.",
    "Utilize a biometric lock: Biometric locks use unique physical characteristics, such as a retina scan or iris recognition, to grant access to a locked container. This would provide an extremely secure option for securing belongings, as it would be difficult for someone else to mimic the user's biometric data.",
    "Create a hidden compartment: In the absence of keys, a hidden compartment could be created within a piece of furniture or a container. The user could place their belongings inside the compartment and then conceal it with a false bottom or a hidden panel. This would provide an additional layer of security and make it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access the belongings."
