    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sweater that allows the wearer to customize their look and function. The sweater could have detachable sleeves, hoods, and collars that can be interchanged or removed based on preference or weather conditions. This would not only offer versatility in style but also allow for easy washing and maintenance of specific parts.",
    "**Built-in Smart Technology**: Integrate smart technology into the sweater, such as a Bluetooth connection that syncs with a mobile app. The app could track the wearerâ€™s body temperature, humidity levels, and even heart rate, providing real-time feedback on comfort levels. Additionally, it could control built-in heating elements for colder days or adjust ventilation for warmer days.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Yarn Blends**: Innovate with sustainable materials by creating sweaters made from recycled plastics or organic fibers, such as hemp or bamboo. These materials would not only reduce environmental impact but also offer unique textures and breathability. The design could also incorporate natural dyes, making each piece unique while promoting eco-conscious fashion.",
    "**Integrated Lighting**: Design a sweater with subtle LED lighting woven into the fabric. This could serve multiple purposes: providing visibility for nighttime activities like walking or biking, enhancing the aesthetic for festivals or parties, or even creating mood lighting for different occasions. The lights could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing for color changes and patterns.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate nanotechnology into the fabric that allows the sweater to repel dirt and stains, effectively making it self-cleaning. This would be particularly useful for active individuals or those in busy urban environments. The technology could use hydrophobic and oleophobic properties to prevent liquids from absorbing into the fibers, maintaining the sweater's appearance longer."
