    "**Keyless Entry Systems**: Implement a biometric authentication system, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to secure homes and businesses. This would eliminate the need for physical keys and provide an additional layer of security.",
    "**Smart Locks with Digital Keys**: Utilize smart locks that can be controlled remotely through a mobile app, allowing users to grant temporary access to visitors or service providers without the need for physical keys. Digital keys can be easily revoked or updated, ensuring secure access.",
    "**Password-Protected Containers**: Design containers with built-in password protection, such as combination locks or electronic locks with a keypad. This would prevent unauthorized access to valuable items, even if the physical key is lost or stolen.",
    "**Secure Storage Units with RFID Tags**: Create secure storage units that use RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags to track and authenticate access. Users would need to possess a specific RFID tag to access their storage unit, eliminating the need for physical keys.",
    "**Augmented Reality Access Control**: Develop an AR (Augmented Reality) system that uses a smartphone app to authenticate access to secured areas. Users would point their device at a designated marker, and the app would verify their identity through facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or other biometric methods."
