    "Smart Mouse with Integrated Projector: This innovative mouse would have an integrated mini projector, allowing users to project their cursor onto any surface. The projector would be small enough to fit within the mouse's body, and would be powered by a rechargeable battery. This feature would enable users to work on presentations, play games, or even create art on any surface, without the need for a separate projector or screen.",
    "Haptic Feedback Mouse: This mouse would incorporate haptic feedback technology, providing users with a tactile experience while navigating digital interfaces. The mouse would use subtle vibrations and resistance to simulate the feeling of interacting with physical objects, making it feel more immersive and engaging. This technology would be particularly useful for gamers, designers, and anyone who spends a lot of time interacting with digital interfaces.",
    "Gesture Recognition Mouse: This mouse would use advanced gesture recognition technology to allow users to control their computer with hand gestures. The mouse would be equipped with sensors that can detect subtle hand movements, allowing users to perform actions such as zooming in and out, scrolling, and clicking with a simple wave of their hand. This feature would be particularly useful for people with mobility or dexterity impairments, as well as for anyone who wants to interact with their computer in a more intuitive way.",
    "Ergonomic Mouse with Built-in Health Tracker: This mouse would be designed with ergonomics in mind, featuring a contoured shape that fits comfortably in the user's hand. It would also include a built-in health tracker that monitors the user's hand and wrist movements, providing real-time feedback on their posture and movement. The mouse would be equipped with sensors that track the user's grip strength, finger movement, and wrist alignment, providing personalized recommendations for improving their hand and wrist health.",
    "Augmented Reality (AR) Mouse: This mouse would use AR technology to bring digital objects and information into the physical world. The mouse would be equipped with a camera and sensors that track the user's movements, allowing them to interact with virtual objects and information in 3D space. This feature would be particularly useful for applications such as virtual try-on, 3D modeling, and interactive storytelling.
