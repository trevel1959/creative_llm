    "Bicycle-Powered Generator: Create a bicycle that generates electricity as you pedal. This bike would be perfect for long-distance travelers, campers, or even for use in developing countries without access to electricity. The generator could be attached to the front wheel or integrated into the frame, and the electricity could be stored in a battery pack for later use.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: Design a bicycle helmet with built-in sensors and a display screen that provides real-time data on traffic conditions, road safety, and navigation. The helmet could also include a speaker system that alerts the rider to potential hazards or dangers, such as approaching cars or pedestrians.",
    "Bicycle-Sharing System: Create a bicycle-sharing system that allows riders to rent and return bicycles at designated stations throughout a city. The system could include a smart card or mobile app that tracks usage and availability, and provides real-time updates on the location of available bicycles.",
    "Electric Bicycle Conversion Kit: Develop a conversion kit that allows riders to convert their traditional bicycles into electric bicycles. The kit could include a lightweight battery pack, motor, and control system that can be easily installed on most bicycles. This would provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to buying a new electric bike.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Water Purifier: Design a bicycle-powered water purifier that can be used in developing countries or disaster zones where access to clean drinking water is limited. The purifier could use a bicycle-powered generator to create clean water from contaminated sources, providing a sustainable and reliable source of clean drinking water."
