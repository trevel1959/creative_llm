    "**Customizable Aesthetic Panels**: Design roller skates with interchangeable aesthetic panels that allow users to personalize their skates. These panels could come in various colors, patterns, and textures, enabling skaters to express their individuality. The panels could be magnetic or use a snap-on mechanism for easy swapping, encouraging creativity and making skates more visually appealing.",
    "**Ergonomic Footbed with Memory Foam**: Enhance comfort by creating an ergonomic footbed with memory foam that molds to the shape of the skater's foot. This would provide better arch support and reduce pressure points, making longer skating sessions more enjoyable. The footbed could also have moisture-wicking properties to keep feet dry and comfortable.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting System**: Introduce an integrated LED lighting system in the roller skates that can change colors and patterns based on the skater's movements or music beats. This feature would not only enhance visibility for safety during night skating but also add a fun and dynamic visual element, making skating a more engaging experience, especially at parties or events.",
    "**Modular Wheel System**: Develop a modular wheel system that allows skaters to easily swap out wheels based on their skating style or surface conditions. Different wheel types (harder for speed, softer for tricks) could be stored in a compact case that comes with the skates. This would enable skaters to adapt their equipment quickly without needing multiple pairs of skates.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Create roller skates with built-in Bluetooth speakers that allow skaters to listen to music while skating. The speakers could be designed to be lightweight and positioned in a way that doesnâ€™t affect balance or performance. This feature would enhance the skating experience, making it more enjoyable and motivating for users."
