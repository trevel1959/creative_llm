    "**Interchangeable Nib System**: Design a fountain pen with a modular nib system that allows users to easily swap out nibs for different writing styles or ink flow preferences. This could include a variety of nib sizes (fine, medium, broad) and styles (stub, italic) that can be changed without the need for tools, enhancing versatility for artists and calligraphers.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Create a fountain pen with a customizable ergonomic grip that can be adjusted to fit the user's hand size and writing style. The grip could feature soft-touch materials and be designed to reduce strain during long writing sessions. Additionally, it could have a memory foam-like material that molds to the user's grip over time.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature within the fountain pen that uses ultrasonic waves to clean the nib and feed when the pen is capped and not in use. This would help prevent clogging and maintain optimal ink flow, making it easier for users to switch between different inks without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Integrated Ink Blending Chamber**: Develop a fountain pen that includes a small blending chamber where users can mix different ink colors before writing. This chamber could allow for customizable ink shades and effects, encouraging creativity in art and journaling. A small window on the side of the pen could show the mixed color, providing a visual cue before writing.",
    "**Digital Companion App**: Create a companion app that syncs with the fountain pen, offering features like handwriting recognition, digital note-taking, and ink color suggestions based on the userâ€™s writing habits. The app could also provide tutorials on different writing techniques, calligraphy styles, and tips for maintaining the pen."
