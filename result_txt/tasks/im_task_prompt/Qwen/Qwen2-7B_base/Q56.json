    "Voice-Activated Control: Another way to improve the bicycle bell is by incorporating voice-activated control. This allows the rider to simply say a command, such as \"ring bell,\" and the bell will emit a loud sound to alert others of their presence. This improves the convenience and ease of use for the rider.",
    "Motion Sensing: A third way to improve the bicycle bell is by adding motion sensing technology. This allows the bell to detect the rider's motion and automatically ring if the rider is cycling below a certain speed or in a certain area. This enhances safety and alerts others of the rider's presence, especially in residential areas or crowded intersections.",
    "Brighter Sound: The bicycle bell's sound could be improved by adding more intense and noticeable sound. With brighter and louder sounds, you'll increase your visibility by others and reduce accidents on the road.",
    "Add a Light: Adding a light to the bicycle bell will ensure that it is well visible at night or in low light conditions. This will increase visual safety, enhancing the rider's visibility and reducing accidents.",
    "Multi-function Design: A multi-function design could be added to the bicycle bell, making it useful for other purposes. For example, the bell could also double as a flashlight or a signaling device for emergency situations."
