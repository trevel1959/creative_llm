    "**Microwave Roasting Oven:** Design a microwave oven that has adjustable temperature settings similar to a traditional roasting oven. The idea is to enable users to roast meat, vegetables or even bake bread using microwaves. This can be achieved by controlling the power output of the microwaves and possibly incorporating a convection fan for better heat distribution. The benefits include faster cooking times and potentially healthier cooking methods as there's no need for oil.",
    "**Smart Microwave with Food Recognition Technology:** Introduce a microwave that uses advanced computer vision technology to identify the type and amount of food placed inside it. It would then automatically adjust the cooking time and power level based on this information. This could also include a feature to suggest recipes based on the ingredients detected, enhancing user experience and convenience.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Microwave Oven:** Create a microwave oven that is designed with energy efficiency in mind. This could involve the use of more efficient heating elements, improved insulation, and smart features that only activate when necessary (e.g., starting the cooking process only after the door is closed). Additionally, integrating solar panels on the top or side of the microwave to charge its battery during daylight hours could make this appliance more sustainable.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Microwave Oven with Built-in Air Fryer:** Combine the functionality of a microwave and an air fryer into one appliance. This would allow users to perform various cooking tasks without needing separate appliances. The air fryer component would utilize hot air circulation to cook food, achieving crispy textures while minimizing fat absorption. This design would save space in the kitchen and offer versatility in meal preparation.",
    "**Voice-Activated Cooking Assistant:** Develop a microwave that integrates voice recognition technology, allowing users to interact with it hands-free. This could include setting timers, adjusting cooking modes, and receiving audible feedback on the progress of the food. The voice assistant could also provide cooking tips, suggest recipes, or play music during meal preparation, enhancing the overall cooking experience. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who are multitasking or have their hands full."
