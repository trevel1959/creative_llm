    "Create a Water Filtration System Using Vegetation: Develop a sustainable and eco-friendly water filtration system that utilizes vegetation to purify water. The system would involve creating a series of vertical gardens or bio-filtration systems that use plants with natural purification properties, such as cattails, duckweed, or horsetails. These plants would be placed in a series of tanks, with each tank containing a different type of plant. The water would flow through the system, passing through the plants, which would absorb and filter out pollutants, including heavy metals, bacteria, and viruses. The clean water would then be collected and stored for drinking.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification using Nanotechnology: Develop a solar-powered water purification system that utilizes nanotechnology to remove pollutants from water. The system would involve creating tiny nanoparticles that would absorb and neutralize pollutants, including heavy metals and pesticides. These nanoparticles would be placed in a specialized membrane, which would be exposed to sunlight, causing the nanoparticles to heat up and neutralize the pollutants. The clean water would then be collected and stored for drinking.",
    "Water Harvesting from the Atmosphere: Create a system that harvests water from the atmosphere, using a combination of technology and nature. The system would involve creating a network of specialized towers that would collect water vapor from the air, using a process called atmospheric water harvesting. The water vapor would be condensed and collected, and then purified using a combination of UV light and nanotechnology. The purified water would then be stored and distributed for drinking.",
    "Floating Water Purification Islands: Develop floating islands that would act as self-sustaining water purification systems. The islands would be designed to float on the water, using a combination of natural and synthetic materials. The islands would be equipped with a series of filtration systems, including biofiltration, chemical filtration, and UV light disinfection. The clean water would be collected and stored for drinking, while the polluted water would be released back into the water source.",
