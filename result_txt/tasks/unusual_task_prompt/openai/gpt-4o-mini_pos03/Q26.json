    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Instead of just tossing a tennis ball for your dog, you can cut a small slit in the ball and insert treats or kibble. This creates a fun puzzle for your pet, encouraging them to roll and shake the ball to get the goodies out, thus engaging their problem-solving skills.",
    "**Stabilizer for Furniture**: If you have a wobbly table or chair, you can cut a tennis ball in half and use the two halves as stabilizers. Place them under the uneven legs to provide balance and prevent the furniture from tipping over.",
    "**Creative Doorstop**: Instead of a traditional doorstop, you can use a tennis ball to hold doors open. Simply slice a small opening in the ball and attach it to a string or a hook on the wall, allowing it to hang. This not only keeps doors propped open but also adds a quirky decorative element to your space.",
    "**Scented Air Freshener**: Cut a small slit in a tennis ball and fill it with cotton balls soaked in your favorite essential oil. Hang it in your closet or place it in a small bowl to freshen the air. The porous nature of the tennis ball will help diffuse the scent gradually.",
    "**Artistic Paint Applicator**: Use a tennis ball as a unique paint applicator for art projects. Attach it to the end of a stick or a dowel and dip it into paint. Rolling the ball across a canvas creates interesting textures and patterns, making it a fun tool for kids and adults alike."
