People from far and wide come to experience this natural symphony.",
    "**The Mountain as a Timekeeper**: The mountain's movement, whether due to geological shifts or weather patterns, creates distinct rhythms that can be observed by those who live nearby. These rhythms are used to keep time for daily activities, marking the beginning and end of seasons, and even predicting the future. The mountain becomes a communal watchtower, guiding the lives of the inhabitants.",
    "**Mountain Theater**: Visualize the mountain's landscape as a stage where dramatic performances take place.

The audience watches from below, and the actors interact with the mountain's terrain, using its features as sets and props. It's a unique form of theater that blends human creativity with nature's grandeur.",
