    "**Insulation**: Another option would be to improve insulation in the building. Proper insulation can help to keep the indoor temperature more consistent by reducing the amount of heat transfer between the interior and exterior.",
    "**Energy-efficient windows and doors**: Installing energy-efficient windows and doors can help to minimize the amount of heat transfer between the indoor and outdoor environments. These windows and doors are designed to reduce the amount of heat loss in cold weather and heat gain in hot weather.",
    "**Ceiling fans**: Using ceiling fans to circulate air can help to cool down a room during hot weather. The fan can help to create a breeze, which can help to evaporate sweat and make the air feel cooler.",
    "**Portable heaters and air conditioners**: If all central heating and air conditioning systems stopped working, portable heaters and air conditioners could be used to regulate indoor temperature. These devices can be moved around as needed to provide heating or cooling to specific areas of the home.",
    "**Passive solar heating and cooling**: Passive solar heating and cooling systems use the sun's energy to heat or cool a building. This can be done by using materials that absorb and store heat, such as concrete or water, and then releasing it when needed."
