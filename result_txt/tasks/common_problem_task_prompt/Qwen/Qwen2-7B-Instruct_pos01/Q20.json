    "**Customizable Safety Profiles:** One creative idea is to offer users the ability to create personalized safety profiles for their self-driving cars. These profiles could include factors like preferred driving speed, aggressive driving behavior tolerances, or specific road conditions that the vehicle should prioritize. For example, a profile could be set up for a family trip where the car is programmed to drive more cautiously in areas with high pedestrian traffic. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System:** Another innovative approach is integrating a health monitoring system into self-driving cars. The vehicle could analyze data from sensors detecting the driver's vital signs, alerting passengers if the driver appears drowsy or unresponsive. This could trigger an automated stop at the next safe location or call emergency services. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Dynamic Navigation Based on User Behavior:** A unique feature could be the dynamic navigation system that adapts based on the user's past driving patterns. By analyzing how the driver typically navigates through different types of roads, the car could suggest routes or maneuvers that are tailored to the driver's preferences, enhancing both efficiency and comfort. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Enhanced Entertainment Integration:** To make long trips more enjoyable, self-driving cars could integrate advanced entertainment systems that respond to the passenger's mood. Using AI, the car could adjust the music playlist, suggest movies or shows, and even control the climate settings to match the user's preferences. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Smart Maintenance Reminders:** An innovative maintenance feature could include a predictive system that monitors the car's performance and sends alerts when certain parts need attention. This would not only ensure the vehicle remains in optimal condition but also reduce the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns by scheduling maintenance proactively. Confidence Score: 0.8"
