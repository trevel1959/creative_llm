    "Multi-Functional: Design a spatula that can serve multiple purposes, such as a spoon, a knife, or a serving utensil. This would make it a versatile tool in the kitchen, reducing the need for multiple utensils.",
    "Built-in Thermometer: Incorporate a built-in thermometer into the handle of the spatula, allowing users to easily check the temperature of hot or cold food without having to put their hand in direct contact with the food.",
    "Self-Cleaning: Add a non-stick coating to the spatula's surface to make it easy to clean and maintain. This coating would prevent food from sticking to the spatula, making it easier to clean after use.",
    "LED Light: Integrate an LED light into the handle of the spatula, allowing users to see clearly in low-light conditions. This would be particularly useful when cooking in a dimly lit kitchen or at night.",
    "Smart Technology: Add smart technology to the spatula, such as a built-in timer, a temperature control system, or a Bluetooth connectivity feature that allows users to control the spatula remotely through a smartphone app."
