    "Resistance from existing stakeholders: Another potential issue is the resistance from existing stakeholders such as taxi drivers, ride-hailing companies, or private car owners who may feel threatened by the proposed changes to the public transportation system. This could lead to lobbying against the overhaul or attempts to undermine the project's success.",
    "Technical difficulties in implementing new technology: With the proposed overhaul, new technology may be introduced to improve the efficiency and reliability of the public transportation system. However, there could be technical difficulties in implementing this new technology, such as compatibility issues or software bugs, which could cause delays or system failures.",
    "Safety concerns: The overhaul may also raise safety concerns, such as the potential for accidents or injuries during the construction phase or the introduction of new vehicles or infrastructure. Ensuring the safety of passengers and workers during the overhaul process will be crucial.",
    "Disruption of daily routines: The overhaul of the public transportation system may cause significant disruptions to daily routines, such as traffic diversions, lane closures, or changes in bus or train schedules. This could lead to inconvenience and frustration for commuters who rely on the public transportation system to get to work or school.",
    "Political interference: The overhaul may be subject to political interference, such as changes in government policies or budget cuts, which could slow down or halt the project altogether. This could result in a lack of consistency and stability in the public transportation system."
