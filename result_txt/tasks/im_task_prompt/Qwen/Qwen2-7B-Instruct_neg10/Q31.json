    "**Camera Attachment System for Drones**: Develop an attachment system that allows cameras to be easily integrated onto drones, enabling professional-grade aerial photography and videography without the need for specialized equipment. This would enhance the versatility of both drones and cameras by allowing users to capture high-quality images from unique angles.",
    "**AI-Driven Scene Recognition Software**: Create software that uses AI algorithms to analyze scenes and automatically adjust camera settings (like ISO, aperture, and shutter speed) to optimize image quality. This would make it easier for photographers to take great photos without having to manually tweak settings, especially in varying lighting conditions.",
    "**Camera Lens Interchangeability with Smartphone**: Design a camera module that attaches to smartphones via magnetic or mechanical interfaces, allowing users to swap out lenses quickly. This would combine the convenience of smartphone photography with the flexibility and quality of interchangeable lenses, enhancing the smartphone photography experience.",
    "**Camera Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Implement AR technology within camera apps to provide real-time overlays of information such as light meter readings, exposure compensation, and other camera settings. This would allow users to see exactly how their adjustments affect the final shot before they take it.",
    "**Portable Camera Charging Station**: Develop a portable charging station that can simultaneously charge multiple cameras or camera accessories. This would be particularly useful for photographers who travel frequently and need to ensure their equipment is always powered up and ready to use."
