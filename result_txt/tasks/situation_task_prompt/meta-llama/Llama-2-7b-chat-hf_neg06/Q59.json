    "Cloud-Based Solar Panels: Develop specialized solar panels that can harness energy directly from the clouds. These panels would be designed to absorb the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the water droplets in the clouds, converting it into usable electricity. This innovative technology would provide a reliable source of clean energy, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Adaptive Windows: Create windows that can change their tint and opacity in response to the amount of sunlight available. These adaptive windows would be equipped with special coatings that can darken or lighten depending on the lighting conditions, allowing for optimal energy efficiency and glare reduction. This technology would not only provide enough sunlight for various activities but also reduce the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a network of small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be deployed in the clouds to diffuse sunlight. These UAVs would be equipped with specialized reflective materials that can concentrate and direct sunlight to specific areas, providing a consistent and reliable source of light even on cloudy days. This innovative solution would be particularly useful for areas with limited access to natural light.",
    "Cloud-Powered LEDs: Develop LED lights that can harness the electromagnetic energy emitted by the clouds. These LEDs would be designed to convert the energy from the clouds into usable electricity, providing a sustainable and efficient source of light. This technology would not only provide enough sunlight for various activities but also reduce the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Cloud-Based Greenhouses: Create greenhouses that can harness the energy from the clouds to provide a consistent and reliable source of light for plants. These greenhouses would be designed with specialized glazing materials that can maximize the amount of sunlight entering the structure, while also maintaining a comfortable temperature for plant growth. This innovative solution would allow for year-round cultivation of various crops, regardless of the weather conditions."
