    "Idea: The bird who forgot how to fly had previously lived with other birds in a lush green forest. One day, it flew too close to a power line and was electrocuted, losing all memory of how to fly. A kind bird took pity on it and found a home in a city park, where it lives happily among tall trees and squirrels. One day, it witnessed a pigeon being chased by a hawk, and it decided to help. It tried to fly but ended up crashing into a car. It lay there dying until a human found it and took it to a vet, where it learned that it wasn't dead after all, just injured. It learned how to fly again and went back to its home in the park, where it was greeted by its friends with open wings.",
