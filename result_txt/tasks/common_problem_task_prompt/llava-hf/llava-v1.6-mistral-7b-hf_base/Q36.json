    "Infrastructure Challenges: Solar panels need a power grid to transmit electricity. Upgrading the power grid infrastructure to handle the increased electricity demand caused by mass solar panel installation can be expensive, and it may require approval or funding from the government or utilities companies.",
    "Financial Barriers: The cost of solar panel installation can be high, and many homeowners may not have the funds to invest in solar panels. Low-income families and people with limited financial resources may be left out of the solar panel initiative. The city will have to devise a payment plan or subsidy system to make solar panels affordable for everyone.",
    "Maintenance and Longevity: Solar panels require proper maintenance, and many homeowners may not be skilled or knowledgeable in carrying out regular checks and repairs. Ensuring that the city has a skilled workforce or outsources solar panel maintenance can be expensive and challenging.",
    "Aesthetic Concerns: Solar panels can be visually unappealing depending on the design and color, and some homeowners may not want them installed on their homes. The city can address this by promoting solar panel designs that are visually appealing and blend seamlessly with the house.",
    "Environmental Impact: Solar energy is more environmentally friendly than traditional energy sources, but the production process for solar panels still involves some level of environmental impact. The city may have to weigh the benefits of solar energy against the environmental risks and look at implementing more sustainable production methods for solar panels."
