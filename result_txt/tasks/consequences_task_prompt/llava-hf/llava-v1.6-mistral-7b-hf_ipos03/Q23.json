    "Nocturnal workforce: A workforce that can see in the dark could work around the clock without needing to rely on artificial lighting. This could lead to a more flexible work schedule, with people working during the night and taking breaks during the day. It could also lead to a global workforce that operates in different time zones, as people could work when it's daytime in one part of the world and nighttime in another.",
