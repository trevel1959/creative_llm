    "Overpopulation Concerns: With a 200-year lifespan, the global population would increase exponentially, leading to severe overcrowding and resource depletion. Cities would become uninhabitable, and new colonies on other planets or in space would be necessary to accommodate the growing population.",
    "Changes in Social Structure: Longer lifespans would challenge traditional social structures, such as retirement and inheritance. People would have more time to pursue their passions and interests, leading to a shift in societal values and new forms of entertainment and leisure activities.",
    "Technological Advancements: With more time to live, people would have the opportunity to develop and master new technologies, leading to rapid advancements in fields such as medicine, transportation, and energy production.",
    "Psychological Effects: A 200-year lifespan would allow for greater emotional and psychological maturity, as people would have more time to develop and work through their emotions and mental health issues. This could lead to a more empathetic and compassionate society.",
    "Ethical Considerations: With increased lifespans, there would be new ethical considerations, such as the distribution of resources, the allocation of healthcare, and the potential for discrimination against those who are born with genetic disadvantages. Governments and societies would need to reevaluate their values and policies to ensure fairness and equality for all."
