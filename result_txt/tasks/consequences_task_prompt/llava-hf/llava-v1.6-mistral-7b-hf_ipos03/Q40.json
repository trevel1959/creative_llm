    "Population Growth: With no diseases to limit life expectancy, the global population would grow exponentially. This could lead to overpopulation and strain on resources, such as food, water, and energy. It would also put pressure on the environment and could potentially cause ecological imbalances.",
    "Increased Lifespan: With the elimination of diseases, people would live much longer lives. This could lead to a significant shift in societal norms and values, as people would have more time to pursue personal interests, careers, and relationships. It could also lead to a greater focus on mental and emotional well-being.",
    "Changes in Education and Retirement: As people live longer lives, education and retirement would need to adapt. Universities and colleges would need to offer more flexible and lifelong learning opportunities, and retirement ages would likely be pushed back. This could also lead to changes in pension systems and social security programs.",
    "Reduced Healthcare Costs: With no diseases to treat, healthcare costs would decrease significantly. Governments and insurance companies would save billions of dollars on medical treatments, and individuals would no longer have to worry about the financial burden of healthcare.",
    "Shift in Public Health: Without diseases to worry about, public health campaigns would need to shift their focus to preventative measures, such as promoting healthy lifestyles and addressing environmental factors that contribute to disease."
