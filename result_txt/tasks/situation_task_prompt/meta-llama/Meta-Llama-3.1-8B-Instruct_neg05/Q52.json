    "**Utilizing Natural Resources**: I would use natural resources to prepare a meal. I'd gather fruits, nuts, and edible plants from the surrounding area. I'd use rocks to crack open nuts and seeds, and create a makeshift fire pit using stones and dry leaves. Once the fire is lit, I'd use a stick to roast the fruits and nuts, and a large leaf as a makeshift plate to serve the meal.",
    "**Improvising with Found Materials**: I'd look for materials like bamboo, sticks, and vines to create a primitive cooking setup. I'd use a stick as a skewer to cook small game like fish or birds, and create a makeshift grill using a large rock and some green leaves. I'd also use a hole dug in the ground as a primitive oven to cook root vegetables.",
    "**Using Body Heat**: In the absence of cooking equipment, I'd use body heat to prepare a meal. I'd find a warm and sheltered spot and use a small animal hide or a piece of cloth to wrap around a small game like a rabbit or a squirrel. By placing the wrapped animal near my body, I'd use my body heat to cook the meat.",
    "**Creating a Solar Oven**: I'd use natural materials like cardboard, plastic bags, and aluminum foil to create a solar oven. By building a box using these materials and placing it in direct sunlight, I could trap heat and cook small items like eggs or vegetables. I'd use a stick to hold the oven in place and adjust its angle to maximize the sun's rays.",
    "**Using a Trench Oven**: I'd dig a trench in the ground and line it with green leaves or grass to create a makeshift oven. By placing a small animal or a root vegetable in the trench and covering it with hot coals or ashes, I could use the natural insulation of the earth to cook the meal. I'd use a stick to cover the trench and let it cook for a few hours."
