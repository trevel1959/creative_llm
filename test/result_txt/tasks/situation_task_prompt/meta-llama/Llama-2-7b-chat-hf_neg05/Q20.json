    "Floating Islands: With no more planes, people could travel between continents by utilizing a network of floating islands that could be built on the ocean. These islands could be designed to provide all the necessary amenities for comfortable travel, including restaurants, shops, and entertainment. Travelers could simply hop from one island to the next, using a combination of ferries and personal watercraft to make the journey.",
    "Submersibles: Another option for intercontinental travel would be to use advanced submersibles that could dive beneath the ocean and travel through the water at incredible speeds. These submersibles could be designed to carry multiple passengers and could be equipped with amenities such as luxury seating, air conditioning, and entertainment systems.",
    "Space Travel: With no more planes, humanity could turn its attention to the final frontier â€“ space travel. Private companies could develop affordable spacecraft that could take passengers on a journey to the moon or even other planets in the solar system. This would provide a new and exciting way to travel between continents, with the added bonus of experiencing weightlessness and gazing at the Earth from a distance.",
    "Tunnel Network: A more ambitious option for intercontinental travel would be to build a network of tunnels that stretch beneath the ocean. These tunnels could be designed to connect major cities and continents, allowing people to travel between them without having to worry about air travel restrictions. The tunnels could be equipped with high-speed trains, cars, or even personal vehicles, providing a fast and efficient way to travel long distances.",
    "Hovercraft: Another creative solution to the problem of intercontinental travel would be to develop advanced hovercraft technology that could transport passengers between continents at incredible speeds. These hovercraft could be powered by a combination of conventional engines and advanced propulsion systems, such as magnets or ion thrusters. They could be designed to carry multiple passengers and could provide a smooth and comfortable ride, even over long distances."
