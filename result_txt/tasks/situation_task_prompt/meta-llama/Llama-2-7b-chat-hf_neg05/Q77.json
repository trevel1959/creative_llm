    "Floating Parks: With the absence of mountains, people could create floating parks that provide a similar experience to traditional hiking and camping. These parks could be built on large platforms or islands, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. Visitors could hike, camp, and engage in water sports like kayaking and paddleboarding within the floating parks.",
    "Virtual Reality Adventures: To recreate the mountain experience, virtual reality technology could be used to simulate climbing and hiking in a virtual environment. Users could wear VR headsets and gloves, allowing them to feel the sensation of climbing and hiking in a virtual mountain range. This would provide an immersive experience for those who cannot access real mountains.",
    "Urban Rock Climbing: Cities could be transformed into rock climbing facilities, offering a unique and challenging experience for climbers. Buildings and structures could be adapted to create indoor climbing walls, or new structures could be built specifically for climbing. This would provide an opportunity for people to enjoy rock climbing in a more accessible and convenient setting.",
    "Cloud Forests: Engineers could create artificial cloud forests that mimic the conditions of a mountain environment. These cloud forests could be built in areas with low elevation, providing a chance for people to experience the beauty and tranquility of a mountain environment without the need to climb a mountain. Visitors could explore the cloud forest on foot or take a cable car to the top for panoramic views.",
    "Airborne Sports: With the absence of mountains, people could turn to airborne sports like skydiving, paragliding, and hot air ballooning. These sports would provide an adrenaline-packed experience for those who crave the thrill of adventure. As technology advances, new airborne sports could be developed, such as hoverbiking or airboarding, which would offer a unique and exciting way to experience the thrill of flying."
