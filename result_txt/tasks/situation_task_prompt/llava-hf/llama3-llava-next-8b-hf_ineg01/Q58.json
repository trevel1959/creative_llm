    "Traps and Barriers: Another approach would be to use traps and barriers to capture and control insect populations. This could include sticky traps coated with pheromones to attract specific insects, or using diatomaceous earth to create a barrier that dehydrates insects.",
    "Predator-Insect Programs: Introducing natural predators of the target insect species could be a viable solution. This could include releasing ladybugs, which are known to prey on aphids, or praying mantis, which feed on a variety of insects.",
    "Insect-Repellent Plants: Certain plants have natural insect-repellent properties. For example, basil, mint, and lemongrass can be planted around gardens or homes to deter pests.",
    "Biological Control: Biological control methods involve using other living organisms to control pests. This could include using bacteria that kill insect larvae or fungi that are toxic to insects.",
    "Insect-Resistant Materials: Using materials that are naturally resistant to insects could be a preventative measure. For example, using copper-based materials can deter insect infestations."
