    "Custom-designed motherboard with integrated AI processing unit: Create a motherboard with a built-in AI processing unit that can perform complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. This would enable the computer to perform tasks beyond traditional computing capabilities, such as facial recognition, voice assistants, and autonomous decision-making.",
    "Modular and upgradeable hardware: Design a computer that allows users to easily upgrade and modify individual components, such as the CPU, GPU, and RAM. This would enable users to customize their computer to suit their specific needs and preferences, and would also extend the lifespan of the device by allowing users to upgrade individual components rather than replacing the entire computer.",
    "Interactive and adaptive display: Create a display that can adapt to the user's preferences and environment, such as adjusting brightness and color temperature based on the ambient light in the room. The display could also use machine learning algorithms to learn the user's viewing habits and preferences over time, and tailor the display settings accordingly.",
    "Self-healing and self-cooling computer: Design a computer that can repair and maintain itself, such as using nanotechnology to repair damaged components or using advanced cooling systems to prevent overheating. This would reduce the need for maintenance and repair, and could potentially extend the lifespan of the device.",
    "Holographic display and interaction: Create a computer that uses holographic technology to display images and allow for holographic interaction. This would enable users to interact with virtual objects and environments in a more immersive and intuitive way, and could have applications in fields such as gaming, education, and healthcare."
