    "**Textile Tapestry**: Utilize vibrant fabrics, scarves, or tapestries to create a colorful and textured wall covering. I could use a combination of patterns, textures, and colors to create a visually appealing effect. This would also add a cozy, homespun feel to the space.",
    "**Lighting Installation**: Focus on lighting as a form of decoration. I could install LED lights, neon signs, or fiber optics to create a mesmerizing display of colors and patterns. This would not only illuminate the space but also add an artistic touch.",
    "**Wallpaper Alternatives**: Explore unconventional materials like paper bags, book pages, or music sheets to create a unique wallpaper effect. I could decoupage or collage these materials to create a one-of-a-kind design.",
    "**Furniture as Art**: Use furniture as a form of art by painting or decorating the pieces themselves. I could upcycle old furniture or create new pieces with bold colors, patterns, or textures. This would add visual interest and create a cohesive look.",
    "**Shadow Play**: Embrace the power of shadows to create an artistic effect. I could use objects with interesting shapes or textures to cast unique shadows on the walls. This would add depth and dimension to the space without relying on paint."
