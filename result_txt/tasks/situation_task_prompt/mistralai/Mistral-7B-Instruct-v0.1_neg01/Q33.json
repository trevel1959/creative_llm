    "Use natural phenomena: One way to keep track of time without clocks or watches is to use natural phenomena such as the position of the sun, moon, or stars. For example, you could use the sun's position to determine the time of day, or use the moon's phases to track the passage of time.",
    "Use a sundial: A sundial is a device that uses the position of the sun to indicate the time of day. It is a simple and effective way to keep track of time without the need for a clock or watch.",
    "Use a water clock: A water clock, also known as a clepsydra, is a device that uses the flow of water to measure time. You could create your own water clock by filling a container with water and marking the level at different intervals.",
    "Use a sound-based system: You could create a sound-based system to keep track of time by using different sounds to indicate different intervals of time. For example, you could use a bell to indicate intervals, or a whistle to indicate quarter intervals.",
    "Use a mobile app: Even though the question asks about a scenario where all clocks and watches disappear, it's still possible to use a mobile app to keep track of time. You could create a custom app that uses your phone's GPS and other sensors to track the passage of time based on your location and other factors."
