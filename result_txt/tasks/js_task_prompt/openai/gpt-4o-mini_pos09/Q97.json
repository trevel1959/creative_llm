    "Celestial Citrus Fusion:** This candy would encapsulate the refreshing essence of various citrus fruits, combining the zesty flavors of grapefruit, lime, and blood orange. The candy would have a unique dual-layer structure: the outer layer would be a crunchy, tangy shell infused with a hint of sea salt, while the inner layer would be a soft, chewy center filled with a burst of citrus juice that releases a wave of flavor with every bite. To enhance the experience, the candy would be dusted with edible glitter, giving it a shimmering, celestial appearance that reflects its vibrant flavors."
