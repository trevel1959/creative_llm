    "Personal Timekeeper: Another idea would be to create a personal timekeeper, such as a homemade sundial or a water clock. These devices can be made using readily available materials like a metal rod, a piece of wood, and a container filled with water.",
    "Sound-based Timekeeper: A sound-based timekeeper could be created using the sound of a dripping faucet or a bell. The sound of dripping water or the ringing of a bell could be used to mark the passage of time.",
    "Movement-based Timekeeper: A movement-based timekeeper could be created using a pendulum or a piece of string. The swinging motion of the pendulum or the movement of the string could be used to measure the passage of time.",
    "Light-based Timekeeper: A light-based timekeeper could be created using a candle or a lantern. The flickering of the flame or the light from the lantern could be used to measure the passage of time.",
    "Community-based Timekeeper: In a community setting, a timekeeper could be created using the position of the stars or the phases of the moon. Observing the night sky could provide clues about the time of night."
