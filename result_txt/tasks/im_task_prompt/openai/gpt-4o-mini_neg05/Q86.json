    "**Adaptive Control Mechanism**: Develop a wheelchair that can be controlled through various means beyond the traditional joystick. Options could include eye-tracking technology, head movements, or even mobile app control, allowing users with limited hand mobility to navigate their wheelchairs more easily and independently.",
    "**Modular Storage Solutions**: Design a customizable storage system that attaches to the wheelchair, allowing users to add or remove compartments as needed. These could include insulated bags for food, secure pockets for personal items, or even a small foldable table for activities on the go, ensuring that users have everything they need within reach.",
    "**Comfort-Focused Seating**: Create a seating system that includes adjustable lumbar support, temperature control (heating/cooling), and memory foam cushions that mold to the user's body shape. This would enhance comfort during prolonged use and help prevent pressure sores, making the wheelchair more user-friendly for daily activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Source**: Innovate a wheelchair that uses solar panels integrated into the frame or a kinetic energy recovery system that harnesses the energy generated by the user's movements. This would not only reduce reliance on batteries but also promote sustainability and allow users to travel longer distances without worrying about charging.",
    "**Interactive Health Monitoring**: Equip the wheelchair with built-in sensors that track vital health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and posture. The data could be synced to a mobile app that alerts users and caregivers to any concerning changes, promoting proactive health management and providing peace of mind."
