    "**Wealth Redistribution**: The erasure of debt might result in a significant redistribution of wealth. Debtors, including individuals and governments, would be freed from financial obligations, potentially increasing consumer spending and investment. However, creditors, including banks and investors, would face massive losses, which could lead to a financial crisis and a decrease in overall investment in the economy, further exacerbating inequality.",
    "**Loss of Credit Systems**: If all debts were erased, it could undermine the global credit system. Lenders would become hesitant to extend credit in the future, fearing that borrowers would not honor their obligations. This could lead to a credit crunch, where individuals and businesses struggle to secure loans for growth and development, stunting economic progress and innovation.",
    "**Political Instability**: The sudden erasure of debt could lead to political instability in various countries. Governments that had relied on debt financing might find themselves unable to fund public services, leading to civil unrest and protests. Additionally, countries that benefited from foreign investments could face backlash from investors who feel cheated, leading to diplomatic tensions.",
    "**Moral Hazard**: The act of erasing all debt could create a moral hazard, where individuals and governments might engage in reckless financial behavior, believing that debts could be erased again in the future. This could encourage a culture of irresponsibility in financial management, leading to unsustainable economic practices and future crises.",
    "**Impact on International Relations**: The erasure of debt could significantly alter international relations. Countries that were previously debtors might seek to realign their foreign policies and alliances, while creditor nations could experience a loss of influence. This could lead to new geopolitical tensions as nations navigate the new landscape of power dynamics."
