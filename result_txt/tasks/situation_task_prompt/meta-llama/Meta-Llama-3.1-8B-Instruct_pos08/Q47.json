    "**Solar Shield Helmet**: Design a lightweight, aerodynamic helmet that incorporates a built-in solar protection system. The helmet would feature a retractable canopy made of a specialized, UV-resistant material that can be easily deployed when needed. The canopy would be equipped with a ventilation system to maintain airflow and prevent overheating. The helmet's design would also include a built-in cooling system, such as a misting feature or a phase-change material, to regulate temperature and prevent sunburn.",
    "**Hair-Replica Headband**: Create a headband that mimics the natural hair growth pattern on the head. The headband would be made of a lightweight, breathable material and would feature a series of small, flexible nodules that mimic the texture and density of human hair. The nodules would be designed to absorb and distribute the sun's rays, preventing sunburn and providing a natural-looking appearance.",
    "**Reflective Scalp Shield**: Develop a wearable, adhesive shield that can be applied directly to the scalp. The shield would be made of a thin, flexible material that reflects UV radiation and prevents it from penetrating the skin. The shield would be designed to be breathable, allowing for airflow and moisture transfer to prevent overheating and discomfort.",
    "**Nano-Textured Headgear**: Design a headgear system that incorporates nano-textured surfaces to enhance sun protection. The headgear would feature a network of tiny, raised nodules that scatter and absorb UV radiation, preventing it from reaching the skin. The nano-textured surface would also help to reduce glare and improve visibility.",
    "**Personal Sunscreen Mist**: Develop a wearable, personal sunscreen misting system that can be applied directly to the scalp. The system would consist of a small, wearable device that sprays a fine mist of sunscreen onto the scalp, providing continuous protection from the sun. The device would be designed to be lightweight, compact, and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for individuals who have lost their hair. The sunscreen mist would be formulated to provide long-lasting protection and be easily absorbed into the skin. [/INST] "
