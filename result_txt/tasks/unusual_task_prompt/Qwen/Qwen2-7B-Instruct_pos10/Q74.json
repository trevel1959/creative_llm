    "**Innovative Driving Experience**: Develop a steering wheel that integrates advanced haptic feedback technology. This would provide real-time tactile sensations to the driver, simulating the feel of road conditions, such as bumps, turns, or rough surfaces. The system could also offer feedback for lane keeping assistance, providing subtle vibrations when drifting out of lane. This not only enhances the driving experience but also potentially improves safety by reducing the reliance on visual cues.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring Wheel**: Create a steering wheel equipped with biosensors that can monitor the driver's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and even stress levels. By integrating this into the vehicle's dashboard, drivers can receive immediate health alerts and adjust their driving habits accordingly, promoting safer and healthier journeys. This feature could be especially useful for long-distance travel or for individuals who have health concerns.",
    "**Gesture Control Steering Wheel**: Integrate a touch-sensitive surface and gesture recognition technology into the steering wheel. Drivers could control various functions within the car (like changing music tracks, adjusting climate control settings, or using navigation) through intuitive hand gestures, reducing the need to take hands off the wheel. This not only increases convenience but also helps maintain focus on the road.",
    "**Environmental Feedback Wheel**: Develop a steering wheel that incorporates solar panels and LED lights to visually communicate the vehicleâ€™s energy consumption and efficiency. The wheel could change color or brightness based on the car's performance, encouraging drivers to adopt more eco-friendly driving habits. This could include highlighting aggressive acceleration, excessive idling, or efficient coasting, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation Wheel**: Design a steering wheel with built-in AR technology that projects a transparent overlay of the route ahead onto the windshield. This could display traffic updates, potential hazards, and turn-by-turn directions directly in the driver's line of sight, eliminating the need to look down at a separate navigation screen. Additionally, this feature could integrate with traffic signals, showing real-time status and predicting potential delays, making the driving experience more efficient and less stressful."
