    "**Inadequate Resources**: The new curriculum may require resources that the school does not currently possess, such as textbooks, technology, or specialized materials. To tackle this issue, schools can conduct a resource audit prior to implementation and seek funding through grants, community partnerships, or fundraising efforts to acquire necessary materials.",
    "**Parental Concerns**: Parents may be apprehensive about the changes, fearing that the new curriculum might not benefit their children or could disrupt their learning. Schools can organize informational sessions to explain the curriculum's goals, benefits, and implementation process. Providing a platform for parents to voice their concerns and suggestions can also foster trust and collaboration.",
    "**Assessment Alignment**: The new curriculum may not align with existing assessment methods, leading to confusion and potential inequities in student evaluation. To mitigate this, educators should develop new assessment tools that reflect the curriculum's objectives and ensure they are fair and comprehensive. Regular feedback from teachers can help refine these assessments.",
    "**Differentiation Challenges**: The curriculum may not adequately address the diverse learning needs of students, including those with special educational needs or varying academic abilities. Schools can implement differentiated instruction strategies, allowing teachers to tailor lessons to meet individual student needs. Ongoing professional development can equip teachers with the skills to adapt their teaching methods effectively.",
    "**Implementation Timeline**: A rushed implementation timeline can lead to confusion and inadequate preparation. To prevent this, schools should establish a phased rollout plan, allowing for pilot programs in select classes before a full-scale launch. This gradual approach enables educators to identify challenges and make necessary adjustments based on feedback."
