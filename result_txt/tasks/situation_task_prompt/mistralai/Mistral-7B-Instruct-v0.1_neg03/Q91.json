    "Inflatable Safety Suit: I would design an inflatable suit that would provide cushioning and protection from injury. The suit would be made of a soft, durable material that would absorb any impact or shock. It would also have a built-in harness to keep me secure and prevent me from falling.",
    "Sensory Substitution Devices: I would invest in sensory substitution devices such as vibration gloves, tactile sensors, and audio cues. These devices would help me to sense my surroundings and alert me to potential dangers.",
    "Robotic Assistance: I would explore the use of robotic assistance to help me navigate my environment. A robot could be programmed to detect obstacles, monitor my movements, and provide me with feedback on my surroundings.",
    "Training: I would invest in training and practice to develop my other senses. For example, I could practice using my sense of smell to detect potential hazards or my sense of hearing to detect approaching danger.",
    "Sensory Integration Therapy: I would seek out sensory integration therapy to help me better understand and integrate the information from my remaining senses. This therapy could help me to develop new ways of processing information and to better protect myself from injury."
