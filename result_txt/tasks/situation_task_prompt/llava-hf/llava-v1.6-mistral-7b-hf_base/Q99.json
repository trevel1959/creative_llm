    "Shadows: Shadows can be used to differentiate between objects in black and white. Objects with different shapes can cast distinct shadows that can help in identifying them. For example, a square object will cast a different shadow compared to a round one.",
    "Sizes: Although colors cannot be seen, objects can still be judged by their sizes. Objects with larger sizes can be differentiated from smaller objects. For example, a large house can be distinguished from a small house.",
    "Numbers: Objects with different numbers of objects can also be differentiated. For example, a group of three apples can be differentiated from a group of four apples.",
    "Position: Objects that are positioned in different orientations can be differentiated. For example, an object lying horizontally can be distinguished from an object lying vertically.",
    "Materials: Different materials can also be differentiated in black and white. Objects made of metal can be distinguished from objects made of wood, or fabric can be distinguished from plastic."
