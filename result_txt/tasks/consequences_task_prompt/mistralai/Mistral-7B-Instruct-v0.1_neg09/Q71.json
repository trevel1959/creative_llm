    "Immortality could lead to overpopulation, as people would have no fear of death and would continue to reproduce at an unsustainable rate.",
    "It could lead to a stagnation of society, as people would have no need to innovate or push the boundaries of what is possible since they would have all the time in the world.",
    "It could lead to a breakdown of social structures, as people would no longer have a sense of purpose or motivation to contribute to society if they knew they would live forever.",
    "It could lead to a loss of individuality, as people would no longer have the option to choose when they end their lives and would be forced to live with the same group of people for an indefinite amount of time.",
    "It could lead to a loss of cultural diversity, as people would no longer have the option to migrate or move to different parts of the world and would be forced to stay in the same place for eternity."
