    "Create a network of pollinator drones: Develop a swarm of autonomous drones that can be programmed to pollinate plants. These drones could be equipped with tiny pollen collectors and distributors, allowing them to transfer pollen between flowers. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to mimic the sun: Develop LED lights that emit the same spectrum of light as the sun, which is essential for plant pollination. These LEDs could be placed near the plants or even integrated into the plant itself, providing a substitute for the sun's pollination role. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Develop a pollinator-friendly wind turbine: Create a wind turbine that is designed to attract and pollinate plants. The turbine could be equipped with spinning blades that create a vortex, which would draw in pollen and transfer it to nearby flowers. (Confidence Score: 0.7)",
    "Create a pollination-enhancing wearable: Design a wearable device that can be worn on the body, such as a bracelet or a scarf. This device could emit a magnetic field that attracts pollen, which would then be transferred to nearby flowers through the wearer's movements. (Confidence Score: 0.6)",
    "Use sound waves to pollinate plants: Develop a device that emits specific sound waves that can be used to pollinate plants. These sound waves could be programmed to mimic the vibrations that occur during natural pollination, allowing plants to absorb the pollen. (Confidence Score: 0.5)"
