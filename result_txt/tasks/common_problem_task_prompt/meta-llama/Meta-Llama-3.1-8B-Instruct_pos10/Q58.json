    "**AI-Powered Threat Detection and Response System**: Implement an AI-driven system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify and respond to potential cyber threats in real-time. This system would analyze network traffic patterns, user behavior, and system logs to detect anomalies and predict potential threats. Upon detection, the system would automatically trigger a response, such as isolating the affected area, blocking malicious traffic, or notifying the security team for further investigation.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics-Based Authentication**: Develop a behavioral biometrics-based authentication system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and physiological signals to verify identity. This system would collect data on user keystroke patterns, mouse movements, facial expressions, and other behavioral traits to create a unique biometric signature.",
    "**Blockchain-Based Secure Data Storage**: Design a blockchain-based secure data storage solution that utilizes a decentralized, immutable ledger to store sensitive data. This would ensure that data is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or deletion.",
    "**Advanced Phishing Detection and Prevention**: Develop an advanced phishing detection and prevention system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze email and web traffic patterns to identify potential phishing attempts. This system would also use natural language processing to analyze email content and identify suspicious language patterns.",
    "**Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Design a quantum-resistant encryption solution that utilizes post-quantum cryptography algorithms to protect data from potential quantum computer attacks. This would ensure that data remains secure even in the event of a quantum computer breach."
