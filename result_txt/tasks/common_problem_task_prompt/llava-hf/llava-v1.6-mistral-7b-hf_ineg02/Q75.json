    "Wildlife Protection: National parks often serve as important habitats for various wildlife species. The park management must strike a balance between allowing visitors to enjoy the park and protecting the wildlife living within it. Problems may arise from conflicts between wildlife and visitors, such as when wildlife wanders into developed areas or when visitors attempt to feed or disturb the animals. Solutions could include expanding wildlife corridors that provide animals with safe passage through the park, implementing stricter regulations on feeding, and educating visitors on how to minimize their impact on the park's ecosystem.",
    "Infrastructure Management: National parks must maintain and upgrade their infrastructure, including roads, trails, restrooms, and facilities such as cabins or campgrounds. This can be problematic due to the park's remote location and the challenges of repairing or replacing aging infrastructure. Solutions could include implementing a long-term maintenance plan, partnering with local businesses or organizations to address infrastructure needs, or finding ways to recycle and repurpose materials to reduce costs.",
    "Visitor Safety: Ensuring the safety of visitors in a national park is a priority. However, with large numbers of people and potential risks such as severe weather, natural disasters, or encounters with wildlife, maintaining visitor safety can be a challenge. Solutions could include conducting regular safety assessments, updating and enforcing safety protocols, and providing educational information about potential hazards and safety precautions to visitors.",
    "Environmental Preservation: National parks are often set aside to protect their natural environment. Problems may arise from activities like logging, development, or invasive species that threaten the park's ecosystem. Solutions could include enforcing strict regulations on such activities, conducting regular environmental monitoring, and implementing a program for early detection and control of invasive plant species.",
    "Education and Awareness: National parks are important educational resources, providing opportunities for visitors to learn about local ecosystems, geology, and wildlife. Problems may arise from limited resources for park rangers or inadequate facilities for educational programs. Solutions could include partnering with local educational institutions or organizations to offer programs, creating interactive exhibits, and providing information and educational resources both online and on-site at the park."
