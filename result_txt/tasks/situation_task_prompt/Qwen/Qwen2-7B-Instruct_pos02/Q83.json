    "**Incorporate a Sleep Mask with a White Noise Machine**: In a world without night-time, the constant exposure to light can make it challenging to sleep. A creative solution could be to develop a sleep mask that also doubles as a white noise machine. The mask would block out all light, ensuring a dark environment for sleep. The white noise machine within the mask would play soothing sounds, helping to create a peaceful environment conducive to sleep. This innovation would address the issue of light exposure during the day, allowing individuals to maintain their natural sleep cycles.",
    "**Create an Automated Room Adjustment System**: Design an AI-powered system that automatically adjusts the room's lighting, temperature, and sound based on the user's sleep patterns. This system would learn the individual's preferred conditions for sleep and adapt accordingly throughout the day. For instance, it could dim the lights and reduce ambient noise at bedtime, creating a serene environment that promotes better sleep quality. During waking hours, it could increase light exposure and adjust the room's temperature to keep the body in a state suitable for daytime activities.",
    "**Develop a Light-Dependent Melatonin Release Pill**: Since the body naturally produces melatonin in response to darkness, developing a pill that releases this hormone in response to light levels could be beneficial. The pill would contain timed-release technology that detects changes in light intensity and releases melatonin accordingly. This would help regulate the body's internal clock, maintaining proper sleep-wake cycles even in the absence of night-time.",
    "**Invent Sleep-Enhancing Virtual Reality Headsets**: Utilize advanced VR technology to create immersive experiences that simulate the peacefulness and darkness of night-time. These headsets could provide users with virtual environments where they can \"sleep\" amidst stars, oceans, or tranquil landscapes. The immersive experience would trick the brain into thinking it's nighttime, making it easier to fall asleep. Additionally, these headsets could incorporate features like ambient sounds, light levels, and temperature control to enhance the sleep experience.",
    "**Design a Light-Blocking Fabric for Clothing and Bedding**: Develop lightweight fabrics specifically designed to block light, which could be incorporated into clothing and bedding. These materials would be used in garments worn during the day to prevent light from entering the eyes and in bedding to ensure a dark environment while sleeping. This approach would allow individuals to maintain a sense of darkness even when outside, promoting better sleep quality. The fabrics could also be engineered to be comfortable, breathable, and stylish, making them a practical addition to daily life."
