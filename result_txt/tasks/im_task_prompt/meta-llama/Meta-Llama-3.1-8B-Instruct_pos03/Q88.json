    "**Ski Pole Selfie Sticks with Built-in LED Lights**: Design ski poles with retractable selfie sticks that can be extended to take photos of oneself or others on the slopes. The poles would have built-in LED lights that can be programmed to flash or change colors, creating a fun and interactive experience for skiers. The lights could also be used to communicate with others on the mountain, such as signaling a desire to meet up or indicating a fun spot to take a photo.",
    "**Smart Ski Poles with Integrated GPS and Navigation**: Develop ski poles with built-in GPS and navigation systems that provide skiers with real-time information about their location, speed, and distance traveled. The poles could also offer turn-by-turn directions to help skiers navigate the mountain, and provide alerts for hazards such as moguls, icy patches, or closed trails.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Music and Sound Effects**: Design ski poles with built-in speakers that play music or sound effects to enhance the skiing experience. The poles could be connected to a skier's phone or music player, and play a continuous stream of music or sound effects, such as the sound of a cheering crowd or the howling of wolves. The speakers could also be used to communicate with others on the mountain, such as playing a message or a joke.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Fitness Tracking and Analytics**: Develop ski poles with built-in fitness tracking and analytics systems that monitor a skier's physical activity, heart rate, and other health metrics. The poles could provide real-time feedback and recommendations for improving skiing technique, and offer insights into a skier's overall fitness and wellness.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Environmental Monitoring and Feedback**: Design ski poles with built-in sensors that monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. The poles could provide real-time feedback and alerts for skiers, such as warning them of extreme cold or heat, or indicating when the air quality is poor. The sensors could also be used to monitor the impact of skiing on the environment, and provide insights into the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives on the mountain. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are creative and original, and offer a range of possibilities for enhancing the skiing experience. The ski pole selfie sticks with built-in LED lights could add a fun and interactive element to skiing, while the smart ski poles with integrated GPS and navigation could provide valuable information and guidance for skiers. The ski poles with integrated music and sound effects could enhance the emotional"
