    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting System**: Develop a thermos that not only maintains temperature but also harvests thermal energy from its surroundings. The thermos would use materials like thermoelectric generators or heat pipes to convert ambient heat into electricity. This system can power small devices like sensors or provide energy for remote locations where power supply is an issue.",
    "**Interactive Thermos for Food Preservation**: Create a smart thermos that adjusts its insulation based on the food's temperature requirements. It could detect the food inside and change its insulation properties to maintain the optimal temperature range for that particular item. For example, it might provide extra insulation for cold drinks or less for hot liquids.",
    "**Thermos as a Health Monitoring Device**: Integrate a thermos with health monitoring sensors that track body temperature, heart rate, or hydration levels. Users could place their drink inside this thermos, which would wirelessly transmit health data to a smartphone app. This would help in maintaining personal health records and alerting users to potential health issues early on.",
    "**Portable Solar-Thermos for Outdoor Activities**: Design a thermos that incorporates solar panels on its exterior. The solar panel would recharge an internal battery when exposed to sunlight. This battery would then power a small cooling mechanism within the thermos, keeping contents cool without needing an electrical outlet. Perfect for outdoor activities like camping or hiking.",
    "**Thermostatic Temperature Adjustment Thermos**: Create a thermos that uses advanced algorithms to adjust its temperature internally. The thermos would monitor the external environment and automatically adjust its insulation and internal heating elements to keep the contents at a pre-set temperature. This could be particularly useful for transporting medicines or vaccines that require specific temperature conditions during transport. "
