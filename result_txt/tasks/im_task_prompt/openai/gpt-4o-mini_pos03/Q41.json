    "**Self-Balancing Technology**: Develop a skateboard that utilizes gyroscopic sensors and motors to maintain balance. This would allow beginners to learn how to skate without the fear of falling. The skateboard could gradually adjust its stability based on the user’s skill level, providing support as they improve.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also introduces innovative designs that highlight the natural aesthetics of the materials, making each skateboard unique.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Introduce a modular skateboard design that allows users to easily swap out parts like wheels, decks, and grip tape. This would enable skaters to customize their boards based on their personal style, riding preferences, or even performance needs, such as switching to softer wheels for smoother rides or harder wheels for tricks.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting System**: Add a built-in LED lighting system that can change colors and patterns based on the rider's movements or music. This feature would enhance visibility during night rides and allow for personal expression. The lights could be programmed through an app to create light shows or sync with music beats.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-in Storage**: Design a skateboard with a hidden compartment for storing essentials like keys, a phone, or even a small water bottle. This could be achieved by creating a hollow deck or incorporating a detachable storage module that doesn’t compromise the skateboard’s performance."
