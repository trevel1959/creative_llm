    "**Personalized Alert Tones**: Instead of generic alarm sounds, allow users to customize alert tones based on the type of alarm (e.g., fire, burglary, or medical emergency). Users could upload their favorite songs or sounds, making it less jarring and more personal. This could also include different tones for different family members, helping them to quickly recognize the type of alert.",
    "**Facial Recognition Technology**: Incorporate facial recognition cameras that can distinguish between family members, friends, and strangers. If a recognized face is detected after hours, the system can send a notification that a family member has returned home. If an unrecognized face is detected, it can trigger an alert or contact authorities, thus enhancing security.",
    "**Geo-Fencing Features**: Introduce geo-fencing capabilities that allow the alarm system to arm or disarm itself based on the location of the homeowner. For example, when the homeowner leaves a designated radius (like their neighborhood), the system automatically arms itself. Conversely, when they return within the area, it disarms, providing convenience without the need for manual input.",
    "**Interactive Mobile App**: Create a mobile app that allows users to monitor their alarm system in real-time. The app could feature a live feed from security cameras, alert notifications, and the ability to communicate with emergency services directly. Additionally, it could provide tips for enhancing home security and a community feature to share alerts with neighbors.",
    "**Environmental Sensors**: Expand the alarm system to include environmental sensors that monitor for smoke, carbon monoxide, water leaks, and extreme temperature changes. This would not only provide security against break-ins but also protect against potential disasters. Alerts for these issues could be sent to the homeownerâ€™s phone and trigger the alarm system to alert neighbors."
