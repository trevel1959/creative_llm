    "Wear a special suit with built-in sensory deprivation technology: This could be a high-tech suit that uses sensors and algorithms to simulate the sensation of touch, pressure, temperature, and other physical sensations. The suit would be equipped with sensors that detect potential injuries and alert the wearer or others in the vicinity.",
    "Use virtual reality to simulate physical sensations: The wearer could use a VR headset that simulates different physical sensations, such as touch, pressure, temperature, and vibration. This would allow the wearer to still experience a range of sensations without actually feeling them.",
    "Install a force field around the body: A high-tech force field could be installed around the body that detects potential injuries and deploys a protective barrier to prevent harm. This could be powered by advanced nanotechnology or other advanced materials.",
    "Use a telepresence robot: The wearer could use a telepresence robot that allows them to control a robotic body with sensory inputs. This would allow the wearer to still interact with the physical world while avoiding direct physical contact.",
    "Develop a mind-controlled exoskeleton: A high-tech exoskeleton could be developed that is controlled by the wearer's thoughts. This would allow the wearer to move around and interact with the physical world without actually feeling any physical sensations."
