    "**Stapler as a Book Weight**: Create a custom design where the staple mechanism is attached to a heavy base that can be adjusted to hold books of various thicknesses. This not only keeps your book open but also ensures it's secure while you're reading or working on it. The design could include an adjustable arm for different book sizes and perhaps a magnetic back for attaching it to metal surfaces.",
    "**Stapler as a Document Organizer**: Develop a stapler that can also function as a small document organizer. It could have multiple compartments inside to hold paper clips, binder clips, and other small office supplies. The staple mechanism would be integrated into a flip-top lid, which opens to allow you to use the stapler normally, but also provides storage space when closed.",
    "**Smart Stapler with Digital Integration**: Design a stapler that can connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It could provide features like a digital counter for how many staples are left, a reminder when the staple cartridge needs replacement, and even offer suggestions for paper types and sizes based on your usage patterns. Additionally, it might sync with productivity apps to track your work progress or integrate with printers for direct document binding.",
    "**Rechargeable Stapler with Eco-Friendly Features**: Create a stapler that runs on rechargeable batteries and uses biodegradable materials. The stapler could feature LED lights indicating battery life, and it could be designed to minimize waste by using fewer staples than traditional models. It might also include a feature that automatically stops stapling once the battery is low, encouraging users to recharge rather than replace the entire device.",
    "**Portable Multi-functional Stapler**: Develop a compact, lightweight stapler that includes additional features such as a built-in paper cutter, hole punch, and staple remover. This makes it an all-in-one tool for small offices or home use, eliminating the need for multiple devices. The design should focus on ergonomic handling and durability, making it easy to use and carry around without causing strain. The stapler could also have a unique feature like a magnetic surface for holding papers in place during stapling or a built-in ruler for precise cutting and measuring."
