    "**Building a Shelter**: First, I would look for materials such as branches, leaves, and vines to construct a shelter that could protect me from the elements, particularly rain and strong winds. I might also create a roof with a slight slope to allow water to run off.",
    "**Water Collection**: To ensure I have access to water, I'd gather dew using leaves or fabric in the morning, and collect rainwater if it's available. If there's no natural source of fresh water, I'd try to catch rainwater by using large leaves or containers placed under a sheltered area.",
    "**Food Gathering**: My survival would depend heavily on finding food. I'd learn to identify edible plants, fruits, and roots. I might also try fishing or trapping small animals using simple tools like sticks and ropes. If fish are abundant, I'd teach myself how to make a basic spear.",
    "**Signal Creation**: To potentially attract rescue, I would create a large signal fire or smoke signal. I'd use dried leaves, branches, and any combustible material. I'd also carve a distress signal into a tree using a sharp tool, perhaps an improvised axe made from a strong, long stick.",
    "**Self-Care and Mental Health**: Lastly, I'd focus on maintaining my mental health. This could involve setting a daily routine, engaging in activities like drawing or writing in a journal (if possible), and practicing mindfulness or meditation. Staying positive and hopeful would be crucial for my mental well-being until rescue arrives."
