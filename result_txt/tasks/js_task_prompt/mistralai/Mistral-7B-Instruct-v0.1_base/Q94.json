    "Luminescent Energy: This new type of energy would be generated by harnessing the power of light itself. By capturing and storing photons, we could generate a form of energy that is clean, renewable, and virtually limitless. The energy could be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities, making our world more sustainable and efficient.",
    "Thermal Energy: This new type of energy would be generated by capturing and harnessing the power of heat. By converting thermal energy into electrical energy, we could power our world without relying on fossil fuels. This could be achieved through the use of geothermal power plants, solar panels, or even nuclear reactors.",
    "Gravitational Energy: This new type of energy would be generated by harnessing the power of gravity. By capturing the kinetic energy of falling objects, we could generate a form of energy that is clean, renewable, and virtually limitless. This could be achieved through the use of gravity-powered turbines or even by capturing the energy of ocean tides.",
    "Quantum Energy: This new type of energy would be generated by harnessing the power of quantum mechanics. By capturing and storing the energy of subatomic particles, we could generate a form of energy that is clean, renewable, and virtually limitless. This could be achieved through the use of quantum computers or even by capturing the energy of dark matter.",
    "Biological Energy: This new type of energy would be generated by harnessing the power of living organisms. By capturing the energy of photosynthesis, we could generate a form of energy that is clean, renewable, and virtually limitless. This could be achieved through the use of genetically engineered plants or even by capturing the energy of bacteria."
