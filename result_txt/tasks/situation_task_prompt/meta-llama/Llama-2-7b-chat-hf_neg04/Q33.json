    "Timekeeping by Nature's Rhythm: One way to keep track of time without clocks or watches is to use natural rhythms and cycles. For example, people could use the rising and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, or the changing of the seasons to measure time. This approach would require a deep understanding of astronomy and the natural world, but it could be a fascinating and sustainable way to keep track of time.",
    "Timekeeping through Community Drumming: Another option is to create a community drumming system where people would gather at specific times to drum together. Each drumbeat could represent a unit of time, and the frequency and rhythm of the drumming could be standardized to create a consistent timekeeping system. This approach would require coordination and cooperation among community members, but it could foster a sense of community and shared purpose.",
    "Timekeeping through Visual Art: People could use visual art to represent time in a creative and expressive way. For example, a series of paintings or drawings could be created to represent the passage of time, with each piece representing a specific time interval. This approach would require artistic skill and creativity, but it could result in a unique and beautiful way to keep track of time.",
    "Timekeeping through Music: Music has been used for centuries to keep track of time, and this approach could be taken to the next level by creating a musical system that represents time in a creative and original way. For example, a specific melody or rhythm could be used to represent each hour of the day, and different musical patterns could be used to represent different time intervals. This approach would require musical skill and creativity, but it could result in a beautiful and memorable way to keep track of time.",
    "Timekeeping through Personal Symbols: People could use personal symbols or talismans to represent time. For example, a person could use a specific stone or crystal to represent each hour of the day, or they could use a specific object or item that holds personal significance to them. This approach would require personal connection and meaning, but it could result in a unique and personal way to keep track of time."
