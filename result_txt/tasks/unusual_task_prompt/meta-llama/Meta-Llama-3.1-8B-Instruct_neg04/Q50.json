    "A Virtual Reality Travel Experience: Imagine a VR headset that transports users to exotic destinations around the world. The headset would be equipped with high-resolution 3D visuals, 360-degree audio, and advanced haptic feedback, allowing users to feel as if they're actually there. Users could explore famous landmarks, immerse themselves in local cultures, and even participate in activities like scuba diving or skydiving from the comfort of their own homes.",
    "Smart Suitcase: A high-tech suitcase that uses AI-powered navigation to ensure users never get lost in unfamiliar cities.
