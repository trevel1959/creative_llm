    "SpongeBob SquarePants-inspired theme park: Create a theme park based on the popular Nickelodeon cartoon character, SpongeBob SquarePants. The park could feature various attractions, such as a rollercoaster through Bikini Bottom, a ferris wheel with sea creatures, and a water park with wave pools and water slides. Visitors could also enjoy interactive experiences, like a SpongeBob-themed obstacle course and a \"Patrick's Rockin' Kitchen\" cooking demonstration.",
    "Sponge-based water filtration system: Design a water filtration system that utilizes sponges as the primary filtration medium. The system would work by passing water through a series of sponges with different pore sizes, allowing the smaller particles to pass through while capturing the larger debris. This system could be used in communities without access to clean drinking water, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution for water purification.",
    "Sponge-powered underwater glider: Create an underwater glider that uses sponges as the primary source of lift. The glider would be designed with a series of sponges attached to a flexible frame, which would expand and contract as the glider moves through the water. The sponges would create a cushioning effect, allowing the glider to move smoothly and efficiently through the water without generating a lot of turbulence. This glider could be used for underwater exploration, marine research, and even search and rescue missions.",
    "Sponge-based art exhibit: Curate an art exhibit featuring works of art created using sponges as the primary medium. Artists could create sculptures, paintings, and installations using a variety of techniques, such as carving, painting, and collaging. The exhibit could also include interactive elements, such as a \"touch tank\" where visitors could handle and explore sponge-based art. This exhibit would showcase the versatility and creativity of sponges as an art medium, while also highlighting their unique properties and textures.",
