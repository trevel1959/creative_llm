    "\"Sunflower Selfie Station\": Create a sunflower-shaped photo booth in a public park or a popular tourist spot. Visitors can take pictures with the sunflower backdrop, and the twist is that the sunflower's petals will be made of soft, colorful fabric that can be adjusted to different angles and colors, allowing users to create unique and playful photos. The station can also be equipped with fun props like oversized sunglasses, hats, and flowers to add to the experience.",
    "\"Sunflower Scented Sounds\": Develop an interactive installation that combines the scent of sunflowers with music and sound effects. The installation can be set up in a public space, and visitors can walk through a sunflower-scented \"tunnel\" that triggers a soundscape of buzzing bees, chirping birds, and gentle wind chimes, creating a multisensory experience that evokes the feeling of being in a sunflower field.",
    "\"Sunflower Street Art\": Collaborate with local street artists to create a series of sunflower-inspired murals in different neighborhoods. Each mural can have a unique design and message, and the community can participate by adding their own sunflower-themed artwork to the mural, creating a dynamic and ever-changing public art installation.",
    "\"Sunflower Sensory Garden\": Design an immersive sensory garden that recreates the experience of walking through a sunflower field. The garden can feature sunflower-shaped planters, scented herbs, and a variety of textures like soft petals, rough bark, and smooth stones. Visitors can explore the garden using their senses, discovering hidden details and surprises along the way.",
    "\"Sunflower Storytelling\": Develop a digital platform where people can share their personal stories and memories associated with sunflowers. The platform can be a website or a mobile app that allows users to upload photos, write stories, and record audio clips. The platform can also feature a \"story of the day\" section, where a randomly selected story is shared with the community, creating a sense of connection and community among users."
