    "**Vase as a Plant Stand**: You can use an ordinary vase as a unique plant stand by placing it upside down. This method is particularly effective for plants that require more space at their base, such as fiddle leaf figs or palm trees. The inverted vase can be secured to the floor or wall for stability, and then the plant pot is placed inside, allowing for creative plant arrangement and showcasing of the vase's design.",
    "**Vase as a Decorative Wall Mount**: Turn your vase into a functional piece of art by mounting it on the wall. Use a sturdy, decorative hanger or frame the vase in a shadow box for added depth and texture. This idea is perfect for small spaces where you want to add a touch of color and interest without taking up floor space.",
