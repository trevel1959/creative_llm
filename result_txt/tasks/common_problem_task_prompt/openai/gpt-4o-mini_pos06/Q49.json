    "**Market Acceptance**: Even if a technology is innovative, there may be resistance from potential users or industries. This could stem from a lack of understanding of the technology's benefits, fear of change, or simply a preference for established solutions. Conducting market research and user education campaigns will be essential to address these concerns and foster acceptance.",
    "**Intellectual Property Issues**: With groundbreaking technologies, there is often a risk of intellectual property disputes. Competitors may claim that the technology infringes on their patents, leading to legal battles that can drain resources and delay development. Establishing a robust patent strategy and conducting thorough prior art searches can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Developing a game-changing technology typically requires significant investment. Securing funding can be a challenge, especially if investors are skeptical about the technology's potential. Additionally, managing resources effectively is crucial, as misallocation can lead to project delays or even failure. A detailed business plan that outlines projected costs and potential returns can help attract investors.",
    "**Scalability Issues**: Once a technology is developed, scaling it for mass production or widespread adoption can pose significant challenges. This includes ensuring that the production process can meet demand without compromising quality. Additionally, scaling may require additional partnerships or infrastructure, which can complicate logistics and increase costs.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: New technologies often face regulatory scrutiny, especially in industries like healthcare, finance, or transportation. Navigating the regulatory landscape can be time-consuming and may require modifications to the technology to ensure compliance. Engaging with regulatory bodies early in the development process can help streamline this aspect."
