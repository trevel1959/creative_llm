    "Flying Transportation System: With human wings, people could use them as a mode of transportation. This would be an eco-friendly alternative to cars and airplanes, reducing carbon emissions. The system could be designed in such a way that people can fly short distances without any assistance, while longer distances could be covered by flying taxis or shuttles.",
    "Human-Winged Sports: New sports could be developed using human wings. For example, there could be a sport where people have to fly through hoops or rings, similar to trampolining. Another possibility is a game where players have to catch balls thrown from high up in the air.",
    "Wingsuit Flying: Human wingsuits could be used for extreme sports like skydiving and bungee jumping. The suit would allow people to glide through the air, making it possible to land safely on the ground or even soar over mountains.",
    "Winged Farming: Farmers could use human wings to plant crops and harvest them more efficiently. They could also use their wings to inspect crops and detect any issues before they become serious problems.",
    "Emergency Response: In case of natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes, people with wings could be used for rescue operations. They could fly over disaster zones and assess the damage, then drop supplies or evacuate people to safety. Additionally, they could help search for survivors in areas that are difficult to reach by traditional means."
