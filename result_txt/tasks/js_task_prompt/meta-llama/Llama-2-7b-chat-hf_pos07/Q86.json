    "Floating City in the Sky: Create a futuristic, self-sustaining city that hovers high above the clouds, powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectricity. The city would be designed to maximize space and minimize environmental impact, with towering skyscrapers, gardens, and parks, and a unique transportation system that utilizes maglev trains and elevated walkways. The city would be a hub for innovation, culture, and sustainability, attracting visitors from around the world.",
    "The Great Barrier Reef Restoration: Create a massive, artificial coral reef system that spans across the globe, restoring the damaged and degraded natural reefs. The artificial reef would be designed to mimic the natural reef's structure and ecosystem, providing a habitat for countless marine species, and serving as a shield against the impacts of climate change. The reef would be powered by a network of underwater turbines, generating electricity through ocean currents, and would feature underwater museums, restaurants, and research centers.",
    "The Cloud Kingdom: Create a floating kingdom in the clouds, inspired by the majesty of the sky and the wonders of the heavens. The kingdom would be built on a series of interconnected platforms, suspended high above the ground, and would feature grand palaces, gardens, and marketplaces.
