Each player must perform specific swimming routines and movements that correspond to their piece's abilities while trying to outmaneuver the opposing team. The goal is to \"capture\" the opponent's king piece by performing a synchronized routine that mirrors a chess move.",
    "**Gravity Dash**: Set in a futuristic arena, players wear special suits that allow them to manipulate gravity for short bursts. The objective is to race through a maze filled with obstacles, using gravity shifts to jump over barriers, slide under traps, and run on walls. The first player to reach the finish line wins, but players can also use gravity shifts to impede their opponents, adding a tactical element to the race.",
    "**Eco-Ball**: A team sport played on a large field divided into sections, each representing different ecosystems (forest, desert, ocean, etc.). Players must work together to \"restore\" their ecosystem by collecting biodegradable balls scattered throughout the field and depositing them in designated areas. Each section has unique challenges, like climbing trees in the forest or navigating sand traps in the desert, promoting teamwork and environmental awareness.",
    "**Robo-Relay**: In this high-tech relay race, teams build and program their own robots to complete a series of challenges, such as obstacle courses, puzzles, and precision tasks. Each robot must complete its section of the race before the next team member can take over, blending engineering skills with athletic competition. Spectators can cheer for their favorite teams as they watch the robots race and strategize in real-time.",
    "**Glow Tag**: Played in a darkened arena illuminated by neon lights, players wear light-up vests and use glow-in-the-dark foam noodles to tag opponents.
