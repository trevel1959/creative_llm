    "**Bicycle Repair and Upcycling Workshop:** Establish a community-focused workshop where participants can learn to repair their bicycles or upcycle old bikes into new creations.

The workshop could also offer workshops on basic bike mechanics, safety tips, and creative customization techniques. By fostering a sense of community and empowerment, this project would help people feel more confident in their ability to work with bicycles."
