    "\"Energy-Crystal\" - This new type of energy would be generated by harvesting and converting the energy of crystals. The process would involve placing the crystals in a special device that extracts the energy from them through a process of resonance and amplification. The energy generated would be a clean and sustainable source that could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, businesses, and vehicles.",
    "\"Energy-Ball\" - This new type of energy would be generated by creating a small, spherical ball that contains a combination of fuel and catalysts. The ball would be heated to a high temperature, causing the fuel to break down and release energy in the form of heat. The heat would then be used to generate electricity, which could be used for a variety of applications.",
    "\"Energy-Wave\" - This new type of energy would be generated by creating a series of waves that travel through a medium, such as air or water. The waves would be generated by a device that uses electromagnetic fields to create the waves. The energy generated would be a clean and sustainable source that could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, businesses, and vehicles.",
    "\"Energy-Gas\" - This new type of energy would be generated by converting biomass, such as wood or agricultural waste, into a clean-burning gas. The process would involve breaking down the biomass into its component parts, such as carbohydrates and proteins, and then using a catalyst to convert these into a gas. The gas would be a clean and sustainable source that could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, businesses, and vehicles.",
    "\"Energy-B\" - This new type of energy would be generated by converting waste heat into electricity. The process would involve using a device that uses a special material, such as a thermoelectric, to convert the waste heat into electricity. The electricity generated would be a clean and sustainable source that could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, businesses, and vehicles."
