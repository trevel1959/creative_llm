    "**Interactive QR Code Tag**:    Create a luggage tag with a scannable QR code that links to a personalized webpage for the traveler. This page could include important travel information, emergency contacts, and even a short bio about the traveler. In case of lost luggage, anyone who finds it can scan the code and easily contact the owner, enhancing the chances of a quick reunion.",
    "**Color-Coded Travel System**:    Design a set of luggage tags that come in various colors and patterns, allowing travelers to categorize their bags based on trips or destinations. For instance, red could represent business trips, blue for vacations, and green for family outings. This visual system would make it easier for travelers to identify their bags on the carousel quickly and avoid mix-ups.",
    "**Weather-Resistant and Durable Materials**:    Improve the materials used for luggage tags by incorporating weather-resistant and tear-proof materials. This would ensure that tags remain intact and legible even after exposure to rain, snow, or rough handling. Additionally, using eco-friendly materials could appeal to environmentally conscious travelers.",
    "**Personalized Digital Display**:    Develop a luggage tag with a small digital display that can be customized via an app. Travelers could input their name, contact information, and a fun message or travel quote that can be updated for each trip. This would add a personal touch and make the luggage stand out while providing essential information.",
    "**Built-in Anti-Theft Features**:    Introduce a luggage tag with a built-in locking mechanism that secures the tag to the luggage. This could involve a combination of a unique key or code that only the owner knows. Additionally, the tag could feature an alarm that triggers if someone tries to remove it without the correct code, adding an extra layer of security."
