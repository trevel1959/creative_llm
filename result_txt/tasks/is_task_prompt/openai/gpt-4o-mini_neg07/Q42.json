    "In a sleepy village where the sun rose and set like clockwork, the townsfolk began to notice something peculiar: the sun had started to snore. Each dawn, its gentle rumble vibrated through the air, causing the leaves to dance and the rivers to ripple. Children giggled, while the elders complained about the disruption. One day, a curious girl named Lila climbed the tallest hill to investigate.

They tickle me!” From then on, Lila listened for the sun’s dreams every morning.",
