    "Solar-Powered Umbrellas: Design umbrellas with built-in solar panels that harness energy from the sun to power LED lights or even small electrical outlets. This would allow people to stay bright and connected even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Drones: Develop drones equipped with specialized seeding materials that can be deployed in the clouds to stimulate the growth of rainbow-colored crystals. These crystals could reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere, creating a natural and sustainable way to brighten up the sky.",
    "Sun-Harvesting Windows: Develop tinted glass windows that can absorb and store sunlight during the day, releasing it at night as soft, warm lighting. This would provide a natural and sustainable source of lighting for homes and buildings, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Based Data Centers: Build data centers located within the clouds, leveraging the natural cooling and humidity of the atmosphere to reduce energy consumption and costs. These data centers could also be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to create a truly sustainable infrastructure.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting Services: Offer lighting services that use cloud-based technology to project soft, diffused light onto buildings and public spaces. These services could be powered by renewable energy sources and could be programmed to change colors and patterns to match different moods, events, or seasons, creating a unique and dynamic lighting experience."
