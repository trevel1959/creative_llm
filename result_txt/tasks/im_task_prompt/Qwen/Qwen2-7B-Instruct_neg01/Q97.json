    "**Interactive Dog Leash**: This idea combines technology with traditional dog leashes. The leash would feature a Bluetooth connection that allows owners to track their pet's location in real-time on a smartphone app. It could also include an inbuilt GPS system for enhanced accuracy. The leash might have built-in LED lights for visibility during nighttime walks, ensuring both safety and fun.",
    "**Adjustable Scent-Repelling Leash**: A leash that can be sprayed with different scents, such as lemon or lavender, to help repel pests like ticks, fleas, or mosquitoes. This is particularly useful for pets who are sensitive to chemicals or for those living in areas with high pest populations. The scent is easily adjustable according to the needs of the pet and the environment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dog Leash Made from Recycled Materials**: This innovative leash is designed with sustainability in mind. It uses recycled materials such as plastic bottles, old tires, or discarded fishing nets. Not only does it reduce waste, but it also creates a unique product that is durable and strong. This could be marketed towards environmentally conscious pet owners.",
    "**Therapeutic Dog Leash**: A leash that incorporates gentle vibrations or micro-movements to soothe dogs during stressful situations, such as loud noises or unfamiliar environments. These vibrations can mimic the calming effect of a mother dogâ€™s touch, helping to ease anxiety and make walks more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner.",
    "**Smart Dog Leash with Voice Recognition Commands**: This leash would feature voice recognition technology that allows the user to issue commands to their dog without needing to physically interact with the leash. For example, \"Sit\" or \"Stay\" could be verbal commands that trigger the dog to perform specific actions. This not only makes training easier but also enhances the bond between the owner and their pet by offering new ways to communicate and interact."
