    "iBike: I would start by investing in a high-quality electric bike, which would allow me to travel long distances at a reasonable speed while also providing a healthy workout. I would also explore bike-sharing services in my area to further reduce costs and environmental impact.",
    "Hike: If all public transport stopped working, I would consider hiking as an alternative mode of transportation. This would be an opportunity to explore new areas and get some exercise while traveling. I would plan my route in advance and make sure to pack enough food and water for the journey.",
    "Ride-sharing: I would also explore ride-sharing options such as Uber or Lyft. While this may not be the most cost-effective option, it would allow me to travel long distances without having to worry about driving or navigating through traffic.",
    "Public transportation alternative: I would look for alternative forms of public transportation such as shuttle buses or taxis. These options may be less reliable than traditional buses or trains, but they could still be a viable option for long-distance travel.",
    "riuCarpooling: Finally, I would consider carpooling with friends or colleagues. This would allow me to split the cost of gas and maintenance while also reducing my carbon footprint. I would make sure to plan ahead and coordinate with others to ensure a smooth and efficient carpooling experience."
