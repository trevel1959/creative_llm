    "Use a Water Purification System: A water purification system can be used to filter out impurities from water sources that are contaminated. This system uses various techniques such as distillation, reverse osmosis, or activated carbon filtration to remove harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and chemicals from water. These systems can be portable and easy to use, making them ideal for individuals who live in areas with limited access to clean water.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Another option is to harvest rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces. Rainwater harvesting involves collecting rainwater in tanks or containers and storing it for later use. This method is cost-effective and sustainable, as it reduces the demand for freshwater from traditional sources.",
    "Desalination of Seawater: If all water sources are polluted, desalination of seawater could be an alternative source of clean drinking water. Desalination involves removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe for human consumption. While desalination requires significant energy and resources, it has the potential to provide a reliable source of clean water in areas where freshwater is scarce.",
    "Use of Bacteria to Filter Water: Researchers have developed bacteria that can break down pollutants in water. These bacteria can be added to water sources to reduce levels of contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. The use of these bacteria has the potential to be a low-cost and sustainable solution for providing clean drinking water.",
    "Reuse of Wastewater: In some cases, wastewater can be treated and reused for various purposes, including drinking water. Treatment processes such as biological treatment, chemical precipitation, and disinfection can be used to remove contaminants from wastewater and make it safe for human consumption. However, it's important to note that the reuse of wastewater may not be suitable for all applications, and careful monitoring and testing are necessary to ensure its safety."
