    "**Solar-Powered Fiber Optic Lighting**: Harness the power of solar energy to create a network of thin, fiber-optic cables that can be stretched across the room. These cables can be coated with a special material that absorbs sunlight during the day and releases it as a soft, ethereal glow at night. This would not only provide a unique and futuristic lighting solution but also serve as a reminder of the importance of renewable energy.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Wall**: Create a living wall of bioluminescent plants that absorb light during the day and emit a soft, blue-green glow at night. This would not only provide a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution but also purify the air and create a calming atmosphere. The bioluminescent plants could be genetically engineered to thrive in a variety of environments, making this solution accessible to people worldwide.",
    "**LED-Embedded Concrete**: Develop a new type of concrete that incorporates LED lights throughout its structure. This would allow for a seamless integration of lighting into the building's design, creating a unique and futuristic aesthetic. The LED lights could be powered by a combination of solar energy and kinetic energy generated by the building's occupants.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Create a special type of paint that absorbs light during the day and releases it as a soft glow at night. This paint could be used to create a variety of lighting effects, from subtle ambient lighting to bold, statement-making designs. The paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or even furniture, providing a flexible and versatile lighting solution.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses kinetic energy generated by the building's occupants to power a network of LED lights. This could be achieved through a variety of means, such as piezoelectric sensors that capture the vibrations of footsteps or a system of generators that convert the energy of moving furniture into electricity. This solution would not only provide a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution but also encourage people to be more mindful of their movement and energy consumption. [/INST] "
