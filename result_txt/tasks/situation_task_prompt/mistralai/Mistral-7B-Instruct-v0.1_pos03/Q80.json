    "Bartering: In the absence of paper money and coins, people would have to resort to bartering. This means exchanging goods or services directly with each other. For example, a farmer could trade a basket of fruits with a baker in exchange for a loaf of bread.",
    "Digital Currencies: People could also use digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to pay for things. These currencies are stored in digital wallets and can be used to make online purchases.",
    "Gift Cards: Gift cards could also be used as a form of payment. They could be used to purchase goods and services from specific retailers or service providers.",
    "Credit Cards: Credit cards could still be used as a form of payment, but they would need to be linked to a digital wallet or bank account. This would allow people to make purchases without having to physically carry cash or coins.",
    "Prepaid Cards: Prepaid cards could also be used as a form of payment. These cards can be loaded with a specific amount of money and used to make purchases until the balance runs out."
