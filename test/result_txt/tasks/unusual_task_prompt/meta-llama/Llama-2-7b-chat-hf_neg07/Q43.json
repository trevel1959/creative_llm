    "Bicycle-powered electricity generation: Create a bicycle that generates electricity as the rider pedals. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as using a dynamo or a turbine to convert the kinetic energy of the pedaling into electrical energy. This can be used to power small devices, such as lights, phones, or even entire homes in remote areas where access to traditional electricity is limited.",
    "Smart bicycle helmet: Design a bicycle helmet with built-in sensors and a display screen that provides real-time data to the rider. This can include information such as speed, distance traveled, and even the rider's heart rate. The helmet can also be connected to a smartphone app that allows the rider to track their progress and set goals for their rides.",
    "Bicycle-sharing platform: Create a platform that allows people to rent bicycles from multiple locations around a city or town. This can be done through a mobile app that allows users to search for available bicycles, reserve one, and unlock it using a digital key. The platform can also include features such as GPS tracking, insurance, and maintenance services.",
    "Bicycle-powered water purification: Design a bicycle that can be used to purify water in remote areas where access to clean water is limited. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as using a UV light or a ceramic filter to remove impurities from the water. The bicycle can be powered by the rider's pedaling, making it a sustainable and efficient way to provide clean water to those in need.",
    "Bicycle-based transportation system: Create a system that uses bicycles as a primary mode of transportation in a city or town. This can include dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing stations, and even autonomous bicycles that can be summoned using a mobile app. The system can be designed to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, while also providing a convenient and affordable way for people to get around."
