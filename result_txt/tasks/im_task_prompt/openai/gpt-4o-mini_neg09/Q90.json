    "**Interactive Learning Mode**: Introduce an interactive learning mode where the guitar assistant plays along with the user. It could analyze the user's playing and adjust its tempo and complexity to match their skill level. This mode could include a variety of genres and styles, allowing users to learn new songs while receiving immediate feedback on timing, rhythm, and technique.",
    "**Visual Feedback System**: Incorporate a visual feedback system that uses LED lights or a projection system to show finger placements on the fretboard for chords and scales. This could be particularly useful for beginners who struggle with finger positioning. The assistant could light up the appropriate strings and frets, guiding users through exercises or songs step-by-step.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Create an AR feature that overlays chord diagrams, scales, and song tabs onto the real world through a smartphone or AR glasses. This would allow users to see exactly where to place their fingers in real-time as they play along with their favorite songs. The assistant could also provide visual cues for transitions between chords, making learning more intuitive.",
    "**Song Composition Assistant**: Develop a songwriting tool within the guitar assistant that helps users create their own music. This could include features like chord progression suggestions, melody generation based on user input, and the ability to record and layer tracks. Users could experiment with different styles and genres, receiving tips on structure and arrangement to enhance their compositions.",
    "**Social Collaboration Platform**: Build a social platform within the guitar assistant that connects users with other guitarists for collaboration and feedback. This could include features like virtual jam sessions, where users can play together in real-time, or forums for sharing recordings and receiving constructive criticism. Users could also find potential bandmates or teachers based on their musical interests and skill levels."
