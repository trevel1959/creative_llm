    "Limited access to films: Another potential problem is the limited access to films. This can make it difficult to find enough films to fill the festival's schedule, or to ensure that the films being shown are diverse and representative of different genres and perspectives. To address this issue, organizers may need to reach out to filmmakers directly, or consider partnering with other film festivals or organizations to access a wider range of films.",
    "Competition for talent: Organizers may also face competition for talent, such as directors, actors, and other industry professionals. This can make it difficult to secure the talent needed to make the festival a success. To address this issue, organizers may need to offer competitive compensation or other incentives to attract top talent.",
    "Limited marketing and promotion: Another potential problem is the limited marketing and promotion of the festival. This can make it difficult to attract an audience and generate interest in the event. To address this issue, organizers may need to consider alternative marketing and promotion strategies, such as social media campaigns or partnerships with local businesses and organizations.",
    "Technical issues: Technical issues, such as equipment failure or poor sound quality, can also pose a problem during the festival. To address this issue, organizers may need to invest in high-quality equipment and have a backup plan in place in case of technical issues.",
    "Limited seating capacity: Another potential problem is the limited seating capacity of the venues being used for the festival. This can make it difficult to accommodate a large audience and ensure that everyone has a seat. To address this issue, organizers may need to consider alternative venues or use a combination of venues to accommodate a larger audience."
