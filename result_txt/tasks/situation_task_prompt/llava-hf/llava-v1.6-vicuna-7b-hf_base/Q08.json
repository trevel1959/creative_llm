    "Water filtration systems: Installing water filtration systems near the polluted water source can remove impurities and sediments, making the water safe for drinking.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces can provide a clean and renewable source of drinking water.",
    "Reverse osmosis: Reverse osmosis is a process that removes dissolved solids from water by pushing it through a semipermeable membrane. This can be used to filter polluted water and produce clean drinking water.",
    "Distillation: Distillation is a process that involves heating water to produce steam, which is then condensed back into liquid form. This can remove impurities and produce clean drinking water.",
    "Aquifer replenishment: Replenishing an underground aquifer with clean water can provide a long-term source of drinking water. This can be done through artificial recharge or natural replenishment."
