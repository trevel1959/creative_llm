    "**Insect Farming and Biocontrol**: Establish a large-scale insect farm to produce beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on common pests. These beneficial insects would be released in controlled environments to maintain a balance between pest populations and ecosystems. This approach would not only reduce the need for pesticides but also create a new industry for sustainable pest management.",
    "**Biodegradable Pest Control Materials**: Develop biodegradable materials that mimic the properties of natural insecticides, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, but with improved safety profiles and reduced environmental impact. These materials could be used in agriculture, homes, and public spaces to control pest populations while minimizing harm to humans and the environment.",
    "**Artificial Intelligence-Powered Pest Detection and Control**: Design an AI-powered system that uses computer vision, machine learning, and sensor data to detect and track pest populations in real-time. This system would enable targeted and efficient pest control measures, reducing the need for broad-spectrum pesticides and minimizing environmental harm.",
    "**Microbial Pest Control**: Engineer microorganisms that produce compounds toxic to pests, such as bacteria that produce insecticidal proteins or fungi that produce mycotoxins. These microorganisms could be used to control pest populations in agricultural settings or as a biological control method for invasive species.",
    "**Urban Beekeeping and Pollinator Conservation**: Implement large-scale urban beekeeping programs to promote pollinator conservation and create a new source of sustainable pest control. Honeybees and other pollinators would be encouraged to thrive in urban environments, helping to pollinate crops and control pest populations through natural processes. This approach would also foster community engagement and education about the importance of pollinators.
