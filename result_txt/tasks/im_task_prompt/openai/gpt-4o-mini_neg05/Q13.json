    "**Gesture-Controlled Interface**: Develop a gesture recognition system that allows users to control their television without a remote. By using a camera embedded in the TV, viewers could wave their hands to change channels, adjust volume, or even scroll through menus. This would be especially useful in a home setting where remotes are often misplaced or for those with mobility challenges.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitor**: Create a television that includes health monitoring features. By utilizing built-in sensors, the TV could track heart rate, stress levels, and even posture while viewers are engaged in watching. It could then suggest breaks, stretches, or relaxation techniques during binge-watching sessions, promoting healthier viewing habits.",
    "**Customizable Screen Shape**: Design a television with a flexible screen that can change its shape based on the viewer's preference or room design. For instance, it could transform from a standard rectangle to a more immersive curved display for movie nights or even a square for video calls. This adaptability would allow the TV to fit seamlessly into various home aesthetics and viewing scenarios.",
    "**AI-Powered Content Curator**: Introduce an AI system that learns the viewer's preferences over time and curates personalized content recommendations. Beyond just suggesting shows and movies, this AI could create themed playlists for different moods or occasions, such as \"Chill Sunday\" or \"Action-Packed Friday,\" making it easier for users to find content that suits their current vibe.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) features that allow viewers to engage with content in a new way. For example, during sports events, viewers could see player statistics or replays overlaid on the screen. In educational programs, additional information or 3D models could pop up, providing a more interactive learning experience."
