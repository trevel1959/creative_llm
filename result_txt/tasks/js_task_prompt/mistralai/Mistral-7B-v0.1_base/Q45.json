Create a device that creates an electromagnetic field similar to that of gravity in weightlessness but without using any energy. 6) Create a device that creates artificial gravity by accelerating itself (for example using jet fuel). 7) Place a large ball on top of another larger ball and have it fall down until it hits the ground with great force.",
    "If you are orbiting Mars at 10 km/s your shuttle would have to work continuously for 24 hours before landing on the surface. 5) If your orbiting at 10 kilometers per second, your spacecraft will have time enough for an engine burn lasting no longer than 15 minutes to achieve an altitude of 118 kilometers prior to entering Mars’ atmosphere. 6) Your shuttle would need an engine capable of accelerating from 10 km/s to 15 km/s in order to achieve a touchdown on Martian soil. 7) If youre orbiting at 10 km/s and want your spacecraft to land on Mars then it will take 30 minutes for the engines to stop working."
