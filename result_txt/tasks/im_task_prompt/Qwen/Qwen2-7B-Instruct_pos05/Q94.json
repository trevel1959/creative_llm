    "**Candle Art Workshop:** You can organize a candle-making workshop where participants learn to create their own unique candles. They can choose from various types of wax, fragrances, and decorative elements like dried flowers or seashells. This not only allows for customization but also offers a creative outlet for people who enjoy crafting.",
    "**Scented Candle Subscription Service:** Create a subscription service that delivers monthly scented candles tailored to each customer's preferences. These could range from floral scents for relaxation to energizing citrus blends for productivity. Each candle could come with a story or inspiration behind its scent, enhancing the overall experience.",
    "**Candle-Themed Restaurant:** Develop a restaurant concept where every aspect—from the decor to the menu—revolves around the theme of candles. The menu could feature dishes inspired by different scents, such as a lavender-infused dessert or a rosemary roasted chicken. The ambiance would include flickering candles, ambient music, and possibly live performances that complement the candle theme.",
    "**Interactive Scent Experience App:** Create an app that allows users to virtually explore a world of scents through their smartphones. Users can \"travel\" to different locations, experiencing the scents associated with those places (like a lavender field in Provence or a spicy market in Marrakech). The app could incorporate augmented reality features, allowing users to \"smell\" virtual objects or spaces through their phone's camera.",
    "**Candle-Inspired Home Fragrance Line:** Extend the candle idea beyond traditional wax candles into other home fragrance products, such as room sprays, incense, reed diffusers, and even essential oil blends. This line could focus on specific themes, like \"cozy winter nights,\" \"summer beach vibes,\" or \"energetic morning routines.\" Each product would be designed to complement the others in the line, creating a cohesive sensory experience throughout the home."
