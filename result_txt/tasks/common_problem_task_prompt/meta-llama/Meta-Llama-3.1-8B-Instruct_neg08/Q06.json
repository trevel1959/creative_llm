I've created a system where I prioritize tasks based on the Martian day-night cycle, focusing on the most critical tasks during the day and the less pressing ones at night. This approach allows me to work efficiently, even in the harsh Martian environment. However, it also means I have to be extremely disciplined and adapt to the planet's 24.6-hour day-night cycle.
