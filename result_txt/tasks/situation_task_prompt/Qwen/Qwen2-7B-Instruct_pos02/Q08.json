    "**Rainwater Collection System:** One creative solution could be setting up a rainwater collection system in areas where it rains regularly. Rainwater is usually pure and can be collected in tanks or barrels, then filtered through sand or other natural materials to remove impurities before being stored for consumption.",
    "**Water Purification Plants on Wheels:** Designing mobile water purification plants that can travel to different locations affected by pollution. These plants could use advanced technologies like reverse osmosis, ultraviolet light, or electrochemical processes to purify water on-site, providing clean drinking water directly to the community.",
    "**Nano-filtration Water Filters:** Innovating a type of water filter that uses nanotechnology. Nano-filtration filters can remove bacteria, viruses, and even some contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption. The filters could be portable and easily installed in households or communities lacking access to clean water.",
    "**Aquaponics and Water Recycling:** Combining aquaponics systems (where fish farming and plant cultivation are integrated) with water recycling techniques. In this setup, fish waste provides nutrients for plants, which in turn clean the water, creating a self-sustaining cycle of clean water production. This method could be particularly effective in urban areas with limited space.",
    "**Algae Bioreactors:** Developing bioreactors that use algae to purify water. Algae can efficiently remove pollutants such as heavy metals, nitrates, and phosphates from water. These bioreactors could be constructed in large tanks or even floating platforms in bodies of water, continuously cleaning and recycling water resources."
