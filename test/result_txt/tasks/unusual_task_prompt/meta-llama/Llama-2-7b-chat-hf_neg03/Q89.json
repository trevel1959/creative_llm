    "Smart Coffee Grinder: Create a coffee grinder that can connect to a smartphone app to allow users to control the grind size and speed remotely. This would be ideal for those who are always on-the-go and want to ensure their coffee is perfectly ground for their preferred brewing method.",
    "Automatic Coffee Grinder: Design a coffee grinder that can automatically detect the type of coffee beans and adjust the grind size and speed accordingly. This would eliminate the need for users to manually select the grind size, making the process faster and more convenient.",
    "Coffee Grinder with Built-in Cooling System: Develop a coffee grinder that has a built-in cooling system to keep the grinds cool and fresh. This would be particularly useful for those who grind their own coffee beans at home, as it would prevent the grinds from overheating and losing their flavor.",

    "Interactive Coffee Grinder: Design a coffee grinder that allows users to interact with it through voice commands or gestures. This could include setting the grind size, selecting the grind type, or even choosing the music to play while the grinder is in use. This would add an extra layer of convenience and fun to the coffee-grinding process."
