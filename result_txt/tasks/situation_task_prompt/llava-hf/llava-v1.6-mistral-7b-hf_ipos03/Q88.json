    "Underground Tunnels: If roads are impassable, one alternative could be to build extensive underground tunnel networks. These tunnels would allow for the safe and efficient transportation of people and goods, without being affected by the surface conditions.",
    "Flying Vehicles: The development of flying vehicles, such as drones or flying cars, could provide an alternative mode of transportation. These vehicles could navigate through the air, avoiding the obstacles on the ground, and provide a quick and efficient means of travel.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Trains: Another option could be the use of magnetic levitation trains. These trains would hover above the ground, using magnetic forces to propel them forward. They would be capable of traveling at high speeds and could be a reliable and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Hyperloop Transportation: Hyperloop transportation is a high-speed transportation system that uses a vacuum tube to transport passengers and cargo. This technology could be utilized in a world where roads are impassable, providing a fast and efficient means of travel over long distances.",
    "Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) Systems: PRT systems consist of a network of automated vehicles that can transport passengers on-demand. These vehicles would be able to navigate through a variety of terrains, including roads, tunnels, and even waterways."
