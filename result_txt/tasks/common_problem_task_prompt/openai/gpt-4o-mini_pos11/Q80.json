    "**Invitations and Stationery**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples may face difficulties in finding eco-friendly alternatives that still convey the desired aesthetic. One creative solution is to use digital invitations or plantable paper that guests can later grow into flowers or herbs. This not only reduces paper waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding.",
    "**Catering and Food Waste**: Selecting a caterer who uses local, organic ingredients can be difficult, and there may be concerns about food waste if the guest count fluctuates. To address this, couples can consider a buffet-style meal with smaller portion sizes, allowing guests to take what they can eat. Additionally, any leftover food can be donated to local shelters or composted to minimize waste.",
    "**Attire and Accessories**: The wedding dress and bridal party attire often contribute to the fast fashion industry, leading to environmental degradation. Couples might struggle to find sustainable options. One innovative idea is to rent wedding attire or source second-hand dresses, which not only reduces waste but also allows for unique, vintage styles. Incorporating accessories made from recycled materials can further enhance the eco-friendly theme.",
    "**Transportation**: Guests traveling from various locations can lead to a significant carbon footprint. Coordinating transportation options can be a logistical challenge. To mitigate this, couples can arrange group transportation using electric or hybrid vehicles, or encourage carpooling among guests. Additionally, selecting a venue that is accessible via public transportation can reduce the need for individual car travel.",
    "**Decor and Flowers**: Traditional floral arrangements often involve flowers that are imported from far away, contributing to carbon emissions. Finding local, seasonal flowers can be a challenge, and using artificial flowers may not align with the couple's vision. A creative approach is to use potted plants that guests can take home as favors, or to incorporate native flowers that are sourced locally. Couples can also explore dried flower arrangements that last longer and reduce waste."
