    "Upholstered Headrests: One creative solution would be to use upholstered headrests instead of pillows. These headrests could be attached to a bed frame or a chair, providing a soft and cushioned surface for resting one's head. They could be designed with different fabrics and colors to match the bedroom decor, and even include adjustable heights and angles for optimal comfort.",
    "Memory Foam Molds: Another idea would be to create custom-fit memory foam molds for each person's head. These molds could be filled with a supportive foam material that conformed to the shape of the head, providing a snug and comfortable fit. The molds could be made from a soft, breathable material like silicone or foam, and could be easily cleaned and reused.",
    "Cushion Collars: A cushion collar is a creative solution that could be worn around the base of the head to provide support and comfort. These collars could be made from a soft, padded material like cotton or fleece, and could be adjusted to fit different head sizes. They could also include features like breathable mesh panels for ventilation and built-in speakers for listening to music or white noise.",
    "Air-filled Inflatable Pillows: Another option would be to create inflatable pillows that could be inflated to different firmness levels for optimal comfort. These pillows could be made from a durable, puncture-resistant material like vinyl or rubber, and could be equipped with built-in air pumps for easy inflation. They could also include features like built-in speakers or LED lights for a more immersive sleeping experience.",
    "Holographic Pillows: For a truly futuristic solution, one could design holographic pillows that project a three-dimensional image of a pillow onto the bed. These holographic pillows could be powered by a small, discreet projector that could be placed under the bed or on a nightstand. They would provide a soothing, calming visual effect, and could even include features like temperature control or aromatherapy for a more immersive sleeping experience."
