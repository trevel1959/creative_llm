    "**Smart Keychain with Built-in Emergency Kit**: Design a smart keychain that doubles as an emergency kit. The keychain would have a compact, water-resistant container with essentials like a flashlight, whistle, first-aid kit, and a small multi-tool. It could also include a GPS tracker, a portable charger, and a small LED light. The keychain would be connected to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing them to receive notifications and alerts in case of an emergency. The device could also include a panic button that sends a distress signal to emergency services or designated contacts.",
    "**Biometric Keyless Entry**: Develop a biometric keyless entry system that uses advanced fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, or vein recognition technology to unlock vehicles. This system would eliminate the need for physical keys, providing a convenient and secure way to access vehicles. The biometric data would be stored securely on a dedicated chip, and users would be able to manage access permissions and share keys with others through a companion app.",
    "**Keyless Vehicle Starter with Integrated Power Bank**: Design a keyless vehicle starter that doubles as a portable power bank. The device would use wireless charging technology to charge the vehicle's battery, eliminating the need for a traditional key. The power bank would also have a high-capacity battery that can charge smartphones, tablets, or other devices on the go. The device could include a companion app that allows users to monitor their vehicle's status, track battery levels, and receive notifications when the vehicle is ready to start.",
    "**Smart Key with Integrated Safety Features**: Develop a smart key that includes integrated safety features like automatic emergency calling, roadside assistance, and vehicle tracking. The key would use cellular connectivity to send distress signals to emergency services or designated contacts in case of an accident. It could also include features like vehicle theft protection, which would alert authorities and the vehicle's owner in case of unauthorized access.",
    "**Augmented Reality Keyless Entry**: Create an augmented reality (AR) keyless entry system that uses a smartphone app to unlock vehicles. The app would use AR technology to superimpose a virtual key on the vehicle's door, allowing users to unlock and start the vehicle without a physical key. The system would include advanced security features like facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, or voice recognition to ensure secure access. The AR interface could also provide users with information about the vehicle's status, maintenance schedules, and other relevant data.
