    "**Budget Overruns**: Blockbuster movies often come with hefty budgets, and managing finances can be a significant issue. Unexpected expenses, such as special effects that require additional resources or delays that increase labor costs, can lead to budget overruns. To address this, a director should work closely with the production team to create a detailed budget plan and maintain regular check-ins to track expenses and make adjustments as necessary.",
    "**Creative Differences**: Directors often have a specific vision for their film, but they may face creative differences with producers, writers, or even the cast. These disagreements can lead to tension on set and impact the film's quality. To navigate this, a director could establish an open line of communication where all parties can express their ideas and concerns, fostering a collaborative environment that ultimately enhances the film.",
    "**Weather and Location Issues**: Outdoor shoots can be unpredictable, with weather changes affecting the schedule and the quality of shots. For example, a sudden rainstorm could ruin a carefully planned scene. To prepare for this, a director should have contingency plans, such as alternative indoor locations or the ability to quickly adapt the shooting schedule based on weather forecasts.",
    "**Time Constraints**: With tight shooting schedules, directors may feel pressured to complete scenes quickly, which can compromise the quality of the film. Rushed shoots can lead to mistakes, missed opportunities for great performances, or inadequate coverage of scenes. To combat this, a director could prioritize pre-production planning, allowing for thorough rehearsals and discussions to ensure that everyone is well-prepared before filming begins.",
    "**Audience Expectations**: Blockbuster films often come with high expectations from fans and critics alike. A director may struggle with balancing their creative vision while also catering to what audiences want. This can create a dilemma between artistic integrity and commercial viability. To tackle this issue, a director could conduct audience testing with early screenings or focus groups to gauge reactions and adjust elements of the film without losing their original vision."
