    "**Personalized Recipe Cards**: Instead of traditional recipe cards, use luggage tags to write down your favorite recipes. The durable material is perfect for kitchen use, and you can hang them on a hook or place them in a recipe box. This makes them easy to clean and more durable than paper cards.",
