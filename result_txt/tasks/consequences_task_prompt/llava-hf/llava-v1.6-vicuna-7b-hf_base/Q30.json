    "Hygiene and food safety would become even more important, as people would be less able to detect spoiled or contaminated food. This could lead to a greater focus on visual inspection and other non-sensory methods of ensuring food safety.",
    "The sense of smell is also important for many non-food-related activities, such as identifying potential hazards or detecting the presence of other people. A loss of smell could have significant implications for these activities as well.",
    "Finally, the loss of taste and smell could have broader implications for our emotional well-being, as these senses are closely linked to our memories and experiences. Without them, people may struggle to recall and appreciate the flavors and aromas of past events, leading to a decline in emotional well-being."
