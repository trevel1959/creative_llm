    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Function**: Create ski poles that can automatically adjust their length based on the skier's preference or terrain conditions. Using a simple button or app control, the poles could extend or retract to suit different skiing styles or snow conditions. Additionally, a memory function could save the preferred lengths for different users, making it easy for families or groups to share the poles.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Temperature Control**: Design ski poles with ergonomic grips that feature built-in temperature control. The grips could warm up on cold days to keep hands comfortable and improve grip, or cool down on warmer days to prevent overheating. This could be achieved through lightweight heating elements or cooling gels, ensuring optimal comfort for skiers in various weather conditions.",
    "**Built-in GPS and Navigation System**: Incorporate a GPS navigation system directly into the ski poles, allowing skiers to easily track their location, find trails, and share their location with friends. The poles could feature a small display or use haptic feedback to alert skiers of turns or hazards ahead, enhancing safety and ensuring they never get lost on the slopes.",
    "**Multi-Tool Functionality**: Create ski poles that serve multiple purposes, such as incorporating a small shovel for emergency situations, a bottle opener for apr√®s-ski, or even a small first-aid kit. This multifunctionality would reduce the amount of gear a skier needs to carry, making it more convenient and efficient on the slopes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Innovate ski poles using sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites. In addition to being environmentally friendly, the design could include a modular system where parts can be replaced or upgraded over time, reducing waste and encouraging longevity in ski pole use."
