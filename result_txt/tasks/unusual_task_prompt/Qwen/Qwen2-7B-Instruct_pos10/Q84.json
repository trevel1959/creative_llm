    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can with Composting Function**: This innovative trash can integrates a composting system into its design. It has separate compartments for organic waste (like food scraps) and non-organic waste. The organic waste is fed into an internal composting unit where microorganisms break down the waste into nutrient-rich soil. Users can then use this soil for gardening or plants, promoting sustainable living practices.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with AI Integration**: This trash can uses artificial intelligence to recognize and sort recyclables from regular waste. It has sensors that detect the type of item thrown in, categorizes it as recyclable or not, and either compacts the recyclables or sends them through a recycling channel. This reduces landfill usage and increases recycling rates.",
    "**Interactive Artistic Trash Can**: This trash can is designed as a piece of public art. It's equipped with interactive screens on the exterior that display art installations or educational content related to waste management and environmental conservation. It encourages community engagement and education, making waste disposal not just a mundane task but an experience.",
    "**Trash Can with Solar Power**: To reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint, this model comes with solar panels on its top surface. It can charge its own battery during daylight hours and use this stored energy to operate its features, such as lighting or ventilation. This reduces dependence on electricity and promotes sustainable practices.",
    "**Recyclable Trash Can with Customizable Design**: This trash can is made entirely from recycled materials, making it an eco-friendly product itself. However, its most unique feature is its modular design, allowing users to swap out different parts or add-ons based on their needs. This includes options for changing colors, adding decorative elements, or integrating additional functionalities like USB charging ports or small storage compartments. It caters to both aesthetic preferences and practical needs while being environmentally responsible."
