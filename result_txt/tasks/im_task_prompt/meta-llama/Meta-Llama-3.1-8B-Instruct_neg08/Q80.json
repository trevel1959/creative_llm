    "**Multi-Functional Whisk Head**: Create a whisk head with interchangeable attachments, allowing users to switch between different whisking tasks. For example, a soft-bristled attachment for delicate sauces, a stiff-bristled attachment for thick batters, and a wire mesh attachment for sifting dry ingredients.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Measuring Scale**: Integrate a compact measuring scale into the handle of the whisk, enabling users to accurately measure ingredients while whisking. This feature would be particularly useful for recipes that require precise measurements.",
    "**Whisk with Adjustable Whisking Speed**: Design a whisk with a variable speed mechanism, allowing users to adjust the whisking speed to suit different tasks. This feature would be beneficial for tasks that require a high-speed whisking motion, such as whipping cream or eggs.",
    "**Whisk with Integrated Timer**: Embed a timer into the handle of the whisk, providing users with a convenient way to track whisking time and avoid over-whisking. The timer could be set to a specific interval, such as 30 seconds or 1 minute, and would alert the user when the whisking time has elapsed.",
    "**Whisk with Non-Stick Coating**: Apply a non-stick coating to the whisk head, reducing the risk of ingredients sticking to the whisk and making cleaning easier. This feature would be particularly useful for tasks that involve sticky or messy ingredients, such as whisking honey or peanut butter."
