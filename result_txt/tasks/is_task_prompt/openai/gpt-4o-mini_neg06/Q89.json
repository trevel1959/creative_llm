The other dragons teased him, but Zilch discovered that his sneezes had a magical side effect: they could summon rainbows. One day, when a terrible drought struck the valley, Zilch sneezed a colossal sneeze, creating a rainbow that led the villagers to a hidden spring. From that day on, Zilch became the valley’s cherished guardian, proving that even the sneeziest of dragons could be a hero.",

The king, impressed, invited Sneezy to join the court as the official “Surprise Provider.” With each sneeze, Sneezy brought joy and laughter, turning his once embarrassing trait into a source of happiness.

    "Far away in a mystical forest, there lived a dragon named Zephyr who had an uncontrollable sneeze that echoed like thunder. His sneezes frightened the forest animals, causing them to scatter. Feeling lonely, Zephyr sought the help of a wise old owl. The owl advised him to embrace his sneezes and use them to create a wind that would help the forest flourish. With practice, Zephyr learned to control his sneezes, using them to spread seeds and plant trees. Soon, the forest bloomed, and the animals returned, grateful for the dragon who turned his sneezes into a gift of life.",
    "In the land of Misty Peaks, a dragon named Sneezy lived among clouds. Every time he sneezed, he accidentally created a storm! The villagers were terrified until one day, a brave knight approached him. “Let’s turn your sneezes into something wonderful!” he said. They devised a plan to channel Sneezy’s sneezes into creating rain for the parched lands below. Together, they danced in the clouds, and with each sneeze, the crops flourished. The villagers celebrated Sneezy as their rain-bringer, and he learned that his sneezes could be a blessing rather than a curse."
