    "**Underground Cities**: Another option would be to live in an underground city. These cities are already being constructed in places like China, where the government is building a massive underground city to house a million people. These cities would be built with advanced technology to provide all the necessary amenities and could potentially become the new home for many displaced by rising ocean levels.",
    "**Aquatic Habitats**: Another possibility is to live in an aquatic habitat, such as a floating city or a large ship. These habitats would be designed to withstand the ocean's challenges and could provide a unique living experience.",
    "**Desert Cities**: Desert cities like Dubai are already well-equipped to handle the challenges of a changing climate. These cities could potentially become more attractive as people look for safe places to live.",
    "**Territorial Migration**: If the ocean levels rise significantly, people may need to migrate to higher-altitude territories. This could lead to a new wave of migration to places like Tibet, the Andes, and the Himalayas.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Communities**: In a post-apocalyptic world, people may need to form self-sustaining communities. These communities would be designed to be self-sufficient and able to withstand the challenges of a changing climate."
