    "A Painting - I would bring a painting to life so that it could move and dance to the music playing in the room. It would be like having my own personal art exhibit.",
    "A Toy Car - I would bring a toy car to life so that it could take me on adventures around town. We could explore new places and have fun together.",
    "A Pen - I would bring a pen to life so that it could write down all of my creative ideas. I could brainstorm new projects and inventions with this helpful assistant.",
    "A Lamp - I would bring a lamp to life so that it could turn on and off whenever I need it. It would be like having my own personal light switch."
