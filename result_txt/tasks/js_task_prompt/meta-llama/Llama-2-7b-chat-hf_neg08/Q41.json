    "Implement a \"Mental Health Day\" every month: Everyone in the world would have to take a day off from work, school, and social media to focus on their mental well-being. This would encourage people to prioritize self-care, practice mindfulness, and engage in activities that bring them joy and relaxation. By doing so, individuals would be better equipped to handle the stresses of daily life and foster a culture of empathy and understanding towards mental health.",
    "Establish a \"Kindness Currency\": Introduce a virtual currency that can be used to reward people for acts of kindness, such as volunteering, donating to charity, or simply being kind to others. This would incentivize people to be more considerate and compassionate towards others, creating a more harmonious and caring society.",
    "Implement a \"No-Phone Zone\" in public places: In public areas like restaurants, parks, and transportation, designate certain areas as \"no-phone zones\". This would encourage people to disconnect from their devices and engage with the world around them, fostering meaningful connections and a greater appreciation for the present moment.",
    "Mandate \"Creativity Time\" in schools: Add a dedicated hour each week to school schedules for students to explore their creativity through art, music, writing, or any other form of expression they choose. This would help cultivate a culture of innovation and imagination, allowing individuals to develop their unique talents and perspectives, and contributing to a more vibrant and diverse society.",
    "Require \"Nature Therapy\" for mental health: Make it a requirement for mental health professionals to incorporate nature-based therapies into their treatment plans. This could include activities like forest bathing, beach walks, or simply spending time in nature. Studies have shown that nature has a profound impact on mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, and promoting overall well-being. By integrating nature into mental health treatments, individuals would be better equipped to manage their mental health and lead happier, healthier lives."
