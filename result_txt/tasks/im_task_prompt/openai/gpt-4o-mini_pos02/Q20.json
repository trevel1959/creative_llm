    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Add a detachable flavor infusion chamber to the coffee maker that allows users to experiment with various spices, herbs, or flavorings. This chamber could steep these ingredients into the water before it brews, enabling users to create unique coffee blends. Imagine a morning brew infused with cinnamon and vanilla or a post-dinner coffee with hints of peppermint.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge coffee oils and residue from internal components. Users could activate this feature via a smartphone app, ensuring their coffee maker remains hygienic without the need for manual scrubbing. The app could also remind users when itâ€™s time for a deep clean based on usage patterns.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Brew Cycle**: Design a brewing cycle that optimizes energy usage and minimizes waste. The coffee maker could have a mode that uses only the necessary amount of water and coffee grounds based on the desired cup size, reducing the carbon footprint. Additionally, it could incorporate a composting feature for used coffee grounds, allowing users to easily collect and recycle them.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Guide**: Create an interactive touchscreen interface that serves as a coffee guide. Users could explore different coffee beans, brewing techniques, and recipes through engaging visuals and tutorials. The interface could also allow users to rate their brews and save their favorite recipes, making the coffee-making experience more educational and enjoyable.",
    "**Coffee Pairing Recommendations**: Incorporate a feature that suggests food pairings based on the type of coffee being brewed. For example, if the user selects a rich espresso, the coffee maker could recommend chocolate croissants or biscotti. This could be achieved through a companion app that connects with the coffee maker, providing recipes and pairing ideas tailored to the selected brew."
