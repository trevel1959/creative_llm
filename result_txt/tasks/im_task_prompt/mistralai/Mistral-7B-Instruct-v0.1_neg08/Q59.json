    "\"I can understand why you might feel jealous when you hear about others finishing their tasks seamlessly. It's natural to feel that way. However, remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone seems to finish tasks quickly doesn't mean they don't struggle with other things. It's important to focus on your own progress and not compare yourself to others.\"",
    "\"Perhaps you could try using a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music or background noise while you work. This can help you focus and be more productive, just like others. Plus, you can customize your music or background noise to your liking, making it a personalized experience.\"",
    "\"Another idea is to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can help you feel less overwhelmed and more in control. You could also try using a timer to work on each task for a set amount of time, then take a short break before moving on to the next one. This can help you stay focused and motivated.\"",
    "\"If you're feeling jealous of others, it might be helpful to try to understand where they're coming from. Perhaps they've been working on their tasks for a longer time, or they have more experience in that area. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and that's what makes us all special.\"",
    "\"Finally, try not to focus too much on how others are doing. Instead, focus on your own progress and what you can accomplish. Remember that everyone has their own journey, and it's important to stay true to your own path. You could also try practicing gratitude and appreciation for the things you do well, rather than dwelling on what you don't do as well.\""
