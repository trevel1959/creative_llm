    "**Bioengineered Pollination Bacteria**: Create genetically modified bacteria that can produce and carry pollen-like particles. These bacteria could be released into the soil or air and would attach to plant surfaces, transferring genetic material from one plant to another. This method could also improve soil health and promote plant growth, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem.",
    "**Mechanical Pollination Brushes**: Design robotic arms or brushes that can mimic the action of pollinators. These devices could be deployed in greenhouses or agricultural fields, gently brushing against the anthers of plants to collect and distribute pollen. This method would require minimal energy and could be controlled remotely for precision.",
    "**Pollen-Infused Seed Bombs**: Create seed bombs that contain a mix of seeds and pollen from various plants. These bombs could be dispersed in areas where plants are struggling to reproduce. As the seeds germinate, they would be cross-pollinated by the pollen within the bomb, ensuring genetic diversity and stronger plant populations.",
    "**Pheromone-Activated Pollination Stations**: Set up stations that release synthetic pheromones mimicking those of natural pollinators. These stations would attract remaining pollinators (like beetles or moths) to specific areas where they could assist in pollination. The stations could also contain nutrient-rich substances to keep the pollinators engaged and encourage them to stay longer.",
    "**Animal-Assisted Pollination**: Train small animals, such as rodents or birds, to assist in pollination. By rewarding them with food, they could be conditioned to carry pollen from one plant to another. This method would require careful selection of animals and training programs, but it could create a new ecosystem of animal pollinators."
