    "Paintbrush Holder with Built-in Mixing Station - Design a paintbrush holder that also includes a built-in mixing station for paint and primer. This would eliminate the need for artists to constantly switch between brushes and mixing cups, saving time and reducing mess.",
    "Smart Paintbrush with Built-in Color Sensor - Develop a paintbrush with a built-in color sensor that can detect the color of the paint on the brush and provide real-time feedback on the color match. This would be especially useful for artists who work with multiple colors and need to ensure a perfect color match.",
    "Ergonomic Paintbrush Handle - Create an ergonomic paintbrush handle that fits comfortably in the hand and reduces fatigue during long painting sessions. This could be achieved through the use of contoured grips, cushioning, and varying handle shapes and sizes.",
    "Paintbrush with Built-in Ruler - Design a paintbrush with a built-in ruler that can be used to measure the size of the brush strokes. This would be helpful for artists who need to create precise and uniform brush strokes, such as in landscape or portrait painting.",
    "Interactive Paintbrush with Artificial Intelligence - Develop a paintbrush that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) to provide real-time feedback on brush stroke technique, color mixing, and composition. This would be a game-changer for artists who want to improve their skills and push the boundaries of their creativity."
