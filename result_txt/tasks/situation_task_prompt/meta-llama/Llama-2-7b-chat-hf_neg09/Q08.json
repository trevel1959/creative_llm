    "Build Underground Water Filtration Systems: Create an underground filtration system that extracts water from underground aquifers, which are less likely to be polluted. These aquifers can be accessed through wells or boreholes, and the water can be filtered through layers of gravel, sand, and activated carbon to remove impurities.",
    "Convert Sea Water into Drinking Water: Desalination plants can be built along coastlines to convert seawater into freshwater. Reverse osmosis is a common method used in desalination plants, where seawater is forced through a semi-permeable membrane, removing salt and other impurities.",
    "Create Floating Water Purification Systems: Develop floating water purification systems that can be placed on lakes, rivers, or oceans. These systems can use solar-powered technology to filter water using nanofiltration or ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and viruses.",
    "Use Algae-Based Water Filtration: Algae can be used to purify water through a process called algal turf scrubbing. This involves growing algae in a shallow pond, which can absorb pollutants from the water as it passes through. The clean water can then be collected and stored for drinking.",
    "Create Personal Water Filtration Devices: Develop portable, personal water filtration devices that can be used on a daily basis. These devices can use a combination of carbon filters, UV light, and other technologies to remove impurities from water, making it safe for drinking."
