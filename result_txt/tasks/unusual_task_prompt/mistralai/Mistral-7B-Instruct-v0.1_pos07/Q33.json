    "Sponge-based Water Purification System: Create a water purification system that uses sponges to filter and clean water. Sponges are known for their ability to absorb and retain water, and this can be leveraged to create an efficient and eco-friendly water purification system.",
    "Sponge-based Solar-Powered Charger: Develop a solar-powered charger that uses sponges to store and release energy. Sponges can be used as a battery, as they have a high surface area and can store a large amount of energy. This can be an effective way to store energy from solar panels and release it when needed.",
    "Sponge-based Air Purifier: Create an air purifier that uses sponges to clean the air. Sponges are known for their ability to absorb and retain moisture, which can be used to clean the air of pollutants and other contaminants.",
    "Sponge-based Fuel Cell: Develop a fuel cell that uses sponges as a catalyst. Sponges are known for their ability to absorb and release water, which can be used to facilitate the reaction in a fuel cell. This can be an effective way to generate clean energy from fuel cells.",
    "Sponge-based Robotic Arm: Create a robotic arm that uses sponges asipulators. Sponges are known for their ability to absorb and release water, which can be used to grip and manipulate objects. This can be an effective way to create a robotic arm that is gentle and safe to use around people and fragile objects."
