    "**Celestial Bodies Observation**: Monitor the position of celestial bodies such as the moon and stars to gauge the time of night. This method would require a clear view of the sky and knowledge of the lunar cycle or star patterns.",
    "**Hourglass**: Use a traditional hourglass to measure the passage of time. An hourglass is a mechanical device that releases sand from an upper chamber to a lower chamber at a controlled rate, allowing for a visual indication of time elapsed.",
    "**Heartbeat and Breathing Rhythm**: Train oneself to monitor one's heartbeat and breathing rhythm. Over time, one can learn to estimate the time by recognizing the patterns of these natural processes.",
    "**Water Clock**: Create a water clock by using a container with a hole in the bottom and a float inside. As the water level drops, the float will rise and sink, providing a visual indication of the passage of time.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Organisms**: Utilize the presence of bioluminescent organisms that glow in the dark. By observing the intensity and duration of their glow, one could estimate the time of day."
