    "One creative idea to cross a river if all bridges collapsed could be to build a makeshift raft using available materials such as driftwood, leaves, and vines. The raft can be tied together and used as a boat to navigate across the river.",
    "Another idea could be to use a long, sturdy rope or cable to create a human bridge. By tying one end of the rope to a solid object on the riverbank and the other end to a tree or other object on the opposite bank, people can cross the river by walking or crawling across the rope.",
    "A third idea could be to use a helicopter or drone to transport people or supplies across the river. This would require access to a helicopter or drone and a way to securely transport the people or supplies.",
    "A fourth idea could be to use a boat or kayak to cross the river. This would require access to a boat or kayak and the ability to navigate the river.",
    "A fifth idea could be to use a balloon or parachute to cross the river. This would require access to a balloon or parachute and the ability to navigate the river."
