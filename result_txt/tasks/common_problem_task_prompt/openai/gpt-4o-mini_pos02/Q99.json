    "**Tactile Smart Maps**: Develop a tactile map application that uses 3D printing technology to create physical maps of neighborhoods or buildings. Users can run their fingers over the raised surfaces to feel the layout, landmarks, and routes. This technology could integrate with GPS to provide real-time updates on their location and any changes in the environment. The main issue to address would be the scalability of producing these maps for various locations and ensuring they remain user-friendly and easy to interpret.",
    "**Wearable Sensory Feedback Device**: Design a wearable device, like a bracelet or belt, that provides haptic feedback to help visually impaired individuals navigate through space. The device could use ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects and vibrate in different patterns or intensities based on proximity. For instance, a rapid vibration could indicate a close obstacle, while a slow pulse could signify a safe path. Ensuring the device is intuitive and not overwhelming with feedback would be crucial for effective use.",
    "**Smart Cane with Environmental Awareness**: Innovate a smart cane equipped with sensors that detect environmental features such as curbs, steps, and traffic signals. The cane could communicate with a smartphone app to provide auditory or vibrational alerts about the surroundings. It could also integrate with public transport systems to give users real-time updates on arrivals and departures. A challenge would be to maintain the cane's traditional lightweight and sturdy design while incorporating advanced technology.",
    "**Interactive Braille Learning Tool**: Create an interactive digital device that teaches Braille through a combination of tactile feedback and auditory cues. The device could have a grid of small, movable pins that rise and fall to form Braille characters, allowing users to feel the letters as they learn. Coupled with audio instructions, this tool could enhance the learning experience for children and adults alike. Ensuring the device is durable, affordable, and engaging would be essential to its success.",
    "**Voice-Activated Home Automation System**: Develop a voice-activated smart home system specifically designed for visually impaired users. This system could include features such as smart lighting, temperature control, and security alerts that are all operable via voice commands. The system would need to be intuitive, with simple setup and operation instructions, as well as ensuring compatibility with existing smart home devices. Addressing privacy concerns and ensuring the system is secure from unauthorized access would be paramount."
