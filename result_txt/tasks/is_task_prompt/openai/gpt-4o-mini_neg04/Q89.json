    "Once upon a time in the mystical land of Eldoria, there lived a dragon named Zyrak who had an unusual problemâ€”he couldn't stop sneezing! Each time he sneezed, clouds of glittering dust erupted from his snout, causing flowers to bloom and rainbows to form. The villagers adored him, but Zyrak felt embarrassed. One day, a fierce storm threatened the village, and only Zyrak's sneezes could disperse the dark clouds. Gathering his courage, he took a deep breath and let out the biggest sneeze ever. A magnificent explosion of sparkles filled the sky, breaking the storm. The villagers cheered, and Zyrak learned that sometimes, our quirks can save the day!",
