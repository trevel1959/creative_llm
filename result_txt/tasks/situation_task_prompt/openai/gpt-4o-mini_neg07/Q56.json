    "**Reflective Materials**: People could use various reflective materials, such as polished metals or glass, to create makeshift mirrors. For instance, a piece of aluminum foil or a shiny car hood could serve as a temporary solution. This would spark creativity in finding alternative ways to see oneself, leading to DIY projects where individuals repurpose items around their homes to create their own reflection tools.",
    "**Digital Reflections**: In a world without physical mirrors, the use of technology could come into play. People might rely on their smartphones, tablets, or computers to see their reflections through front-facing cameras. This could lead to a rise in apps designed specifically for this purpose, including features that enhance or modify reflections, allowing users to experiment with their appearance in fun and creative ways.",
    "**Shadow Play**: Without mirrors, individuals might begin to experiment with shadows and light. By positioning themselves in front of a light source, they could observe their silhouette on walls or floors. This would not only provide a unique way to see oneself but could also inspire artistic expressions, such as shadow puppetry or silhouette art, encouraging a new form of self-expression.",
    "**Reflective Clothing**: Fashion designers could innovate by creating clothing with reflective materials integrated into the fabric. These garments would allow wearers to see their reflections in various surfaces, such as glass windows or shiny vehicles. This trend could lead to a movement in fashion that embraces utility and self-awareness, with clothing designed to help individuals view themselves from different angles throughout the day.",
    "**Optical Illusions**: Artists and designers could create installations or art pieces that utilize optical illusions to give the impression of a reflection. For example, using angled mirrors or reflective surfaces in creative ways could allow viewers to see their likeness in unexpected forms. This would not only serve as a way to see oneself but also encourage engagement with art and creativity, making self-reflection a communal experience."
