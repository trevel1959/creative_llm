    "Cloud-Enhanced Solar Panels: Create solar panels that are designed to work in cloudy conditions. These panels would have a special coating that maximizes energy capture even when the sun is partially obscured by clouds.",
    "Cloud-Simulating Mirrors: Build large mirrors that can simulate the appearance of a clear sky, allowing sunlight to reach the ground even on cloudy days. These mirrors could be strategically placed around cities to improve the amount of available sunlight.",
    "Cloud-Optimized Solar Gardens: Design solar gardens that are specifically tailored to work in cloudy conditions. These gardens would feature a mix of trees, shrubs, and plants that create microclimates that optimize the amount of sunlight available.",
    "Solar Umbrellas: Develop solar umbrellas that can be opened and closed to control the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground. These umbrellas would be used in urban areas to provide shade and collect solar energy simultaneously.",
    "Cloud-Powered Energy Storage: Create energy storage systems that use cloud power to store excess solar energy generated on clear days for use on cloudy days. This would help smooth out the variability of solar energy production and provide a reliable source of power."
