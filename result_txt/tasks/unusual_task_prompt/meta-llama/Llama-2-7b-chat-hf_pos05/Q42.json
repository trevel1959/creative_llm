    "Smart Gloves with Built-in Sensors: Develop a pair of gloves with built-in sensors that can detect various physiological signals, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. These sensors can be integrated into the gloves' fabric, allowing users to monitor their vital signs without any bulky devices. The data can be transmitted wirelessly to a smartphone or computer for analysis and tracking.",
    "Glove-based Virtual Reality Interface: Create a glove with integrated sensors that can detect hand movements and translate them into virtual reality gestures. This can enable users to interact with virtual objects and environments in a more natural and intuitive way. The glove can be used in various applications, such as gaming, education, and medical training.",
    "Heated Gloves for Cold Weather: Develop a pair of heated gloves that can keep hands warm and comfortable in cold weather. The gloves can be powered by rechargeable batteries or a small heating unit built into the glove. The heating element can be controlled by a switch or a smartphone app, allowing users to adjust the temperature to their liking.",
    "Glove-based Braille Display: Create a glove with raised dots on the fingertips that can display Braille characters in real-time. The glove can be worn on the hand like a regular glove, and the raised dots can be made of a flexible material that can be raised and lowered using a small motor. This can enable blind and visually impaired individuals to read and write in Braille with greater ease and convenience.",
    "Glove-based Exoskeleton for People with Disabilities: Develop a glove that can provide support and enhance the mobility of people with disabilities. The glove can be equipped with sensors and actuators that can detect and mimic the user's hand movements, allowing them to perform various tasks with greater ease and precision. The glove can be used in various applications, such as rehabilitation, daily living, and work."
