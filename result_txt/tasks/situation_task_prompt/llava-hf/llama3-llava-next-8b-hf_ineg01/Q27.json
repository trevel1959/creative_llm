    "Create a \"cool\" room: If you have a spare room, set it up as a cool, comfortable space for sleeping and relaxing. This can be achieved by using light-colored paint, placing mirrors on the walls to reflect light, and using light-colored curtains that can be easily opened and closed to control natural light and ventilation.",
    "Utilize sunlight: Take advantage of natural sunlight during the day by opening curtains and blinds to let in sunlight, which can help warm your home. Close them at night to retain heat."
