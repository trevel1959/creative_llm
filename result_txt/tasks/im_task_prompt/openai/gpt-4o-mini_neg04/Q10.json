    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Enhance the laptop with a built-in AR display that projects virtual elements onto the physical environment. Users could interact with 3D models, virtual notes, or even collaborate with others in a shared AR space. This would be particularly useful for designers, architects, and educators, providing an immersive experience that traditional screens cannot offer.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lid**: Develop a laptop with a solar-powered lid that can charge the battery using solar energy. This could be especially beneficial for users who are often on the go or in outdoor settings. The lid would feature high-efficiency solar cells that blend seamlessly into the design, ensuring that users can extend their battery life sustainably without needing a power outlet.",
    "**Modular Components**: Create a laptop with modular components that allow users to easily upgrade or replace parts like the RAM, storage, or even the graphics card. This would not only extend the lifespan of the laptop but also reduce electronic waste. Users could customize their machines based on their needs, whether for gaming, graphic design, or basic tasks, making the laptop more versatile and user-friendly.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Integrate a more advanced AI personal assistant that can learn from the user's habits and preferences over time. This assistant could manage schedules, automate repetitive tasks, suggest optimizations for productivity, and even analyze the userâ€™s work patterns to provide personalized tips for improvement. The assistant could be voice-activated and seamlessly integrated into all applications, enhancing the overall user experience.",
    "**360-Degree Privacy Shield**: Introduce a 360-degree privacy shield that can be deployed around the laptop screen. This would consist of retractable, flexible screens that can be pulled up when the user wants to work in a public space, ensuring that their screen is only visible to them. The shield could also feature sound-dampening technology to keep conversations private, making it ideal for open offices or coffee shops."
