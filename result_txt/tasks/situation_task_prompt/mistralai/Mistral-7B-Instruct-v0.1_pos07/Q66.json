    "Use 3D Printing Technology: If all natural materials like wood and stone disappeared, we could use 3D printing technology to create a house. We could design and print the walls, roof, and even the furniture using plastic or metal. This would be a cost-effective and efficient way to build a house.",
    "Use Recycled Materials: We could use recycled materials to build a house. We could use old tires, plastic bottles, and even old furniture to create a unique and eco-friendly house. This would be a creative way to use recycled materials and reduce waste.",
    "Use Modular Construction: We could use modular construction to build a house. We could create prefabricated modules that can be assembled on-site. This would be a fast and efficient way to build a house, and we could use a variety of materials like steel, aluminum, and glass.",
    "Use Sustainable Materials: We could use sustainable materials like bamboo, hemp, and straw to build a house. These materials are renewable and eco-friendly. We could use them to create a unique and sustainable house that is in harmony with nature.",
    "Use Biodegradable Materials: We could use biodegradable materials like mushroom mycelium, hempcrete, and straw bales to build a house. These materials are natural and biodegradable. We could use them to create a unique and eco-friendly house that is in harmony with nature."
