    "Create a network of underground tunnels or underground transport systems that can be used for pedestrian and vehicular travel. These tunnels would be designed to provide seamless connectivity between different parts of the city, allowing people to move around without being affected by the absence of roads.",
    "Implement a system of drones that can deliver goods and people across the city. These drones would be equipped with advanced navigation systems and could be used for on-demand transportation, allowing people to move around without relying on roads.",
    "Develop a modular transportation system that can be easily assembled and disassembled. This system would consist of interconnected modules that can be used to create temporary roads or pathways, allowing people to move around without the need for permanent infrastructure.",
    "Create a network of waterways that can be used for transportation. This would involve the construction of canals and waterways that can be used for boats and other watercraft, allowing people to move around without relying on roads.",
    "Develop a network of pedestrian-friendly zones, with wide sidewalks and dedicated pedestrian lanes. This would involve the creation of pedestrian-only zones, where people can walk or cycle without the need for roads."
