    "**Eye Exercises and Vision Training Programs**: With the absence of corrective lenses, a new trend could emerge around eye health and vision training. People might adopt daily routines of eye exercises designed to strengthen the eye muscles and improve focus. Workshops and online platforms could offer guided sessions led by vision specialists, focusing on techniques like the Bates Method, which emphasizes relaxation and visualization to enhance natural eyesight.",
    "**Natural Vision Remedies**: A surge in interest in holistic and natural remedies could arise, leading to the development of herbal supplements and diets aimed at improving vision. Nutritional experts could create specialized meal plans rich in vitamins A, C, E, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to support eye health. Community gardens could sprout up, encouraging people to grow their own eye-healthy foods, fostering a sense of community while promoting better vision.",
    "**Vision-Adapted Architecture**: As people adjust to life without glasses or contacts, architects and urban planners might begin designing buildings and public spaces with enhanced visibility in mind. This could include brighter lighting, larger signage with high-contrast colors, and the use of textures to guide visually impaired individuals. Public transportation systems could also adapt, implementing tactile paths and auditory cues to help those with impaired vision navigate more easily.",
    "**Social Support Networks**: The disappearance of glasses and contacts could lead to the establishment of support groups and communities focused on sharing coping strategies for living with poor vision. These networks would facilitate the exchange of resources, advice, and experiences, fostering camaraderie among individuals facing similar challenges. They could organize events like vision-friendly scavenger hunts or guided nature walks, promoting social interaction while encouraging adaptive skills.",
    "**Innovative Assistive Technology**: With the rise of smart devices, new assistive technologies could be developed to help individuals with poor vision. This might include smartphone apps that utilize AI to read text aloud, recognize faces, or describe surroundings. Wearable devices could be designed to provide haptic feedback to guide users, alerting them to obstacles or helping them navigate unfamiliar environments. These technologies would empower individuals to maintain independence and confidence in their daily lives."
