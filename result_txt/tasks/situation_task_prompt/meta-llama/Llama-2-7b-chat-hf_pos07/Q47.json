    "Wear a Sunhat: A sunhat is a great way to protect your head from sunburn, and it can also be styled in various ways to match your outfit. You can opt for a floppy hat with a wide brim or a fedora with a narrower brim, depending on your personal preference.",
    "Use a Sun Umbrella: A sun umbrella is a portable and lightweight option that can provide excellent protection from the sun. It can be easily carried in a bag or backpack, and it can be used on the go or at the beach.",
    "Apply Sunblock: If you don't want to wear a hat or umbrella, you can always apply sunblock to your head. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF to ensure maximum protection. You can apply it liberally to your scalp and hair, making sure to cover all exposed areas.",
    "Try a Sunsleeve: A sun sleeve is a sleeve-like garment that covers your arm and provides protection from the sun. You can wear it on your head to protect your scalp and hair from sunburn. It's a great option for people who don't like wearing hats or umbrellas.",
    "Plant a Hair Forest: If you're not a fan of any of the above options, you can always try planting a hair forest! This may sound unusual, but it's a creative and eco-friendly way to protect your head from the sun. You can plant a variety of plants that have natural hair-like structures, such as bamboo or aloe vera, around your head. These plants will provide shade and protect your head from the sun's harmful rays."
