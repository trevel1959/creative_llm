    "Bio-luminescence: I would give humans the ability to produce light from their bodies, similar to fireflies or glowworms. This would allow for better low-light visibility, improved night vision, and even a form of communication. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Shape-shifting: I would allow humans to change their body shape and form to adapt to different environments and situations. For example, they could transform into a more compact form for space travel or a more robust form for underwater exploration. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Internal compartmentalization: I would redesign the human body to have internal compartments that could be used to store and organize various bodily functions. For instance, a compartment for storing nutrients and waste, or a compartment for housing the brain. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Self-healing: I would give humans the ability to heal themselves more quickly and efficiently. This could involve the development of advanced regenerative abilities, such as the ability to regrow lost limbs or repair damaged organs. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Energy manipulation: I would allow humans to manipulate and control energy, allowing them to harness it for various purposes such as powering their bodies or manipulating their surroundings. This could involve the development of advanced bio-electrical systems or even the ability to generate energy from the environment. Confidence score: 0.8"
