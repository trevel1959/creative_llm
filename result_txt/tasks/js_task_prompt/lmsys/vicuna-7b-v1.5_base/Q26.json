    "Food crops: With the magic wand, I would make it possible to grow more food crops in areas where farming is difficult or impossible due to climate change, drought, or other environmental factors. This would help to address food security and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries.",
    "Medicinal plants: I would use the magic wand to grow more medicinal plants in areas where they are rare or endangered. This could help to address the global shortage of medicinal plants and their derivatives, which are used in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals.",
    "Renewable energy: I would use the magic wand to grow more trees and other plants that can be used to produce renewable energy, such as biofuels or bioplastics. This would help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.",
    "Green infrastructure: I would use the magic wand to grow more green infrastructure, such as parks, gardens, and urban forests. This would help to improve air quality, reduce heat islands, and provide habitats for wildlife in urban areas.",
    "Water purification: I would use the magic wand to grow more plants that can be used to purify water. This could help to address the global water crisis and improve access to clean drinking water."
