    "Chewing Gum: Although it may seem counterintuitive, chewing gum can actually help clean your teeth by stimulating saliva production, which neutralizes acids that cause cavities. Look for sugar-free gum that contains xylitol, which has been shown to reduce plaque buildup.",
    "Flossing With String: If you don't have floss, you can use string or dental tape to remove food particles from between your teeth. Simply wrap the string around your fingers and gently pull it back and forth between your teeth.",
    "DIY Dental Floss: Another alternative to traditional floss is to make your own using cotton thread or dental tape. You can flavor it with essential oils or add a bit of honey for extra sweetness.
