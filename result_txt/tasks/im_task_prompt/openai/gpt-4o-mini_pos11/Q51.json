    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the table, such as a built-in touchscreen surface that can serve multiple purposes. Users could access recipes, play music, or even video chat while dining. The table could also have wireless charging pads embedded into the surface for smartphones and tablets, enhancing convenience and reducing clutter from cables.",
    "**Interactive Surface**: Develop a table with an interactive surface that can change colors or display images based on user preferences or events. For example, the table could project a starry night sky for romantic dinners or display seasonal themes for holidays. This could be achieved using LED technology and a customizable app that allows users to select themes and colors.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design a table using innovative sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bamboo composites. The table could be marketed as an eco-friendly option, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the design could incorporate features like upcycled glass tabletops or reclaimed wood, emphasizing both sustainability and aesthetics.",
    "**Convertible Functionality**: Create a table that can easily convert into different types of furniture, such as a desk, coffee table, or even a bench. This could be achieved through a series of foldable or sliding components that allow the table to transform based on the user's needs. This multi-functionality would be particularly appealing in small living spaces where maximizing utility is essential.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Integrate AR technology into the table, allowing users to use their smartphones or AR glasses to visualize different table settings, such as how a meal will look or how decorations will fit into the space. This could also include interactive games or educational content for families, making mealtime more engaging and fun."
