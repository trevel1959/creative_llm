    "**Smart Walker**: Develop a wearable, AI-powered exoskeleton that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. This device would allow individuals to stand up and walk around using their brain signals. The Smart Walker would have a stable base, adjustable height, and advanced sensors to detect obstacles and prevent falls.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Harness**: Design a wearable harness that uses magnets or electromagnetics to create a localized gravity field, allowing users to float or hover in mid-air. This technology would enable individuals to move around without standing up, while still maintaining control and balance.",
    "**Personal Aerial Vehicle (PAV)**: Develop a compact, autonomous drone that can be controlled by the user's voice or gestures. The PAV would have a hovering capability, allowing individuals to move around without standing up, while also providing a bird's-eye view of their surroundings.",
    "**Seated Mobility Pod**: Design a futuristic, spherical mobility pod that can be controlled by the user's thoughts or voice. The pod would have a rotating axis, allowing individuals to move around in any direction, while seated comfortably inside.",
    "**Neuro-Controlled Levitation**: Develop a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that can read the user's brain signals and control a levitation system. This technology would allow individuals to move around without standing up, using their thoughts to propel themselves through the air."
