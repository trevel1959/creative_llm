Additionally, food manufacturers would have to focus on developing products that are more visually appealing and have distinct textures to make up for the lack of taste and smell.",
    "New Sensory Experiences: With taste and smell out of the picture, people would have to rely on other senses to experience the world around them. This could lead to a new appreciation for the other senses and a focus on developing sensory experiences that cater to these senses, such as immersive sound and visual experiences.",
