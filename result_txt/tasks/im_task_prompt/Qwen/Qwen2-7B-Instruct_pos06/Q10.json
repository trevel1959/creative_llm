    "**Innovative Laptop Cooling System**: Design a laptop that incorporates a smart cooling system using phase change materials (PCMs) in its base. When the laptop heats up, the PCM absorbs the excess heat, then releases it back as the temperature drops. This maintains a consistent and comfortable operating temperature without requiring additional fans or noise.",
    "**Touchless Laptop Interface**: Develop a laptop that integrates capacitive sensors on its touchpad and keyboard, enabling users to interact with the device without touching any physical components. This feature can significantly benefit individuals with hygiene concerns, such as during pandemics, or those who prefer contactless technology.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laptop Packaging**: Create a laptop whose packaging is made entirely from biodegradable materials like bamboo fiber, corn starch, or recycled plastics. The goal is to reduce environmental impact by minimizing waste and promoting sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.",
    "**Customizable Keyboard Layout**: Offer a laptop with a modular keyboard where users can rearrange keys or add specialized function keys according to their needs. This customization option caters to various typing habits and professional requirements, enhancing user comfort and productivity.",
    "**Laptop with Built-in Augmented Reality**: Incorporate AR technology into the laptop, allowing users to visualize 3D models or virtual objects directly on the screen without the need for external devices. This feature can revolutionize fields like architecture, engineering, and education by providing immersive learning experiences."
