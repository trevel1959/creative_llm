    "**Innovative Modular Design**: Create a computer that can be customized in real-time by adding or removing components as per user needs. This could be achieved through modular design where each component (CPU, RAM, GPU, storage) is connected to a central hub using high-speed connectors. The user could then swap out components without needing any specialized tools or expertise. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Biodegradable Components**: Design a computer using biodegradable materials such as bamboo, corn starch, or recycled plastics. These materials not only reduce the environmental impact but also make the computer more sustainable. The design would include components that are easy to disassemble and recycle at the end of the product's life cycle. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**AI-Assisted System Tuning**: Develop a system that uses artificial intelligence to optimize performance based on usage patterns. The AI learns how the user interacts with the computer and adjusts settings, software configurations, and power management to enhance performance and efficiency. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Sustainable Power Supply**: Implement a renewable energy source, like solar panels, to power the computer. This would involve designing an efficient power conversion system that can charge batteries during daylight hours and supply power to the computer when there's no sunlight. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Intuitive User Interface**: Create a computer with an intuitive, voice-controlled interface that understands natural language commands. This would enable users to interact with the computer without the need for a physical keyboard or mouse. Voice recognition technology would interpret commands accurately and execute them swiftly. Confidence Score: 0.9"
