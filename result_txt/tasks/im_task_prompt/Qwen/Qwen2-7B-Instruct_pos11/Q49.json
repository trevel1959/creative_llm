    "**Smart Oral Health Tracker**: Create an electric toothbrush that not only cleans teeth but also tracks oral health metrics. This device could monitor brushing duration, pressure applied, frequency of brushing, and even detect potential issues like gum disease. It could connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth for real-time feedback, tips for improvement, and reminders to maintain a healthy routine.",
    "**Teeth Whitening System**: Integrate a gentle, safe, and effective teeth whitening system into the electric toothbrush. This would involve using micro-encapsulated activated charcoal or other natural whitening agents in the bristles or brush head. Users can experience improved smile aesthetics without the need for additional whitening products.",
    "**Hygiene Reminder Function**: Develop an electric toothbrush that reminds users when it's time to replace their toothbrush heads or change toothpaste. This feature could be based on usage patterns, recommended replacement intervals, or the type of toothpaste used. It could be especially helpful for those who struggle to remember such maintenance tasks.",
    "**Innovative Brush Heads**: Design electric toothbrushes with unique brush head shapes and materials. For example, incorporate soft, silicone bristles for sensitive gums, or add massage points for relaxing and rejuvenating the mouth. This could lead to more personalized and effective cleaning experiences.",
    "**Environmental Impact Awareness**: Create an eco-friendly electric toothbrush line that emphasizes sustainability. This could include brushes made from recycled materials, powered by renewable energy sources (like solar panels), or designed for easy recycling after use. The aim is to reduce waste and encourage more sustainable oral hygiene practices."
