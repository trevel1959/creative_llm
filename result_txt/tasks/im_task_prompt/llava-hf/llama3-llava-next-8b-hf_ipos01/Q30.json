    "Smart Cooling System: Integrate an AI-powered air conditioner that learns the user's preferences and adjusts temperature and fan speed accordingly. It could also analyze the room's layout, considering factors like furniture placement, to optimize cooling and reduce energy waste.",
    "Air Purifying Feature: Incorporate an air purification system into the air conditioner that not only cools the air but also removes pollutants and allergens. This would improve indoor air quality and provide an added health benefit for users.",
    "Air Conditioner App: Develop a mobile app that allows users to control their air conditioner remotely, set timers, and monitor energy usage. This could include notifications for filter replacements, temperature adjustments, and alerts for potential maintenance issues.",
    "Eco-Mode: Implement an eco-mode feature that allows users to reduce energy consumption by limiting the cooling capacity of the air conditioner. This could be achieved through a variable speed fan or a built-in thermostat that learns the user's comfort levels.",
    "Smart Lighting Integration: Develop an air conditioner that can integrate with smart lighting systems, allowing the air conditioner to adjust temperature based on the natural light entering the room. This would create a more energy-efficient and comfortable environment."
