    "**Multi-Function Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a spatula with a base that allows users to switch out different heads for various cooking tasks. One head could be flat for flipping pancakes, another could be slotted for draining excess oil, and a third could be curved for scraping bowls. This versatility would make it easier for cooks to use one tool for multiple purposes, reducing clutter in the kitchen.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Timer and Recipe Guide**: Create a spatula that features a small digital display on the handle, which can be programmed with cooking times for various recipes. Users can input their desired dish, and the spatula will count down the time, vibrating when it’s time to flip or remove the food. This would help novice cooks keep track of cooking times and improve their culinary skills.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Spatula**: Develop a spatula made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that break down naturally after use. This spatula would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and could be marketed as a single-use option for outdoor events or parties, reducing plastic waste while still providing functionality.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light to sanitize the spatula's surface after use. This feature would help maintain hygiene in the kitchen, especially when dealing with raw meats or sticky substances. Users would simply place the spatula in a designated holder that activates the UV light for a few minutes, ensuring it’s clean and ready for the next use.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Grater and Zester**: Design a spatula that features a grater and zester on one side of the head, allowing users to easily add zest or grated ingredients to their dishes without needing to switch tools. This would be particularly useful for recipes that require both flipping and flavoring, streamlining the cooking process and saving time."
