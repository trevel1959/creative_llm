    "Transitional Habitats: In a world where all natural materials like wood and stone are gone, building a house would require adopting innovative technologies and materials to create a sustainable and functional living space. One creative solution could be to design and construct a house using a combination of recycled materials, like plastic waste, and biodegradable materials like bamboo or straw. This approach would not only reduce waste but also provide a unique aesthetic to the building.",
    "Structural Mesh: Another idea for building a house without natural materials is to use a mesh-like structure made of a flexible, yet strong material like graphene. Graphene is a highly durable and versatile material that can be molded into various shapes and forms, making it an ideal candidate for creating a lightweight yet strong house. The mesh structure would provide excellent insulation, airflow, and protection against extreme weather conditions.",
    "Smart Geodesic Domes: Geodesic domes are already known for their efficiency and strength, but in a world without natural materials, they could become the go-to design for sustainable housing. By using a combination of recycled materials and advanced 3D printing technology, it's possible to create a smart geodesic dome that is not only energy-efficient but also aesthetically pleasing. The dome shape provides excellent structural integrity and can be designed to incorporate various features like solar panels, wind turbines, and rainwater harvesting systems.",
    "Bio-based Building Blocks: Another creative solution for building a house without natural materials is to use bio-based building blocks made from renewable resources like agricultural waste or algae. These blocks can be molded into various shapes and forms to create walls, floors, and ceilings, providing a sustainable and durable building material. The blocks can also be designed to incorporate insulation, ventilation, and other features to create a comfortable living space."
