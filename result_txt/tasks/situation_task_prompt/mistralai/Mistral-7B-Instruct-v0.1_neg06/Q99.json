    "Texture: Even though everything is black and white, different objects will still have different textures. For example, a smooth marble statue will feel different from a rough barked tree. By feeling the texture of an object, we can differentiate it from others.",
    "Shape: Shapes are also unique to each object. Even if everything is black and white, the shape of an object can still be recognized. For example, a round apple will feel different from a ball. By identifying the shape of an object, we can differentiate it from others.",
    "Size: Even though everything is black and white, different objects will still have different sizes. For example, a small pebble will feel different from a large boulder. By identifying the size of an object, we can differentiate it from others.",
    "Sound: Even though everything is black and white, different objects will still make different sounds. For example, a hollow metal pipe will make a different sound than a solid wooden block. By listening to the sound of an object, we can differentiate it from others.",
    "Smell: Even though everything is black and white, different objects will still have different smells. For example, a freshly cut apple will smell different from a stale apple. By identifying the smell of an object, we can differentiate it from others."
