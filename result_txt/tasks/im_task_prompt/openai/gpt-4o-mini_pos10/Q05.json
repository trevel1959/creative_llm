    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop shoes made from biodegradable or recycled materials that not only reduce environmental impact but also decompose naturally at the end of their lifecycle. This could include innovative fabrics derived from ocean plastics or natural fibers like hemp, which are both sustainable and stylish.",
