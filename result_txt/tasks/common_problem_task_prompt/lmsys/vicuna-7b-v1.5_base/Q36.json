    "Aesthetics: Another potential problem is that solar panels can be an eyesore and may not be aesthetically pleasing to everyone. Some homeowners may not want the panels on their roof or may not like the way they look. This could lead to resistance from some homeowners and may require additional effort to convince them of the benefits of solar energy.",
    "Maintenance: Solar panels require regular maintenance to ensure they are functioning properly. This could be a problem for homeowners who are not comfortable with DIY maintenance or who do not have the time or resources to hire a professional. This could result in malfunctioning panels and reduced energy production.",
    "Space: Solar panels require space on the roof to be installed. This could be a problem for homeowners who do not have enough space on their roof or who live in an apartment or condo where rooftop installation is not possible. This could limit the number of homes that can be equipped with solar panels.",
    "Shading: Solar panels require direct sunlight to function properly. If there are trees or other structures on the roof that block the sunlight, this could reduce the efficiency of the panels. This could be a problem for homeowners who live in areas with a lot of shading or who have trees on their property.",
    "Weather: Solar panels are designed to withstand most weather conditions, but they can still be damaged by extreme weather events such as hail, wind, or heavy snow. This could result in costly repairs or the need to replace the panels altogether."
