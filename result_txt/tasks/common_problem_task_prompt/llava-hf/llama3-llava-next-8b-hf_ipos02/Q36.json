    "Space constraints: Many homes do not have sufficient roof space to accommodate solar panels, which could limit the potential for solar energy generation.",
    "Weather conditions: Solar panels require a certain amount of sunlight to function efficiently. In regions with frequent overcast skies or extreme weather conditions, solar panels may not be as effective.",
    "Maintenance and warranty: Solar panels require regular maintenance and cleaning to ensure optimal performance. Homeowners may not be willing or able to commit to this level of upkeep.",
    "Energy storage: Solar panels generate energy during the day, but what about when the sun isn't shining? Homeowners may need to invest in additional energy storage solutions, such as batteries, to ensure a reliable energy supply.",
    "Grid connection: If a city's electrical grid is not compatible with solar panels, homeowners may not be able to sell excess energy back to the grid, limiting the potential benefits of solar energy."
