    "**Customizable Weight Inserts**: Design a bowling ball with removable weight inserts that allow bowlers to easily adjust the ball's weight and balance according to their preference or lane conditions. This would cater to bowlers of all skill levels, enabling beginners to start with a lighter weight while allowing advanced players to fine-tune their ball for specific styles and conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bowling Ball**: Create a bowling ball made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bio-based resins. This eco-friendly alternative would appeal to environmentally conscious bowlers and could help reduce the environmental impact of bowling equipment production. The ball could also feature biodegradable packaging, further promoting sustainability in the sport.",
    "**Interactive Bowling Ball**: Develop a bowling ball that lights up or changes colors based on the bowler's performance. For example, the ball could glow green for strikes, yellow for spares, and red for gutter balls. This feature would not only make bowling more visually exciting but also enhance the social aspect of the game, as friends could cheer and react to the color changes during play.",
    "**Textured Grip Technology**: Introduce a bowling ball with an innovative grip surface that adapts to the bowler's hand. This could involve using materials that provide extra grip when wet or sweaty, ensuring that bowlers can maintain control over their throw regardless of conditions. The texture could also be customizable, allowing bowlers to choose their preferred grip style, from smooth to textured.",
    "**Bowling Ball with Integrated Cooling System**: Design a bowling ball that incorporates a cooling system to manage heat generated during play. This would prevent the ball from becoming too hot, which can affect performance. The cooling mechanism could use a gel insert or a series of micro-channels that circulate air, keeping the ball at an optimal temperature for consistent performance throughout a game."
