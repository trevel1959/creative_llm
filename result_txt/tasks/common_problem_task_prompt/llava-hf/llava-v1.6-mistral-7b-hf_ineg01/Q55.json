    "Infrastructure and Infrastructure Maintenance: A park dedicated to wildlife and environmental conservation must have infrastructure that meets the needs of both the visitors and the wildlife it seeks to protect. This can include restrooms, trails, parking areas, and other facilities. - To address this issue, conduct feasibility studies to ensure that the park's infrastructure aligns with the project's goals and the local environment. Maintain facilities and infrastructure through routine inspection and repair to reduce the likelihood of disruptions or environmental impacts.",
    "Wildlife Habitat Impact: Establishing a park can have indirect impacts on local wildlife, potentially disrupting their natural habitats or behavior patterns. - To minimize human-wildlife conflicts, ensure that the design of the park minimizes habitat fragmentation, and it has minimal interference with the ecosystem. Regular monitoring and management plans can also help mitigate such issues.",
    "Human Traffic and Impact on Wildlife: Although the park aims to protect wildlife, the presence of people introduces the potential for disturbances, stress, or harm to the natural habitat. - To accommodate the high influx of visitors, consider implementing regulations and guidelines for visitors, such as educational signs about respecting wildlife, designated paths for walking, and limiting the number of visitors during critical wildlife migration or breeding seasons.",
    "Safety and Security: Security of park staff, visitors, and wildlife is paramount. Crime or other incidents may compromise the wildlife's well-being and affect visitor numbers. - Implement and maintain a robust security system that includes staff-friendly practices, such as routine background checks, emergency training for staff, and monitoring of visitor behavior.",
    "Education and Awareness: A key responsibility of a conservation park is to educate the public about the importance of environmental conservation and the ways they can help. - To ensure effective education, partner with local schools, create educational materials such as guided tours, and offer workshops or events. Establishing a social media presence to share information about the park and the issues it addresses can help reach a broader audience."
