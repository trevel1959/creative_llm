    "Use nature as your kitchen: Take advantage of the natural resources available to create a meal. For example, gather wild edibles like berries, leaves, and herbs to make a salad or tea. Use rocks and sticks to create a makeshift mortar and pestle to mash or grind ingredients.",
    "Utilize the human body: Use the human body as a cooking tool to prepare a meal. For instance, use your hands to mix and knead dough, or use your mouth to chew and mix food. You could also use your feet to grind or pound ingredients.",
    "Create a makeshift oven: Use a hole in the ground or a clay pot as a makeshift oven. Line the pot with rocks or mud to retain heat and cook food. You could also use a fire to heat up food directly on a stick or rock.",
    "Use tools from other cultures: Look to other cultures for inspiration on how to prepare a meal without cooking equipment. For example, you could use a Japanese bamboo steamer to cook vegetables or a Mexican tortilla press to make tortillas.",
    "Get creative with raw materials: Look for raw materials like cardboard, straws, and string to create makeshift cooking tools. For example, you could use a cardboard box as a makeshift cutting board or a straw as a makeshift whisk. Use string to tie ingredients together or create a makeshift skewer for grilling."
