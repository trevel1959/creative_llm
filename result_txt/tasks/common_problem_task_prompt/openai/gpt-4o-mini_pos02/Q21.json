    "**Cyberbullying Awareness**: The digital age has introduced new forms of bullying, particularly through social media and online platforms. Children may face harassment or negative interactions that can impact their mental health. Parents should educate their children about cyberbullying, promoting open communication so that children feel safe reporting any negative experiences. Creating a supportive environment where children can discuss their online interactions without fear of judgment is crucial.",
    "**Information Overload**: The internet provides a vast amount of information, which can be overwhelming for children. They may struggle to discern credible sources from unreliable ones, leading to confusion and misinformation. Parents can help by teaching critical thinking skills and media literacy, guiding their children on how to evaluate sources and encouraging them to ask questions about the information they encounter online.",
    "**Privacy and Security Concerns**: With the rise of social media and online sharing, children may unknowingly expose themselves to privacy risks. They might share personal information that could lead to identity theft or unwanted attention. Parents should discuss the importance of online privacy, teaching children about setting strong privacy settings on their accounts and the implications of sharing personal information online.",
    "**Digital Dependency**: As children grow up surrounded by technology, there is a risk of developing a dependency on digital devices for entertainment and social interaction. This can hinder their ability to engage in face-to-face communication and develop social skills. Parents can encourage offline activities, such as reading, sports, or arts and crafts, and set aside tech-free family time to foster stronger relationships and social skills.",
    "**Impact on Academic Performance**: The distractions posed by digital devices can negatively affect a child's focus and academic performance. The temptation to multitask—such as texting while doing homework—can lead to decreased productivity and learning retention. To combat this, parents can create a designated homework space free from digital distractions and encourage focused study habits, including the use of apps that limit access to distracting sites during study times."
