    "Solar-powered airships: These would be large, lightweight airships powered by a network of solar panels that harness the sun's energy to generate electricity. The airships would be able to transport passengers and cargo over long distances, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional air travel.",
    "Magnetic train: This would be a high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to travel on a trackless, magnetic rail. The train would be able to reach speeds of up to 500 miles per hour, significantly reducing travel times and providing a more efficient and sustainable mode of transportation.",
    "Personal flying vehicles: These would be small, personal-sized flying vehicles that use a combination of electric and solar power to take off and land vertically. They would be able to transport passengers and cargo over short to medium distances, providing a convenient and eco-friendly alternative to cars and trucks.",
    "Underwater trains: These would be high-speed trains that travel through a network of underwater tunnels, connecting major cities and regions around the world. The trains would be powered by a combination of magnetic levitation and underwater propulsion systems, providing a fast and efficient mode of transportation that is not affected by traffic or weather.",
    "Magnetic hoverbikes: These would be small, two-wheeled vehicles that use magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground. They would be able to travel at high speeds and traverse difficult terrain, providing a convenient and efficient mode of transportation in urban environments."
