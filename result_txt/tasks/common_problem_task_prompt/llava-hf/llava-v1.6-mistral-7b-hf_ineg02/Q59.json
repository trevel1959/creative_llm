    "Equipment Compatibility: Different devices may not have the same virtual reality capabilities, which could affect how games are played. If one player uses a device that is not fully supported or has lower specs, they may have a disadvantage compared to others. Organizers should confirm compatibility and provide any necessary devices or upgrades.",
    "Virtual Environment Lag: Even if players have fast internet connections, there may be lag, delays, or synchronization issues related to the virtual environment itself. This could lead to unfair gameplay and dissatisfaction among players. Organizers might need to invest in a more advanced VR platform or run multiple servers to reduce these lag-related problems.",
    "Health and Safety: Long periods of gameplay in virtual reality can lead to eye strain, dizziness, nausea, and even long-term health issues. It's essential to ensure that the gaming environment follows best practices and recommendations for a safe gaming experience. Organizers should provide regular breaks, set time limits, and recommend players to use appropriate safety gear like VR headset straps and wrist supports.",
    "Cheating: Some players may use cheat codes, software exploits, or other nefarious methods to gain an unfair advantage. This could lead to an unlevel playing field and potential loss of trust among competitors. Organizers should implement strict anti-cheating policies, such as player monitoring, pre-tournament screenings, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy.",
    "Technical Support: If any technical issues arise during the tournament, they need to be addressed swiftly to minimize disruption. Organizers should have a dedicated technical support team on standby during the tournament to address and resolve any issues quickly and efficiently, keeping player frustration to a minimum."
