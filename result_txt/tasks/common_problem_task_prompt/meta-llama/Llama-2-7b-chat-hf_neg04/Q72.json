    "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Power Plant: OTEC is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the temperature difference between the warm surface waters and cold deep waters of the ocean to generate electricity. This power plant would use a closed-loop system where cold seawater is pumped from the deep ocean to the surface, where it is heated by a heat exchanger to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. The warm water is then pumped back into the deep ocean, creating a continuous cycle. This plant would be located near coastal areas with a significant temperature difference between the surface and deep ocean waters.",
    "Bio-Electrochemical System: This power plant would use microorganisms to produce electricity through a process called bio-electrochemical systems. The microorganisms would be placed in an anode and cathode chamber, where they would feed on organic matter and produce electrons, which would flow through an external circuit to generate electricity. The organic matter could be waste biomass, algae, or even carbon dioxide. This plant would be particularly useful in areas with limited land availability or water scarcity.",
    "Solar-Powered Hydrogen Production: This power plant would use concentrated sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called photoelectrochemical water splitting. The hydrogen produced could be stored and used as a clean energy source for transportation or power generation. The plant could be located in areas with high levels of solar irradiance, such as deserts or rooftops.",
    "Tidal Lagoon Power Plant: This power plant would use the predictable and reliable tidal currents to generate electricity. The plant would consist of a series of barrages or walls built across a tidal estuary, where the water level would rise and fall with the tides. As the water flows through the barrages, it would pass through turbines, generating electricity. This plant would be particularly suitable for coastal areas with high tidal ranges, such as the UK or Canada.",
    "Green Roof Solar Power Plant: This power plant would use the flat rooftops of buildings to generate electricity. The rooftops would be covered with solar panels, which would capture sunlight and"
