    "**Personal Hoverboards**: Picture a future where personal hoverboards have become the norm. These devices could utilize magnetic levitation technology, allowing users to glide above the ground with minimal effort. To navigate, riders could control speed and direction through body movements or a handheld device. With designated hoverboard lanes, commuting would become faster and more efficient, and hoverboards could be easily stored in small spaces.",
    "**Smart Walking Paths**: Envision urban areas designed with \"smart walking paths\" that incorporate interactive technology. These paths would feature embedded LED lights that guide pedestrians, display real-time information about public transport schedules, and even provide alerts about local events. With augmented reality (AR) features, walkers could use their smartphones to overlay navigation instructions or points of interest as they stroll through the city.",
    "**Community-Based Carpooling Networks**: Imagine a community-driven carpooling app that connects neighbors for shared rides. Users could create profiles detailing their travel needs, and the app would match them with others going in the same direction. This system would not only reduce the number of vehicles on the road but also foster community connections. Features could include a rating system for drivers and passengers, ensuring safety and reliability.",
    "**Personalized Segway Rentals**: Think of a city-wide network of personalized Segway rentals, where users can customize their Segwayâ€™s settings based on their preferences. Riders could choose between different speed settings, seating options, and even color schemes. With strategically placed rental stations, people could easily pick up and drop off Segways throughout the city, making it a convenient option for short-distance travel.",
    "**Bicycle-Sharing Alternatives with Electric Trikes**: In the absence of traditional bicycles, electric trikes could fill the gap by providing a stable and efficient mode of transport. These trikes could be designed for both individuals and small groups, making them ideal for families or friends traveling together. With built-in GPS and app integration, users could locate the nearest trike and unlock it using their smartphones, ensuring a seamless travel experience."
