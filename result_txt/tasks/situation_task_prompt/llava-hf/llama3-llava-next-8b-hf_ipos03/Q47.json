    "Headband with UV Protection: I would use a headband made from UV-protective materials, like a hat with a chin strap, to keep the sun off my head. The band could be made of UPF fabric and could be adjustable to fit comfortably.",
    "Sun-Protective Head Cover: I would wear a large, sun-protective head cover made of UPF fabric, which could be worn like a hood or a large hat. This would provide full coverage and protect my entire head from the sun.",
    "Hair Replacement with Sun Protection: If hair replacement is an option, I would choose a hair replacement system that includes a protective layer, such as a scalp cap or a wig with UV-protective materials.",
    "Sun-Protective Sunscreen: If hair loss is temporary, I would use a high-SPF, water-resistant sunscreen on any exposed skin on my head and neck to protect against sunburn.",
    "Sun-Protective Clothing: I would wear clothing with UPF, such as hats, shirts, and jackets made from UV-protective fabrics, to minimize sun exposure on my head and neck."
