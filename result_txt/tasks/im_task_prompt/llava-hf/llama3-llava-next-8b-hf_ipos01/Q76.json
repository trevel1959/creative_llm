    "Hair Tie App: Develop a mobile app that can be used in conjunction with the hair tie. The app could have a timer that counts down the time until the tie needs to be replaced, as well as a reminder feature that alerts the user when it's time to reapply the tie.",
    "Hair Tie Subscription Service: Offer a subscription service that sends a new hair tie to the user on a regular basis, such as once a month. The service could also include a personalized consultation with a hairstylist to help the user choose the best hair tie for their hair type and style.",
    "Hair Tie for Men: Design a hair tie specifically for men, with a thicker and sturdier construction to withstand thicker and stronger hair. The tie could also have a more masculine color scheme and a sleeker design to appeal to male users.",
    "Hair Tie for Pets: Create a hair tie for pets, such as dogs and cats, that can help keep their fur neat and tidy. The tie could be made with a softer, more flexible material to accommodate the animal's comfort, and could come in a variety of colors and patterns to match the pet's fur."
