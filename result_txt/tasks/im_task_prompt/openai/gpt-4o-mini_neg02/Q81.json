    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a spatula with interchangeable heads that can switch between different types (e.g., slotted, solid, or angled) based on the cooking task. This would reduce the need for multiple utensils, save space in the kitchen, and allow for more versatility in cooking. The handle could also have a built-in storage compartment for the extra heads.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Create a spatula with a self-cleaning mechanism using ultrasonic technology. After cooking, the spatula could be placed in a designated cleaning dock that uses ultrasonic waves to remove food particles and grease, ensuring the spatula is always clean and hygienic without the need for manual scrubbing.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Grip Adjustment**: Develop a spatula that features an adjustable grip to accommodate different hand sizes and cooking styles. The handle could be designed with a customizable grip that can be molded or adjusted to fit the user's preference, enhancing comfort and reducing strain during prolonged cooking sessions.",
    "**Color-Changing Spatula for Doneness Indication**: Introduce a spatula that changes color based on the heat of the cooking surface or the food being cooked. For instance, the spatula could turn green when it's at a safe cooking temperature for delicate items like eggs, or red when itâ€™s too hot. This visual cue would help prevent overcooking and improve food safety.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Timer and Alarm**: Create a spatula that features a built-in timer and alarm system. Users can set the cooking time for their food directly on the spatula, and it will alert them when it's time to flip or remove the food. This would be particularly useful for busy cooks who may be multitasking in the kitchen."
