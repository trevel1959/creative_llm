    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Contact Lenses**: Imagine a future where contact lenses have transformed into augmented reality displays. These lenses would project information, entertainment, and even virtual assistants directly onto the user's field of vision. For example, a person could wear AR contact lenses while walking down the street, and suddenly, a virtual map would appear, guiding them to their destination. They could also receive real-time language translations, making international travel a breeze. The lenses could even provide personalized recommendations for restaurants, shops, or attractions based on the user's interests and preferences.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Health Monitoring**: These contact lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors that track the wearer's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood glucose levels, and oxygen saturation. This information would be transmitted to a mobile device or a cloud-based platform, allowing the user to monitor their health in real-time. The lenses could also detect potential health issues, such as diabetes or eye problems, and alert the user or their healthcare provider. This technology could revolutionize the way we manage our health, making it easier to prevent and treat diseases.",
    "**Holographic Display Contact Lenses**: Imagine being able to project holographic images and videos directly onto your retina. These contact lenses would use advanced holographic technology to create 3D images that appear to float in mid-air. Users could watch movies, play games, or even attend virtual meetings without the need for screens. This technology could also enable new forms of education, where students can interact with 3D models and simulations to better understand complex concepts.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Contact Lenses**: These contact lenses would be equipped with electrodes that read brain signals, allowing users to control devices with their thoughts. For example, a person could think about sending a text message, and the lenses would transmit the signal to their phone. This technology could enable people with paralysis or other motor disorders to communicate and interact with the world in new ways. It could also revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making it more intuitive and accessible.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring Contact Lenses**: These contact lenses would be designed to detect and analyze environmental pollutants, such as air quality, water quality, or radiation levels. The lenses could provide users with real-time information about their surroundings, helping them make informed decisions about their health and well-being. This technology could also be used to monitor environmental pollution, enabling governments and organizations to take action to protect the planet."
