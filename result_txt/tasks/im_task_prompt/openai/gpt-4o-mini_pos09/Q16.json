    "**Smart Hairbrush with App Integration**: Design a smart hairbrush that connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The app could analyze hair type, thickness, and scalp health, providing personalized hair care tips, product recommendations, and tracking hair growth over time. Additionally, it could offer reminders for regular hair care routines, making it easier for users to maintain healthy hair.",
    "**Ergonomic Multi-Function Handle**: Create a hairbrush with an ergonomic handle that includes built-in features such as a comb, mirror, and hair tie storage. The handle could be designed to fit comfortably in the hand while also providing additional functionality. This would make the hairbrush a versatile tool for on-the-go styling and touch-ups.",
    "**Heat and Cooling Functionality**: Introduce a hairbrush that can heat up or cool down while brushing. The heat function could help with styling, making it easier to create waves or curls, while the cooling feature could help set hairstyles and reduce frizz. Users could control the temperature through a simple dial on the handle, making it a dual-purpose styling tool.",
    "**Interchangeable Bristle Types**: Design a hairbrush with interchangeable bristle heads that can be swapped out depending on the user's hair type and styling needs. For example, a user could choose from soft bristles for gentle detangling, firm bristles for smoothing, or even a paddle brush head for blow-drying. This customization would make the hairbrush more versatile and suitable for various hair types.",
    "**Built-In Hair Product Dispenser**: Develop a hairbrush that features a built-in compartment for hair products such as leave-in conditioner or styling spray. Users could simply press a button to dispense the product evenly onto their hair while brushing. This would streamline the styling process and ensure even distribution of products without the mess of separate application."
