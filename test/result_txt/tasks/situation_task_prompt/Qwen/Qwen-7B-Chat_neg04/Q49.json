    "Create a Fire Safety Plan: One of the most important things to do in case of a fire is to have a fire safety plan in place. This plan should include evacuation routes, meeting places, and emergency phone numbers. You can also create a fire escape ladder or install a smoke detector to alert you of any potential danger.",
    "Use Non-Ammunition Fire Extinguishers: If traditional fire extinguishers are not available, you can use non-ammonium-based fire extinguishers such as baking soda or water. These can be used to smother small fires before they spread.",
    "Build a Fire Barrier: If you cannot prevent a fire from starting, you can build a fire barrier around your home. This can be done by using thick blankets or tarps to block off entry points.",
    "Use Heat-Resistant Materials: In case of a fire, it's important to keep your belongings safe. You can use heat-resistant materials such as wool or cotton to wrap your valuable items.",
    "Practice Fire Drills: It's essential to practice fire drills regularly to ensure that everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency. You can conduct mock drills at home with family members to prepare for a real-life situation."
