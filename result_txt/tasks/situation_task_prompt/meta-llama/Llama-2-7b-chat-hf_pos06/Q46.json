    "Build a community composting program: Create a network of community composting sites where residents can drop off their organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings. This waste can then be turned into nutrient-rich compost that can be used in gardens and landscaping.",
    "Implement a waste-to-energy program: Develop a system that converts waste into energy through processes such as incineration or anaerobic digestion. This can provide a sustainable source of energy and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.",
    "Create a waste-reduction challenge: Launch a public education campaign that challenges residents to reduce their waste generation through simple actions such as reducing food waste, avoiding single-use plastics, and buying products with minimal packaging.",
    "Develop a waste-tracking app: Create a mobile app that allows residents to track their waste generation and identify areas where they can reduce their waste. The app can also provide recommendations for sustainable waste management practices.",
    "Implement a pay-as-you-throw system: Introduce a pay-as-you-throw system where residents are charged for the amount of waste they generate. This can incentivize residents to reduce their waste and choose sustainable alternatives."
