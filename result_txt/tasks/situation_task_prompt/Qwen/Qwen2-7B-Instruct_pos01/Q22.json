    "**Aerial Transportation System**: Imagine a system of small, autonomous drones that could transport individuals across the town or city. These drones could be equipped with seats, safety belts, and could operate on pre-programmed routes. They could land and take off from any rooftop or designated landing zones, making transportation efficient and accessible to everyone. The drones would be environmentally friendly and could operate without roads.",
    "**Vertical Urban Planning**: If roads were no longer an option, consider a city designed around vertical structures. Skyscrapers would have elevators and staircases connecting different floors as well as connecting platforms where people could transfer to other buildings. This would require careful planning of the layout and access points but could lead to a highly efficient and compact urban environment.",
    "**Underwater Subterranean Networks**: For coastal cities, imagine developing a network of subterranean tunnels beneath the water. This would allow for direct and quick transportation across the city, avoiding the need for surface-level roads. Tunnels could connect key areas and could be accessed through underwater ports or elevators.",
    "**Personalized Flying Devices**: Each individual could own a small, personal flying device, similar to a drone but designed for personal use. These devices could be controlled by smartphones or other wearable tech, allowing for individual navigation and transport within the city. They would have safety features such as automatic landing and collision avoidance systems.",
    "**Teleportation Pods**: In a futuristic scenario, imagine teleportation pods that could instantly transport people from one location to another. While this is currently science fiction, if roads were non-existent, such technology could provide an instant and efficient means of transportation. However, this idea raises ethical and logistical concerns regarding safety and accessibility."
