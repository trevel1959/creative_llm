    "**Floating Coral Reefs**:    - Imagine a habitat that mimics the beauty of coral reefs but floats on the surface of the ocean. These artificial reefs would be made from sustainable materials and would host a variety of marine life, including fish, sea turtles, and even seabirds. The floating structure would allow for easy observation and research while providing a safe haven for endangered species, with areas for breeding and feeding.",
    "**Underground Oasis**:    - This habitat would be an expansive underground network, featuring a variety of chambers and tunnels that simulate different ecosystems, such as deserts, rainforests, and wetlands. Each chamber would have its own climate control, water sources, and light conditions, creating a unique environment for different species. The underground oasis would also be designed with natural filtration systems to recycle water and nutrients, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Sky Gardens**:    - This habitat would consist of elevated platforms and hanging gardens, allowing arboreal animals like monkeys, birds, and sloths to thrive in a three-dimensional space. Each platform would have interconnected bridges made of natural materials, encouraging exploration and social interaction. The gardens would feature a variety of plants that provide food, shelter, and nesting opportunities, creating a vibrant ecosystem in the sky.",
    "**Dynamic Climate Zones**:    - This innovative habitat would include multiple climate zones within a single environment, allowing animals from different ecosystems to coexist. Using advanced climate control technology, specific areas could simulate conditions ranging from tropical rainforests to arid deserts. Animals would have the opportunity to adapt and thrive in various settings, fostering biodiversity and encouraging species interactions that would not typically occur in nature.",
    "**Sensory Enrichment Zones**:    - This habitat would focus on sensory stimulation for animals, incorporating elements that engage sight, sound, smell, and touch. For example, there could be areas with colorful plants that emit pleasant scents, soundscapes featuring natural sounds or animal calls, and textured surfaces for animals to explore. This environment would be designed to promote mental health and well-being, encouraging natural behaviors and social interactions."
