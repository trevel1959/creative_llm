    "**\"The Ethics of Experimentation\"**: As researchers work to develop a vaccine, they may be forced to confront difficult moral dilemmas. For example, they may need to decide whether to conduct human trials on a large scale, potentially putting thousands of people at risk in order to gather the necessary data. Alternatively, they may need to weigh the benefits of the vaccine against the potential risks, such as allergic reactions or long-term side effects.",
    "**\"Vaccine Vulnerability\" - A Supply Chain Nightmare**: The production and distribution of a new vaccine may be hampered by a lack of resources, including raw materials, manufacturing capacity, and trained personnel. This could lead to a shortage of vaccines, making it difficult for those who need them most to access them.",
    "**\"The Social Impact of a New Vaccine\"**: The introduction of a new vaccine may have significant social implications, such as changing the way people interact with each other or altering the dynamics of communities. For example, if the vaccine is highly effective, it may lead to a decrease in social distancing measures, potentially causing a surge in new cases.",
    "**\"The High Cost of a New Vaccine\"**: The development and production of a new vaccine may be extremely expensive, making it inaccessible to many people who need it. This could exacerbate existing health disparities and create a two-tiered system of healthcare, where those who can afford the vaccine have access to it and those who cannot are left behind.",
    "**\"The Risk of Misinformation\"**: As the vaccine nears completion, misinformation and disinformation about its safety and efficacy may spread quickly, potentially causing widespread panic and mistrust. This could lead to a decline in vaccination rates, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity."
