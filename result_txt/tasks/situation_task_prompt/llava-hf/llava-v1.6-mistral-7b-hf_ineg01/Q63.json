    "**Biometric Security**: Biometric security, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, could be used to secure belongings. A device with a biometric sensor could be placed near the door or container, and when the correct biometric information is detected, the door or container would unlock, granting access to the contents inside.",
    "**Smart Locks with Voice Recognition**: Smart locks with voice recognition could be another solution. These locks would be activated by speaking a specific phrase or code, which would then unlock the door or container. This would require a voice recognition system integrated into the locking mechanism.",
    "**Mechanical Combination Lock**: A mechanical combination lock could be used to secure belongings. The combination lock would be set to a unique sequence of numbers or symbols, which would need to be entered correctly to unlock the door or container. This would require a physical dial or keypad to input the combination.",
    "**RFID Tagging System**: An RFID tagging system could be used to secure belongings. Each item or container would be tagged with a unique RFID tag, which could be scanned by a reader to unlock the door or container. This would require an RFID reader and a secure area to store the tags.",
    "**Laser Locking System**: A laser locking system could be an innovative solution. This would involve using a laser beam to activate a locking mechanism. The laser beam would need to be aligned correctly to unlock the door or container, providing a high level of security."
