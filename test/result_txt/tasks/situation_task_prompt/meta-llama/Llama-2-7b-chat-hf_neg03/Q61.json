    "Create a network of pollinator-friendly pathways: With all the flowers gone, it's crucial to create a network of pathways that allow pollinators to move around and reach plants. These pathways could be created using materials like stone, gravel, or even recycled plastic. By creating a network of pathways, pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds can easily move from one plant to another, ensuring effective pollination.",
    "Use artificial pollinators: In a world without flowers, artificial pollinators could be created to mimic the role of flowers in pollination. For instance, small, artificial flowers could be designed to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, while also providing them with the necessary nectar and pollen. These artificial flowers could be placed near plants to ensure effective pollination.",
    "Harness the power of wind pollination: While flowers are the primary source of pollination, wind pollination can also play a significant role. By strategically placing plants with wind-pollination capabilities near each other, it's possible to create a network of plants that can pollinate each other without the need for flowers. This could involve planting species like grasses, wheat, and rice, which are naturally wind-pollinated.",
    "Utilize the help of other animals: While flowers are the primary pollinators, other animals like bats, birds, and even insects can also play a crucial role in pollination. By training or encouraging these animals to pollinate plants, it's possible to ensure effective pollination even without flowers. For instance, bats could be trained to pollinate cacti and agave plants, while birds could be encouraged to pollinate fruit trees.",
    "Develop new plant hybrids: In a world without flowers, it may be possible to develop new plant hybrids that are more resilient to pollination challenges. By cross-breeding plants with different pollination mechanisms, it's possible to create new plants that can pollinate themselves or rely on other pollinators. For instance, scientists could cross-breed plants with wind-pollination capabilities with those that rely on insect pollination, creating a new generation of pollin"
