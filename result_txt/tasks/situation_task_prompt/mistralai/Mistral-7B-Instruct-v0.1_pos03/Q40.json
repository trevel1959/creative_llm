    "Solar panels: If all batteries stopped working, solar panels could be used to power devices. Solar panels can convert sunlight into electricity, which can be used to charge devices. This would require the installation of solar panels on all devices and a portable solar panel to charge them.",
    "Hand-crank generator: Another option would be to use a hand-crank generator to generate electricity. This would require the installation of a hand-crank generator on all devices, and the user would need to turn the crank to generate electricity.",
    "Kinetic energy: Kinetic energy can be harnessed to generate electricity. For example, a kinetic energy converter could be attached to a device to generate electricity from the motion of the device. This would require the installation of a kinetic energy converter on all devices.",
    "Steam turbine: A small steam turbine could be used to generate electricity. This would require the installation of a steam turbine on all devices, and a source of steam such as a boiler or a heat exchanger.",
    "Nuclear power: A small nuclear reactor could be used to generate electricity. This would require the installation of a nuclear reactor on all devices, and the user would need to be trained in nuclear physics and engineering to operate the reactor safely."
