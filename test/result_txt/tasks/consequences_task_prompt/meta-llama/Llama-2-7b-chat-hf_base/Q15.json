    "Global Transportation Overhaul: If the world ran out of oil, transportation as we know it would need to drastically change. Electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would become the primary means of transportation, reducing carbon emissions and reliance on oil. High-speed trains and magnetic levitation trains would also become more prevalent, allowing for faster and more efficient travel. Additionally, cities would need to reorganize their infrastructure to accommodate these new modes of transportation, such as building more charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations.",
    "Renewable Energy Boom: With oil no longer available, the focus would shift to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Governments and private companies would invest heavily in renewable energy infrastructure, leading to a significant increase in the adoption of these technologies. This would not only reduce our reliance on oil but also help combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Agricultural Revolution: The lack of oil would have a profound impact on agriculture, as many traditional farming practices rely heavily on oil-based inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation systems. Farmers would need to adopt new, more sustainable practices, such as organic farming, permaculture, and vertical farming. This could lead to a more diverse and resilient food system, with a greater focus on local and regional production.",
    "Circular Economy: With oil no longer available, the concept of a circular economy would become more important than ever. This approach emphasizes the reuse and recycling of materials, reducing waste and the consumption of new resources. Companies would need to adopt more sustainable business models, such as product-as-a-service rather than product-oriented businesses, and designing products with recyclability and longevity in mind.",
    "Urban Planning Overhaul: Cities would need to be redesigned to accommodate the new transportation modes and energy sources. This could involve denser, more compact urban planning, with a focus on walkability, cycling, and public transportation. Green spaces and parks would become more important for both environmental and social reasons, providing both recreational and mental health benefits. Additionally, cities would need to adapt their infrastructure to accommodate the increased use of"
