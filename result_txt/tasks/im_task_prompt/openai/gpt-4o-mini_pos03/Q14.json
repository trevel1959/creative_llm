    "**Personalized Sleep Coach**: Incorporate AI technology that learns the userâ€™s sleep patterns over time. The clock could provide tailored recommendations for bedtime routines, suggest optimal wake-up times based on sleep cycles, and offer relaxation techniques or meditative sounds to help users fall asleep faster. This would turn the alarm clock into a comprehensive sleep coach.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Aromatherapy**: Equip the alarm clock with a built-in diffuser that releases essential oils at the time of waking. Users could choose scents like citrus for energy or lavender for relaxation. The gentle aroma would enhance the waking experience and help to improve mood and alertness throughout the day.",
    "**Interactive Projection Display**: Instead of a traditional screen, create a clock that projects the time and relevant information (like weather, calendar events, or motivational quotes) onto the ceiling or wall. Users could easily see the time without having to turn over in bed. The projection could also change colors or shapes based on the time of day, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.",
    "**Gradual Sound Increase**: Replace the jarring alarm sound with a gentle crescendo feature. The alarm could start with soft sounds, such as a heartbeat or nature sounds, and gradually increase in volume to simulate a more natural waking process. This would reduce the shock of waking up and help users feel more refreshed.",
    "**Physical Activity Alarm**: Incorporate a feature that requires users to engage in physical activity to turn off the alarm. For instance, the clock could be paired with a small exercise mat or sensor that detects movement. Users might need to do a certain number of jumping jacks or a short yoga pose to silence the alarm, promoting physical activity right from the start of the day."
