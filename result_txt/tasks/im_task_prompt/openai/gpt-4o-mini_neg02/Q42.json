    "**Expandable Design**: Create a suitcase with an expandable design that allows travelers to increase its capacity when needed. This could be achieved through an accordion-style fabric that expands outward, or zippers that can open additional compartments. This feature would be particularly useful for returning home with more items than originally packed.",
    "**Built-in Weight Sensor**: Equip the suitcase with a built-in weight sensor that alerts the user if they are over the weight limit set by airlines. The suitcase could have a digital display on the handle that shows the current weight, helping travelers avoid excess baggage fees and ensuring they pack efficiently.",
    "**Modular Packing System**: Develop a suitcase that includes a modular packing system with detachable compartments. Each compartment could be designed for specific items (e.g., shoes, toiletries, electronics) and could be used independently or as part of the suitcase. This would allow travelers to organize their belongings more efficiently and easily access items without unpacking everything.",
    "**Self-Standing Design**: Create a suitcase with a self-standing design that utilizes retractable legs or a wider base. This would prevent the suitcase from tipping over when not in use, making it easier to pack and unpack, especially in crowded areas like airports or train stations.",
    "**Integrated Privacy Features**: Design a suitcase with integrated privacy features, such as a built-in lock that uses biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) for added security. Additionally, the suitcase could have a noise-canceling compartment that protects sensitive items (like electronics) from being overheard during travel."
