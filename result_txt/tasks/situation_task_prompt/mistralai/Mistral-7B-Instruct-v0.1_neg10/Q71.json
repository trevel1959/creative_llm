    "Use: If the ground is too hard to dig into, we could useiel to soften it. This is a process that involves injectingiel into the soil to break up any compacted areas and make it easier to dig. This method is commonly used in construction, but it could also be used in gardening to create a more workable soil.",
    "Useiel: Another method we could use to soften the soil is to useiel. This is a process that involves breaking up the soil with a tool called a tiller. A tiller is a piece of equipment that has a series of blades that rotate around a central axis. As the blades rotate, they break up the soil and loosen it, making it easier to work with.",
    "Use a soil aerator: Another option we could use to soften the soil is to use a soil aerator. This is a piece of equipment that has hollow spikes that are attached to a drum. As the drum rotates, the spikes poke holes in the soil, which helps to loosen it and improve drainage.",
    "Use a laser level: If the ground is too hard to dig into, we could use a laser level to mark out the areas where we want to plant our garden. This would allow us to dig more accurately and efficiently, without having to constantly measure the depth of the soil.",
    "Use a soil moisture sensor: If the ground is too hard to dig into, we could use a soil moisture sensor to determine the moisture content of the soil. This would allow us to add water to the soil in the areas where it is needed, which could help to soften it and make it easier to work with."
