    "Magnetoreception: A sense that allows humans to detect magnetic fields. Magnetoreception is already present in many animals, such as fish and birds, who use it for navigation. This sense could help humans navigate without relying solely on GPS technology or traditional landmarks, making it particularly useful for individuals who live in areas with poor signage or those who enjoy outdoor activities like hiking or camping.",
    "Tactile depth perception: A sense that allows humans to perceive depth through touch, much like how rats use their whiskers to navigate objects. The ability to perceive depth through touch could be useful for individuals with visual impairments, allowing them to navigate their environments with greater ease and accuracy.",
    "Improved sense of smell: Humans already have a keen sense of smell, but an enhanced sense of smell could have numerous practical applications. For example, it could be used to detect early signs of diseases, such as cancer, or to identify the chemical composition of objects, such as testing for the presence of drugs or toxins.",
    "Ultravision: A sense that allows humans to see ultraviolet light, much like some animals do. This could be useful for a variety of practical applications, such as detecting counterfeit currency or identifying specific plants or animals that aren't visible to the naked eye.",
    "Echolocation: A sense that allows humans to detect objects or obstacles in their environment by emitting sounds and interpreting the echoes that bounce back. This could be useful for individuals with visual impairments, allowing them to navigate their environment with greater ease and accuracy."
