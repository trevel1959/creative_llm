    "Solar panels: Solar panels can be installed on the roof or walls of a home to generate electricity from sunlight. This electricity can then be used to power a heating system that circulates warm air throughout the home.",
    "Geothermal heating: Geothermal heating uses the earth's natural heat to warm a home. This can be achieved by digging a geothermal well that pumps hot water or steam into the home.",
    "Biomass heating: Biomass heating uses organic materials such as wood, agricultural waste, or pellets to generate heat. This can be done using a wood-burning stove or a specialized biomass boiler.",
    "Passive solar heating: Passive solar heating uses the sun's heat to warm a home by designing the home's layout and materials to maximize solar gain. This can include installing large windows on the south-facing walls of the home and using insulation to keep the heat inside.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells can be used to generate electricity and heat from water. This can be done by installing a hydrogen fuel cell system in the home, which can be powered by water from a nearby source such as a river or lake."
