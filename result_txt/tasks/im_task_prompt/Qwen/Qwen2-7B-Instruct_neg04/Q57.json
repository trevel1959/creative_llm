    "**Smart Mousepad**: Create a smart mousepad that not only provides a smooth surface for the computer mouse but also integrates features like touch sensors to control various functions on the computer without the need for keyboard inputs. For example, swiping left or right could navigate through web pages, pinching to zoom in/out on documents, or flicking upwards could open the notification center.",
    "**Gaming Mouse with Haptic Feedback**: Develop a gaming mouse that includes haptic feedback technology. This allows the user to feel vibrations or pulses while gaming, enhancing the sensory experience and providing additional information about in-game events such as hits, deaths, or power-ups. This can significantly improve gameplay and immersion.",
    "**Ergonomic Mouse Stand**: Design an adjustable stand for the computer mouse that promotes better posture and reduces strain on the hand and wrist. The stand could be height-adjustable, allowing it to be positioned at different angles based on the user's preference or the type of work being done (e.g., typing, drawing, gaming). Additionally, it could incorporate features like built-in cooling fans or a small LED light strip for enhanced comfort.",
    "**Wireless Charging Mouse**: Integrate wireless charging capabilities into a computer mouse, enabling users to charge their device simply by placing it on a compatible charging pad. This eliminates the need for cables and keeps the desk clean and clutter-free. The charging system could also include smart battery management to ensure optimal performance and longevity.",
    "**Voice-Commanded Mouse**: Create a mouse that pairs with a dedicated app or software, allowing users to control the mouse and interact with the computer using voice commands. This feature would be particularly beneficial for individuals with motor disabilities, providing an alternative method of input that doesn't require manual movement of the hand or fingers. The app could offer customization options, including gesture recognition and language support for diverse users."
