    "Costs of overhead and startup: Starting a coffee shop involves significant costs for renting a space, purchasing equipment (such as coffee machines, tables, and chairs), and hiring staff. Budgeting for these expenses while maintaining profitability can be challenging, especially in a competitive market where prices may need to be lower to attract customers.",
    "Difficulty in building customer base: A new coffee shop starting out may face challenges in building a loyal customer base from scratch. Without a history and reputation to fall back on, it can be difficult to differentiate one's coffee shop from competitors, and generate word-of-mouth or loyal regulars.",
    "Availability of specialized baristas and staff: As the coffee shop market is highly competitive, attracting and maintaining a skilled and passionate staff may be difficult, as baristas and other staff members may have their pick of jobs. This can lead to problems with turnover, higher salary demands, and difficulties in finding and retaining the right employees.",
    "Difficulty in sourcing high-quality ingredients: A competitive coffee shop will need to source high-quality coffee beans and other ingredients to ensure a good reputation and attract patrons. This may be difficult when competing against established shops that may have contracts with suppliers or well-established brand preferences.",
    "Lack of brand recognition: As a new entry into the competitive market, the coffee shop may struggle to establish its brand recognition and identity, which can be crucial in such a saturated environment. This can make initial sales and retention efforts particularly challenging."
