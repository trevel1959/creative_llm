    "\"Bird's Eye View\": Create a series of art pieces showcasing the speaker's envy through a bird's perspective.

    "\"Envy's Edge\": Create a line of greeting cards that address the emotion of envy in a unique and creative way.

How did you do it?\" The cards could be designed with bold, eye-catching graphics and colors to reflect the emotion of envy."
