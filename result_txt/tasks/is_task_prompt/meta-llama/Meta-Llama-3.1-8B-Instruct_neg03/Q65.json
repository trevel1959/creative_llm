    "\"Time Warp\": A wearable device that, when activated, allows the wearer to pause time for a short duration. The device is shaped like a sleek, futuristic watch and has a single, glowing button on its face. When pressed, the watch emits a soft hum and the surrounding environment appears to freeze in place.

However, the pause is only temporary, and time will resume once the wearer releases the button or the device's battery runs out.",
