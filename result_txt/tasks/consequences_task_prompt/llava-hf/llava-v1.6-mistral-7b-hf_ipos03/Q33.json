    "Food Supply Issues: The food supply would also be impacted, as larger animals would require more food to sustain their increased size. This could lead to overgrazing, depleting resources, and potentially triggering a cascade of food chain imbalances.",
    "Habitat Changes: Larger animals would require more space to move around, which could lead to habitat fragmentation and the displacement of other species that rely on the same ecosystems. Additionally, the altered landscapes could affect the distribution of plant and animal species, leading to a shift in biodiversity.",
    "Human-Animal Interactions: The size difference between humans and animals could also change the dynamics of human-animal interactions. For instance, larger animals might be more aggressive or intimidating, while smaller humans might need to develop new strategies to avoid being bullied or attacked.",
    "New Evolutionary Pathways: The increased size of animals could lead to new evolutionary pathways, as species might adapt to their larger bodies to better navigate their environments. This could result in the emergence of new species or the development of unique characteristics that help them survive and thrive in their new, larger forms.",
    "Cultural and Societal Impacts: The presence of large animals would likely have a significant impact on human culture and society. For example, large animals might be used as symbols of strength or power, and they could play a role in religious or mythological narratives."
