    "Snoozelet: A smart alarm clock that allows users to set custom snooze times and durations. The device uses facial recognition technology to identify the user and adjust the snooze time accordingly. For example, if the user is a light sleeper, the device can set a shorter snooze time to ensure they wake up feeling refreshed.",
    "DreamWeaver: An alarm clock that harnesses the power of dreams to wake users up. The device uses a built-in sleep tracker to monitor the user's sleep patterns and dreams.

    "Sunrise Simulator: An alarm clock that simulates a sunrise to help users wake up more naturally. The device gradually brightens the room, simulating the natural light of a sunrise, to help the user's body adjust to the wake-up time.
