    "Glow-in-the-Dark Candles: Create candles that emit a soft, eerie glow in the dark. This can be achieved by adding glow-in-the-dark paint or pigment to the wax. The glow can be adjusted by adding different concentrations of the pigment, and the candles can be made in various colors to create different moods and atmospheres.",
    "Scented Candles with a Twist: Develop candles that release a unique scent when the flame is blown out. For example, a lavender scent could be released when the flame is extinguished, creating a calming and relaxing atmosphere. This can be achieved by adding essential oils or fragrances to the wax before pouring it into the candle holder.",
    "Color-Changing Candles: Create candles that change color as they burn. This can be achieved by adding color-changing pigments to the wax, which will shift from one color to another as the candle burns. For example, a candle could start as a soft blue, then transition to a vibrant red, and finally settle on a warm orange.",
    "Interactive Candles: Design candles that react to sound or movement. For example, a candle could be programmed to light up when a certain sound is detected, such as a ringing phone or a knock on the door. This can be achieved by using sensors and microcontrollers to detect and respond to sound waves.",
    "Customizable Candles: Create candles that can be customized to fit a customer's preferences. For example, customers could be able to choose the scent, color, and size of their candle, as well as the design of the candle holder. This can be achieved by using a customization platform that allows customers to input their preferences and receive a personalized candle."
