    "Use multifunctional furniture: In a tiny house, every square inch is valuable. Therefore, it's important to use furniture that serves multiple purposes. For example, a folding table can also be used as a desk, a sofa can double as a bed, and a storage unit can also be used as a seating area.",
    "Maximize natural light: Natural light can make a small space feel larger and more inviting. Therefore, it's important to incorporate large windows or skylights into the design of the tiny house.",
    "Use vertical space: In a tiny house, vertical space is just as valuable as horizontal space. Therefore, it's important to use shelving, hooks, and other vertical organizers to maximize storage space.",
    "Choose the right materials: Lightweight and durable materials such as bamboo, cork, and reclaimed wood are ideal for tiny houses. These materials are also eco-friendly and can help reduce the environmental impact of the tiny house.",
    "Incorporate technology: Technology can be used to make a tiny house more functional and comfortable. For example, a small television or projector can be used for entertainment, and a portable stove or grill can be used for cooking."
