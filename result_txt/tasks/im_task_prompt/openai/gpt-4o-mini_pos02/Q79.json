    "**Adjustable Size Hanger**:    Design a hanger that can be adjusted in width and height to accommodate different clothing types, from small children’s clothes to oversized garments. This would eliminate the need for multiple hangers and reduce clutter. The mechanism could be a simple sliding or folding design that locks into place, making it easy to switch sizes.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hanger**:    Develop a multi-functional hanger that includes built-in clips for pants or skirts, a rotating hook for easy access, and even a small fold-out shelf for accessories like scarves or ties. This would provide a complete solution for organizing outfits in one place, reducing the need for multiple types of hangers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Biodegradable Materials**:    Create hangers made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that break down over time, reducing plastic waste in landfills. These hangers could be marketed as part of a larger eco-conscious clothing line, appealing to environmentally aware consumers. Additionally, the design could be aesthetically pleasing, encouraging users to showcase them.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in Dehumidifier**:    Incorporate a small, rechargeable dehumidifier into the hanger design to prevent moisture buildup in closets. This would help protect clothes from mold and mildew, especially in humid climates. The dehumidifier could be discreetly integrated into the hanger’s structure, with a small LED indicator to show when it needs recharging.",
    "**Customizable Hanger with Interchangeable Covers**:    Introduce a hanger that allows users to change its appearance with interchangeable covers made from different fabrics or materials. This would enable users to match their hangers with their room decor or seasonal themes. The covers could be easily slipped on and off, making it a fun way to personalize a wardrobe."
