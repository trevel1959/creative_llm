    "**Physical Notebooks and Handwritten Notes**: In a world without computers, I would rely on physical notebooks and handwritten notes to record my work and studies. I would use a combination of bullet points, diagrams, and illustrations to organize my thoughts and ideas. This method would allow me to maintain a physical record of my progress and reflect on my work in a tactile and engaging way. I would also use different colored pens and highlighters to categorize and prioritize my notes, making it easier to review and reference later.",
    "**Collaborative Note-Taking with Friends**: If all computers crashed, I would turn to my friends and classmates for help. We would work together to create a shared notebook or binder where we would record and share our notes, ideas, and insights. This collaborative approach would foster a sense of community and teamwork, as we would rely on each other's strengths and expertise to fill in the gaps. We would also use our collective knowledge to cross-check and verify information, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our notes.",
    "**Audio Recordings and Voice Notes**: In the absence of computers, I would use audio recorders and voice notes to capture and store my thoughts, ideas, and lectures. I would record lectures, meetings, and discussions, and then transcribe the recordings by hand or use a digital audio player to replay and review the content. This method would allow me to access my notes and ideas on the go, and I could also use the recordings to create study guides and review materials.",
    "**Visual Storytelling with Drawings and Comics**: If computers disappeared, I would turn to visual storytelling as a means of recording and communicating my ideas. I would use a combination of drawings, comics, and illustrations to convey complex concepts and information in a engaging and accessible way. This method would allow me to think creatively and visually, and I could use different art styles and techniques to convey different emotions and ideas.",
    "**Oral Tradition and Storytelling**: In a world without computers, I would rely on oral tradition and storytelling to pass on knowledge and information. I would use spoken word, storytelling, and performance to convey complex ideas and concepts, and I would also use music, poetry, and other forms of artistic expression to make the information more engaging and memorable. This method would allow me to connect with others on a deeper level, and I could use the oral tradition to preserve and share knowledge across generations. [/INST] "
