    "**Subterra**: An underground sport that takes place in a network of tunnels and caverns. Players would use specialized equipment, such as grappling hooks and pulleys, to navigate the tunnels and reach hidden checkpoints.

Players would have to rely on their other senses, such as hearing and touch, to navigate the course.",
