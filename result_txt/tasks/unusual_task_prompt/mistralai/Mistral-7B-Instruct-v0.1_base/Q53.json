    "**Smart Keyboard:** A keyboard that integrates with your smartphone, allowing you to control your phone with your fingers while typing on the keyboard. The keyboard would have buttons and touchscreens that correspond to the buttons and touchscreens on your phone, so you can easily switch between typing and controlling your phone. This would be especially useful for people who use their phone frequently while typing, such as programmers or graphic designers.",
    "**Touchless Keyboard:** A keyboard that allows you to type without physically touching any keys. Instead, you would use sensors that track your hand movements and translate them into keystrokes. This would be especially useful for people with disabilities or for people who are allergic to dust or germs, as it would eliminate the need to touch the keys.",
    "**Keyboard with built-in display:** A keyboard that has a built-in display, allowing you to see what you are typing without having to look away from the keyboard. This would be especially useful for programmers or graphic designers who need to keep their eyes on the keyboard while typing.",
    "**Keyboard with built-in speakers:** A keyboard that has built-in speakers, allowing you to listen to music or other audio while you type. This would be especially useful for people who like to listen to music while they work, but don't want to use headphones.",
    "**Keyboard with built-in microphone:** A keyboard that has a built-in microphone, allowing you to make phone calls or video calls while you type. This would be especially useful for people who work from home and need to communicate with colleagues or clients often."
