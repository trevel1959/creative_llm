    "**Scented Drawer Liners**: Instead of traditional drawer liners, place small candles or pieces of wax in your drawers. As the wax melts slightly from the warmth, it will release a pleasant fragrance, keeping your clothes smelling fresh. Choose scents that complement your wardrobe, like lavender for calming or citrus for a refreshing feel.",
    "**DIY Waterproof Matches**: If you need waterproof matches, you can dip wooden matchsticks in melted candle wax. Once the wax hardens, these matches can withstand moisture, making them perfect for camping or outdoor activities. Just be sure to let them dry completely before storing them.",
    "**Furniture Scratch Repair**: Use a candle to fill in scratches on wooden furniture. Choose a candle that matches the wood color, and gently rub the candle over the scratch. The wax will fill in the gap and can help restore the furnitureâ€™s appearance. For added effect, you can buff the area with a soft cloth to blend it in seamlessly.",
    "**DIY Lip Balm**: If you have a scented candle that you no longer wish to burn, you can repurpose it into a moisturizing lip balm. Melt the leftover wax and mix it with a carrier oil (like coconut or almond oil) and a few drops of essential oil for flavor. Pour the mixture into small containers and let it solidify for a personalized lip balm.",
    "**Mood Lighting in a Jar**: Create a unique centerpiece by placing a candle inside a mason jar filled with sand, pebbles, or seashells. This not only provides mood lighting but also adds a decorative touch to your space. The jar will protect the flame from wind if used outdoors, and the light will reflect beautifully off the glass."
