    "No food would be ever be stuck into another food in such an intimate, passionate manner, save a wafflle iron. No other appliance lets me make my food into other food. Waffle irons let my food play with mine. Waffle irons let my food play with other food!",
    "I could have breakfast ready for myself and my dog Sprocket!",
    "Waffle sandwiches.",
    "My waffle iron is a black cast iron in the shape of a cross. So is your mother's.",
    "I could waffle an ice luge."
