    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and the influx of tourists can have a detrimental effect on the local environment. Issues such as increased waste, air pollution, and habitat disruption may arise. To address this, the organizing committee could implement strict sustainability guidelines, such as using renewable energy sources for venues, ensuring waste is minimized and recycled, and preserving local ecosystems through responsible construction practices.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Large-scale events like the Olympics can be prime targets for security threats, including terrorism and civil unrest. The challenge is to ensure the safety of athletes, spectators, and staff without creating an atmosphere of fear. A proactive approach would involve collaborating with local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to develop a comprehensive security plan, including surveillance, crowd management strategies, and emergency response protocols.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can boost the local economy, it can also exacerbate economic inequalities. Local businesses may struggle to compete with multinational corporations that sponsor events or provide services. To counter this, the organizing committee could prioritize local vendors and small businesses in the supply chain, offering them opportunities to showcase their products and services during the games.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics bring together diverse cultures, which can lead to misunderstandings or cultural appropriation. For example, if the host country fails to respect the traditions of participating nations, it can lead to diplomatic tensions. To foster cultural sensitivity, the organizing committee should engage with local communities and cultural representatives to ensure that ceremonies, events, and promotions are inclusive and respectful of all cultures involved.",
    "**Athlete Well-being**: The pressure of competition can lead to mental health issues among athletes, such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, the physical toll of intense training and competition can result in injuries. To promote athlete well-being, the organizing committee could provide comprehensive mental health resources, including counseling services and relaxation areas, as well as ensure that medical staff are readily available to address injuries promptly."
