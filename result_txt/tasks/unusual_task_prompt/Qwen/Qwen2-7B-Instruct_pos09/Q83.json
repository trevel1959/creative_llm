    "**Innovative Carpet Design for Accessibility:** Create a line of carpets specifically designed for people with disabilities. The carpet can have raised patterns or textures that guide individuals with visual impairments along specific paths or provide tactile feedback in dangerous areas like stairs. The design could also include Braille elements to further enhance accessibility.",
    "**Sustainable Carpet Recycling Program:** Develop a program that collects old and worn-out carpets from homes and businesses, then repurposes them into new, eco-friendly materials. This could involve recycling the fibers into insulation, textiles for clothing, or even creating new carpet tiles. This not only reduces waste but also provides an innovative solution for sustainable living.",
    "**Interactive Educational Carpet for Children:** Design carpets that serve as interactive learning tools for children. These carpets could be printed with maps, puzzles, or educational games that engage kids as they walk or play on them. For example, a world map carpet where each continent is a different color and children learn about geography by following the colors.",
    "**Smart Home Integration with Carpets:** Integrate carpets with smart home technology, such as motion sensors or temperature controls. The carpets could automatically adjust their heating or cooling based on the presence of individuals, helping save energy and enhance comfort. Additionally, they could detect when a person is lying down and adjust the firmness accordingly.",
    "**Therapeutic Carpet for Mental Health:** Develop a line of carpets infused with natural scents or microelements that promote relaxation and mental well-being. For instance, lavender-infused carpets for bedrooms, or eucalyptus-scented carpets for workout areas. These carpets could be used in hospitals, wellness centers, or even homes to create a calming environment that promotes healing and stress relief."
