    "**Self-Cleaning Cutting Board**: Imagine a cutting board that not only serves as a surface for food preparation but also has built-in UV-C light technology that sanitizes itself after use. Users would simply place the board in a designated spot, and with the press of a button, it would activate a cleaning cycle that eliminates bacteria and odors. This gadget would promote hygiene in the kitchen and save time on manual cleaning.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Spoon**: This innovative spoon would allow users to infuse flavors directly into their dishes while cooking.

The spoon could also have an adjustable release mechanism, allowing cooks to control the intensity of the flavor infusion. This gadget would elevate the cooking experience and make it easier to experiment with new flavors.",
    "**Multi-Function Pan**: A pan that combines several cooking methods into one device—sautéing, steaming, and frying.

For instance, a steaming tray could be placed above the pan for steaming vegetables while simultaneously sautéing proteins below. This would save space in the kitchen and encourage healthier cooking by making it easier to prepare balanced meals.",
    "**Magnetic Spice Rack**: This gadget would consist of a series of magnetic spice containers that can be easily attached to the side of the refrigerator or any magnetic surface. Each container would have a clear window to see the spice inside, and a unique pouring mechanism to control the amount dispensed. This design would save counter space, keep spices fresh, and make it easier to access and organize spices while cooking.",
    "**Interactive Meal Planner**: A kitchen gadget that functions as a digital meal planner, allowing users to input dietary preferences, restrictions, and ingredients on hand. It would generate a week’s worth of meal plans and create a shopping list based on what is needed. The device could also sync with smart appliances, suggesting cooking times and methods for each meal. This would help busy individuals plan their meals efficiently and reduce food waste."
