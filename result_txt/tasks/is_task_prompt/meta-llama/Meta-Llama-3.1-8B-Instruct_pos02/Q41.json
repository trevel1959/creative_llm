    "**The Whale's Memory**: This experiential art piece is a large, translucent sculpture of a whale's body, filled with glowing orbs that represent memories. As visitors approach, the orbs begin to glow brighter, releasing a fragrance or scent that corresponds to the memory.

The experience invites visitors to reflect on their own memories and the connections they make with the natural world.",
