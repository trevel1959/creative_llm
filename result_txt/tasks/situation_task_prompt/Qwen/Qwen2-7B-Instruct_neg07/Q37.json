    "**Inverted Human-Powered Wheelchair**: Design a wheelchair that operates in reverse by using a system of gears or pulleys to move backward. The user can pedal in the opposite direction, allowing them to navigate backward without physically moving forward.",
    "**Glide Board with Reverse Propulsion**: Create a longboard with an attached motor and propellers underneath it. The propellers would spin in reverse, providing backward thrust. The board would be controlled by the rider's weight distribution and steering, enabling smooth backward movement.",
    "**Reverse-Pedaling Bicycles**: Develop a specialized bicycle frame where the pedals are placed on the back of the bike, allowing for backward pedaling. This would require new pedal mechanisms and possibly a different seat position, but it would allow for efficient backward travel.",
    "**Tethered Inverted Scooter**: Design a scooter that is tethered to a motorized base. The scooter itself has a reverse gear, and when the rider moves the handlebars backward, the motorized base provides the necessary force to propel the scooter backward. This setup ensures safety and stability while still offering mobility in reverse.",
    "**Reversing Robotic Suit**: Create a robotic exosuit that can be worn over normal clothing. The suit has motors integrated into the legs and feet, which can be programmed to move backward. The suit would need sensors to ensure proper balance and coordination during backward movement. This solution would offer a high level of control and efficiency in navigating backward."
