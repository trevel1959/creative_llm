    "Multi-functional furniture: Designing a tiny house that utilizes multi-functional furniture pieces is a great way to maximize space. For example, a sofa bed can serve as both a seating area and a sleeping space. A table with built-in storage can also be used as a desk or a dining table.",
    "Vertical gardens: Adding vertical gardens to the tiny house can not only add visual appeal but also provide a natural source of light and air. This can be achieved by installing hanging planters or using walls as a canvas for a green wall.",
    "Smart technology: Incorporating smart technology such as smart lighting, thermostats, and security systems can make the tiny house more functional and efficient.",
    "Solar panels: Installing solar panels on the roof of the tiny house can provide a sustainable source of energy for the house.",
