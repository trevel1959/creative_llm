    "Use a Rainwater Harvesting System: Set up a rainwater harvesting system to collect and store rainwater for irrigation purposes. This can be done by installing a roof-based rainwater harvesting system, which collects rainwater and stores it in a tank for later use. The water can then be used to water plants, gardens, and other areas where irrigation is necessary.",
    "Use a Hydroponic System: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This method can be used to grow plants without the need for rainwater. A hydroponic system can be set up indoors or outdoors and can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs.",
    "Create a Man-Made Lake: If all rain stopped, a man-made lake could be created to provide a source of water for irrigation. This could be done by digging a large hole in the ground and filling it with water from a nearby source, such as a river or lake. The lake could then be used to irrigate plants and crops.",
    "Use Solar-Powered Irrigation: Solar-powered irrigation systems use the energy from the sun to pump water from a source, such as a well or a nearby water source, to irrigate plants. These systems are energy-efficient and can be used to water plants even during periods of little to no rainfall.",
    "Use a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) System: NFT is a method of hydroponics that uses a film of nutrient-rich water to feed plants. This method can be used to grow plants without the need for rainwater. The nutrient film is pumped through a series of tubes, providing plants with a constant supply of nutrients, and the water is then recirculated back to the beginning of the system."
