    "Build a desalination plant: A desalination plant uses advanced technology to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it suitable for drinking. This could be an effective solution for obtaining clean drinking water in areas with access to the ocean or a large saltwater lake.",
    "Create a water filtration system: A water filtration system uses various filters to remove impurities from water, such as bacteria, viruses, and sediment. These systems can be designed to be portable and easy to use, making it possible to purify water in remote areas or during emergencies.",
    "Harness the power of plants: Certain plants, such as the Moringa tree, have natural water purification abilities. By using these plants in a water filtration system, it could be possible to create a sustainable and eco-friendly way to obtain clean drinking water.",
    "Develop a water-harvesting system: A water-harvesting system collects and stores rainwater for use during times of drought or water scarcity. This could be especially useful in areas with frequent rainfall but poor water infrastructure.",
    "Create a reverse osmosis system: A reverse osmosis system uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, removing impurities and contaminants. This system could be used to purify water from any source, including groundwater, surface water, or even wastewater."
