    "Gravity Energy: This new type of energy would be based on the fundamental force of gravity. It would harness the power of gravity to generate electricity, using massive gravitational fields to create a perpetual motion machine. The energy would be clean, sustainable, and virtually unlimited, as it would not produce any waste or emissions.",
    "Quantum Flux Energy: This energy source would tap into the quantum realm, manipulating the flux of particles and antiparticles to generate power. By harnessing the energy of the quantum vacuum, this technology would be able to produce energy without any physical input, making it completely sustainable and potentially unlimited.",
    "Solar Wind Energy: This innovative energy source would utilize the immense power of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the sun. By capturing and harnessing the solar wind, this technology could generate electricity without any environmental impact, as it would not produce any emissions or waste.",
    "Resonance Energy: This energy source would rely on the phenomenon of resonance, where two or more objects vibrate in harmony to generate energy. By creating a network of resonant objects, this technology could produce a sustainable and continuous flow of energy, with the potential to power entire cities.",
    "Entropic Energy: This energy source would tap into the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, harnessing the energy of entropy to generate power. By exploiting the natural tendency of systems to move towards disorder, this technology could produce energy with zero waste or emissions, making it a truly sustainable and efficient source of power."
