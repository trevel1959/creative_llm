    "Old-school Library Research: In the event of an internet server crash, one could resort to traditional library research methods. Visit local libraries and access their vast collections of books, journals, and other publications. The knowledge and information contained within the pages of these physical texts would still be available, providing a wealth of information on various topics.",
    "Personal Archives: Individuals could rely on their personal archives, which could include printed copies of important documents, photographs, and other paper-based materials. These archives could provide a wealth of information on family history, personal experiences, and other topics of interest.",
    "Community Knowledge Sharing: In the absence of internet servers, communities could come together to share knowledge and information. Neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and other community events could be used to exchange ideas and learn from one another.",
