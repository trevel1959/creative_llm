    "**Storytelling Circles**: Without toys, children could gather in circles to share stories. They could take turns adding to a collective narrative, using their imaginations to build on each other's ideas. This could be enhanced by using costumes made from household items, such as old clothes or fabric scraps, to represent characters in their stories.",
    "**Shadow Play**: Children could utilize the sunlight or a flashlight to create shadow puppets on walls. They could use their hands or cut-out shapes from cardboard to form different characters and enact plays or stories. This activity would not only be fun but would also teach them about light and shadow.",
    "**DIY Games**: Children could invent their own games using common household items. For example, they might use a roll of tape to create a target game on the floor, or stack empty cans to create a bowling alley. They could even design board games using paper and markers, making their own rules and objectives.",
    "**Imaginative Role-Playing**: Children could engage in role-playing scenarios based on their surroundings. For instance, they might pretend to be chefs in a kitchen, doctors in a clinic, or explorers in the wild. By using their environment and each otherâ€™s creativity, they could invent elaborate games that mimic real-life experiences.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: In the absence of toys, children could turn to art as a primary form of play. They could gather materials like leaves, rocks, and paper to create collages, sculptures, or paintings. This would allow them to express their feelings and ideas creatively, fostering both artistic skills and emotional intelligence."
