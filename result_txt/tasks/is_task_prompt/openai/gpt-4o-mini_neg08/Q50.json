    "In a quiet village, a group of mice discovered a hidden talent: they could sing. Every night, they gathered under the moonlight, their voices weaving a magical melody that echoed through the fields. One evening, a weary traveler stumbled upon their concert and was enchanted. He spread the word, and soon, animals from far and wide came to listen. The mice became famous, their songs bringing joy and unity to the village. They taught everyone that even the smallest creatures could create the most beautiful music. From that day on, the village celebrated an annual festival in honor of the singing mice.",
