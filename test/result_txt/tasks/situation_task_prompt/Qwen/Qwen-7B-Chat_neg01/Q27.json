    "Build a solar-powered greenhouse: Using solar panels to harness energy from the sun, you could build a greenhouse that would act as both a source of heat during cold weather and a natural cooling system during hot weather. The greenhouse could be equipped with fans or other ventilation systems to circulate air and help regulate temperature.",
    "Create a passive heating system using rocks: By placing rocks in strategic locations around your home, you could create a simple but effective passive heating system. During cold weather, the rocks would absorb heat from the sun and slowly release it throughout the day, providing warmth without requiring any electricity.",
    "Use insulation to keep warm: If you don't have access to traditional heating sources, you can use insulation to keep your home warm. Insulation can be added to walls, floors, and ceilings to reduce heat loss and keep the interior of your home warm.",
    "Build a fire pit outside: A fire pit is a great way to stay warm on cold nights. You can build one outside your home using materials like stone, brick, or concrete. Once built, you can use wood or other fuel sources to keep the fire going and provide warmth.",
    "Use a portable stove: If you need to cook food while also staying warm, consider using a portable stove. There are many different types of portable stoves available, ranging from small camping stoves to larger, more powerful models. With a portable stove, you can cook meals and stay warm at the same time."
