    "Make a fire escape plan: The first step to protecting your home from a fire is to create a fire escape plan. This plan should include at least two ways out of each room in your home, and a designated meeting spot outside where everyone can gather once they've escaped. Make sure to practice the plan with your family so that everyone knows what to do in case of a fire.",
    "Install fire-resistant windows: If fire-fighting equipment is unavailable, you'll want to take steps to make your home more fire-resistant. Installing fire-resistant windows can help to slow the spread of flames and give you more time to escape. These windows are made with special materials that can withstand high temperatures and won't shatter easily, providing an extra layer of protection.",
    "Create a fire-resistant barrier: Another option is to create a fire-resistant barrier around your home. This can be done by filling any gaps between your home and neighboring buildings with a fire-resistant material, such as fireproof caulk or sealant. This will help to slow the spread of flames and give you more time to escape.",
    "Use a fire pit: In some cases, a fire pit can actually be a useful tool in protecting your home from a fire. By creating a fire pit in your backyard, you can contain any small fires that may start nearby and prevent them from spreading to your home. Just be sure to keep the fire pit at least 10 feet away from any structures and to properly extinguish it before leaving it unattended.",
    "Install a sprinkler system: While fire-fighting equipment may not be available, a sprinkler system can still provide some protection against fires. A sprinkler system can be installed in your home and will automatically spray water to extinguish any fires that may start. This can help to slow the spread of flames and give you more time to escape."
