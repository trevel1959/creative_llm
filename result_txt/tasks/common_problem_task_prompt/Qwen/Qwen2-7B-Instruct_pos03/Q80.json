    "**Eco-Friendly Venue Selection**: Choose a venue that supports sustainable practices. This could be a nature reserve, botanical garden, or any outdoor space that prioritizes minimal environmental impact. The venue should also offer waste reduction services such as composting, recycling, and water conservation. For indoor weddings, consider venues that have energy-efficient lighting, heating, and cooling systems.",
    "**Sustainable Invitations**: Instead of traditional paper invitations, opt for digital options or use recycled paper. You can also incorporate eco-friendly materials like hemp, bamboo, or wheat paper. Encourage guests to RSVP online to reduce paper waste further.",
    "**Seasonal & Local Food Menu**: Sourcing locally grown, seasonal produce not only supports local farmers but also reduces carbon emissions from transportation. Choose vegetarian or vegan options to minimize the carbon footprint even further. Serve food on reusable plates, glasses, and utensils to avoid single-use plastics.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decorations**: Use biodegradable decorations like silk flowers, potted plants, or natural elements such as wood, stones, and driftwood. Avoid helium balloons as they contribute to pollution and consider using LED lights instead of traditional bulbs for their energy efficiency.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk by providing information about nearby transport options and perhaps arranging shuttle services if needed. You could also consider renting bicycles for guests to use during the event or setting up a charging station for electric vehicles. "
