    "Safety concerns: High-rise buildings pose unique safety challenges. Workers must be trained and equipped to handle the risks associated with working at great heights, such as falls and equipment failures. The building must also be designed with safety features such as fire escapes, sprinkler systems, and emergency exits to ensure the safety of occupants in case of an emergency.",
    "Construction delays: High-rise buildings often require specialized equipment and expertise, which can lead to delays in construction. In addition, unforeseen issues such as weather conditions or material shortages can also cause delays.",
    "Noise and air pollution: The construction process for a high-rise building can be noisy and generate a significant amount of dust and debris, which can affect the quality of life for nearby residents and businesses.",
    "Cost overruns: High-rise buildings can be expensive to construct, and cost overruns can occur due to unexpected issues or changes in the design.",
    "Environmental impact: The construction of a high-rise building can have a significant impact on the environment, including the consumption of resources, the production of waste, and the disruption of local ecosystems."
