    "**Biometric Authentication**: Incorporate biometric sensors such as fingerprint or facial recognition to enhance security. This feature would allow only authorized users to disarm the alarm system, preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, a temporary access code could be generated for guests or service personnel that expires after a set time.",
    "**Home Integration System**: Create a seamless integration with other smart home devices. The alarm system could communicate with smart locks, cameras, and lights to create a comprehensive security network. For example, if an alarm is triggered, the system could automatically turn on exterior lights and lock doors, making the home less appealing to intruders.",
    "**Emergency Response Feature**: Include a built-in emergency response button that can alert local authorities or emergency contacts with the push of a button. This feature could be particularly useful in situations where the user feels threatened and cannot speak freely. It could also send a location ping to ensure help arrives quickly.",
    "**Personalized Alerts and Notifications**: Develop a customizable notification system that allows users to choose how they receive alerts. Options could include text messages, app notifications, or even voice alerts through smart speakers. Users could set different notification preferences for different types of alerts, ensuring they only receive important information in the manner they prefer.",
    "**Integrated Environmental Sensors**: Add sensors for smoke, carbon monoxide, and water leaks to the alarm system. This would transform the device into a multi-functional safety system, alerting users not only to security breaches but also to potential environmental hazards in the home. Notifications could be sent to the userâ€™s phone, and emergency services could be contacted automatically in critical situations."
