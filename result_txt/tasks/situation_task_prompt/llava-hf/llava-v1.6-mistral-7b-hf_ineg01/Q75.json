    "Hydrogen-powered cars: Hydrogen-powered cars use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which can then be used to power the vehicle's electric motor. Hydrogen can be produced from water through electrolysis, making it a renewable resource.",
    "Electric-powered cars: Electric cars use batteries to store electricity, which can then be used to power the vehicle's electric motor. As the demand for electric cars increases, the development of more efficient and longer-lasting batteries will become increasingly important.",
    "Bio-powered cars: Bio-powered cars use biomass, such as plant matter or agricultural waste, to produce ethanol or other biofuels. These fuels can then be used to power internal combustion engines or fuel cells, providing an alternative to oil-based fuels.",
    "Maglev trains: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to float above the tracks, eliminating the need for traditional wheels and tracks. This would allow for more efficient and faster transportation, without relying on oil.",
    "Wind-powered cars: Wind-powered cars use wind turbines to convert wind energy into electricity, which can then be used to power the vehicle's electric motor. This would be a sustainable and renewable alternative to oil-based fuels."
