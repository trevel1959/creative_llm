    "**Soap-free Water Purification System**: Develop a device that uses advanced nanotechnology to break down and remove dirt, grime, and bacteria from water, making it safe for drinking and cleaning purposes. This system would utilize UV light, electrolysis, or other non-chemical methods to purify water, eliminating the need for soap or cleaning products.",
    "**Microbe-based Cleaning Solutions**: Discover and cultivate microorganisms that can safely and effectively break down organic matter, eliminating the need for soap or chemical cleaners. These microbes could be applied directly to surfaces or used in a solution to clean and disinfect. This approach would also provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional cleaning products.",
    "**Air-based Cleaning Technology**: Design a system that utilizes air pressure and airflow to dislodge and remove dirt, dust, and other particles from surfaces. This technology could be applied in various settings, from households to industrial facilities, providing a soap-free and chemical-free cleaning solution.",
    "**Solar-powered Sanitization**: Develop a device that harnesses solar energy to produce a concentrated beam of UV light, capable of killing bacteria and other microorganisms on surfaces. This technology would be particularly useful for outdoor cleaning and disinfection, providing a soap-free and chemical-free solution for maintaining hygiene in public spaces.",
    "**Bioluminescent Cleaning Agents**: Create a line of bioluminescent cleaning agents that use living organisms to break down and remove dirt, grime, and other substances from surfaces. These agents would be safe for use on various materials, including skin, and would provide a unique, non-toxic, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional cleaning products. The bioluminescent properties would also make it easier to detect and monitor the effectiveness of the cleaning process. "
