    "Vitamin-rich algae farming: Algae are a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and iron. With the disappearance of fruits and vegetables, algae farming could become a viable alternative for obtaining these essential nutrients. Algae can be grown in controlled environments, such as indoor farms or even in large-scale outdoor ponds, using a variety of techniques, including photobioreactors or open-pond systems.",
    "Insect-based nutrition: Insects are a highly nutritious and sustainable source of protein and other essential nutrients. Mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers are already being farmed for human consumption in some parts of the world. With the loss of fruits and vegetables, insect-based nutrition could become a more prominent part of our diets, providing a valuable source of essential vitamins and minerals.",
    "Lab-grown foods: With the advancement of biotechnology, it is now possible to grow food in laboratories using cell cultures. This method allows for the production of a wide range of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and even meat. By using cell cultures, it is possible to produce food that is identical to natural food, but without the need for soil, sunlight, or other natural resources.
