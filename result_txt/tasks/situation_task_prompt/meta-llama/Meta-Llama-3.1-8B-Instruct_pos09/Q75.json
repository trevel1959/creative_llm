    "**Solar-Powered Roadways**: Develop a network of solar panels integrated into the road surface, allowing vehicles to generate electricity as they drive. This would not only power vehicles but also provide a sustainable source of energy for homes and businesses.",
    "**Advanced Biofuels**: Research and develop new biofuels from non-food sources like algae, agricultural waste, or even plastic waste. These biofuels could be used in existing engines with minimal modifications, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure**: Rapidly expand and upgrade the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs). This would enable widespread adoption of EVs, which could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology**: Invest in the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology, which could power vehicles with zero emissions. This would require the creation of a hydrogen infrastructure, including production, storage, and distribution facilities.",
    "**Maglev Transportation**: Develop a maglev transportation system, which uses magnetic levitation to propel vehicles at high speeds, reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency. This could be a game-changer for long-distance travel, making it faster, cleaner, and more sustainable."
