    "**Genetically Modified Crop Production**: Scientists could work on creating genetically modified crops that are rich in essential nutrients. These crops could be designed to grow in various climates and conditions, ensuring a consistent supply of vitamins and minerals even in the absence of fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Aquaponics Farming**: Aquaponics farming involves growing plants in water, using the waste produced by fish to fertilize the plants. This method could be used to grow nutrient-rich plants, which could then be processed into supplements. This would be a sustainable and efficient way to produce vitamins and minerals without relying on traditional farming methods.",
    "**Synthetic Foods**: Companies could develop synthetic foods that are specifically designed to provide all the necessary vitamins and minerals. These foods would be produced in a controlled environment, ensuring a consistent and reliable supply of essential nutrients.",
    "**Vertical Farming**: Vertical farming involves growing plants in vertically stacked, climate-controlled environments. This method could be used to grow a variety of nutrient-rich plants, which could then be processed into supplements. Vertical farming would be particularly useful in areas where traditional farming methods are not feasible.",
    "**Nutrient Recycling**: Nutrient recycling involves breaking down food waste into its individual components and then reusing those components to grow new plants. This method could be used to produce nutrient-rich plants that can be processed into supplements. This would be an environmentally friendly way to obtain essential vitamins and minerals."
