    "**Emergency Medical Supplies**: Balloons can be filled with medical-grade helium and used as makeshift floatation devices in emergency situations, such as a boat or airplane crash in water. The buoyancy of the helium would help to keep the balloon and its occupants afloat until help arrives.",
    "**Balloon-Powered Generators**: By using the inflation process to generate electricity, balloons can be repurposed into small-scale generators for charging electronic devices or powering small appliances. This could be particularly useful in off-grid situations or during natural disasters.",
    "**Balloon-Based Sustainable Transportation**: By linking multiple balloons together and using them to generate lift, a balloon-based transportation system could be developed. This would be a lightweight, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional vehicles, particularly in urban environments.",
    "**Balloon-Based Music Instruments**: Balloons can be used to create unique musical instruments by attaching them to tubes or pipes and connecting them to a resonating chamber. The balloons can be inflated and deflated to produce different pitches and sounds, creating a new form of music that is both experimental and engaging.",
    "**Balloon-Based Cleaning System**: Balloons can be used to collect and remove debris, such as trash or litter, from hard-to-reach areas like gutters, storm drains, or under bridges. By attaching a balloon to a pole or long handle, the balloon can be inflated and used to scoop up and lift debris."
