    "**Emergency Flashlight**: Incorporate an emergency flashlight that is bright enough to be seen from a distance, which can be particularly useful in situations where visibility is critical, such as during search and rescue operations.",
    "**Multifunctional Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that can be used as a multi-tool, including a knife, a screwdriver, and other useful tools. This would be a practical and space-saving solution for those who need to carry multiple tools but don't want to carry a separate toolkit.",
    "**LED Flashlight**: Replace the bulb with LED lights, which are more energy-efficient and longer-lasting than traditional flashlight bulbs. This would not only save users money on replacement bulbs but also reduce the environmental impact of disposing of them.",
    "**Hands-Free Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that can be worn on the head or attached to clothing, allowing users to keep their hands free while using the flashlight. This would be particularly useful for those who need to use both hands for other tasks, such as climbing or working.",
    "**Motion-Sensitive Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that turns on automatically when it detects movement, such as when someone enters a dark room or when a user is about to trip. This would be a convenient and hands-free solution for those who often find themselves in dark spaces."
