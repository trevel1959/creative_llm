    "Water Filtration Community Kiosks: Create a network of community kiosks that provide clean water through filtration systems. Each kiosk would be located in a high-traffic area, such as a market or bus station, and would be staffed by local entrepreneurs who are trained to maintain and repair the filtration systems. This approach would not only provide clean water but also create jobs and economic opportunities for the local community.",
    "Floating Water Purification Systems: Design and deploy floating water purification systems that can be placed on lakes, rivers, or other bodies of water in developing countries. These systems would use a combination of ultraviolet light, ceramic filters, and other technologies to remove bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants from the water. This approach would provide clean water to communities that are located near water sources but lack access to safe drinking water.",
    "Community-Led Rainwater Harvesting: Establish a community-led rainwater harvesting program that encourages households to install rainwater collection systems in their homes. The program would provide training and support to households on how to maintain and repair their systems, as well as educate them on the importance of proper storage and treatment of rainwater. This approach would not only provide clean water but also promote sustainable water management practices in the community.",
    "Mobile Water Purification Units: Develop and deploy mobile water purification units that can be transported to remote or disaster-affected areas. These units would use advanced technologies such as ultraviolet light, ozone, or ceramic filters to purify water, and would be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. This approach would provide clean water to communities that lack access to safe drinking water due to conflict, natural disasters, or other crises.",
    "Waste-to-Water Technology: Establish a waste-to-water technology program that converts waste from landfills, sewage, or agricultural activities into clean water. The program would use a combination of anaerobic digestion, membrane filtration, and disinfection technologies to produce safe drinking water. This approach would not only provide clean water but also reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting"
