    "**Highland Retreats**: Areas that are currently high-altitude regions, such as the Andes or the Himalayas, could see an influx of people seeking refuge from rising seas. Communities could develop in these areas, with eco-villages built using sustainable architecture that blends with the natural landscape. The focus would be on self-sufficiency, utilizing permaculture techniques and renewable energy to create a harmonious living environment.",
    "**Underground Habitats**: To escape the effects of rising sea levels, communities could build underground habitats in safe geological formations. These habitats could utilize advanced technology to maintain air quality and temperature, while also incorporating vertical farming systems to grow food. The underground design would provide natural insulation and protection from extreme weather events, creating a safe haven for residents.",
    "**Vertical Islands**: Envision artificial islands constructed as vertical structures rising above the water. These islands could be equipped with residential units, recreational areas, and agricultural spaces. The design would include water filtration systems and desalination plants to ensure a sustainable water supply. Vertical islands could also serve as biodiversity reserves, incorporating native flora and fauna to maintain ecological balance.",
    "**Reclaimed Land Cities**: Some coastal cities could adapt by reclaiming land from the ocean using innovative techniques. This could involve constructing barriers and using sediment from the ocean floor to create new land. The reclaimed areas could be designed as green urban spaces, complete with parks, residential buildings, and commercial zones, all while implementing flood-resistant infrastructure to cope with future sea level rise.",
    "**Floating Farms**: To address food security in a world with rising sea levels, floating farms could be established. These farms would consist of buoyant structures that allow for aquaponics and hydroponics, enabling the cultivation of crops and fish in a sustainable manner. Residents could live on adjacent floating communities, fostering a strong connection between food production and living spaces, while also minimizing the impact on traditional land."
