    "**Limited Communication**: In a world without electricity, communication methods become severely limited. Without smartphones or internet access, people might rely on traditional methods such as handwritten letters or bulletin boards for sharing information. Community centers could establish a local news network where residents can post announcements, share news, or offer services, fostering a sense of community.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many water supply systems rely on electricity for pumping and filtration. Without it, access to clean water could become a problem. Individuals could invest in rainwater harvesting systems or build simple filtration systems using sand and charcoal. Communities could also organize water-sharing programs to ensure everyone has access to safe drinking water.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Difficulties**: Maintaining comfortable living conditions without electricity poses a challenge, especially in extreme weather. In winter, homes could be equipped with wood stoves or alternative heating methods like thermal mass designs that retain heat. In summer, utilizing natural ventilation techniques, such as strategically placed windows and shade structures, can help keep homes cool.",
    "**Health and Safety Risks**: The absence of electricity can hinder access to medical care and emergency services. Individuals could form local health cooperatives to share resources, such as first aid training and supplies. Additionally, communities could establish a network of volunteers trained in basic healthcare and emergency response to ensure that residents receive necessary assistance in case of emergencies.",
    "**Loss of Entertainment and Leisure Activities**: Without electronic devices, people may struggle to find entertainment. To counter this, communities could organize regular events like game nights, storytelling sessions, or outdoor movie screenings using projectors powered by alternative energy sources, such as solar panels. Encouraging hobbies like gardening, crafting, or sports can also help individuals stay engaged and connected."
