    "DNA Storage: One idea could be to use DNA storage technology to store information. DNA is a highly stable molecule that can hold vast amounts of data. Scientists have already developed methods for encoding data into DNA, so this could be a feasible option for storing large amounts of information in the event of a disaster.",
    "Holographic Data Storage: Another idea could be to use holographic data storage technology. This involves creating three-dimensional images of data that can be stored on a disc or other media. The advantage of holographic data storage is that it allows for much higher storage densities than traditional methods, which could make it an ideal solution for storing large amounts of data.",
    "Nanotechnology-based Memory: A third idea could be to develop memory devices based on nanotechnology. These devices could be incredibly small and could potentially store vast amounts of data using tiny structures. While this technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to revolutionize data storage in the future.",
    "Time Travel: A fourth idea could be to use time travel as a way to store information. In theory, if we could travel back in time and store information in a specific location, we could retrieve it later when needed. However, this is purely theoretical at the moment and would require significant advances in physics and technology.",
    "Quantum Cryptography: A fifth idea could be to use quantum cryptography to securely store and transmit data. Quantum cryptography uses the principles of quantum mechanics to create secure encryption keys that cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties. By using quantum cryptography, we could ensure that our data remains safe and secure even in the event of a disaster."
