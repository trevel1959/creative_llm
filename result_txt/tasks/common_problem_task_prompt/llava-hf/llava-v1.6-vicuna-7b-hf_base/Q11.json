    "Limited volunteer support: Another common problem faced while organizing a charity event is the lack of volunteer support. It's important to have a dedicated team of volunteers who can help you with various aspects of the event, from setting up and managing the event to promoting it and handling the finances. If you don't have enough volunteers, it can be challenging to organize the event successfully.",
    "Difficulty in spreading the word: Promoting the event in a limited time frame is essential for the success of any charity event. However, if you don't have a dedicated team to handle the promotion or if you are facing difficulties in reaching out to the target audience, it can be challenging to spread the word about the event and attract a decent number of attendees.",
    "Competition with other events: If your charity event is taking place at the same time as other events in the city, it can be challenging to draw the attention of potential attendees. In such cases, it's essential to have a unique selling proposition, which can help you stand out from the crowd and attract more attendees to the event.",
    "Last-minute cancellations: Last-minute cancellations can create issues with regards to event logistics. If some of the attendees do not show up or if some of your vendors back out at the last minute, it can create a chaotic situation, and you may end up spending extra time and resources to rearrange the logistics.",
    "Difficulty in managing attendees: One of the major challenges associated with organizing a charity event is managing the attendees. Ensuring that everyone is safe, comfortable and enjoying the event is a challenging task. Managing the crowd, providing necessary arrangements, and keeping the event on schedule are all critical aspects of the event that need to be managed properly."
