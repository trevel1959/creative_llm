    "\"Glowing Blooms\": This new plant species, named \"Luminaria,\" would have flowers that emit a soft, ethereal glow. The petals would be translucent, allowing the light to shine through, giving the plant a mesmerizing, otherworldly appearance. The glow would be bioluminescent, produced by a specialized organelle called \"photophores\" that contain a unique combination of enzymes and pigments. This would allow the plant to attract pollinators, such as nocturnal insects, and provide a unique source of light in dark environments.",
    "\"Scented Leaves\": \"Aromaflora\" is a new plant species that produces leaves with fragrant oils that change scent depending on the time of day and environmental conditions. The leaves would contain specialized cells that release different fragrances, such as citrusy, floral, or woody scents, in response to changes in temperature, humidity, or light. This would allow the plant to communicate with its surroundings and attract specific pollinators or herbivores.",
    "\"Self-Healing Skin\": \"Regenera\" is a plant that has developed a unique skin that can repair itself in response to damage. The skin would be covered in specialized cells called \"healthy cells\" that can detect and repair any injuries, such as scratches or cuts, in real-time. This would allow the plant to maintain its integrity and continue to photosynthesize and grow without the need for external intervention.",
    "\"Water-Storing Roots\": \"Hydrostoma\" is a plant that has evolved to store water in its roots, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The roots would be adapted to absorb and store water more efficiently, and the plant would have a specialized system for distributing water throughout its body. This would allow the plant to survive for extended periods without rain or irrigation, making it an ideal crop for dry regions.",
    "\"Insect-Repelling Trunks\": \"Pulvinaria\" is a plant that has developed a unique trunk structure that repels insects. The trunk would be covered in small, spiky projections that deter insects from crawling or climbing on the plant."
