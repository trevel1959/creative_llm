    "AI-Powered Smart Calculator: Develop a calculator that uses artificial intelligence to perform advanced mathematical calculations, such as symbolic manipulation, equation solving, and even machine learning algorithms. This calculator would be able to solve complex problems with ease and provide detailed explanations for its calculations, making it an invaluable tool for students, professionals, and researchers.",
    "Augmented Reality Calculator: Create a calculator that utilizes augmented reality technology to display calculations in a 3D virtual environment. Users could interact with the calculator by using hand gestures or voice commands, making calculations more intuitive and engaging. This calculator would be particularly useful for visual learners or for demonstrating mathematical concepts in an interactive way.",
    "Personalized Calculator: Develop a calculator that learns the user's preferences and calculates accordingly. For example, if a user consistently uses a certain formula or function, the calculator could automatically suggest it when they input similar information in the future. This personalized approach would make the calculator more efficient and user-friendly.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface Calculator: Create a calculator that can read brain signals and perform calculations based on the user's thoughts. This calculator would use electroencephalography (EEG) or other brain-computer interface technologies to detect electrical activity in the brain and translate it into mathematical calculations. This would allow users to perform calculations without physically interacting with the calculator, making it an innovative solution for individuals with mobility or dexterity issues.",
    "Collaborative Calculator: Develop a calculator that allows multiple users to work together on calculations in real-time. This calculator would use cloud-based technology to enable multiple users to access and edit calculations simultaneously, making it easier to collaborate on complex mathematical projects. This would be particularly useful for students working on group projects or for professionals collaborating on financial or scientific calculations."
