    "**Orbital Debris Collision**: As more satellites are launched, the risk of collision with existing orbital debris increases. This could damage the satellite or even cause it to become inoperable. To address this, itâ€™s essential to conduct comprehensive tracking of space debris and implement collision avoidance maneuvers for the satellite if necessary. Developing technology to actively remove debris from orbit could also be a long-term solution.",
    "**Regulatory and Compliance Issues**: Launching a satellite requires compliance with various national and international regulations. Issues may arise if the satellite's mission does not align with regulatory requirements or if there are delays in obtaining necessary licenses. To avoid this, early engagement with regulatory bodies and ensuring all legal documentation is in order well before the launch date is crucial.",
    "**Environmental Impact Concerns**: The launch of rockets can have significant environmental impacts, including emissions, noise pollution, and potential damage to ecosystems in launch areas. Addressing these concerns may involve using more environmentally friendly fuels, conducting environmental impact assessments, and ensuring that launch sites are located away from sensitive areas.",
    "**Funding and Budget Overruns**: Launching a satellite is a costly endeavor, and there is a risk of budget overruns due to unforeseen expenses. This can jeopardize the entire mission if additional funding is not secured. To mitigate this risk, a detailed budget plan should be established with contingencies for unexpected costs, and regular financial reviews should be conducted throughout the project lifecycle.",
    "**Public Relations and Stakeholder Engagement**: A satellite launch can attract significant media attention, and negative public perception can arise from issues such as accidents, environmental damage, or lack of transparency. To manage this, a robust public relations strategy should be in place, including proactive communication with stakeholders, community engagement, and transparent reporting on the satellite's mission and its benefits."
