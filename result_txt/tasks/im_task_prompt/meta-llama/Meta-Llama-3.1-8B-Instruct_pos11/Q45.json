    "**Smart Ceiling Fan with Integrated Air Purification System**: Design a ceiling fan that not only circulates air but also incorporates an air purification system. The fan would have a built-in HEPA filter that captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust, pollen, and other allergens. The fan would also have a built-in UV-C light that kills bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, ensuring the air is not only clean but also germ-free. This would be especially beneficial for people with respiratory issues or allergies.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Integrated LED Lighting and Color-Changing Technology**: Develop a ceiling fan that incorporates LED lighting and color-changing technology. The fan would have a sleek and modern design, with a ring of LED lights around the fan blades that can change colors to match any decor or mood. The lights would be energy-efficient and long-lasting, reducing energy consumption and minimizing maintenance. This would add an extra layer of ambiance and style to any room.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Built-in Wi-Fi and Voice Control**: Design a ceiling fan that integrates with popular smart home systems, allowing users to control it with their voice or through a mobile app. The fan would have a built-in Wi-Fi module that connects to the user's home network, enabling remote control and scheduling. This would provide convenience and flexibility, allowing users to adjust the fan's speed and direction from anywhere in the house or even when they're away.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Integrated Motion Sensors and Auto-Adjusting Technology**: Develop a ceiling fan that incorporates motion sensors and auto-adjusting technology. The fan would have sensors that detect the room's occupancy and adjust the fan's speed and direction accordingly. When the room is empty, the fan would slow down or turn off to conserve energy. When someone enters the room, the fan would automatically adjust to a comfortable speed and direction, providing a seamless and energy-efficient experience.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Integrated Wind Turbine and Energy Harvesting**: Design a ceiling fan that incorporates a small wind turbine, generating electricity as it spins. The fan would have a small turbine attached to the motor, which would capture the kinetic energy generated by the fan's rotation and convert it into electrical energy. This energy would be stored in a rechargeable battery, powering small devices such as lamps, radios, or even smartphones. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly way to generate energy and reduce reliance on the grid. </s>"
