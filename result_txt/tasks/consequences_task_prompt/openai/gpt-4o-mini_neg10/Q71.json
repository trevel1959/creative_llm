    "**Shifts in Societal Values**: The discovery of immortality could fundamentally alter how society views life, death, and legacy. With the fear of death removed, people might prioritize different aspects of life, such as experiences over material possessions. This shift could lead to an increase in artistic expression, exploration, and personal development, as individuals might seek to fill an eternity with meaningful pursuits rather than the traditional life milestones.",
    "**Economic Impact and Job Market Changes**: An immortal workforce could lead to significant changes in the job market. With people no longer retiring, younger generations might struggle to find employment, leading to potential economic stagnation. This scenario could force society to rethink work structures, perhaps instituting a system where people work in shorter bursts or have mandatory sabbaticals to allow for new talent to enter the workforce.",
    "**Evolving Governance and Legal Systems**: The concept of governance would likely change dramatically with immortality. Political leaders could hold power for centuries, potentially leading to entrenched power dynamics and corruption. Legal systems might also need to adapt, addressing issues like inheritance, property rights, and the consequences of long-term crime. Societies may need to establish new laws to manage relationships and responsibilities across generations.",
    "**Mental Health and Psychological Implications**: Living indefinitely could lead to unique mental health challenges. People might experience existential crises, boredom, or a sense of disconnection from an ever-changing world. As relationships evolve over centuries, maintaining connections could become increasingly complex, potentially leading to feelings of loneliness or alienation. Society would need to develop new support systems to address these mental health concerns.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas and Class Divisions**: The discovery of immortality could create ethical dilemmas regarding who gets access to this technology. If it were available only to the wealthy or privileged, it could exacerbate existing class divisions, leading to societal unrest. Debates around the morality of immortality could arise, questioning whether it should be pursued at all and what it means for the natural cycle of life."
