    "Woolly Mammoth - Bringing back the woolly mammoth would be an incredible opportunity to study the evolution of mammals and the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Mammoths were herbivores and their diet consisted mainly of grasses and shrubs, which would make them an important addition to modern-day grasslands and savannas. They could also serve as a source of genetic material for modern elephants, helping to improve their chances of survival in the wild.",
    "Quagga - The quagga, a subspecies of zebra, was once found in large numbers in South Africa. However, due to hunting and habitat loss, the last wild quagga died in 1883. Bringing back the quagga would help to restore balance to the ecosystem and provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of zebras. Quaggas are known for their distinctive stripes, which could be used to develop new patterns for clothing and textiles.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - Once the most abundant bird species in North America, the passenger pigeon went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting. Bringing back the passenger pigeon would allow us to study the impact of human activities on bird populations and ecosystems. They could also serve as a symbol of conservation and the importance of protecting wildlife.",
    "Moa - The moa was a large flightless bird that once inhabited New Zealand. With the ability to reach heights of up to 10 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds, the moa would be an impressive sight to behold. Bringing back the moa would provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of flightless birds and their adaptations to different environments. They could also serve as a source of genetic material for modern-day birds, helping to improve their chances of survival in the wild.",
    "Thylacine - The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. Despite being an apex predator, the thylacine was unable to compete with introduced predators such as dogs and cats. Bringing"
