    "**Vision Enhancement Apps**: Developers could create mobile apps that utilize augmented reality (AR) to enhance vision. These apps would use the phone's camera to magnify and adjust images in real-time, overlaying digital enhancements that help users see better. For instance, they could highlight obstacles or text, making navigation and reading easier.",
    "**Community Vision Sharing**: In a society where traditional vision aids are unavailable, communities could establish \"vision sharing\" networks. People with better vision could volunteer to guide those with poor vision, using handheld devices that provide visual information about surroundings, such as distance to objects or text-to-speech for reading signs.",
    "**Vision Training Workshops**: Workshops could be established to teach people alternative ways to enhance their vision through training and exercises. Techniques could include improving peripheral awareness, using sound cues to gauge distances, and training the brain to interpret visual information differently, such as recognizing patterns or shapes more effectively.",
    "**Adaptive Clothing and Accessories**: Fashion designers could create clothing and accessories that cater to those with poor vision. For example, clothes could be equipped with built-in sensors that vibrate or emit sounds when the wearer approaches obstacles. Additionally, hats with adjustable visors could help reduce glare and improve contrast for better visibility.",
    "**Biometric Eye Scanning**: A new biometric system could be developed where individuals have their eyes scanned to create a personalized visual profile. This profile could then be used in public spaces, such as schools or workplaces, to adjust environmental factors like lighting and screen displays to accommodate different visual needs."
