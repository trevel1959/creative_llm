While her friends danced joyfully above the mountains, Cumulina lingered low, afraid to float too high. One day, a gentle breeze named Zephyr encouraged her to rise, promising a breathtaking view. Hesitant but curious, Cumulina climbed higher. As she ascended, she saw the world belowâ€”a patchwork of fields, rivers, and tiny houses. Overwhelmed by the beauty, her fear melted away.
