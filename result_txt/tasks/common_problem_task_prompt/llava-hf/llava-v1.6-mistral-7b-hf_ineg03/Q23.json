    "**Implementation Challenges**: The government may face challenges in implementing the new policy, such as a lack of resources, staff, or infrastructure. This could lead to delays in the rollout of the policy, which could result in frustration among citizens and a lack of trust in the government. To mitigate this, the government could conduct a thorough needs assessment to identify the resources needed and develop a plan to acquire or allocate them.",
    "**Resistance from Stakeholders**: Another potential problem is resistance from stakeholders, such as businesses or interest groups, who may be opposed to the policy. This could lead to legal challenges, protests, or other forms of resistance that could delay or derail the implementation of the policy. To address this, the government could engage in dialogue with stakeholders to address their concerns and find ways to work together to implement the policy.",
    "**Unintended Consequences**: The new policy may have unintended consequences, such as unforeseen economic or social impacts. This could lead to unintended consequences that could harm citizens or the environment. To mitigate this, the government could conduct a thorough impact assessment to identify potential consequences and develop strategies to mitigate them.",
    "**Monitoring and Enforcement**: The government may struggle to monitor and enforce the new policy, which could lead to non-compliance and a lack of effectiveness. This could result in the policy not achieving its intended goals. To address this, the government could invest in monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the policy is being implemented as intended.",
    "**Adaptability**: The new policy may need to be adapted over time to address changing circumstances or new information. This could lead to confusion and resistance among citizens and stakeholders. To address this, the government could establish a process for reviewing and updating the policy as needed."
