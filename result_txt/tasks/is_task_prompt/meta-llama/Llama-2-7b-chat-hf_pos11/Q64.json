    "Build a giant ice cream cone city: The Planet of Ice Cream could be a massive, cone-shaped planet covered in a never-ending sea of ice cream. The cone could be so large that it stretches up into the sky, with towering peaks and deep valleys carved out of the frozen treat. The planet's surface could be dotted with tiny ice cream shops and cafes, where visitors can indulge in their wildest ice cream dreams. Visitors could also explore the planet's frozen tundras, where they might discover hidden caves filled with rare and exotic ice cream flavors.",
