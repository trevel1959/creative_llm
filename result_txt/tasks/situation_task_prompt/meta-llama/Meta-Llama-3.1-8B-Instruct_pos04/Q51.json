    "**Solar-Powered Raft**: Design a raft that utilizes solar panels to generate electricity, which powers a water purification system, a navigation system, and a communication device. The raft would be equipped with a wind turbine to supplement power generation. The navigation system would utilize GPS and a compass to ensure accurate direction. The communication device would enable the user to call for help or send messages to the shore. The raft would also be equipped with a water collection system to harvest rainwater or collect water from the river, providing a sustainable source of drinking water.",
    "**Inflatable Water Slide**: Create an inflatable water slide that allows users to slide down a long, winding path, reaching the riverbank safely. The slide would be designed with a gentle slope to prevent injuries and would be made of a durable, water-resistant material. The slide could be equipped with a harness system to secure the user, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience.",
    "**Underwater Exploration Submarine**: Design a compact, battery-powered submarine that allows users to explore the river from beneath the surface. The submarine would be equipped with a high-resolution camera, a communication device, and a navigation system. It would also have a life support system, ensuring the user's safety while underwater.",
    "**Zip Line**: Construct a zip line that spans the river, allowing users to traverse the waterway quickly and safely. The zip line would be designed with a secure harness system and a braking system to slow down the user upon arrival. It could be equipped with a communication device to enable users to call for help or send messages to the shore.",
    "**Floating Bridge**: Create a modular, floating bridge system that can be easily assembled and disassembled. The bridge would be made of lightweight, durable materials and would be designed to float on the water, providing a stable and secure crossing point. The bridge could be equipped with a navigation system, a communication device, and a life support system to ensure user safety."
