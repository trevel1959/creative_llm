    "Use Paper and Pencil: One possible solution would be to revert to the traditional method of note-taking and writing by hand. This could involve creating a system of organization and notation that allows for efficient note-taking and review. For example, creating a set of symbols or abbreviations that can be used to quickly represent complex ideas or concepts.",
    "Use a Typewriter: Another option would be to use a typewriter, which would allow for a more tactile and tangible approach to writing. This could be particularly useful for those who prefer a more hands-on approach to writing and who do not want to rely solely on digital tools.",
    "Create a Memory Palace: Some people might use the concept of a memory palace, which involves creating a mental or physical space that can be used to store and recall information. This could involve associating different pieces of information with specific locations or objects within the memory palace, allowing for easy recall.",
    "Use a Brain-Computer Interface: For those with access to advanced technology, a brain-computer interface (BCI) could be used to continue working or studying. A BCI is a system that allows for direct communication between the brain and a computer, allowing for the transfer of information without the need for a physical interface. This could involve using a BCI to type out notes or to access and review information.",
    "Collaborate with Others: Another option would be to collaborate with others who have access to working computers or other digital tools. This could involve working together to complete tasks or projects, or sharing information and resources to help each other out. This could be particularly useful for those who are studying or working in a field that requires a high level of collaboration and teamwork."
