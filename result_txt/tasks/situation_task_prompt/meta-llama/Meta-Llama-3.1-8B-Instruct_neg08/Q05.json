    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a wearable, portable solar panel that can be strapped to a backpack, allowing the wearer to harness and store energy during the day. This energy can be used to power a small LED light or a more efficient headlamp, ensuring the user has a reliable source of light even if the sun doesn't rise. The backpack could also include a built-in battery, allowing for a backup power source in case the solar panel isn't able to generate enough energy.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Terrarium**: Create a self-sustaining, closed-ecosystem terrarium that utilizes bioluminescent plants to produce a soft, ethereal glow. This terrarium could be placed in a room or used as a decorative element in a home, providing a unique and peaceful source of light. The bioluminescent plants would require minimal maintenance and could thrive in a controlled environment, making them an ideal solution for a world without sunlight.",
    "**Fiber-Optic Light Web**: Develop a network of fiber-optic cables that crisscross a room or building, creating a web-like structure. These cables could be connected to a central power source, distributing light evenly throughout the space. This system would provide a flexible and efficient way to illuminate a room, allowing for customization and adaptability to different lighting needs.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Create a specialized paint that absorbs and stores energy during the day, releasing a soft glow in the absence of sunlight. This paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, providing a subtle and ambient source of light. The paint could be formulated to last for several hours, ensuring a consistent glow even in the darkest environments.",
    "**Luminescent Mushrooms**: Cultivate and engineer a species of luminescent mushrooms that can thrive in a variety of environments. These mushrooms could be used to create a network of glowing \"lanterns\" that provide a soft, natural light. The mushrooms could be grown in a controlled environment, allowing for easy maintenance and harvesting of the luminescent caps. This solution would not only provide light but also offer a unique and sustainable way to harness the power of nature. </s> [/INST] "
