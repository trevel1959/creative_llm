    "Quantum Energy: Imagine a new form of energy that is derived from the quantum realm. This energy would be generated by harnessing the power of subatomic particles and manipulating them to create a sustainable and limitless source of power. The energy would be incredibly efficient, requiring minimal equipment and infrastructure, and would have the potential to revolutionize the way we power our homes, transportation, and industries.",
    "Eco-Energy: Envision a new form of energy that is derived from the natural world. This energy would be generated by harnessing the power of the sun, wind, and water, and would be completely renewable and sustainable. The energy would be clean and safe, with no harmful emissions or waste, and would have the potential to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change.",
    "Gravitational Energy: Imagine a new form of energy that is derived from the force of gravity. This energy would be generated by harnessing the power of gravitational waves and manipulating them to create a sustainable and limitless source of power. The energy would be incredibly dense and could be used to power everything from small devices to entire cities, with minimal infrastructure required.",
    "Nano-Energy: Picture a new form of energy that is derived from the nanoscale world. This energy would be generated by harnessing the power of nanoparticles and manipulating them to create a sustainable and limitless source of power. The energy would be incredibly efficient, with the potential to revolutionize the way we power our devices and industries, and could even be used to create new types of materials and technologies.",
    "Bioluminescent Energy: Imagine a new form of energy that is derived from living organisms. This energy would be generated by harnessing the power of bioluminescence, the natural ability of certain organisms to produce light, and manipulating it to create a sustainable and limitless source of power. The energy would be clean and safe, with no harmful emissions or waste, and could be used to power everything from small devices to entire cities. It could also have the potential to create new types of technologies and materials, such as bioluminescent building materials that could light up buildings without the need for electricity."
