    "**Interactive Personalized Calendar App**: Create an app that learns from user preferences over time to customize the calendar experience. The app could suggest events based on past behavior (e.g., reminding you of your gym schedule if you regularly work out on Tuesdays) or learn about your daily routines to suggest optimal times for appointments or meetings.",
    "**Virtual Reality Calendar Experience**: Develop a VR application that allows users to virtually step into their calendar day by day, month by month. This immersive experience could provide a more engaging way to plan and visualize schedules, offering a 360-degree view of events, reminders, and tasks.",

This could be particularly useful for families, teams, or groups coordinating events, ensuring everyone is aware of and prepared for shared activities.",
