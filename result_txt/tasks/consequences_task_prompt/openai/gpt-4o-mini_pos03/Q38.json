    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The ability to predict the future would raise profound ethical questions. For instance, if someone could foresee a tragic event, should they intervene to prevent it? This could lead to moral quandaries about free will versus determinism. Would individuals feel pressured to act in certain ways to avoid negative outcomes? Society would need to grapple with the implications of intervention versus acceptance, leading to debates about responsibility and the moral weight of knowledge.",
    "**Economic Disruption**: Predicting the future could lead to significant economic shifts. Markets might become overly volatile as people react to predicted outcomes, creating bubbles or crashes based on anticipated events rather than actual economic performance. Additionally, industries that rely on uncertainty—like gambling or insurance—could be severely impacted, leading to job losses and the need for new economic models that accommodate this new reality.",
    "**Social Stratification**: Access to future-predicting technology could create a divide between those who can afford it and those who cannot. This disparity could lead to a new form of social stratification where the wealthy gain even more power and influence by making better-informed decisions, while the less fortunate are left at a disadvantage. Society might need to address this inequality, possibly leading to policy changes and social unrest as those without access demand fair opportunities.",
    "**Psychological Effects**: The knowledge of the future could have profound psychological effects on individuals. People might experience anxiety or paralysis from knowing potential outcomes, leading to decision fatigue or a reluctance to take risks. Conversely, some might feel empowered by the knowledge, leading to a culture of overconfidence. Mental health professionals would need to adapt their practices to help people navigate the complexities of living with foresight.",
    "**Changes in Education and Skill Development**: If predicting the future became a reality, educational systems would likely shift to focus on adaptability and critical thinking rather than rote learning. Curriculums might include training on how to interpret and act upon predictions effectively. Skills that emphasize creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence would become paramount, as these would help individuals navigate an unpredictable world even when predictions are available."
