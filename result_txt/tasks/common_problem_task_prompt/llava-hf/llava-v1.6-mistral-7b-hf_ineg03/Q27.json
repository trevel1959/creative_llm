    "Financial challenges: Developing a new vaccine can be expensive, with costs associated with research, clinical trials, and manufacturing. Funding may be limited, and there is always the risk of financial loss if the vaccine does not receive regulatory approval.",
    "Time constraints: The development of a new vaccine can take several years, which may be too long for an outbreak or pandemic situation. This can lead to a sense of urgency and pressure to expedite the process, which may compromise the quality and safety of the vaccine.",
    "Regulatory hurdles: The process of getting a new vaccine approved by regulatory bodies like the FDA can be complex and time-consuming. This can result in delays and frustration for researchers and the public alike.",
    "Production and distribution challenges: Once a new vaccine is developed, it must be manufactured and distributed to the public. This can be a logistical nightmare, with challenges such as ensuring the vaccine is stored at the correct temperature, reaching remote areas, and ensuring that healthcare workers are trained to administer the vaccine.",
    "Public skepticism: There is often public skepticism about new vaccines, particularly if they are developed quickly. This can lead to a lack of trust in the vaccine and a reluctance to get vaccinated, which can have serious public health consequences."
