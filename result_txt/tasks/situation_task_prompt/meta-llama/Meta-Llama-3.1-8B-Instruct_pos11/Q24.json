    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses**: Develop contact lenses that are not just for correcting vision but also for providing augmented reality experiences. These lenses would have tiny displays and sensors that can project virtual images, videos, and even interactive interfaces onto the user's field of vision. This technology would allow people with poor vision to navigate and interact with their environment in a more immersive and engaging way.",
    "**Personalized 3D Printing**: Utilize 3D printing technology to create customized, wearable devices that can correct vision. These devices could be tailored to an individual's specific needs, using advanced algorithms and AI to create precise, personalized corrections. This would enable people with poor vision to have access to high-quality vision correction without the need for traditional glasses or contact lenses.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Built-in Microchips**: Develop contact lenses with integrated microchips that can detect and correct vision problems in real-time. These microchips would be equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms that can analyze the user's vision and make adjustments as needed. This technology would allow people with poor vision to have seamless, automatic correction of their vision.",
    "**Virtual Reality Assistants**: Create virtual reality assistants that can help people with poor vision navigate and interact with their environment. These assistants would use advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time guidance and support, allowing users to complete tasks and engage with their surroundings with greater ease and confidence.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Vision Correction**: Develop new, bio-inspired technologies that mimic the natural processes of the human eye. For example, researchers could create implantable devices that use electrostimulation to restore vision or develop wearable devices that use optical illusions to correct vision. This approach would focus on harnessing the body's natural mechanisms to correct vision, rather than relying on traditional glasses or contact lenses. [/INST] "
