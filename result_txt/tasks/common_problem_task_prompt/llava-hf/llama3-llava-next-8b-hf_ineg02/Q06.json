    "Gravity: Mars has only 1/3 of Earth's gravity, which would cause problems for human movement, balance, and sleep patterns. This would require adjustments to furniture and other items used on Mars to ensure safety and comfort.",
    "Water: Mars has no liquid water, so accessing water for drinking, hygiene, and other purposes would be a significant challenge. This would require a reliable and sustainable water source, such as through in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) techniques.",
    "Food: Mars lacks natural food sources, so a reliable and sustainable food supply would need to be established. This could be through hydroponics, aeroponics, or other forms of in-situ agriculture.",
    "Communication: Mars is much farther from Earth than any other planet, which would make communication with Earth more challenging. This would require reliable and high-speed communication systems, such as radio or optical communication.",
    "Psychological Impact: Living on Mars would likely have a significant psychological impact on the inhabitants. The isolation, lack of familiar surroundings, and the physical challenges would require mental and emotional support."
