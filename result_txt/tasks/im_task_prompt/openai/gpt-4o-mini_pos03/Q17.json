    "**Integrated Water Recycling System**: Develop a built-in water recycling mechanism that captures, filters, and reuses rinse water for future cycles. This system could significantly reduce water consumption, especially in areas facing water scarcity. The recycled water would be treated with UV light and a filtration process to ensure cleanliness before being used in subsequent washes, promoting sustainability and eco-friendliness.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Drum**: Implement a self-cleaning feature for the washing drum that uses high-frequency sound waves to dislodge and remove residues and odors. This would prevent mold and mildew buildup, ensuring that the washing machine remains hygienic and the clothes come out smelling fresh. The feature could be activated periodically or after a certain number of washes, reducing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular washing machine design that allows users to customize their machines based on their needs. For instance, users could add modules for extra drying capacity, steam cleaning, or even a mini washer for delicate items. This flexibility would cater to diverse lifestyles and preferences, allowing families to adapt their machines as their needs change.",
    "**Virtual Reality User Interface**: Introduce a virtual reality (VR) interface that allows users to interact with their washing machine in an immersive way. Using VR goggles, users could visualize the wash cycle, see how different settings affect the wash, and even simulate different laundry scenarios. This could enhance user engagement and understanding of the machineâ€™s features, making laundry day a more interactive experience.",
    "**Detergent Dispenser with AI Recommendations**: Integrate an AI-powered detergent dispenser that calculates the optimal amount of detergent based on the load size, fabric type, and soil level. The system could also suggest eco-friendly detergent brands or recipes for homemade detergents based on user preferences, promoting sustainability and cost-effectiveness."
