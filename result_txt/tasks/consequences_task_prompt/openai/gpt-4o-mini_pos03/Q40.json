    "**Economic Shifts**: The healthcare industry, which heavily relies on disease management and treatment, would undergo a radical transformation. Pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and medical professionals would need to pivot towards preventive care, wellness, and health education. New industries might emerge focusing on lifestyle enhancement, longevity research, and mental health support, creating job opportunities in sectors previously overshadowed by disease treatment.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Longevity**: With people living longer and healthier lives, society would face ethical questions regarding longevity. Issues like resource allocation for the elderly, the implications of an aging population on workforce dynamics, and the potential for societal stratification based on access to advanced health technologies could arise. The debate over whether life extension should be pursued at all would intensify, raising philosophical questions about the nature of life and death.",
    "**Shifts in Social Dynamics**: As people live longer, the traditional life stages (education, career, retirement) may shift. The concept of retirement could evolve, with individuals choosing to work in different capacities or pursue new careers later in life. This could lead to a renaissance of creativity and innovation as experienced individuals contribute to various fields, but it might also create tension between younger and older generations in the job market.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: An increase in population and changes in consumption patterns could lead to greater environmental challenges. The need for more housing, food production, and energy could exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss. Society would need to adopt aggressive sustainability measures, invest in renewable energy, and rethink urban planning to minimize ecological footprints.",
    "**Cultural Renaissance**: With health concerns alleviated, people might have more time and resources to pursue creative endeavors, leading to a cultural renaissance. Art, literature, music, and innovation could flourish as individuals focus on personal growth and community engagement rather than survival. This could foster a global exchange of ideas and creativity, breaking down cultural barriers and enhancing global collaboration."
