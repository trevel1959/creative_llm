This would be ideal for food artists, chefs, and those who want personalized meals.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Oven:** Design an oven that not only cooks food but also engages users in the cooking process.

The compost is then used to fertilize plants or gardens, making this oven a sustainable and eco-friendly option.",
    "**Portable Oven for Outdoor Cooking:** Create a compact, lightweight oven designed specifically for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, or picnics. It should be easy to carry, operate on a portable power source (like solar panels), and have a simple design that allows for quick setup and cleanup.
