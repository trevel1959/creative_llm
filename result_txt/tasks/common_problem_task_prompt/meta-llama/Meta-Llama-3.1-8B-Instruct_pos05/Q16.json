    "**Trail of Tales**: Create an immersive experience where hikers can record their stories and memories on a customized audio journal. This journal can be a waterproof, solar-powered device that allows hikers to record their experiences, and then upload them to a cloud-based platform. The platform can be designed to create a community-driven narrative, where hikers can share their stories and connect with others who have completed similar sections of the trail.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hiker**: Develop a line of sustainable, eco-friendly gear for hikers, including backpacks, sleeping bags, and clothing.
