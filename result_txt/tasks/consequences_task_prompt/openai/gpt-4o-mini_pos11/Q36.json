    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Resource Allocation**: As limb regeneration becomes possible, society would face ethical dilemmas regarding resource allocation. For instance, would it be fair to prioritize limb regeneration for those who lost limbs due to preventable accidents over those who lost them due to congenital issues? This could lead to debates about the ethics of healthcare, insurance coverage, and who deserves access to regenerative therapies, possibly creating a divide between different socio-economic groups.",
    "**Impact on Sports and Competition**: The sports industry would be transformed as athletes could regenerate limbs after injuries, potentially leading to an era of enhanced performance. However, this could also lead to concerns about fairness and the integrity of competition. Would it create an uneven playing field, and how would governing bodies regulate athletes who can heal faster than others? This could prompt discussions about the definition of natural talent and the essence of competition itself.",
    "**Changes in Personal Identity and Psychology**: The ability to regenerate limbs could alter personal identity and self-perception for many individuals. People who identify strongly with their disabilities might experience a shift in how they see themselves. Additionally, the psychological implications of losing a limb and then regrowing it could lead to complex emotional responses, requiring new therapeutic approaches to help individuals navigate their identities and self-worth.",
    "**Environmental and Evolutionary Implications**: If limb regeneration became a common trait among humans, it could influence human evolution. Over time, natural selection might favor individuals with superior regenerative capabilities, potentially leading to a population with enhanced healing abilities. This could also impact environmental interactions, as humans might take more risks, knowing they can regenerate limbs, which could lead to changes in behaviors and lifestyles.",
    "**Economic Implications for Industries**: Industries focused on prosthetics, rehabilitation, and physical therapy could face significant disruptions. Companies that manufacture prosthetic limbs may need to pivot to focus on regenerative medicine technologies. Conversely, new markets could emerge around regenerative therapies, creating jobs and economic opportunities in research, development, and application of these advanced treatments."
