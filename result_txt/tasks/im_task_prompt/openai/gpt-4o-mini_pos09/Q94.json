    "**Aroma Layering Candles**: Instead of a single scent, these candles would feature multiple layers of wax infused with different fragrances. As the candle burns, the layers would melt sequentially, transitioning from one scent to another. For instance, a candle might start with a refreshing citrus top note, then transition to a floral middle note, and finish with a warm vanilla base. This gradual change would create a more dynamic olfactory experience, allowing users to enjoy a multi-faceted aroma journey.",
    "**Interactive Candle Art**: These candles would be embedded with a small LED display that could show customizable designs, messages, or even animations as they burn. Users could connect their smartphones to the candle via an app, allowing them to change the visuals based on their mood or occasion. This could be perfect for celebrations, where messages like \"Happy Birthday\" or festive patterns could be displayed, making the candle not just a source of light but also a form of entertainment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Seed Candles**: These candles would be made from biodegradable materials and embedded with seeds. Once the candle has burned down, the leftover wax and container could be planted in soil, allowing flowers or herbs to grow. This would encourage sustainability and give a second life to the candle, turning a simple decorative item into a beautiful garden addition. The packaging could also be made from recycled materials, further promoting an eco-conscious lifestyle.",
    "**Scent Diffusion Control Candles**: This innovative candle would feature a dual-chamber design, allowing users to control the intensity of the scent released. One chamber could hold a concentrated fragrance oil, while the other contains a neutral wax. Users could adjust the burning rate of each chamber with a simple twist mechanism, customizing how strong or subtle they want the aroma to be. This would cater to individual preferences and make it easier to manage scent levels in different environments.",
    "**Smart Timer Candles**: These candles would come equipped with a built-in timer that allows users to set a specific burn duration. Once the time is up, the candle would extinguish itself safely. This feature would be ideal for those who want to enjoy a candle's ambiance without the risk of forgetting it lit, especially in homes with pets or children. The timer could also be programmable for different days or occasions, ensuring the candle lights up at the desired time automatically."
