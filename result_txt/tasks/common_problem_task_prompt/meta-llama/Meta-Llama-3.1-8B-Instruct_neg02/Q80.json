    "**Eco-Chic Venue**: Choose a venue that's already environmentally conscious, such as a historic mansion with a garden or a rustic barn. Then, incorporate elements that minimize waste and reduce carbon footprint, like using locally sourced materials, composting food waste, and reducing single-use plastics. To take it a step further, consider using a venue that's already implementing sustainable practices, such as using solar power or rainwater harvesting systems.",
    "**Sustainable Fashion**: Create a wardrobe that's both stylish and eco-friendly. Choose dresses or suits made from sustainable materials like organic cotton, recycled polyester, or repurposed fabrics. You can also incorporate second-hand or vintage pieces into your attire. For a unique touch, consider upcycling or repurposing old items into accessories, like turning an old lace tablecloth into a wedding veil or using a vintage window as a decorative element.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Instead of renting a gas-guzzling limousine, consider using an electric or hybrid vehicle for transportation. You can also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation. For a more unique experience, consider renting a vintage or eco-friendly vehicle, like a classic car or a horse-drawn carriage.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Partner with a catering service that offers zero-waste options, like composting food waste or using biodegradable servingware. You can also consider a plant-based menu or a locally sourced menu that reduces transportation emissions. To take it a step further, consider hosting a brunch or breakfast wedding, which typically generates less food waste than a traditional dinner wedding.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Get creative with your decor by using natural elements like flowers, branches, and stones. You can also repurpose items you already have, like old vases, jars, or containers. Consider using LED candles or fairy lights to reduce energy consumption. For a unique touch, create a \"living\" wedding arch by incorporating plants or greenery into your decor."
