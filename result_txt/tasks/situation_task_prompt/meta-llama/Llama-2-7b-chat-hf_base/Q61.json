    "pollen-dispensing drones: Create small, lightweight drones that can be programmed to collect pollen from one plant and transfer it to another. These drones could be powered by solar energy or small motors and could navigate through plants using sensors and GPS.",
    "underwater pollination: If flowers disappeared, plants could adapt to be pollinated underwater. This could involve creating specialized leaves or petals that can trap water and attract aquatic animals, such as fish or snails, to transfer pollen between plants.",
    "wind-powered pollination: Create large, vertical wind turbines that could generate enough power to pollinate plants. These turbines could be placed near plants and use their blades to transfer pollen between them.",
    "robotic pollinators: Develop small, agile robots that can navigate through plants and transfer pollen between them. These robots could be powered by solar energy or batteries and could be programmed to pollinate specific plants.",
    "light-based pollination: Create specialized light sources that can stimulate pollination in plants. These light sources could emit specific wavelengths of light that are attractive to pollinators, such as bees or butterflies, and could be used to pollinate plants in areas where traditional pollinators are scarce."
