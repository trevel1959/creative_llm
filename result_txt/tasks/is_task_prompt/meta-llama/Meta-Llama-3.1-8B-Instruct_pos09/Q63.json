    "The school's main building is designed to resemble a giant cat's face, complete with whiskers and a smiling mouth. The entrance is a giant cat door that opens to reveal a cozy library filled with cat-themed books and a \"pet cafe\" where students can relax with adoptable cats. ",
    "The school's curriculum is centered around the \"Paws-itive Learning\" program, which uses animals as teachers and learning aids. Each subject area has a corresponding animal \"expert\" who teaches students about topics such as fractions (using a rabbit's carrot-cutting skills), fractions (using a bird's nesting habits), and more.

    "The school's mascot is a wise old owl named Professor Hootenanny, who serves as the school's beloved principal. Professor Hootenanny is known for his witty sayings and clever quips, which are often displayed on the school's bulletin board for students to enjoy. ",
    "The school's extracurricular activities include a \"Pet Therapy\" club, where students learn about animal-assisted therapy and practice interacting with animals to help people in need. ",
    "The school's cafeteria serves a special \"Paws-itively Delicious\" menu, featuring dishes such as \"Pupperoni Pizza\" and \"Kitty Cat Chicken Tenders.\" A portion of the proceeds from each meal goes towards supporting local animal shelters and rescue organizations. "
