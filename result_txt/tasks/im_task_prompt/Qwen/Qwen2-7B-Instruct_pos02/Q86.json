    "**Designing a Smart Wheelchair Navigation System:** This idea involves creating an advanced wheelchair navigation system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. The system can interpret the user's environment in real-time and provide guidance through augmented reality overlays on a tablet or smartwatch. This not only enhances mobility but also reduces the risk of accidents by alerting the user to obstacles or potential hazards. ",
    "**Innovative Wheelchair Upholstery Material:** Develop a new type of wheelchair upholstery material that offers enhanced comfort, breathability, and durability. This could include incorporating memory foam, heat-sensitive materials that adjust to the user's body temperature, or antimicrobial treatments to prevent skin irritations and infections. Such a material would significantly improve the quality of life for wheelchair users.",
    "**Customizable Ergonomic Add-ons:** Create modular components that can be easily attached to standard wheelchairs to enhance their ergonomic properties. These could include adjustable armrests, lumbar supports, or footrests that can be customized based on individual needs. This approach allows for greater personalization and comfort without requiring a custom-made wheelchair.",
    "**Portable Power Supply System:** Design a lightweight, portable power supply system that can be integrated into wheelchairs, allowing them to be used in remote areas where charging infrastructure may be limited. This system could utilize solar panels, rechargeable batteries, or a combination of both to ensure the wheelchair remains operational regardless of location. This innovation would greatly expand the accessibility of wheelchair use for individuals living in rural or underdeveloped regions.",
    "**Integrating Virtual Reality Therapy:** Develop a VR application specifically designed for wheelchair users, focusing on enhancing physical therapy, rehabilitation, and mental health support. This could include virtual exercises that simulate real-world environments, helping users practice mobility skills, or engaging in immersive activities that boost mood and motivation. By integrating technology like this, wheelchair users can receive personalized, effective therapy sessions from the comfort of their own homes."
