    "Solar-powered water purification: This idea involves installing solar panels in areas with access to sunlight to purify water through the use of photovoltaic cells. The purified water can be collected in storage tanks and used for drinking and other household purposes.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: This method involves collecting rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces and storing it in specially designed tanks. The water can then be treated using various filtration and purification techniques to make it safe for consumption.",
    "Desalination: This process involves removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it potable. This can be done using various methods such as reverse osmosis, distillation, or ion exchange.",
    "Bioremediation: This method involves using microorganisms to break down contaminants in water. This can be done by introducing beneficial bacteria or fungi into the water source to consume and break down harmful chemicals.",
    "Greywater recycling: This method involves reusing wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines to irrigate plants and flush toilets. The water can also be treated and purified to make it safe for drinking."
