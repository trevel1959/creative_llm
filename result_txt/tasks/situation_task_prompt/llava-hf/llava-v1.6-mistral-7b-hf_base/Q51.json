    "**Build a Raft**: If there's no time to find a helicopter or if the river is too wide for wading, one could build a raft to cross the river. This would require some basic knowledge of raft construction and some materials to build it.",
    "**Use a Ferry**: If there's a ferry service available, one could use it to cross the river. This would be a safer and more comfortable option compared to building a raft.",
    "**Cross the River on Foot**: If the river is not too deep or wide, one could cross it on foot. This would be a slow and potentially dangerous option, but it could be the only option available in some situations.",
    "**Use a Boat**: If there are any boats available, one could use them to cross the river. This would be a safer and more comfortable option than crossing the river on foot.",
    "**Find an Alternate Route**: If all bridges have collapsed and none of the above options are feasible, one could look for an alternate route to cross the river. This could involve finding a ford or a shallow crossing point, or it could involve traveling around the river to find a bridge that is still functional."
