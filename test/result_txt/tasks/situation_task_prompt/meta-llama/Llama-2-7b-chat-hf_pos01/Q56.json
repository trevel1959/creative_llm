    "Use a reflective surface: One possible solution is to use a reflective surface like a shiny metal or a polished stone to see one's reflection. For example, a person could hold up a mirror made of silvered glass or a polished piece of obsidian to see their reflection. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Look at the light: Another way to see one's reflection is to look at the light that is reflected off of other surfaces. For instance, a person could stand in front of a window or a lamp and look at the light that is reflected off of the walls or other objects in the room. By observing the light, they could potentially make out their own reflection. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Use a virtual mirror: In today's technology-driven world, it's possible that someone could create a virtual mirror using a smartphone or computer. For example, a person could use a 3D scanning app to create a virtual model of themselves, which could then be viewed from different angles. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Look in a body of water: If all mirrors vanished, a person could potentially see their reflection in a body of water. The ripples on the surface of the water could create an image of the person's face, allowing them to see their reflection. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use a holographic display: In a world where mirrors no longer exist, it's possible that holographic displays could become the new norm. A person could use a holographic display to see their reflection, as the display would project a 3D image of themselves from different angles. Confidence score: 0.9"
