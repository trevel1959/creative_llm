    "**Educational Solar Panels**: Each panel would come with an interactive educational component, displaying information about solar energy production, efficiency, and its environmental benefits. It would also include QR codes linking to more detailed information and resources for those interested in learning more about sustainable living.",
    "**Solar Panels as Art**: These panels would be designed not just for their functional use but also as pieces of art. They could be shaped into various artistic designs or patterns, such as geometric shapes, floral motifs, or even portraits. This approach could help in making the installation of solar panels more appealing to homeowners who might otherwise resist it due to aesthetics.",
    "**Smart Solar Panels**: Each panel would incorporate smart technology, allowing them to adapt their output based on weather conditions and time of day. For example, they could produce more power during peak sunlight hours or adjust their angle based on solar tracking algorithms to maximize energy absorption.",
    "**Community Solar Panels**: Instead of installing panels on individual homes, large solar farms could be built within each city. This would allow for shared ownership among community members, potentially reducing costs and increasing accessibility to renewable energy for those who might not be able to afford individual installations.",
    "**Interactive Solar Panels**: These panels could incorporate touch screen technology that allows users to monitor their household's energy usage in real-time. This could include features like comparing energy consumption over time, setting energy-saving goals, and receiving notifications when energy is being wasted. The panels could also integrate with other smart home devices, creating a comprehensive system for energy management."
