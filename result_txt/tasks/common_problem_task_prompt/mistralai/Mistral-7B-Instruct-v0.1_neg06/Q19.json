    "\"Everyone else managed to do it; why can't you?\" is not an appropriate question to ask about creating a new fashion line. It is not productive to compare oneself to others or to focus on what others have done. Instead, the focus should be on what you can do and how you can differentiate your fashion line from others.",
    "\"What sets your fashion line apart from others?\" is a better question to ask. This question allows you to focus on what makes your fashion line unique and why it is worth pursuing.",
    "\"What are your strengths and weaknesses in creating a fashion line?\" is another good question to ask. This question allows you to assess your own capabilities and limitations and to identify areas where you may need additional support or resources.",
    "\"What are your goals for your fashion line?\" is a productive question to ask. This question allows you to clarify what you want to achieve with your fashion line and to create a plan for reaching those goals.",
    "\"What are some potential challenges you may face in creating a fashion line and how can you overcome them?\" is a great question to ask. This question allows you to anticipate potential obstacles and to develop strategies for addressing them."
