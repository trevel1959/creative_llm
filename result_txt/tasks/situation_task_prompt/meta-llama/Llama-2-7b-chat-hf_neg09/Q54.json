    "Aqua-Sleds: Imagine a sled-like device that can glide effortlessly across the water, powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrofoils. The sled would be made of lightweight, buoyant materials and equipped with comfortable seating for passengers. With the disappearance of ships and boats, Aqua-Sleds would become the new mode of transportation for long-distance travel across large bodies of water.",
    "Water Bikes: Water bikes are similar to regular bicycles but designed for use on water. They would be powered by pedaling with your legs, using a specialized pedal system that converts the energy into propulsion. Water bikes would provide a low-impact, eco-friendly way to travel across the water, allowing you to cover long distances without the need for fuel.",
    "Hydrofoil Pods: Hydrofoil pods are small, personal watercraft that use hydrofoils to lift the hull out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. They would be powered by electric motors or even human power, using a specialized kayak-style paddle. With their small size and maneuverability, hydrofoil pods could be used for short-distance travel or as a fun recreational activity.",
    "Submarine Taxis: In a world without ships or boats, submarine taxis would become the new way to travel across large bodies of water. These submersible taxis would be designed for passenger transportation, equipped with comfortable seating, air conditioning, and even entertainment systems. They would be powered by electric motors or even solar panels, making them an eco-friendly and convenient mode of transportation.",
    "Water Wings: Water wings are a unique and futuristic mode of transportation that would allow people to fly across large bodies of water. They would be designed like a giant pair of wings, with a harness and control system that would allow the rider to steer and control their flight. Water wings would be powered by a combination of electric motors and hydrofoils, making them fast and efficient. They would be a thrilling and exhilarating way to travel across the water, offering a new perspective on the world below."
