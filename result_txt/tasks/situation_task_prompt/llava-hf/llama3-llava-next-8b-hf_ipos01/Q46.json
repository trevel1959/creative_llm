    "Waste-to-Energy Innovations: Invest in research and development of waste-to-energy technologies, such as advanced anaerobic digesters or plasma waste-to-energy systems, to convert waste into clean energy. This would not only manage waste but also generate renewable energy.",
    "Waste Management Hubs: Establish community waste management hubs where residents can deposit their waste, which would be collected and processed at a central facility. These hubs could also serve as community centers, providing education and resources on waste reduction and recycling.",
    "Biodegradable Products: Promote the use of biodegradable materials in packaging and consumer products. This would reduce the amount of non-biodegradable waste entering landfills and the environment.",
    "Circular Economy Platforms: Create online platforms that connect businesses, consumers, and waste management services to promote a circular economy. These platforms would facilitate the exchange of goods, services, and waste management solutions.",
    "Waste-to-Resource Facility: Develop facilities that convert waste into valuable resources, such as textiles into yarn for weaving, or old electronics into precious metals and rare earth elements."
