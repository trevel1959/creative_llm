    "**Cultivating Indoor Gardens**: Another option would be to cultivate indoor gardens, using hydroponic systems or aeroponics to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables in a controlled environment. This could be a cost-effective and sustainable way to produce fresh produce without relying on traditional farming methods.",
    "**Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**: GMOs could be developed to produce fruits and vegetables that are resistant to diseases, pests, and harsh environmental conditions. These GMOs could be cultivated in a controlled environment or in greenhouses, providing a consistent supply of nutritious produce.",
    "**Nutritional IV Drips**: Nutritional IV drips could be used to deliver essential vitamins and minerals directly into the bloodstream. These drips could be customized to meet individual nutritional needs and could be administered in a medical setting or at home.",
    "**Food Fortification**: Food manufacturers could fortify non-perishable food items with essential vitamins and minerals. This would ensure that people have access to a variety of nutritious foods even if fresh produce is scarce.",
    "**Nutritional Bioengineering**: Nutritional bioengineering could be used to create foods that are rich in essential vitamins and minerals. For example, scientists could genetically modify grains, legumes, or other staple foods to increase their nutritional content."
