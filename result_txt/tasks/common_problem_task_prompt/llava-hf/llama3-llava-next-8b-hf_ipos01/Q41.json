    "Weight Constraints: The weight of a spaceship is crucial for both propulsion and structural integrity. The designer must balance the weight of the spacecraft, including fuel, cargo, and passengers, to ensure optimal performance and minimize the strain on the ship's structure.",
    "Environmental Factors: The design of a spaceship must take into account the harsh environment of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and lack of oxygen. The designer must incorporate protective features, such as insulation, shielding, and life support systems, to ensure the safety of the crew and passengers.",
    "Propulsion Systems: The propulsion system of a spaceship is critical for maneuvering and maintaining speed. The designer must choose the most efficient and reliable propulsion system, considering factors such as fuel consumption, power requirements, and environmental impact.",
    "Navigation and Communication: A spaceship must be equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems to enable safe and efficient travel. The designer must consider the impact of space on communication signals and ensure that the ship's systems can communicate effectively with Earth-based systems.",
    "Safety and Emergency Procedures: In the event of an emergency, the design of a spaceship must prioritize safety and emergency procedures. The designer must incorporate features such as emergency exits, lifeboats, and communication systems to ensure the safety of the crew and passengers."
