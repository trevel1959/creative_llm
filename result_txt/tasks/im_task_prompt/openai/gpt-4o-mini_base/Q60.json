    "**Towel with Integrated UV-C Sterilization**: Create a towel that has a built-in UV-C light strip along its edge. After use, simply fold the towel and activate the sterilization feature. The UV-C light will eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring the towel is clean and safe for the next use. This could be especially useful for gym towels or beach towels that often come into contact with dirt and germs.",
    "**Multi-Functional Towel**: Design a towel that can transform into different products. For example, it could convert into a picnic blanket, a beach mat, or even a lightweight backpack. By incorporating hidden zippers, pockets, and foldable sections, users can adapt the towel to various situations, making it a versatile accessory for travel, sports, and outdoor activities.",
    "**Temperature-Regulating Towel**: Introduce a towel made from temperature-regulating fabric that can keep the user warm or cool depending on the environment. This towel would be ideal for different climates—keeping you warm after a swim in cold water or cooling you down after a workout. The fabric would use phase-change materials that absorb or release heat based on the surrounding temperature.",
    "**Aromatherapy Towel**: Create a towel that is infused with essential oils or has pockets for inserting scent sachets. After a shower or bath, the towel would release a soothing aroma, enhancing the relaxation experience. Users could choose different scents for different moods—lavender for relaxation, eucalyptus for invigoration, or citrus for a refreshing lift.",
    "**Interactive Towel with QR Codes**: Design towels that feature printed QR codes that link to various resources. For example, scanning the code could provide users with a guided stretching routine, a skincare regimen, or tips for effective post-workout recovery. This interactive element makes the towel not just a drying tool but a gateway to wellness and self-care information."
