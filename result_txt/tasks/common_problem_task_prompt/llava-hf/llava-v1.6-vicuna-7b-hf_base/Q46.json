This includes addressing issues such as crime and theft, and maintaining well-trained and certified personnel to oversee operations.",
    "Environmental factors: Changing weather conditions, natural disasters, and urbanization can lead to the disruption of public transportation systems. Planning for these potential issues, like adapting routes, implementing emergency response plans, and monitoring system readiness during adverse conditions, is crucial.",
    "Technological advancements: The public transportation system must be able to keep up with advancements in technology, such as developing electric or autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that the infrastructure is compatible with modern transportation systems while maintaining safe and efficient operations is a challenge."
