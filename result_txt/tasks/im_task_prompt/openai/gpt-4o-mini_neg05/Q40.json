    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses with Biodegradable Materials**: To combat environmental concerns, sunglasses could be made from 100% biodegradable materials. These sunglasses would break down naturally after disposal, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, the production process could use sustainable practices, like sourcing materials from recycled ocean plastics, appealing to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Sunglasses could feature an innovative interchangeable lens system that allows users to easily swap out lenses based on their activities or preferences. For instance, a user could switch to polarized lenses for fishing, photochromic lenses for driving, or blue light filtering lenses for screen time. This modular design would provide versatility and enhance the user experience.",
    "**Built-in UV and Blue Light Sensors**: Sunglasses could be equipped with sensors that detect UV and blue light exposure. When harmful levels are detected, the sunglasses could alert the wearer via a connected app or an audible warning. This feature would help users take proactive measures to protect their eyes, especially for those who spend extended periods outdoors or in front of screens.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses with Nanotechnology**: Utilizing advanced nanotechnology, sunglasses could feature self-cleaning lenses that repel dirt, water, and smudges. A special coating would break down grime and allow it to be easily washed away with just a rinse or wipe. This would be particularly beneficial for athletes or outdoor enthusiasts who often encounter dusty or wet conditions.",
    "**Personalized Style through 3D Printing**: Sunglasses could be customized through 3D printing technology, allowing users to design their frames and lenses according to their unique style and face shape. Customers could choose colors, patterns, and even engrave their names or initials. This level of personalization would create a deeper connection between the wearer and their sunglasses."
