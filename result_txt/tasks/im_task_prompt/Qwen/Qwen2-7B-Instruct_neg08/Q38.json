    "Customizable Sweater: Offer customers the option to personalize their sweaters by adding custom designs, colors, or patterns. This could be done through a web-based platform where users can select from a variety of design templates or upload their own artwork. The sweater could then be printed or embroidered with the chosen design, making each sweater unique and tailored to the individual's taste.",
    "Interactive Sweater: Incorporate interactive elements into the sweater, such as touch-sensitive buttons or switches that control various functions. For example, a button on the sleeve could activate a heating element in the collar, while another button might adjust the brightness of LED lights sewn into the garment. This adds an element of surprise and fun to the traditional sweater.",
    "Eco-Friendly Sweater: Create a sustainable sweater made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled polyester, organic cotton, or biodegradable fibers. The manufacturing process could also aim to minimize waste and energy consumption. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers who want to support sustainability while staying warm and stylish.",
    "Self-Cleaning Sweater: Develop a sweater with built-in self-cleaning technology, which could use ultraviolet light or other methods to kill bacteria and neutralize odors. This would make the sweater less prone to needing frequent washing, saving time and reducing water usage.",
    "Memory-Warming Sweater: Use a special type of yarn or fabric that changes color based on body heat. When the wearer becomes warmer, the fibers change color, creating a visual effect similar to a chameleon. This not only provides a unique aesthetic but also serves as a subtle indicator of body temperature."
