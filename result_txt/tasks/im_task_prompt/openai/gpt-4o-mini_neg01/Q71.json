    "**Integrated Sleep Tracker**: Embed a lightweight, flexible sleep tracking device within the sleeping bag fabric that monitors the userâ€™s sleep patterns, movements, and even heart rate. This data could sync with a mobile app to provide insights into sleep quality and suggest improvements, making it a perfect companion for campers and outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Modular Design with Attachments**: Create a modular sleeping bag that allows users to attach various components based on their needs. For example, detachable pockets for storing gear, a removable hood for warmer nights, or even an insulated liner for extra warmth. This versatility would cater to different climates and personal preferences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a sleeping bag made from 100% biodegradable or recycled materials, including insulation derived from natural sources like hemp or recycled plastic bottles. This not only reduces environmental impact but also appeals to eco-conscious consumers looking for sustainable outdoor gear.",
    "**Built-in Bug Repellent Technology**: Infuse the fabric of the sleeping bag with natural insect-repelling agents, such as citronella or eucalyptus, or use a technology that releases micro-particles to deter bugs. This feature would enhance the camping experience by providing protection against mosquitoes and other insects without the need for chemical sprays.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Design**: Transform the sleeping bag into a versatile item that can serve multiple functions. For instance, it could be designed to convert into a hammock, a blanket, or even a poncho in emergencies. This multifunctionality would appeal to minimalist travelers and those looking to save space in their gear."
