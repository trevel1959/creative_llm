    "**Accessibility of Technology**: While developing innovative technology, there may be challenges in ensuring that the technology itself is accessible. This includes creating interfaces that can be easily navigated by visually impaired users, such as voice commands, haptic feedback, or Braille displays. If the technology is too complex or requires visual interaction, it may alienate the very users it aims to assist.",
    "**Affordability and Funding**: The cost of developing and producing assistive technologies can be high, which may limit accessibility for those who need it most. Securing funding for research, development, and distribution is a significant hurdle. If the final product is priced too high, it may be out of reach for many visually impaired individuals, creating a disparity in access to life-enhancing tools.",
    "**Integration with Existing Systems**: Another potential problem is ensuring that the new assistive technology integrates seamlessly with existing tools and environments. For example, if the technology is meant to assist in navigation, it should work well with public transport systems, smartphones, and other everyday tools that visually impaired users rely on. A lack of compatibility could hinder its effectiveness and usefulness.",
    "**Training and Support**: Users may face difficulties in understanding how to use new assistive technologies, especially if they are not provided with adequate training and support. Developing comprehensive user manuals, tutorials, and support systems is essential. If users feel overwhelmed or confused, they may abandon the technology altogether, negating its intended benefits.",
    "**Privacy and Security Concerns**: Many assistive technologies require data collection to function effectively, such as location tracking or user behavior analysis. This raises potential privacy and security concerns, particularly for vulnerable populations. It is essential to implement robust security measures and be transparent about data usage to build trust with users."
