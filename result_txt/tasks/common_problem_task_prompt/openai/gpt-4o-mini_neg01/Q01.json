    "**Vehicle Maintenance Issues**: A long road trip can put significant strain on a vehicle, and if it’s not properly maintained, it could break down during the journey. Problems like tire blowouts, engine overheating, or brake failure could occur. To mitigate this, ensure that the vehicle undergoes a thorough inspection before the trip, including checking oil levels, tire pressure, and brakes. Having a roadside assistance plan can also provide peace of mind.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Road trips can quickly become expensive, with costs for gas, food, lodging, and activities adding up. Without a clear budget, group members might end up spending more than anticipated, leading to financial stress. To prevent this, establish a budget before the trip and track expenses using a shared app. Consider planning some meals and accommodations in advance to keep costs manageable.",
    "**Diverse Dietary Needs**: Traveling with a group means catering to different dietary preferences and restrictions, which can be challenging. Some members may be vegetarian, gluten-free, or have allergies, making it difficult to find suitable dining options on the road. To solve this, gather information about everyone’s dietary needs before the trip and plan meals accordingly. Consider packing snacks that accommodate various diets and research restaurants along the route that offer diverse menu options.",
    "**Entertainment and Engagement**: Long hours in a vehicle can lead to boredom and restlessness among passengers, especially if there are long stretches without interesting stops. This can result in frustration and tension in the car. To combat this, prepare a playlist of favorite songs, audiobooks, or podcasts to keep everyone entertained. Additionally, plan interactive games or discussions to engage everyone and make the journey more enjoyable.",
    "**Accommodation Issues**: Finding suitable places to stay can be a logistical nightmare, especially during peak travel seasons when hotels may be fully booked. This can lead to stress and last-minute scrambling for alternative options. To alleviate this, research and book accommodations in advance, considering the preferences and budgets of all group members. Using platforms that allow for group bookings can simplify the process."
