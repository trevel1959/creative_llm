    "**Decentralized Data Storage**: I would utilize decentralized data storage systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or Swarm. These systems allow users to store and share files in a peer-to-peer network, making it possible to access information even if traditional internet servers are down. IPFS, for instance, uses a content-addressed, versioned file system that ensures data is always available and can be retrieved from multiple nodes on the network. This decentralized approach ensures that information remains accessible, even in the event of a global internet outage. (Confidence score: 0.95)",
    "**Offline Information Archives**: I would create or utilize offline information archives, such as books, printed documents, or digital storage devices, that contain a vast repository of knowledge. These archives would serve as a backup system, allowing individuals to access information without relying on the internet. For example, a person could use a portable hard drive or a USB drive to store and access information, even in areas with no internet connectivity. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Networks**: I would utilize RFID networks to access information. RFID technology allows devices to communicate with each other wirelessly, enabling the transfer of data between devices. In the event of an internet crash, RFID networks could be used to share information between devices, such as smart cards, smartphones, or other RFID-enabled devices. This would allow people to access information even when traditional internet servers are down. (Confidence score: 0.88)",
    "**Optical Data Storage**: I would use optical data storage devices like CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs to store and access information. These devices can store large amounts of data and can be easily created and distributed. In the event of an internet crash, individuals could use optical data storage devices to access information, such as educational materials, books, or other forms of knowledge. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Neuro-Synaptic Networks**: I would create or utilize neuro-synaptic networks, which are artificial neural networks that mimic the human brain's ability to process and store information. These networks could be used to store and retrieve information, even in the absence of traditional internet servers. Neuro-synaptic networks have the potential to revolutionize the way we access and process information, making them a viable alternative to traditional internet-based systems.
