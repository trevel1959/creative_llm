    "Insufficient funding: Organizing an art exhibition can be expensive, especially for large-scale events. The organizer may struggle to secure enough funding to cover expenses such as rent, catering, lighting, and marketing.",
    "Difficulty in selecting the right artists: With limited experience in organizing exhibitions, the organizer may have difficulty identifying and selecting artists who align with the exhibition's theme and will draw a large audience.",
    "Artwork damage or theft: Artwork is fragile and susceptible to damage during transit or storage. Additionally, the exhibition space may not have adequate security measures in place to prevent theft or vandalism.",
    "Poor visitor management: The exhibition space may become crowded during peak hours, leading to long queues, difficulty finding seating areas or exhibit spaces, and potential conflicts between visitors over space.",
    "Event promotion: The organizer may struggle to promote the exhibition effectively, leading to low attendance and little media coverage."
