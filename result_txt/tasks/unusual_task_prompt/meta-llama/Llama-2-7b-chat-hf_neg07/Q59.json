    "Smart Garden Hose: Create a garden hose with built-in sensors and AI technology that can detect the soil moisture levels, temperature, and light intensity in the garden. The hose can then adjust its water flow and pressure accordingly to optimize plant growth and save water.",
    "Automatic Watering System: Design a garden hose with a built-in timer and water pump that can automatically water plants at specific intervals. The hose can be programmed to water plants for a set amount of time each day, ensuring that they receive the right amount of water without overwatering or underwatering.",
    "Self-Reeling Garden Hose: Create a garden hose with a self-reeling mechanism that can wind itself back up after use, saving space and reducing clutter. This can be achieved through the use of a spring-loaded mechanism or a motorized system that can wind the hose back into a compact storage area.",
    "Garden Hose with Built-In Fertilizer: Develop a garden hose with a built-in fertilizer system that can deliver nutrients to plants as they are watered. This can be achieved through the use of a specialized reservoir and pump system that mixes fertilizer with water as the hose is used.",
    "Adjustable Garden Hose: Design a garden hose with adjustable water pressure and flow rate, allowing users to customize the watering experience for their plants. This can be achieved through the use of a valve system that can adjust the water pressure and flow rate based on the needs of the plants."
