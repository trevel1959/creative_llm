    "**Adjustable Spout Design**: Create a watering can with an adjustable spout that can be modified for different types of watering. For example, the spout could be extended for reaching high plants or retracted for low ones. The nozzle could also have interchangeable heads, such as a fine mist for delicate seedlings or a strong stream for larger plants.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Design a watering can with a built-in reservoir that allows it to self-water plants for a certain period. This can be achieved by integrating a wick system that draws water from the reservoir into the soil gradually. This feature would be especially useful for busy individuals or during vacations, ensuring plants remain hydrated without daily attention.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip and Balance**: Redesign the handle and body of the watering can to enhance ergonomics and balance. The handle could be shaped to fit comfortably in the hand, with rubber grips to prevent slipping. Additionally, the can could have a weighted base to prevent tipping, allowing for easier pouring and maneuvering without straining the wrist.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Introduce a lid that serves multiple purposes. One side could have a built-in measuring cup for precise watering amounts, while the other side could function as a seed disperser with adjustable openings for different seed sizes. This would allow gardeners to easily transition from watering to planting without needing additional tools.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering Levels**: Implement a transparent section on the side of the watering can with color-coded markings that indicate different water levels. This feature would help users quickly assess how much water is left and gauge how much to fill it for specific plant needs. The colors could represent different watering requirements (e.g., blue for low, green for medium, and red for high)."
