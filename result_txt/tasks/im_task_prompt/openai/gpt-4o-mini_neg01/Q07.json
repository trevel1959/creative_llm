    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, corn starch, or other sustainable resources. This toothbrush could have replaceable heads to minimize waste, and it would be packaged in recyclable materials. An educational campaign could accompany its launch, informing consumers about the environmental impact of plastic toothbrushes.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Design a toothbrush that features a built-in UV-C light sanitizing chamber. After each use, the user can place the toothbrush in the chamber, which will eliminate 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. This could be particularly appealing to health-conscious consumers and could come with a charging dock that also sanitizes the brush head.",
    "**Personalized Toothbrush with Customizable Features**: Offer a toothbrush that allows users to customize features such as bristle firmness, handle length, and grip style. Users could select their preferences via an online platform and receive a toothbrush tailored to their needs. This would cater to individual comfort and effectiveness, making oral care more personalized.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flosser**: Innovate a toothbrush that combines brushing and flossing in one device. The toothbrush could have a small reservoir for water that releases a gentle stream of water while brushing, effectively cleaning between teeth and along the gum line. This would save time and encourage users to maintain a more thorough oral hygiene routine.",
    "**Toothbrush with Color-Changing Bristles**: Introduce a toothbrush with bristles that change color based on the pH level of the userâ€™s mouth or the presence of plaque. This feature would provide a visual cue to indicate when it's time to brush or if certain areas need more attention. It could help users develop better brushing habits by making oral hygiene more interactive and engaging."
