    "**Global Shift to Renewable Energy**: The world would rapidly transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Governments and corporations would invest heavily in research and development to improve the efficiency and affordability of renewable energy technologies.",
    "**Economic Downturn and Geopolitical Realignment**: The sudden loss of oil would lead to a global economic downturn as industries reliant on oil, such as transportation and manufacturing, would be severely impacted. This would result in widespread job losses, business closures, and a significant decrease in international trade. The loss of oil would also lead to a shift in global power dynamics, with countries that have invested heavily in renewable energy becoming more influential.",
    "**Rise of Alternative Transportation**: The world would see a rapid adoption of alternative modes of transportation, such as electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. This would lead to a decrease in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a reduction in the reliance on fossil fuels. Cities would also become more pedestrian-friendly, with increased investment in public transportation and bike infrastructure.",
    "**Collapse of Global Supply Chains**: The loss of oil would disrupt global supply chains, leading to widespread shortages and price increases for essential goods. This would result in social unrest, as people struggle to access basic necessities like food and medicine. Governments would need to intervene to maintain order and ensure the distribution of essential goods.",
    "**Mass Migration and Urbanization**: The loss of oil would lead to a mass migration of people from rural areas to urban centers, as people seek access to renewable energy and alternative transportation. This would result in the rapid growth of cities, with increased investment in infrastructure, housing, and social services. However, this would also lead to increased competition for resources, social tensions, and potential conflicts over land and resources. "
