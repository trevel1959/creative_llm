    "Water Purification Systems: Develop affordable and easy-to-use water purification systems that can be installed in homes and communities. These systems could utilize activated carbon filters, ultraviolet light, or other proven technologies to remove impurities from water sources.",
    "Community Water Banks: Establish community water banks where residents can deposit their clean water in exchange for a fee. This could incentivize people to invest in water purification systems and share the resources with their neighbors.",
    "Desalination Plants: If seawater is available, build desalination plants that can remove salt and other minerals from seawater, making it safe for drinking. These plants can be powered by renewable energy sources to minimize environmental impact.",
    "Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Develop technology that can extract clean drinking water from the air, especially in arid regions where water sources are scarce. This could be achieved through a process that condenses water vapor from the air and filters out impurities.",
    "Fog Collection: In regions with frequent fog, build fog collectors that capture fog and condense it into clean water. This can be done using a variety of materials, such as mesh or plastic, that are placed on rooftops or other elevated structures."
