    "Sleep in a hammock: In a world without night-time, sleeping in a hammock would be a great way to catch some shut-eye. The gentle swaying motion of the hammock would lull you into a peaceful sleep, as the of daylight.",
    "Use blackout curtains: If you can't go outside during the day, you can create your own night-time by using blackout curtains. These curtains can be hung on the windows of your room to block out all light, creating a dark and restful sleep environment.",
    "Use a sleep mask: Another way to create your own night-time is to use a sleep mask. These masks are designed to block out light and promote relaxation, making them a great option for those who don't have access to blackout curtains.",
    "Use a sound machine: If you can't sleep without the sound of rain or waves, you can create your own sound machine by using a white noise machine or a fan. These devices can produce a calming white noise that will help you drift off to sleep.",
    "Take a nap during the day: If you're having trouble sleeping at night, you can try taking a nap during the day. This can help you feel more rested and alert during the day, and can also help you adjust to the lack of night-time."
