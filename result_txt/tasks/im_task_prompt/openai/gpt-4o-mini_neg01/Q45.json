    "**Mood Lighting Feature**: Design a ceiling fan with built-in LED lights that can change colors and brightness. Users could customize the lighting based on their mood or the time of day. For example, warmer colors for a cozy evening and brighter, cooler colors for an energizing morning. The fan could also have a setting that mimics natural light patterns, gradually changing the color temperature throughout the day.",
    "**Air Purification System**: Incorporate a high-efficiency air filtration system into the ceiling fan. The fan would not only circulate air but also filter out dust, allergens, and pollutants. This feature could be especially beneficial for those with allergies or respiratory issues. The filtration system could be easily accessible for cleaning or replacement, ensuring optimal performance.",
    "**Adjustable Blade Angles**: Innovate a ceiling fan design that allows users to adjust the angle of the blades manually or automatically. This feature would enable better air circulation based on specific room layouts or furniture arrangements. For instance, if a room has a high ceiling, the blades could be angled downward to push air more effectively, while in a low ceiling room, the blades could be angled to disperse air evenly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a ceiling fan made entirely from sustainable and recyclable materials. This could include blades crafted from reclaimed wood or bioplastics. The motor could be energy-efficient, and the overall design could promote minimal environmental impact. This fan would appeal to eco-conscious consumers and contribute to sustainable living practices.",
    "**Integrated Bluetooth Speakers**: Create a ceiling fan that features built-in Bluetooth speakers. This would allow users to play music or listen to podcasts while enjoying the comfort of the fan. The speakers could be designed to provide high-quality sound without compromising the aesthetics of the fan. Users could control the audio through a dedicated app or through voice commands."
