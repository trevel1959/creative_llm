    "Water Purification System: is a cutting-edge technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and remove contaminants from water sources. With this system, you could could be used to purify water from any source, including rivers, lakes, and even sewage.",
    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe for human consumption. This process is becoming increasingly popular as a way to obtain clean drinking water, and it could be a viable option if all other sources were polluted.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Harvesting rainwater is another way to obtain clean drinking water. This involves collecting and storing rainwater in a tank or other container, and then using it for drinking and other household uses.",
    "Greywater Treatment: Greywater is the wastewater that comes from sinks, showers, and washing machines. With the right treatment system, this water can be purified and made safe for drinking.",
    "Solar Still: A solar still is a simple device that uses the sun's heat to purify water. This involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam back into water, leaving contaminants behind. This could be a viable option if you had access to a large enough area of clear, uncontaminated ground."
