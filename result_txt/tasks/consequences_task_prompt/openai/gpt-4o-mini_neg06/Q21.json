    "**Musical Etiquette**: Just as there are social norms for verbal communication, new rules would emerge around musical exchanges. For example, one might have to play a certain melody to greet someone or respond to a question with a specific chord progression. This could lead to the development of complex musical etiquette, where timing, volume, and style all play a role in social interactions.",
    "**Conflict Resolution through Improvisation**: Disputes could be resolved through musical improvisation, where parties engage in a musical dialogue to express their grievances and find common ground. This could lead to more harmonious resolutions, as participants would need to listen actively and respond musically, fostering empathy and collaboration rather than aggression.",
    "**Cultural Festivals and Gatherings**: Communities would host frequent musical gatherings, where people come together to share their compositions and engage in musical conversations. These events would serve as a vital social glue, reinforcing community bonds and cultural identity, as everyone contributes to the collective musical tapestry of their society."
