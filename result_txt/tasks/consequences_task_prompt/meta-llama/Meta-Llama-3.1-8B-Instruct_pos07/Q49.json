    "**The Great Forgetting**: A mysterious phenomenon causes people to forget their memories, but with a twist: they retain their skills and knowledge.

This leads to a society where people are highly competent but emotionally detached, struggling to form meaningful bonds with others.",
    "**The Memento Effect**: When people lose their memories, they start to create new, false memories to fill the void. These fabricated recollections become so vivid and convincing that they begin to influence people's decisions and actions. As a result, the line between reality and fantasy blurs, and the concept of truth becomes increasingly ambiguous.",
    "**The Lost Generation**: In this scenario, only children and infants retain their memories. As a result, they become the sole authorities on history, culture, and knowledge. They must navigate the challenges of growing up while shouldering the responsibility of preserving the collective memory of humanity.",
    "**The Simulacrum**: When people lose their memories, they are replaced by artificial, simulated versions of themselves.
