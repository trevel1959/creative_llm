    "**Gravity-Defying Chair-Swivel**: I'd invent a chair that can swivel and rotate in mid-air, allowing me to move around without needing to stand up. The chair would be equipped with a system of gyroscopes and miniature thrusters, enabling it to hover and change direction quickly. This would be particularly useful in tight spaces or areas with heavy foot traffic.",
    "**Exoskeleton Assistive Device**: I'd develop a wearable exoskeleton that provides support and mobility for people who can't stand up. The device would be powered by a compact, high-torque motor and would use advanced sensors to detect the user's movements, adjusting its assistance accordingly. This would allow me to move around with ease, even in areas with stairs or uneven terrain.",
    "**Hoverboard**: I'd create a high-tech hoverboard that uses magnetic levitation and advanced navigation systems to allow me to move around without standing up. The hoverboard would be equipped with sensors to detect obstacles and adjust its trajectory accordingly, ensuring a smooth and safe ride.",
    "**Robot Companion**: I'd design a small, AI-powered robot that can move around on its own, carrying me or providing assistance as needed. The robot would be equipped with advanced sensors and navigation systems, allowing it to navigate complex spaces and avoid obstacles.",
    "**Personal Transport Pod**: I'd invent a small, spherical transport pod that can move around on its own, carrying me or providing a comfortable, enclosed space for me to move around in. The pod would be equipped with advanced navigation systems and sensors, allowing it to navigate complex spaces and avoid obstacles. It could also be programmed to follow me or provide a safe, enclosed space for me to move around in. "
