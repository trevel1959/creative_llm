    "If there were no more birds, how would you wake up in the morning without an alarm clock?",
    "Birds are and can be used as a natural alarm clock. If they were to disappear, it would be difficult to wake up in the morning without an alarm clock. However, there are several alternative ways to wake up in the morning without an alarm clock.",
    "One way is to use a natural light alarm clock. This type of clock uses sunlight to wake you up. It can be placed in a window to capture the sunlight and set to a time that you want to wake up.",
    "Another way is to use a smart speaker with voice-activated controls. You can set a voice command to turn on the lights or play music at a certain time, which can be used as a natural alarm clock.",
    "You can also use a plant-based alarm clock. Some plants, such as the Venus flytrap, open up at a certain time each day. You can use this to your advantage by placing the plant in your bedroom and setting it to open at the time you want to wake up."
