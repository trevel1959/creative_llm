    "**Multi-Functional Coat Rack with Charging Station**: Enhance the coat rack by incorporating a charging station for smartphones and other devices. This could include wireless charging pads on top of the rack and USB ports on the side. Users could hang their coats while simultaneously charging their devices, making it a convenient addition to any entryway or mudroom.",
    "**Customizable Modular Coat Rack**: Design a coat rack that can be customized by the user. This modular system would allow users to choose the number of hooks, shelves, and even colors or materials. Users could rearrange the components according to their needs, whether they have more hats, bags, or coats, creating a personalized and adaptable storage solution.",
    "**Scented Coat Rack with Essential Oil Diffuser**: Transform the coat rack into a calming and inviting piece by integrating an essential oil diffuser. Users could add their favorite essential oils, which would disperse a pleasant scent every time they hang or take off their coats. This would enhance the sensory experience of coming home and provide a refreshing atmosphere in the entryway.",
    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Create a coat rack that uses AR technology to provide an interactive experience. Users could scan the coat rack with their smartphones to receive style tips on how to wear their coats, suggestions for matching accessories, or even virtual try-ons of different outfits. This would not only make the coat rack functional but also an engaging fashion tool.",
    "**Weather-Responsive Coat Rack**: Develop a coat rack that can respond to weather changes. Using a simple app or a built-in weather sensor, the coat rack could light up or display a message indicating the type of coat to wear based on the current weather conditions (e.g., \"It's raining, grab your raincoat!\"). This feature would help users make better choices when getting ready to leave the house."
