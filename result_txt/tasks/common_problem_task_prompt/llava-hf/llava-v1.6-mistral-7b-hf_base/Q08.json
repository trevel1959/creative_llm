    "Curriculum development: A new school curriculum may require significant time and effort to create and develop. The curriculum team must ensure that the curriculum is tailored to the specific needs of the students and meets state or national standards. This process could take a lot of time and resources, and there is a high risk of rejection or revision if the curriculum is not considered effective or meaningful.",
    "Classroom management: A new school curriculum may require significant changes to classroom management practices. Teachers may have to adapt their teaching methods to accommodate the new curriculum, which could lead to disruption and instability in the classroom environment. Additionally, teachers may resist changes to their teaching methods and may need training and support to adopt the new curriculum effectively.",
    "Parental involvement: A new school curriculum may require more parental involvement, which could result in a decrease in parental engagement. Parents may not be aware of the curriculum's changes or may not be comfortable with the new curriculum, leading to strained relationships between teachers and parents.",
    "Technology and resources: A new school curriculum may require the use of technology or additional resources, which could be expensive and may require significant upgrades to existing infrastructure. Additionally, there may be a shortage of curriculum materials, and this shortage may require the school to spend money on these materials, which could be costly.",
    "Standardized testing: A new school curriculum may require a change in the standardized testing process. Teachers may need to adapt their teaching methods to align with the new curriculum, which could result in lower test scores initially. This change may be challenging for students and teachers to adapt to, and there may be opposition from parents and other stakeholders."
