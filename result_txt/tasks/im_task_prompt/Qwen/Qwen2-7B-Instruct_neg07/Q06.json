    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Rain and Sun Protection**: Develop an umbrella that combines both rain protection and sunshade features. The umbrella can have a retractable canopy that adjusts according to weather conditions using sensors. In rainy weather, the canopy would extend as normal, while in sunny weather, it could retract to provide shade, thus saving space and energy.",
    "**Umbrella as a Mobile Power Bank**: Create an umbrella with integrated solar panels on its surface. This design would allow users to charge their electronic devices like smartphones or tablets under the umbrella when they are outdoors. It's particularly useful for people who spend a lot of time outdoors, ensuring their devices remain charged even when there is no access to power outlets.",
    "**Personalized Umbrella Printing Service**: Offer a service where customers can print designs, photos, or logos onto custom-made umbrellas. This could be particularly appealing to businesses looking to promote their brand through branded umbrellas or to individuals who want a unique and personalized accessory. Users could also choose from various fabric colors and patterns.",
    "**Smart Umbrella with Built-in GPS Tracker**: Introduce a smart umbrella that includes a built-in GPS tracker. This feature would be invaluable for parents, seniors, or individuals prone to losing items. If the umbrella is misplaced, its location can be tracked via a smartphone app, making it easier to find.",
    "**Umbrella-Integrated Lighting System**: Design an umbrella that doubles as a portable light source. This could be particularly useful during power outages or for camping trips. The umbrella would have LED lights built into its structure, which can be activated by a button or motion sensor. The integrated lighting system would make the umbrella a versatile tool, enhancing its utility beyond just rain protection. "
