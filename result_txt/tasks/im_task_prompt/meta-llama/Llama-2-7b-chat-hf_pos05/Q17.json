    "Smart Wash: This idea involves creating a washing machine that can detect the type of fabric being washed and adjust its cleaning settings accordingly. For example, it can use different temperatures, detergents, and spin cycles for delicate fabrics, synthetic fabrics, and heavily soiled items. This would save time and effort for users, as they wouldn't have to worry about manually selecting the right settings for each load of laundry.",
    "Washing Machine with Built-in Dryer: This idea combines a washing machine and dryer into one compact unit. This would save space and energy, as users wouldn't need to transfer their clothes to a separate dryer after washing. The built-in dryer could use advanced heat pump technology to efficiently dry clothes, while also minimizing energy consumption.",
    "Color-Changing Washing Machine: This idea involves creating a washing machine that can change its color to indicate the load's progress. For example, it could start out blue when it's empty, turn green when the wash cycle begins, and change to yellow when the wash cycle is halfway through. This would provide a fun and visually engaging experience for users, while also helping them keep track of their laundry's progress.",
    "Interactive Washing Machine: This idea involves creating a washing machine that can interact with users through voice commands or touch screens. For example, users could ask the washing machine to start a wash cycle, check the load's progress, or receive notifications when the cycle is complete. This would provide a convenient and hands-free way for users to control their laundry, while also adding an element of fun and interactivity to the experience.",
    "Washing Machine with Air Purification: This idea involves creating a washing machine that can also purify the air in the surrounding environment. For example, it could use advanced filters to remove dust, pollen, and other allergens from the air, providing a healthier and more comfortable living space for users. This would be especially beneficial for people with allergies or respiratory issues, as they could enjoy cleaner air while doing their laundry."
