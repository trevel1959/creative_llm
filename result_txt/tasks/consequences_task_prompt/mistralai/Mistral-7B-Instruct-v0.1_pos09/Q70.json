    "Reduced: The speed of light would be reduced by half, which would have a profound impact on the universe. Light is the fastest thing in the universe, and if it were to slow down, it would cause a ripple effect on everything else. It would take longer for light to travel through space, which would affect the way we observe and study the universe.",
    "Darkness: If the speed of light was reduced by half, it would become darker in space. This would be due to the fact that light is responsible for illuminating the universe. If light were to travel slower, it would take longer to reach us, and we would see less of it.",
    "Time dilation: If the speed of light was reduced by half, time would slow down for objects moving at the new speed of light. This would be known as time dilation, and it would affect the way we measure time. It would also affect the way we understand the universe, as time is a fundamental aspect of physics.",
    "Gravitational waves: If the speed of light was reduced by half, it would also affect the way gravitational waves are produced and detected. Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time that are caused by massive objects moving at of light. If light were to travel slower, gravitational waves would be produced at a slower rate, and we would be able to detect them more easily.",
    "Cosmic microwave background radiation: If the speed of light was reduced by half, it would also affect the cosmic microwave background radiation. The cosmic microwave background radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and it is one of the most important pieces of evidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang. If light were to travel slower, it would take longer to reach us, and we would see a distorted version of the cosmic microwave background radiation."
