    "Bicycle-Powered Electricity Generator: By attaching a generator to the bicycle's wheels, the rider's pedaling could be used to generate electricity. This could be a portable power source for charging electronic devices or running small appliances.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Pump: Attach a small pump to the bicycle's rear wheel, and the rider's pedaling could pump water or air into a storage tank. This could be useful for tasks like inflating tires, pumping water into a water storage system, or even providing air for an air mattress.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Lighting: Attach a small light bulb to the bicycle's rear wheel, and the rider's pedaling could generate electricity to power the bulb. This could be a portable, human-powered light source for illuminating paths at night or providing light in remote areas without access to electricity.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Music: Attach a small speaker to the bicycle's rear wheel, and the rider's pedaling could generate electricity to power the speaker. This could be a fun, eco-friendly way to listen to music while cycling, or it could be used to create a unique, human-powered musical instrument.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Charging Station: Create a network of bicycle-powered charging stations in public spaces. Riders could plug their devices into the charging station, and their pedaling would generate electricity to charge the devices. This would promote physical activity and reduce the need for traditional charging methods."
