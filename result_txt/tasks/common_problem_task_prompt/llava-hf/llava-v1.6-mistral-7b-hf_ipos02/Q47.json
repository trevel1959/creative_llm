    "**Lack of Technical Knowledge**: If the person building the computer is not familiar with the assembly process or lacks technical knowledge, they might struggle to put the computer together correctly. This could lead to incorrect connections, improper installation, or damage to the components.",
    "**Difficulty in Sourcing Parts**: The person may have difficulty finding the necessary parts to complete the build, especially if they are looking for specific or custom components. This could lead to delays and frustration as they search for the right parts or deal with unavailability.",
    "**Inadequate Tools**: A lack of proper tools, such as screwdrivers, pliers, or wire cutters, can make the assembly process more difficult and time-consuming. Additionally, using incorrect tools could potentially damage the components or create a less stable connection.",
    "**Overheating Issues**: If the person does not consider proper cooling solutions, the computer may overheat, leading to decreased performance or damage to the internal components.",
    "**Electrical Safety Concerns**: Building a computer from scratch involves working with electrical components, and if the person is not aware of electrical safety precautions, they could be at risk of electrical shock or short circuits."
