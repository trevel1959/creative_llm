    "**Pet Toy**: Beyond just being a toy for dogs, tennis balls can be repurposed for various pets. For instance, you can create a puzzle toy for cats by cutting a small slit in the ball and filling it with treats. The cat will have to bat the ball around to get the treats to fall out, providing mental stimulation and exercise.",
    "**Doorstop**: A tennis ball can serve as an effective doorstop. Simply cut a small slit in the ball and wedge it under a door. This not only keeps the door open but also prevents it from slamming shut during windy conditions. The bright color of the ball makes it easy to spot, too.",
    "**Piano Key Cleaner**: The felt of a tennis ball can be used to clean piano keys. By cutting the ball in half and using the flat side, you can gently scrub the keys to remove dust and grime without scratching the surface. The soft material ensures that the keys are cleaned effectively while maintaining their shine.",
    "**Cable Organizer**: You can create a simple cable organizer by cutting a slit into a tennis ball and inserting various cables into it. This prevents cables from tangling and makes it easier to find the right one when needed. You can also label each cable by writing on the ball with a permanent marker.",
    "**Shoe Freshener**: Tennis balls can help keep shoes fresh. Place a couple of tennis balls inside your shoes when you're not wearing them to absorb moisture and odors. The balls can also help maintain the shape of the shoes, especially if they are left for an extended period."
