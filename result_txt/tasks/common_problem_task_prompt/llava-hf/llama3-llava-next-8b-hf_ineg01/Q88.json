However, maintaining a consistent and professional image on social media can be challenging, especially when dealing with the constant scrutiny and criticism that comes with political campaigns.",
    "Media Coverage: Getting media coverage is important for any political campaign, but it can be difficult to secure positive coverage from mainstream media outlets. This can be especially challenging for new or less-established candidates who may not have a strong track record or a recognizable name.",
    "Volunteer Burnout: Running a successful political campaign requires a lot of hard work and dedication from volunteers. However, burnout can be a major issue if volunteers are not given enough support or recognition for their efforts. This can lead to volunteers becoming disengaged and less productive.",
