    "Permits and Regulations: Securing the necessary permits and adhering to local regulations is crucial for any public event. Organizers must ensure that they have the necessary permits for the venue, noise levels, and other logistical aspects of the festival. Failure to comply with regulations can lead to fines, legal issues, or even the cancellation of the event.",
    "Sound and Noise: Managing the sound levels at a music festival is essential to prevent disturbances to nearby residents or businesses. Noise complaints can lead to event shutdowns or legal issues. To address this, event organizers can implement sound barriers, monitor sound levels, and establish designated quiet areas.",
    "Safety and Security: Ensuring the safety and security of attendees is paramount. This includes crowd control, medical services, and emergency evacuation plans. Organizers must also be prepared to handle potential emergencies, such as medical emergencies, lost children, or security threats.",
    "Food and Beverage: Providing adequate food and beverage options for attendees is crucial for their comfort and enjoyment. Organizers must consider the dietary preferences and restrictions of the audience, as well as the logistics of setting up food vendors and managing waste disposal.",
    "Accommodation: If the festival is taking place in a location with limited accommodation options, event organizers may need to coordinate with nearby hotels or Airbnb hosts to ensure there is sufficient lodging for attendees. This can be challenging, especially if the event is popular and attracts a large audience."
