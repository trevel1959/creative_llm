    "**Smart Transportation System**: The city would feature a fully integrated smart transportation network that includes electric autonomous vehicles, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly walkways. Real-time data would be collected to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and minimize wait times. Public transport would be free to encourage its use, and all vehicles would run on renewable energy sources, significantly reducing the city's carbon emissions and making commuting more efficient and enjoyable.",
    "**Cultural Hubs and Art Districts**: The city would celebrate creativity by establishing dedicated cultural hubs and art districts that host galleries, theaters, and performance spaces. These areas would not only showcase local talent but also provide workshops and classes for residents to explore their artistic side. Monthly festivals would be held to celebrate various art forms, creating a vibrant atmosphere and fostering community spirit. Local artists would have opportunities to collaborate with schools, businesses, and community centers to inspire creativity in all age groups.",
    "**Sustainable Water Management**: To address water scarcity and promote sustainability, the city would implement a comprehensive water management system that includes rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and green infrastructure such as bioswales and permeable pavements. These features would not only manage stormwater effectively but also create beautiful landscapes. Public education campaigns would encourage residents to conserve water and adopt sustainable practices, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.",
    "**Inclusive Community Spaces**: The city would prioritize inclusivity by designing community spaces that cater to people of all ages and abilities. Parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities would be accessible and designed with input from diverse community members. Features such as sensory gardens, inclusive playground equipment, and quiet zones for relaxation would be integrated into public spaces, ensuring that everyone feels welcome and can participate in community activities.",
    "**Smart Energy Grid**: The city would utilize a decentralized smart energy grid that harnesses renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal. Each building would be equipped with solar panels and energy storage systems, allowing residents to generate and store their own energy. A community energy trading platform would enable neighbors to buy and sell excess energy, promoting collaboration and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This system would be supported by an app that allows residents to monitor their energy usage and optimize consumption."
