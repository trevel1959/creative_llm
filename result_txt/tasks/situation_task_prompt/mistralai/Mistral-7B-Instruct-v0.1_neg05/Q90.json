    "Desalination: In a scenario where there is no rain, one of the most viable options for collecting water is through desalination. This process involves removing the salt and other impurities from seawater to make it safe for consumption. With desalination, you can collect water from oceans, rivers, or even lakes.",
    "Harvesting fog: Another innovative way to collect water is through fog harvesting. This process involves capturing the moisture that condenses on surfaces, such as buildings, trees, or even the ground. Fog harvesting systems use materials like plastic sheets, which trap the moisture and collect it for later use.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: While it may seem like an obvious choice, rainwater harvesting is still a viable option even if there is no rain. By collecting rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces, you can store it for later use. This method can be particularly useful in areas where rainfall is sporadic or unpredictable.",
    "Condensation collection: Condensation is the process by which moisture collects on surfaces. By placing condensation collectors, such as cold traps or dew traps, in areas where there is high humidity, you can collect water from the condensation that forms on the surface.",
    "Wastewater treatment: Another option for collecting water is through wastewater treatment. This process involves cleaning and purifying wastewater from households, businesses, or even industrial facilities. By treating the wastewater, you can make it safe for consumption and use it for irrigation or other non-potable uses."
