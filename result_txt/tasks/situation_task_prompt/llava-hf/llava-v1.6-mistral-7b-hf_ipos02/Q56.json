    "**Augmented Reality (AR)**: AR technology could be used to create virtual mirrors that would allow people to see their own reflection in a digital interface. Users could take selfies, apply filters, and even try on virtual makeup or clothing. This could be a convenient and fun way to see one's reflection without the need for physical mirrors.",
    "**3D Scanning**: With advancements in 3D scanning technology, individuals could use it to create a 3D model of themselves. This model could then be viewed from various angles, giving them a different perspective on their own reflection. This could also be used for 3D printing purposes, allowing people to create physical copies of themselves.",
    "**Holographic Reflections**: Holographic technology could be used to create holographic projections of a person's reflection. These projections could be interactive, allowing individuals to manipulate their reflection in real-time. This could be a unique way to explore one's appearance and identity.",
    "**Social Media Reflections**: In a world without mirrors, social media platforms could introduce features that allow users to see their own reflection through the lens of their friends' posts. This could lead to a new form of social interaction, as individuals could share their reflections and engage with others' reflections in a more personal and intimate way.",
    "**Nature's Reflections**: Reflections could be found in nature, such as still water bodies or polished surfaces of rocks and trees.
