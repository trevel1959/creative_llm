    "**Adjustable Grip Technology**: Create ski poles with grips that can adjust their shape and size based on the skier's hand size and grip preference. This could involve a memory foam-like material that molds to the skier's hand, providing optimal comfort and reducing fatigue. The poles could also feature a heat-retaining material for cold weather, keeping hands warm during long runs.",
    "**Built-in Avalanche Safety Features**: Design ski poles that incorporate avalanche safety tools, such as a beacon or a mini shovel that can be deployed quickly in emergencies. The poles could have a compartment to store a small emergency kit with essentials like a whistle, first-aid supplies, and a small multi-tool. This would provide skiers with added safety and peace of mind when venturing into backcountry areas.",
    "**Modular Pole System**: Introduce a modular ski pole system where users can easily swap out components based on their skiing needs. For example, poles could have interchangeable tips for different terrains (powder, ice, groomed runs) or detachable sections that allow for adjustable lengths. This would cater to a variety of skiing styles and conditions, making the poles versatile for all skiers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop ski poles made from sustainable and biodegradable materials that do not compromise on strength and durability. Using bamboo or recycled aluminum could reduce the environmental impact of ski equipment. Additionally, a portion of the profits could be directed towards environmental conservation initiatives in ski areas.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Equip ski poles with LED lights that can be activated for low-light skiing conditions, improving visibility for the skier and others on the slopes. These lights could have different settings, such as steady, flashing, or colored lights, to signal the skierâ€™s intentions (like stopping or turning). This feature would enhance safety during dusk or nighttime skiing."
