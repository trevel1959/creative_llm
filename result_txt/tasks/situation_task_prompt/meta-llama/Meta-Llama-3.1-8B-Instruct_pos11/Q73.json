    "**Solar Umbrella**: Develop a lightweight, portable umbrella that captures and stores solar energy during the night, releasing it as a cooling breeze during the day. This umbrella would not only provide shade but also create a refreshing cooling effect, making it an ideal solution for hot days.",
    "**Misting Canopy**: Design a network of micro-sprinklers and a thin, breathable canopy that releases a fine mist to lower the surrounding temperature. This misting canopy would be powered by a small, solar-powered pump and could be easily installed in urban areas or even in backyards.",
    "**Shade-Creating Architecture**: Develop innovative building designs that incorporate large, overhanging roofs or awnings to provide natural shade. These structures could be designed with advanced materials that absorb and dissipate heat, keeping the interior cooler and more comfortable.",
    "**Personal Cooling Jacket**: Create a wearable, temperature-regulating jacket that uses phase-change materials to absorb and release heat. This jacket would be perfect for individuals who spend extended periods outdoors, providing a personal and portable solution for staying cool.",
    "**Smart Window Film**: Design a transparent, solar-powered window film that can change its tint in response to temperature changes. During hot days, the film would darken to block out sunlight, while during cooler days, it would become transparent to allow sunlight to enter. This film would be a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for buildings and homes. [/INST] "
