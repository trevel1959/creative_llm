Time constraints might lead to rushed decisions, compromising the depth of the narrative or the clarity of the message. This could result in a less impactful final product.",

Deciding how much to reveal about someone's private life, respecting cultural sensitivities, or handling confidential information responsibly can be complex. Violating someone's privacy or causing emotional distress might negatively impact the documentary's reception and the filmmaker's reputation.",
    "**Creative Control vs. Producer Pressure**: There can be a conflict between creative vision and the demands of producers, investors, or distributors. Balancing artistic integrity with commercial considerations can be challenging, potentially leading to compromises in storytelling. Filmmakers might feel pressured to make changes that detract from the authenticity or impact of the documentary.",
    "**Technological Limitations**: Advances in technology have opened up new possibilities for filmmaking, but they also present challenges. Keeping up with the latest equipment, software, and editing techniques can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, managing data storage, cybersecurity, and online distribution can be daunting for some filmmakers, especially those without technical expertise."
