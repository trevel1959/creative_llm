    "**Augmented Reality Viewfinder**: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) viewfinder that overlays useful information onto the live image. Photographers could see grid lines, composition guides, exposure settings, and even real-time editing suggestions while framing their shot. This feature would help users improve their composition skills and visualize how different settings affect the final image before they even press the shutter.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular camera system where users can customize their camera based on their specific needs. Components such as the body, grip, battery, and even the sensor could be swapped out or upgraded independently. This would allow photographers to adapt their equipment for different types of shoots, such as travel, sports, or studio photography, without needing to invest in entirely new cameras.",
    "**Integrated Drone Functionality**: Incorporate drone technology into the camera body, allowing it to detach and fly for aerial shots. This would enable photographers to capture unique perspectives without the need for additional equipment. The drone could be controlled via the camera interface, and advanced features like obstacle avoidance and GPS tracking could be included to ensure safe and effective operation.",
    "**AI-Powered Post-Processing**: Introduce an AI-powered post-processing feature directly within the camera. After capturing images, the camera could analyze the shots and suggest edits or enhancements, such as color correction, noise reduction, or cropping suggestions. Users could then apply these changes with a single button press, making the editing process more efficient and accessible.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Integrate solar panels into the camera body or accessories to allow for solar-powered charging. This would be particularly useful for outdoor photographers or travelers who may not have access to traditional power sources. The camera could charge while in use, extending shooting time without the need for extra batteries."
