    "Time dilation: If the speed of light were reduced by half, time would appear to slow down for objects moving at that speed. This means that time would pass more slowly for the object relative to a stationary observer, causing the object to experience time dilation. For example, if a spacecraft traveling at half the speed of light were to travel from Earth to the nearest star, it would take twice as long as it would if it were traveling at the speed of light.",
    "Length contraction: As an object approaches the speed of light, its length appears to contract. If the speed of light were reduced by half, the contraction effect would be more pronounced. This means that objects would appear shorter to an observer when moving at that speed. For instance, a spacecraft traveling at half the speed of light would appear shorter to an observer on Earth than it would if it were traveling at the speed of light.",
    "Energy conservation: The energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass. If the speed of light were reduced by half, the energy required to accelerate an object to that speed would increase. This means that less massive objects could not reach the reduced speed of light, and more massive objects would require more energy to accelerate to that speed. For example, a spacecraft with a mass of 1000 kg could not reach half the speed of light without a significant increase in energy output.",
    "Relativity of simultaneity: If the speed of light were reduced by half, the concept of simultaneity would become more complex. Two events that are simultaneous for an observer at rest would no longer be simultaneous for an observer moving at half the speed of light. This means that time dilation would occur for an observer moving at that speed, causing time to pass more slowly for the observer. For instance, if two events occurred simultaneously for an observer on Earth, they would not be simultaneous for an observer traveling at half the speed of light.",
    "Gravitational redshift: According to general relativity, the gravitational redshift occurs when an object emits light and the light is observed from a distance. If the speed of light were reduced by half, the gravitational redshift would be more pronounced. This means that the light emitted by an object would appear redder than it would if the speed of light were not reduced. For example, a planet orbiting a star would appear redder to an"
