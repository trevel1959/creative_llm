    "Society would grind to a halt: Without sleep, humans would struggle to function, leading to a breakdown in social and economic structures. Productivity and creativity would plummet, and accidents and mistakes would increase, causing chaos and confusion.",
    "Health problems would escalate: Lack of sleep would exacerbate existing health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The immune system would be weakened, making people more susceptible to illnesses, and mental health issues would worsen, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and suicide rates.",
    "Relationships would suffer: Sleep deprivation would cause irritability, mood swings, and a lack of empathy, leading to strained relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. Marriages and partnerships would struggle, and social connections would weaken, leading to a breakdown in society.",
    "Creativity would be stifled: Without the ability to dream and relax, creativity would be severely limited. Innovation and progress would slow, and the arts would suffer, as artists and musicians would struggle to find inspiration.",
    "The world would change in unexpected ways: In the absence of sleep, humans would adapt in unpredictable ways. Some might become hyper-focused and productive, while others would become aggressive and violent. Society would fragment into different groups, each with their own coping mechanisms, leading to a chaotic and ever-changing landscape."
