    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Develop a revolutionary self-cleaning coating for glasses that uses nanotechnology to repel dust, smudges, and water. This coating would utilize hydrophobic and oleophobic properties, ensuring that lenses remain clear and pristine without the need for constant cleaning. The coating could also be anti-fogging, providing users with a clear view in all conditions, from humid environments to temperature changes.",
    "**Interchangeable Frames**: Create a line of glasses with interchangeable frames that allow users to easily switch out the frame design based on their mood or outfit. Each frame could have a unique aesthetic, and the lenses could be easily swapped as well, making it easy to switch from prescription to sunglasses. This customizable approach would cater to fashion-conscious consumers and reduce the need for multiple pairs of glasses.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Incorporate health-monitoring technology into glasses, such as sensors that track eye strain, UV exposure, and even biometric data like heart rate or stress levels. The glasses could connect to a mobile app that provides insights and recommendations for eye health and overall wellness, reminding users to take breaks or adjust their screen time based on their activity levels.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**: Design a pair of glasses that can fold down into a compact size for easy portability. This innovative design would feature a hinge mechanism that allows the glasses to collapse into a small, protective case that fits easily in pockets or bags. This would appeal to travelers and those who need to carry multiple pairs of eyewear without taking up too much space.",
    "**Built-in Audio Technology**: Develop glasses with built-in bone conduction speakers that allow users to listen to music or take calls without the need for traditional headphones. This feature would provide a discreet and immersive audio experience while keeping the ears free for ambient sounds. The glasses could also have a noise-canceling feature, making them ideal for use in noisy environments."
