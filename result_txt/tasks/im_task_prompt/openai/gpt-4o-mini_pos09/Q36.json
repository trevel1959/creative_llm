    "**Modular Knife System**:    - Design a knife with interchangeable blades and handles, allowing users to customize their knife for different tasks. The handle could feature a locking mechanism to securely attach various blades (chef's, paring, serrated, etc.), making it easy to switch between them without needing multiple knives. This would save space in the kitchen and be environmentally friendly by reducing waste.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**:    - Develop a knife with a built-in self-sharpening mechanism. This could involve a small ceramic rod embedded within the handle that automatically sharpens the blade each time the knife is sheathed. This feature would ensure that the knife maintains its edge without the need for manual sharpening, making it more user-friendly and convenient for everyday use.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adaptive Handle Design**:    - Create a knife with a handle that adapts to the user's grip. Utilizing smart materials that mold to the shape of the hand when pressure is applied, this knife would provide maximum comfort and reduce the risk of slipping. The handle could also have a built-in grip texture that changes based on the user's hand moisture level, ensuring a secure hold during use.",
    "**Knife with Built-in LED Lighting**:    - Design a knife that incorporates LED lights along the spine of the blade. This feature would illuminate the cutting area, making it easier to see what you're slicing, especially in low-light conditions. The lights could be activated by a simple switch on the handle and could have different brightness settings, catering to various kitchen environments.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Knife**:    - Develop a knife made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that can break down after disposal. This knife would be perfect for outdoor enthusiasts and picnics, reducing plastic waste. The design could include a natural resin handle for comfort and a plant-based composite blade that remains sharp and functional during use but safely decomposes after its lifecycle."
