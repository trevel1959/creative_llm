People would embrace their choices, viewing them as learning experiences rather than burdens, ultimately fostering a culture of resilience and optimism.",

This could lead to a more compassionate society, where people are encouraged to learn from their experiences and support each other in their journeys toward self-improvement.",

    "**Shame**: The removal of shame could revolutionize how people view themselves and their actions.

The result would be a more accepting society that prioritizes mental health and well-being."
