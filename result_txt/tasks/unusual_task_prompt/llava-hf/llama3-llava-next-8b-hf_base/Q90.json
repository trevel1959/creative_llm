    "As a makeshift lice remover: Soak the corkscrew in hot oil to create a hot oil patch. Then apply it directly to lice-infested hair, where the corkscrew can help dislodge the lice more effectively than a hairbrush.",
    "As plant label marker: A corkscrew can be used to embed labels into hard-to-watermark terracotta pots or heavy planters. Screw the label in at a slight angle and use the corkscrew holes to puncture holes for drainage.",
    "As a bottle opener: For small glass bottles with stubborn corks, try inserting the corkscrew's tapered end into the cork and twisting it while tapping the cork with the handle to dislodging the cork. Remove and enjoy your drink.",
    "As a mini screwdriver: To assemble furniture or repair small objects, use the pointed tip of the corkscrew to insert screws into screws or nails, then the flat end to push them into the appropriate holes.",
    "As an anchor: For securing small screws into hard drywoods when not strong enough to hold, use the corkscrew as a pilot hole guide for your drill or screwdriver, allowing the screws to be driven more easily into the wood."
