    "**Vertical Farming**: Create a massive, wall-like structure made of a lightweight yet durable material, such as a metal or PVC frame, with a trellis system for climbing plants. This would allow for maximum space efficiency and exposure to sunlight. The structure could be designed to rotate, ensuring optimal sun exposure for the plants.",
    "**Hydroponic Greenhouse**: Build a large, transparent dome-shaped greenhouse that uses hydroponics to grow plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This would eliminate the need for digging and would also conserve water. The dome's shape would allow for even distribution of sunlight and would provide a controlled environment for the plants.",
    "**Aeroponic Garden**: Design a network of pipes and tubes that would circulate a nutrient-rich mist around the roots of plants, eliminating the need for soil. This would be especially effective for plants that thrive in well-draining conditions. The system could be suspended above the ground, allowing for easy maintenance and access.",
    "**Floating Garden**: Create a series of interconnected, buoyant platforms that would float on a large, shallow pond or lake. These platforms would be designed to support a variety of plants, and the water would provide a natural source of nutrients. The platforms could be made of a lightweight material, such as foam or recycled plastic.",
    "**Underwater Garden**: Design a large, submersible garden that would be placed beneath the surface of a lake or ocean. This would utilize the natural nutrients present in the water and would provide a unique environment for plants to thrive. The garden could be designed to be self-sustaining, with its own ecosystem and water circulation system."
