    "Change the size or shape. A lot of people use the post it for reminders, so reducing or increasing the size to remind them to do small or large things would increase reminders greatly. For example you make a note that's smaller so you're more inclined to pay attention to reminders when reading the note. On the other hand you could make a note bigger, so you know what it says. Or maybe instead of making notes bigger in general, you make specialized ones smaller, so people can make a list of things to buy with a mini paper on one side , and the list on the other so customers can check it on their way or while at home. A smaller size will also help people keep more notables, especially with phones being smaller by technology.",
    "If you wanted post It notes to only be used for reminding people, what would that change for them and for society? Would it increase the impact that the reminding has? And if not, what else can you change about it for your first choice( or something else for your 2nd).  1.\tIn terms of having reminders more often( more positive outcome of course), the bigger the notes of course to keep notes on everything that should be done. Smaller notes would get forgotten quickly; smaller is better for small, short term/time notes.",
    "Having the stickers as stickers, i.e instead of being made all separate, the pieces of different stuff (the rectangle shaped paper- sticks etc) could go together as bigger notes on a backing paper, not needing to glue anything. However, then these 'dangerous' glads would still be the same as glorifiers- but as stickers which mean that you can tear apart as and when, i.e the purpose is to bring down the glads. But, on the other hand, the purpose is not bringing the glas paper down.",
    "Change the backing too then. There will be notes, sticky or removable (and this is my best choice)- with the backing paper the colour of the nots so you can use different backed papers to differentiate where and how and why the notes were made",
    "Create a larger surface area note that doesn’t allow notes to go missing - The problem is keeping notes with sticky tabs, as when not glued down, they can be picked up, moved, etc and then forgotten. One example of a way to keep notes within view and easy to keep track of includes a magnetized box – if notes come with a magnetic strip or a strong enough paper with magnets, they can be placed upon/behind a magnetized backing. So that as they move the magnetized strips, they will stay in the magnetic backing and people will be able to easily access the note(s)"
