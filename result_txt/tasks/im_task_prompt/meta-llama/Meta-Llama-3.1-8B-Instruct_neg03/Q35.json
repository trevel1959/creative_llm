Visitors would wear VR headsets to fully immerse themselves in the experience. The museum would also feature interactive exhibits that allow visitors to learn about the mythology and history behind each lost city.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Floating City**: Design a sustainable floating city that can be built on a series of interconnected islands or a single large island. The city would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, and would feature advanced water management systems to minimize waste and pollution. The city would also incorporate green spaces, such as parks and gardens, to provide a natural oasis in the midst of urbanization. Visitors could take guided tours of the city to learn about its innovative design and sustainable features.",
    "**Interactive Light Festival**: Host an interactive light festival that takes place in a large, abandoned industrial space or a scenic outdoor location. The festival would feature a series of interactive light installations that respond to sound, movement, and touch. Visitors could walk through a tunnel of colorful lights that change pattern and color in response to their footsteps, or interact with a giant, glowing orb that reacts to their voice and gestures. The festival would also feature live music and performances that incorporate light and sound.",
    "**Virtual Reality Time Travel Experience**: Develop a VR experience that allows visitors to travel through time to different eras of history, such as ancient Egypt, the Wild West, or the Roaring Twenties.

Visitors could interact with virtual characters and objects, and even participate in historical events, such as a Roman gladiator battle or a medieval jousting tournament.",
    "**Sensory Deprivation Tank with Virtual Reality**: Create a sensory deprivation tank that combines floatation therapy with VR technology. Visitors would float in a tank of water that is heated to a comfortable temperature, and would wear a VR headset to immerse themselves in a virtual environment. The VR experience could be designed to enhance the relaxation and meditation benefits of floatation therapy, or could be used to treat anxiety disorders or PTSD. The tank would be designed to minimize distractions and maximize the sense"
