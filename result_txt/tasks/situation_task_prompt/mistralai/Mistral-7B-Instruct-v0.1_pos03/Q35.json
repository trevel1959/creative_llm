    "Use a scooter or a moped: If all bicycles disappeared, scooters and mopeds could be a viable alternative for transportation. They are smaller, more lightweight, and require less maintenance than bicycles. They can be easily maneuvered in traffic and can travel on most streets and bike paths.",
    "Use a walking bike: If you prefer to, you could consider using a walking bike instead of a bicycle. These bikes have larger wheels and are designed for longer distances, making them more comfortable to ride. They can also be more stable and easier to control than traditional bicycles.",
    "Use a motorized bike: If you need to travel longer distances or over rough terrain, a motorized bike could be a good option. These bikes are equipped with a small engine and can be pedaled like a regular bicycle or driven like a car. They can be more expensive than traditional bicycles, but they can save you time and effort.",
    "Use a public transportation system: If you don't mind sharing your transportation with others, you could consider using a public transportation system. Buses, trains, and subways can be convenient and affordable ways to get around without a car. However, they may not be as flexible or convenient as a personal vehicle.",
    "Use a ride-sharing service: If you need to travel quickly or to a specific location, you could consider using a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft. These services can be convenient and affordable, but they may not be as cost-effective as using a bicycle or public transportation for daily commutes."
