    "\"Time Traveler's Journal\": A fountain pen that doubles as a time capsule.

    "\"Glow-in-the-Dark\": A fountain pen that glows in the dark, allowing users to write in the dark without the need for a flashlight.

    "\"Sound Wave\": A fountain pen that converts handwriting into music. The pen would use a special type of ink that contains tiny sensors that detect the movement of the pen as it writes. These sensors would then transmit the data to a small speaker or earbuds, allowing users to hear the music they've created.",
    "\"Shape-Shifter\": A fountain pen that can change its shape and size to fit different writing styles and preferences. The pen would have a flexible body that can be bent and twisted to create different shapes and sizes, allowing users to customize their writing experience.
