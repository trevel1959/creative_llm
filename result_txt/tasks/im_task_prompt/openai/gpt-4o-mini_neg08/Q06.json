    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Create an umbrella with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV-C light to disinfect the fabric after use. The umbrella could have a small compartment that activates a cleaning cycle when it’s folded, ensuring that mold, mildew, and bacteria don’t accumulate on the fabric. This would be particularly useful in urban areas where pollution and grime can cling to the umbrella.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design with Adaptive Canopy**: Design an umbrella that can automatically adjust its canopy shape based on wind conditions. Using sensors, the umbrella could detect strong gusts and change its form to minimize resistance and prevent flipping inside out. This would make it much more durable and reliable during stormy weather.",
    "**Multi-Function Umbrella with Built-in Light and Charger**: This umbrella would feature a built-in LED light at the tip of the handle, providing illumination for nighttime walks. Additionally, it could have a small solar panel integrated into the canopy that charges a portable battery, allowing users to charge their devices while on the go. This combination would be perfect for camping trips or late-night outings.",
    "**Compact Folding Umbrella with Personalization Options**: Develop an umbrella that can be customized in terms of color, design, and size. Users could select patterns or even upload their own images to be printed on the canopy. The umbrella could also feature a compact folding design that fits easily into a backpack or purse, appealing to fashion-conscious individuals who want a unique accessory.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Umbrella**: Create an umbrella that can regulate temperature under its canopy. Using lightweight, reflective materials, the umbrella could keep the area beneath it cooler on sunny days. Additionally, it could have a built-in fan that operates on solar power to circulate air and provide a refreshing breeze, making it ideal for outdoor events or beach days."
