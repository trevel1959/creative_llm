    "In a forgotten forest, there stood an ancient tree rumored to grow diamonds instead of fruit. The villagers whispered tales of its magic, but none dared to approach. One day, a curious girl named Elara ventured into the woods. As she touched the bark, the tree shimmered, revealing a single diamond nestled among its leaves. Overjoyed, she plucked it gently, and the tree began to speak. “Take only what you need, for greed will wither me.” Elara returned home, sharing her treasure with the village, and the tree flourished, its diamonds becoming a symbol of generosity and harmony for all.",
