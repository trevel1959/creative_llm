    "**Overabundance of Ideas**: With genius-level intellects flooding the world, the sheer volume of ideas and innovations could lead to chaos rather than progress. While creativity and problem-solving would flourish, the challenge would lie in filtering and prioritizing these ideas. Society would need to develop new frameworks for evaluating and implementing innovations, perhaps creating think tanks or democratic platforms where citizens can vote on the most promising concepts to pursue.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas and Moral Responsibility**: A sudden increase in intelligence could lead to a surge in awareness of ethical dilemmas, particularly in areas like technology, genetics, and artificial intelligence. With enhanced cognitive abilities, individuals might grapple with complex moral questions that were previously overlooked. This could lead to a collective movement towards more ethical decision-making, but it could also create divisions among those who prioritize different ethical frameworks, leading to potential conflicts and societal unrest.",
    "**Increased Mental Health Challenges**: The sudden influx of intelligence could have unexpected psychological implications. Many individuals might struggle to cope with their new cognitive abilities, experiencing heightened anxiety, pressure to perform, or existential crises. Mental health resources would need to adapt rapidly to address these challenges, potentially leading to the development of new therapeutic practices that focus on managing genius-level intellect and the accompanying emotional complexities.",
    "**Global Collaboration and Conflict**: With everyone possessing the potential for genius, global collaboration could reach unprecedented levels. People from diverse backgrounds could unite to tackle major issues like climate change, poverty, and disease. However, this newfound intelligence could also lead to increased conflict, as differing ideologies and solutions clash. Nations might find themselves in intense debates over the best paths forward, leading to both innovative solutions and potential geopolitical tensions.",
    "**Education System Overhaul**: The traditional education system would require a complete overhaul to accommodate the new reality. With everyone being a genius, the focus of education would shift from rote memorization and standardized testing to fostering creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. Schools might transform into innovation hubs where students work on real-world problems, and teachers become facilitators rather than authoritative figures. The emphasis would be on lifelong learning and adaptability."
