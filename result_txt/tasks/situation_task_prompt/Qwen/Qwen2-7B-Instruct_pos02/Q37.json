    "**Inverted Wheelchair**: Design an inverted wheelchair that moves backward by using the rear wheels as the primary means of propulsion. This innovative solution would allow individuals to navigate backward by pushing themselves with their arms or hands. The design would incorporate a unique steering mechanism that allows for precise control while moving in reverse.",
    "**Gravity-Assisted Backward Roller**: Create a gravity-assisted roller that rolls backward down inclined surfaces. This device could be used in specific environments where gravity can be harnessed for movement. It would consist of a lightweight, self-balancing frame with wheels that can roll smoothly backward when placed on an incline. Safety features such as brakes and automatic stoppers would be included to prevent accidents.",
    "**Reversing Suitcase**: Develop a suitcase with built-in wheels and a retractable handle that allows the user to pull it backward. The suitcase would have a locking mechanism to secure items during backward movement and might include a small motor to assist in pulling, especially over rough surfaces. It would be particularly useful for travelers who need to move backward in tight spaces or crowded areas.",
    "**Backward-Pushing Skateboard**: Design a skateboard with a unique push mechanism that enables the rider to propel the board backward. This invention could involve a modified skateboard frame with an adjustable lever that the rider uses to push against the ground, causing the board to move in reverse. The skateboard would also feature a safety system to prevent accidental forward movement.",
    "**Remote-Controlled Inverted Vehicle**: Create a small, remote-controlled vehicle designed specifically for backward movement. This vehicle could be remotely operated from a stationary position, making it ideal for navigating through tight spaces or assisting people with limited mobility. It would be equipped with sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance, ensuring safe operation. The vehicle's design would prioritize simplicity and ease of use, focusing on intuitive controls and low maintenance requirements."
