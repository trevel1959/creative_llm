    "**Interactive Door with Augmented Reality (AR)**: Design a door that incorporates AR technology. When you approach the door with your smartphone or AR glasses, it could display useful information, such as the weather, your calendar events for the day, or even a friendly greeting from family members. This interactive experience could help you prepare for the day ahead while adding a fun, futuristic twist to the mundane act of opening a door.",
    "**Sound-Responsive Door**: Create a door that reacts to sound. This door would have built-in microphones that detect your voice or a specific sound pattern (like a clap). Upon recognition, the door could unlock or open automatically. Additionally, it could have soundproofing features that allow you to play calming sounds or music when you are inside, enhancing your privacy and creating a serene environment.",
    "**Artistic Door Panels**: Replace the plain surface of traditional doors with customizable panels that can be changed easily. These panels could be made from materials like canvas, wood, or metal and allow homeowners to swap out artwork or designs whenever they wish. This way, the door becomes a canvas for self-expression and creativity, showcasing different styles or themes throughout the year.",
    "**Biometric Security Door**: Upgrade the door with advanced biometric security features. Instead of traditional locks, this door could use fingerprint or retina scanning technology to grant access. This not only enhances security but also eliminates the need for keys, making it more convenient. The door could even learn the patterns of family members and allow access based on familiarity, creating a personalized experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Door with Plant Integration**: Design a door that incorporates a small vertical garden or planters. This eco-friendly door could feature slots or built-in pots for plants, promoting sustainability and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the entrance. The plants could also help with air purification and add a touch of nature to urban environments. This door would not only be functional but also contribute positively to the ecosystem."
