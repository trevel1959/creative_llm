    "Mind mapping: Mind mapping is a visual way of organizing information and ideas. It involves creating a central idea and branching out from there, connecting related concepts and ideas. Mind maps can be created on paper, but they can also be created digitally using tools like MindMeister or XMind.",
    "Audio recording: If there was no paper, we could use audio recording technology to capture important information. This could involve recording voice memos on our phones or using dedicated audio recorders. The advantage of this method is that we can capture not only our words but also our tone, inflection, and even body language.",
    "Photography: Photography is another way to capture important information. We could use our phones or cameras to take pictures of important documents, whiteboards, or other visual aids. This method has the advantage of creating a permanent record that can be easily accessed and shared.",
    "3D printing: If there was no paper, we could use 3D printing technology to create physical objects that represent important information. For example, we could create a 3D model of a product or a prototype, or we could create a 3D model of a building or a city. This method has the advantage of creating a tangible object that can be easily understood and shared."
