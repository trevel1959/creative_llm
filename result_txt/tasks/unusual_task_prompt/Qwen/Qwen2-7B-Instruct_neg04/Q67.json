    "**Innovative Camping Light System**: Design a flashlight that can be attached to various camping equipment such as tents or backpacks. It should have an adjustable brightness level and a motion sensor that turns the light on and off based on movement. Additionally, it could include a solar panel to recharge during daylight hours, making it an eco-friendly and reliable source of light for campers.",
    "**Emergency Multi-Tool Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that doubles as a multi-tool, incorporating features like a knife, screwdriver, bottle opener, and a seatbelt cutter. This would be especially useful in emergency situations where quick access to tools is necessary. The flashlight part should be bright and have a zoom function for better visibility at a distance.",
    "**Tactile Feedback Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that provides tactile feedback through vibrations or haptic responses when the user needs to adjust the brightness or change the mode (e.g., from white light to red night vision). This would be particularly helpful for visually impaired individuals who may need assistance in low-light conditions.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Flashlight**: Design a children's flashlight that comes with a series of interactive stories stored within its memory. By pressing different buttons, the flashlight tells a story while highlighting key moments in the story with specific visual effects or sound effects. This creates an immersive storytelling experience for children.",
    "**Smart Home Integration Flashlight**: Create a smart flashlight that can connect to a home automation system. When paired with a smartphone app, users can control the flashlight remotely, schedule automatic on/off times, or even use voice commands to turn it on or off. This would be beneficial for homeowners looking for a more convenient way to manage their lighting around the house."
