    "Impact on Ecosystems: The change in water salinity could have a profound impact on marine ecosystems, potentially leading to the extinction of many marine species that are adapted to saltwater.",
    "Flooding: The increased volume of freshwater could lead to more frequent and severe flooding in coastal areas, as the water level would rise significantly.",
    "Climate Change: The change in ocean salinity could have a significant impact on global climate patterns, potentially leading to more extreme weather events.",
    "Agriculture: The availability of freshwater could lead to a boom in agriculture, as freshwater is essential for growing crops.",
    "Energy Production: The change in ocean salinity could impact energy production, particularly in countries that rely on tidal or wave energy."
