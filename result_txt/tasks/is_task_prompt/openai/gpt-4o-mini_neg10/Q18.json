    "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, lived a clever fox named Felix. Unlike other foxes, Felix had no tail, having lost it in a daring escape from a hunter. Embarrassed, he hid from the other animals, fearing their laughter. One day, a gathering was called to discuss a threat to the forest. Felix, though hesitant, stepped forward and shared his cunning plan to outsmart the predator. The animals listened, inspired by his bravery. Together, they executed the plan, and the forest was saved. Felix learned that true worth isnâ€™t in appearances but in the courage to lead.",
