    "Community-based healthcare cooperatives: In the absence of doctors and medical facilities, communities could come together to form cooperatives where members share resources, knowledge, and expertise to provide mutual aid and support. These cooperatives could be organized around specific health needs, such as chronic illness management, mental health support, or emergency response. Members could work together to create a network of caregivers, including non-medical professionals like retired healthcare workers, volunteers, and community leaders.",
    "Online health resources and telemedicine: With the widespread availability of internet access, online resources and telemedicine platforms could become a vital tool for maintaining health. Patients could consult with licensed healthcare professionals remotely, accessing medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment through video conferencing or messaging platforms. This would enable patients to receive medical care without relying on physical clinics or hospitals. Additionally, online resources could provide educational content, healthy living tips, and mental health support, helping to empower individuals to take control of their health.",
    "Herbalism and traditional healing practices: In the absence of modern medicine, people might turn to traditional healing practices, such as herbalism, acupuncture, or homeopathy. These alternative approaches to healthcare have been used for centuries and could become more prominent in a post-doctor world. Communities could share knowledge and resources on the use of local plants, herbs, and other natural remedies for common ailments. This approach would require a renewed appreciation for the wisdom of indigenous cultures and traditional healing practices.",
    "DIY health monitoring and self-care: With the absence of medical professionals, individuals might take a more active role in monitoring their health. This could involve DIY health monitoring kits that include basic medical supplies, such as blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and glucometers. Patients could also learn to take their own vital signs, perform basic first aid, and recognize signs of serious illnesses. This self-reliance would require a shift in mindset, as people would need to take greater responsibility for their health and well-being.",
