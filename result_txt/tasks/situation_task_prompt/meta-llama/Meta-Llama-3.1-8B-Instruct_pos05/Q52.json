    "**Solar Oven**: Utilize a reflective surface, such as a mirror or aluminum foil, to concentrate sunlight onto a contained area. This would allow for cooking through the power of the sun. The contained area would be insulated to maintain a consistent temperature, ensuring even cooking.",
    "**Thermal Mass Cooking**: Employ a thermal mass, such as a stone or brick, to absorb and store heat from a fire or other heat source. Once heated, the thermal mass would be used to cook food by placing it in a sealed container or wrapping food in a heat-retentive material.",
    "**Steam Pit**: Create a steam pit by digging a hole and placing a container filled with water in the center. As the water heats up, steam would rise, cooking food placed above or around it. This method would require careful temperature control to prevent overcooking.",
    "**Charcoal Smoker**: Use a makeshift smoker by creating a small pit with a charcoal fire. Place food in a covered container or wrap it in leaves to cook slowly over low heat. This method would allow for a smoky flavor and tender meat.",
    "**Geothermal Cooking**: Harness the natural heat from the earth by digging a shallow hole and placing a container in it. As the earth's heat is transferred to the container, it would cook the food inside. This method would be most effective in areas with a high geothermal gradient."
