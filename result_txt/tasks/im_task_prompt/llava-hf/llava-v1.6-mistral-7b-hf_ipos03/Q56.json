    "Bicycle Bell with LED Lights: Add LED lights to the bicycle bell that change color based on the distance of approaching vehicles. Red for danger, yellow for caution, and green for clear. This would provide cyclists with an easy-to-understand visual warning system.",
    "Adjustable Volume Bicycle Bell: Design a bicycle bell with an adjustable volume knob, allowing cyclists to choose the loudness of the bell according to their preference and the noise level of the environment. This would cater to different cycling conditions and environments.",
    "Multi-Function Bicycle Bell: Combine the bicycle bell with a small air horn or whistle for added safety. The cyclist can switch between the bell and the horn/whistle depending on the situation, providing a versatile safety tool.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Integrated Speaker: Add a small, high-quality speaker to the bicycle bell that plays customizable alert tones. This would allow cyclists to personalize their bells and possibly even communicate with other cyclists.",
    "Bicycle Bell with Vibration Alert: Integrate a small vibration motor into the bicycle bell, which would vibrate the handlebars when the bell is activated. This would provide an additional tactile alert for the cyclist."
