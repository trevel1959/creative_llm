    "**Plastic Bottle Garden**: Transform empty plastic bottles into miniature gardens or terrariums. Cut the bottles to various sizes, punch holes for drainage, and fill them with soil. Plant small succulents or seeds, and decorate with stones, pebbles, and twigs for a unique indoor garden. This idea is creative because it repurposes waste into living art pieces that can enhance any space.",
    "**DIY Plastic Bottle Solar Still**: Build a solar still using plastic bottles to purify water in remote areas without access to clean water sources. Cut the bottles in half, invert one on top of the other, and use the cap as a lid. The inner bottle acts as a condenser, collecting water from the outside air. This innovative solution provides a sustainable method for water purification, making it an impactful idea.",
    "**Recycled Plastic Bottle Wind Chimes**: Collect plastic bottles and cut them into different lengths, then attach them to a wooden frame. Attach bells or other small objects to each bottle, and hang the chime outside for a musical outdoor decoration. This idea combines aesthetics with functionality, creating a pleasant sound when wind blows through.",
    "**Plastic Bottle as a Water Filter**: Create a simple water filter using plastic bottles filled with sand, gravel, and charcoal. This natural filtration system can be used to purify water before drinking, especially in areas with limited access to clean water. It's a low-cost and environmentally-friendly alternative to commercial water filters.",
    "**Plastic Bottle Solar Oven**: Design a solar oven by placing a dark-colored plastic bottle inside a reflective box made of aluminum foil or another reflective material. Use the bottle as a lens to focus sunlight onto food placed inside the oven. This ingenious idea can be used for cooking food with minimal energy input, promoting sustainability and reducing dependence on traditional energy sources."
