    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introducing a self-cleaning feature that uses high temperatures to incinerate food residue, similar to a self-cleaning feature in some modern ovens. This technology could be enhanced with a built-in cleaning cycle that activates after cooking, using a non-toxic, biodegradable cleaning agent that eliminates the need for harsh chemicals, making it safer for the environment and users.",
    "**Modular Oven Design**: A modular oven that allows users to customize their cooking experience by adding or removing different components based on their needs. For example, one module could be a steam oven, another could be a convection oven, and a third could be a traditional baking oven. Users could easily switch between modules, making the oven versatile for various cooking methods without taking up extra space.",
    "**Oven with Built-in Recipe Library and Display**: This oven could feature a touchscreen interface that not only displays recipes but also guides users through the cooking process step-by-step. It could include video tutorials, nutritional information, and the ability to save favorite recipes. Users could even connect to the internet to download new recipes or upload their own, creating a community around cooking.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Oven with Solar Power Option**: A design that incorporates solar panels on the exterior of the oven to harness renewable energy for cooking. This oven could significantly reduce energy consumption, particularly in sunny climates, and feature a battery system to store excess energy for use during cloudy days or at night. It would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce electricity bills.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Surface**: An oven with an interactive cooking surface that allows users to place ingredients directly on the surface for precise cooking. This could include features like induction heating or a built-in griddle that can be adjusted for different cooking techniques. The surface could also have smart sensors to detect the type of food being cooked and automatically adjust the temperature and cooking time accordingly."
