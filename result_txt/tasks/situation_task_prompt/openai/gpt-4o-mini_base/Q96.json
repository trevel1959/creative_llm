    "**Coral Garden Exploration**: With sand gone, the beach could be redesigned to emphasize underwater ecosystems. Tourists could snorkel or dive in specially curated coral gardens, where marine biologists lead tours to educate visitors about coral conservation. These gardens would be planted with vibrant corals and marine life, turning the beach into a living museum of underwater biodiversity.",
    "**Floating Platforms and Hammocks**: To replace the sandy area, large floating platforms could be constructed in the shallows, equipped with hammocks, sun loungers, and even mini-bars. Visitors could relax above the water, enjoying the gentle sway of the ocean while sipping cocktails and listening to live music from floating stages, creating a unique beach experience that combines relaxation with a vibrant social atmosphere.",
    "**Interactive Tide Pools**: Without sand, the focus could shift to creating interactive tide pools that mimic natural ecosystems. These pools would be designed with educational displays and touch tanks, allowing visitors to learn about marine life up close. Kids could engage in guided exploration sessions where they learn to identify different species, fostering a deeper appreciation for oceanic environments.",
    "**Beach Sports Redefined**: The absence of sand opens up possibilities for new beach sports. Areas could be designated for activities like paddleboarding, kayaking, or even beach volleyball on floating courts. Organized tournaments could attract enthusiasts, creating a competitive yet fun atmosphere. This would encourage a more active lifestyle while still enjoying the beach environment.",
    "**Ocean-Themed Eco-Parks**: Beachfront areas could be transformed into eco-parks that focus on ocean conservation and education. These parks could feature interactive exhibits, guided nature walks, and workshops on sustainable practices. Visitors could learn about the impact of pollution on marine life and participate in beach clean-up initiatives, turning their beach visit into a meaningful experience that contributes to environmental stewardship."
