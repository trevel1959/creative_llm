    "**Invisible Film Festival**: Create an immersive experience where viewers are surrounded by a series of screens displaying a continuous, uninterrupted film. The twist? The screens are placed in unexpected locations, such as bus shelters, streetlights, and building facades, making the film appear to be projected from nowhere. To enhance the experience, incorporate sound design that seems to emanate from the surroundings, making it difficult for viewers to pinpoint the source.",
    "**Augmented Reality Scavenger Hunt**: Design an interactive experience where participants use AR glasses or a mobile app to uncover hidden messages, images, or videos embedded in public spaces. The twist? Each discovery triggers a new challenge or puzzle that must be solved before moving on to the next location. This experience encourages exploration, collaboration, and creative problem-solving.",
    "**Sensory Deprivation Room**: Create a unique space where visitors are immersed in a sensory deprivation environment, stripped of visual and auditory stimuli. To enhance the experience, use ASMR triggers, gentle vibrations, or soothing scents to create a calming atmosphere. Participants can then gradually reintroduce sensory stimuli, observing how their perception of the space changes.",
    "**Interactive Light Installation**: Develop a large-scale light installation that responds to the environment and the people within it. Use sensors and machine learning algorithms to create an ever-changing display of colors, patterns, and shapes. The twist? The installation adapts to the emotions and behaviors of the people around it, creating a dynamic and empathetic relationship between the artwork and its audience.",
    "**Reverse Escape Room**: Design an escape room experience where participants are given a set amount of time to figure out how to **get in**, rather than escape. The room is designed to be impenetrable, with no visible entry points or clues. As participants try to find a way in, they'll uncover hidden mechanisms, puzzles, and red herrings, leading to a thrilling conclusion. This experience turns the traditional escape room on its head, requiring creative thinking and persistence."
