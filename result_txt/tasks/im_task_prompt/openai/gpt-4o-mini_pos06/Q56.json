    "**Multi-Function Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that also serves as a mini flashlight and a horn. The bell could have a built-in LED light that can be activated with a simple twist or push, providing visibility during night rides. Additionally, it could have a loud horn feature that can be activated for emergencies, making it a versatile safety tool.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Create a bicycle bell made from recycled materials or biodegradable plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists and promote sustainability in the biking community. The design could also feature artistic elements that showcase the recycled nature of the materials, making each bell unique.",
    "**Visual Alert System**: Develop a bicycle bell that includes LED lights that flash in conjunction with the ringing sound. The visual component would enhance visibility to pedestrians and drivers, especially in low-light conditions. Users could also choose different light patterns for various scenarios, such as a steady flash for warning or a quick blink for alerting.",
    "**Interactive Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that can record short messages or sounds that can be played back. Cyclists could record their own messages (e.g., “On your left!”) or choose from a selection of pre-recorded sounds. This feature could be particularly useful in busy areas where verbal communication is needed.",
    "**Adjustable Volume and Tone**: Design a bell with adjustable volume settings and tonal variations. Cyclists could control the volume based on their environment—louder for busy streets and softer for quiet parks. This feature would enhance the bell's usability and ensure that it is appropriate for various riding conditions."
