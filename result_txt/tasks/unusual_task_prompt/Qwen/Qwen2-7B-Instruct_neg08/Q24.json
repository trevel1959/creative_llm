    "**Jealousy-Neutralizing Toothbrush**:    Design a toothbrush that emits calming aromatherapy scents or sounds when used. The toothbrush could have built-in sensors to detect your mood (using a small heart rate monitor), and if it senses feelings of envy or stress, it would switch on a mode that diffuses lavender oil or plays soothing music. This could help alleviate feelings of jealousy as you brush.",
    "**Progressive Toothbrush**:    Create a toothbrush that visually tracks progress in completing tasks. As you use it, it could display a percentage or points indicating how many tasks you've completed. Seeing this progression might inspire a sense of accomplishment and diminish feelings of jealousy towards others who seem to be more productive.",
    "**Envy-Reflecting Mirror Toothbrush**:    Integrate a smart mirror into the toothbrush handle that reflects only the person using the toothbrush. This can be a way to remind users that their productivity is unique to them and not comparable to others. It can also provide motivational quotes or affirmations tailored to the user's goals.",
    "**Collaborative Toothbrush**:    Develop a toothbrush that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The app allows you to create virtual teams and track your productivity against others in the team. However, the twist is that the more you complete tasks, the more points you earn, which can then be used to \"buy\" virtual items for your toothbrush, creating a gamified environment that fosters healthy competition without envy.",
    "**Mindfulness Toothbrush**:    Design a toothbrush with haptic feedback and guided meditation sessions. After each brushing session, the toothbrush could guide you through a short mindfulness exercise, focusing on gratitude for what you have achieved rather than what others have accomplished. This could help shift your mindset from envy to appreciation and contentment."
