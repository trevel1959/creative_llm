    "Nature's Rhythm: Utilize the sun, moon, and stars as a natural timekeeping system. Observe the position of the celestial bodies to determine the time of day, dividing the day into 12 equal segments, each corresponding to a different phase of the celestial bodies. This method would require some knowledge of astronomy and the local time zone.",
    "Sand Timers: Create a series of sand timers with different amounts of sand, each representing a different unit of time. For example, a timer with 100 grains of sand could represent 100 minutes, while a timer with 600 grains could represent 600 minutes (10 hours). This method would require frequent refills and would not be as precise as other methods.",
    "Water Clocks: Create a series of water clocks, each with a different amount of water, representing different units of time. For example, a clock with 100 milliliters of water could represent 100 minutes, while a clock with 600 milliliters could represent 600 minutes (10 hours). This method would require frequent refills and would not be as precise as other methods.",
    "Shadow Clocks: Create a sundial that uses the shadow of a vertical stick or object to indicate time. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow of the stick will move, dividing the day into 12 equal segments. This method would require some knowledge of astronomy and the local time zone.",
    "Rhythmic Chants: Develop a series of chants or songs that correspond to different units of time. For example, a chant that lasts for 10 seconds could be accompanied by a specific hand gesture, while a chant that lasts for 60 seconds could be accompanied by a different gesture. This method would require some practice and memorization, but could be a fun and creative way to keep track of time."
