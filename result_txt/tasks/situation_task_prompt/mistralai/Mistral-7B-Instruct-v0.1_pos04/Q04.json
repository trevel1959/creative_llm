    "Develop alternative sources of natural resources: If all the world's forests disappeared, we would need to find alternative sources of natural resources. This could involve exploring new areas of the world to find untapped reserves, or developing new technologies to extract resources from the ground in a more efficient and sustainable way.",
    "Promote reforestation: We could focus on reforestation efforts around the world to replenish the lost natural resources. This could involve planting new trees in areas that have been deforested, or creating new forests in areas that have never been forested before.",
    "Encourage sustainable agriculture: We could encourage sustainable agriculture practices that use less land and resources, such as vertical farming or hydroponic farming. This would help to reduce the demand for resources that are currently being used unsustainably.",
    "Develop new materials: We could invest in research and development to create new materials that are more sustainable and efficient. This could include developing new types of plastics or other materials that are made from renewable resources.",
    "Implement circular economy principles: We could implement circular economy principles to reduce waste and promote the reuse of resources. This could involve designing products and systems that are more durable and repairable, and encouraging people to recycle and reuse materials whenever possible."
