    "**Smart Brush with Personalized Oral Health Coaching**: Develop an electric toothbrush that comes with a built-in AI-powered coach. This coach analyzes the user's brushing habits, provides real-time feedback, and offers personalized oral health advice based on their specific needs. The coach could be integrated into the toothbrush handle, using voice commands or a companion app to communicate with the user.",
    "**Glowing Brush Head with Micro-LED Display**: Design an electric toothbrush with a glowing brush head that displays a mesmerizing light show while brushing. The light patterns could be programmed to simulate a relaxing ocean wave, a soothing forest, or even a fun game to keep kids engaged. This feature would not only make brushing more enjoyable but also provide a fun way to track progress and stay motivated.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flosser**: Create an electric toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser, making it a one-stop solution for oral hygiene. The water flosser would use a combination of gentle water pressure and targeted jets to remove food particles and plaque from between teeth and below the gumline. This feature would be especially beneficial for individuals with sensitive teeth or those who struggle with traditional flossing.",
    "**Toothbrush with Real-Time Plaque Detection**: Develop an electric toothbrush that uses advanced sensors to detect and track plaque buildup in real-time. The toothbrush would provide instant feedback on areas where plaque is most prevalent, allowing users to adjust their brushing technique and focus on those specific spots. This feature would help prevent tartar buildup and promote healthier teeth and gums.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Air Purification**: Design an electric toothbrush that comes with an integrated air purification system, which captures and removes airborne bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can contaminate the mouth. This feature would be particularly useful for individuals with weakened immune systems or those who spend a lot of time in polluted environments. The air purification system could be powered by the toothbrush's battery or a separate power source."
