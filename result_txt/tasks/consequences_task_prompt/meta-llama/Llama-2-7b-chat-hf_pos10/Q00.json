    "Mental Health Concerns: Humans rely on sleep to maintain their mental health, and without it, they may experience severe psychological repercussions. The inability to sleep could lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. The constant lack of rest could cause irritability, mood swings, and even suicidal thoughts. The absence of sleep could also exacerbate existing mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.",
    "Physical Health Decline: Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining physical health, and a lack of sleep could have severe consequences. The body's natural repair processes occur during sleep, and without it, the immune system may weaken, leading to a higher risk of illnesses like the common cold and flu. Prolonged sleep deprivation could also cause cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and an increased risk of obesity.",
    "Impaired Cognitive Function: Sleep is essential for cognitive function, and a lack of sleep could significantly impact cognitive abilities. Memory consolidation, problem-solving skills, and decision-making capabilities could all suffer. The inability to sleep could lead to confusion, difficulty concentrating, and a decreased ability to learn new information.",
    "Social Isolation: Without the ability to sleep, humans may struggle to maintain social relationships. The constant fatigue and irritability could make it challenging to interact with others, leading to social isolation and loneliness. The inability to participate in social activities or maintain a job could result in financial difficulties and further exacerbate the lack of sleep.",
    "Economic Consequences: A global loss of sleep could have significant economic consequences. The inability to work or participate in daily activities could lead to a decline in productivity and economic output. The lack of sleep could also impact the healthcare system, as the increased demand for mental health services could strain resources. The tourism and travel industries could also suffer, as people may no longer be able to take vacations or travel for leisure due to the constant fatigue."
