    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Instead of just using a tennis ball as a fetch toy, you can create an interactive pet toy. Cut a small opening in the ball and fill it with treats. Your dog or cat will have to roll and manipulate the ball to get the treats out, providing both physical exercise and mental stimulation.",
    "**Wipe Holder**: Use a tennis ball as a creative holder for cleaning wipes. Cut a slit in the ball and insert a roll of cleaning wipes. The ball can be placed on a counter or hung up, allowing you to pull out a wipe from the opening easily while keeping the rest of the roll clean and dry.",
    "**Garden Plant Protector**: Cut a tennis ball in half and place the halves over the tops of garden stakes. This will create a protective cap that prevents injury to hands or pets when they brush against the stakes. The bright color also serves as a visual cue to help you remember where the stakes are placed.",
    "**Door Stopper**: Cut a small slit in the tennis ball and slide it onto the edge of a door. This not only acts as a door stopper to prevent slamming but also protects the wall from damage. You can even paint or decorate the ball to match your home decor.",
    "**Racket Grip Enhancer**: If you find your tennis racket grip too slippery, cut a tennis ball in half and use the inner side as a grip enhancer. The textured surface provides extra traction and comfort while playing, helping to reduce the chances of slipping during intense matches."
