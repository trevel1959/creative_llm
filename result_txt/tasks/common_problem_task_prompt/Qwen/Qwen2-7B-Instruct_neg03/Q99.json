    "**Enhanced Braille Display**: Develop a wearable device that translates digital text into braille, providing real-time feedback to the user. The device would feature an array of small tactile buttons that can be activated by vibrations or sound to convey the letters of the text. This would allow visually impaired individuals to read digital content such as emails, messages, and online articles in real-time.",
    "**Tactile Navigation System**: Create a smart cane with embedded sensors that can detect obstacles and map out the surroundings using ultrasonic or laser technology. The cane would vibrate or emit sounds at different intensities depending on the distance and type of obstacle. Additionally, it could provide audio guidance on how to navigate around the obstacle, helping users to safely move through their environment.",
    "**Audio-Enhanced Virtual Reality**: Design a VR system specifically tailored for the visually impaired, where the environment is described through sound instead of visuals. The VR headset would include microphones that capture the environment's sounds and then translate them into a spatial audio experience. Users could explore virtual worlds by listening to the sounds they create and interact with objects based on the audio cues provided.",
    "**Emotion-Driven Voice Interaction**: Develop a voice assistant that uses artificial intelligence to interpret the emotions behind spoken words and respond accordingly. For visually impaired individuals, this could help in better understanding the context and tone of conversations, making interactions more meaningful and less confusing. The assistant would analyze speech patterns, intonation, and other vocal cues to determine the emotional state of the speaker and adjust its responses appropriately.",
    "**Adaptive Text-to-Speech Reader**: Create a mobile app that automatically detects the reading level of the user and adjusts the text-to-speech output accordingly. The app would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the complexity of the text and tailor the reading speed, pronunciation, and emphasis to suit the user's needs. This would enable visually impaired individuals to read a wide range of texts, from simple children's books to complex academic papers, with ease and confidence."
