    "Eco-Friendly Power Stations: Create small, portable power stations that run on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. These stations can be used to charge electronic devices, power homes, and provide lighting during power outages.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Clothing: Develop clothing with built-in energy-harvesting technology that captures and converts kinetic energy from movement into electricity. This could be used to power small devices, like smartphones or fitness trackers, or even to charge larger devices like laptops.",
    "Community-Powered Microgrids: Create microgrids that are powered by a combination of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, and are connected to the local community. These microgrids can provide a reliable source of power during outages and can also be used to charge electronic devices.",
    "Bioluminescent Lighting: Develop lighting systems that use bioluminescent organisms, such as glowworms or fireflies, to provide lighting. These systems can be used in homes, offices, or public spaces and can provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional lighting sources.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Roads: Create roads that can harness and convert kinetic energy from traffic into electricity. This energy can then be used to power electronic devices or to charge electric vehicles. This innovative solution can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and provide a sustainable source of energy."
