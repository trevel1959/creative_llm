By observing the time of the next noontide, we could determine the time of day.",
    "celestial bodies: We could use celestial bodies such as the moon and stars to keep track of time. The moon's phases can be used to determine the time of day, and the stars can be used to determine the time of year.",
    "GPS: GPS technology can be used to keep track of time. The GPS system uses a network of satellites to determine the time of a location.",
    "Radio waves: Radio waves can be used to keep track of time. Radio stations broadcast the time on a regular basis, and we can use a radio receiver to determine the time.",
    "Vibration: We could use the vibrations of objects to keep track of time. For example, we could use the vibrations of a pendulum to determine the time of day."
