    "Car-Sharing App: Create a mobile app that allows users to rent out their personal cars to others in their area. The app could be designed to facilitate easy communication and transactions between car owners and renters, with features such as real-time availability, pricing, and messaging. This would provide an alternative to traditional car-sharing services, which often have limited availability and high fees.",
    "Smart Car Seat: Develop a car seat that incorporates advanced technology to improve safety and convenience. For example, the seat could have built-in sensors that detect when a child is properly buckled in and alert the driver if the child is not secured properly. The seat could also have a built-in entertainment system, such as a tablet or games, to keep children occupied during long car rides.",
    "Automatic Car Wash: Create a car wash system that uses robotics and AI to automate the car wash process. The system could use cameras and sensors to detect dirt and debris on the car and use robotic arms to clean it. The system could also use AI to optimize the cleaning process based on the type of car and the weather conditions. This would provide a more efficient and effective car wash experience than traditional car washes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.",
    "Car-to-Car Communication System: Develop a system that allows cars to communicate with each other and share information such as traffic conditions, road closures, and parking availability. The system could use a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity to enable real-time communication between cars. This would improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, making driving safer and more efficient.",
    "Solar-Powered Car: Create a car that is powered by solar panels, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. The car could have a sleek and aerodynamic design to maximize the amount of sunlight that can be absorbed by the solar panels. The car could also have advanced battery technology to store excess energy generated by the solar panels for use during periods of low sunlight. This would provide a practical and environmentally friendly mode of transportation that reduces reliance on fossil fuels."
