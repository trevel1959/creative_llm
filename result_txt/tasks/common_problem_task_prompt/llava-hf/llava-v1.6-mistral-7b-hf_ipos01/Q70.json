    "**Cultural Sensitivity:** Different cultures have different norms and values, which can sometimes cause conflict in the workplace. This can be particularly problematic in a multicultural environment where employees come from diverse backgrounds. To address this, the company could implement cultural awareness training to help employees understand and respect each other's cultural differences.",
    "**Inclusion and Participation:** Employees who are not fluent in the primary language of the workplace may feel excluded or struggle to participate in meetings and discussions. This can lead to a lack of input and innovation from these employees. To overcome this, the company could provide interpreters or use video conferencing technology with translation capabilities.",
    "**Language Barriers in Customer Service:** If the company deals with customers from different cultures, language barriers can create difficulties in providing effective customer service. To address this, the company could train customer service representatives in multiple languages or provide translation services for customer interactions.",
    "**Marketing and Advertising:** Advertising campaigns that are not culturally sensitive or appropriately translated can offend potential customers from different cultures. To overcome this, the company could conduct market research in different cultures and tailor their marketing and advertising campaigns accordingly.",
    "**Recruitment and Hiring:** If the company recruits from a diverse pool of candidates, language barriers can make it difficult to assess a candidate's qualifications and fit for the company. To address this, the company could provide language proficiency assessments or conduct interviews in the candidate's native language."
