    "**Augmented Reality Vision Enhancement**: Develop an AR system that overlays virtual images on the real world to help people with poor vision see their surroundings more clearly. This could involve creating 3D maps, enhancing colors and contrasts, or even augmenting objects with labels or descriptions.",
    "**Smart Braille Gloves**: Create gloves equipped with sensors that detect the shape of objects in the environment and convert them into Braille messages that can be felt by users. This would allow individuals with poor vision to interact with the world more intuitively and safely.",
    "**Tactile Navigation Paths**: Implement a system where the ground is covered with different textures, each representing a specific type of object or location. For example, smooth surfaces could indicate walls, rough textures could represent furniture, and raised lines could lead to doorways or stairs. This tactile navigation would enable people with poor vision to move around independently.",
    "**AI-Driven Voice Guidance Systems**: Develop AI-powered voice assistants that describe the environment around the user in detail. The system could recognize and identify objects, provide directions, and give warnings about potential obstacles. This would offer a dynamic and personalized solution for navigating both familiar and unfamiliar spaces.",
    "**Interactive Sensory Experiences**: Design wearable devices that stimulate various senses (e.g., sound, touch, vibration) to convey information about the environment. For instance, when approaching a step, the device could vibrate or produce a specific sound pattern to alert the user. This approach would require a sophisticated understanding of how to interpret visual cues through other senses."
