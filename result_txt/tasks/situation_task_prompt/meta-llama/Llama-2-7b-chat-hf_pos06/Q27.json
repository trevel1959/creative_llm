    "Build a greenhouse: A greenhouse is a great way to regulate indoor temperature without using heaters or air conditioners. You can use transparent plastic or glass walls and a roof to trap heat from the sun during the day and release it at night. This will help maintain a comfortable temperature inside. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use passive solar design: By designing your home with passive solar principles in mind, you can take advantage of natural heating and cooling. For example, you can use south-facing windows to capture sunlight during the winter and absorb heat, while using shades or blinds to block out the sun during the summer to keep the house cool. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Implement a geothermal system: If you have access to a natural hot spring or geothermal reservoir, you can use this heat to regulate your indoor temperature. A geothermal system involves installing a loop of pipes underground that absorbs heat from the earth and transfers it to your home for heating and cooling. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Utilize phase change materials: Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that can absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. You can use PCMs in walls, floors, or ceilings to absorb heat during the day and release it at night, helping to maintain a comfortable temperature. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Build a radiant floor heating system: A radiant floor heating system involves installing heating elements, such as pipes or electric mats, under the floor to warm the space. This can be an efficient and comfortable heating solution, especially in well-insulated homes. Confidence score: 0.95"
