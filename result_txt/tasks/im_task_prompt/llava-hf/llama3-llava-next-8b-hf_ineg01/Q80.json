    "Multifunctional Whisk: Develop a whisk with interchangeable heads, allowing users to perform various tasks with a single tool. For example, a soft silicone head for delicate batters, a stainless steel head for thicker mixtures, and a wire whisk head for efficient egg beating.",
    "Whisk with Built-in Timer: Create a whisk that incorporates a built-in timer to ensure precise measurements for recipes that require precise timing. The timer could be set to a specific duration or activated by a button.",
    "Smart Whisk: Design a smart whisk that connects to a mobile app, allowing users to track their whisking progress and receive notifications when the desired consistency is reached. The app could also include recipe suggestions, cooking tips, and even a timer.",
    "LED Lighted Whisk: Add an LED light to the whisk handle, providing illumination in dark kitchens or for precise measurement of small quantities. The light could also be adjustable for different brightness levels.",
    "Whisk with Attachable Strainer: Combine the functions of a whisk and a strainer by adding a removable strainer head to the whisk. This would allow for efficient removal of lumps and particles while whisking."
