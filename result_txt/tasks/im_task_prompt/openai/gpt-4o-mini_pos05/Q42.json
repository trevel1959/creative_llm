    "**Modular Compartments**: Design the suitcase with removable, modular compartments that can be customized based on the traveler's needs. For instance, one compartment could be dedicated to clothing, another for electronics, and another for toiletries. These compartments could be swapped out or rearranged, allowing for personalized organization and ease of access.",
    "**Built-in Charging Station**: Incorporate a built-in solar charging panel on the exterior of the suitcase along with USB ports inside. This feature would allow travelers to charge their devices on-the-go, especially during long layovers or while waiting at the airport. The suitcase could also have a battery backup for use in low-light conditions.",
    "**GPS Tracking and Anti-Theft Features**: Equip the suitcase with GPS tracking technology that can be monitored via a smartphone app. Additionally, integrate anti-theft features such as a locking mechanism that can only be unlocked via a biometric scan (like a fingerprint) or a smartphone app. This would provide peace of mind for travelers concerned about luggage theft.",
    "**Self-Driving Capability**: Develop a suitcase that can follow the traveler autonomously. Using advanced sensors and navigation technology, the suitcase could detect the owner's location and follow them around the airport or train station, reducing the burden of carrying or pulling it along.",
    "**Weather-Resistant and Climate-Controlled Compartments**: Construct the suitcase using weather-resistant materials and include climate-controlled compartments for sensitive items like electronics or cosmetics. This feature would protect valuable belongings from extreme temperatures or humidity during travel."
