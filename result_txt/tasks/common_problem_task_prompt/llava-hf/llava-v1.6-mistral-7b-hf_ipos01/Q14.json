    "**Safety Concerns**: High-rise buildings are inherently risky structures due to their height and the number of people working at heights. Falling debris, scaffolding accidents, and structural failures can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. Implementing strict safety protocols and using the latest safety equipment is essential to minimize these risks.",
    "**Energy Efficiency**: High-rise buildings consume a significant amount of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting. Designing a building with energy efficiency in mind, such as using energy-efficient windows, insulation, and lighting systems, can help reduce the building's overall energy consumption and lower operating costs.",
    "**Accessibility**: Ensuring that a high-rise building is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is a critical issue. This includes providing ramps, elevators, and clear signage to facilitate easy navigation throughout the building.",
    "**Material Sourcing**: The sourcing of materials for a high-rise building can be a challenge. Sustainable and environmentally-friendly materials should be used whenever possible. Additionally, the sourcing of these materials can have a significant impact on the local economy and global supply chains.",
    "**Community Impact**: High-rise buildings can change the landscape of a neighborhood and impact the community in various ways. This includes issues such as increased traffic, reduced parking availability, and changes to the local character of the area."
