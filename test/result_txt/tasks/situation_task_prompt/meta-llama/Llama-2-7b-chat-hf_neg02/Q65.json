    "Mirrors as Light Sources: One creative solution to light up a room without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use mirrors as light sources. By positioning mirrors in strategic locations around the room, you can reflect natural light from windows or other sources, illuminating the space. For example, placing a mirror opposite a window can help to double the amount of light entering the room, providing a brighter and more illuminated space.",
    "Glowing Plants: Another option is to use glowing plants to light up a room. Certain plants, such as glowing mushrooms or plants with bioluminescent properties, can provide a soft, natural light in the absence of artificial lighting. These plants can be placed around the room to create a soft, ambient glow, providing a unique and sustainable lighting solution.",
    "Light-Emitting Walls: Another creative solution is to use light-emitting walls to illuminate a room. By incorporating LED strips or other light-emitting materials into the walls, you can create a subtle, ambient light that provides sufficient illumination without the need for traditional lighting fixtures. This can be especially useful in rooms with high ceilings or large windows, where traditional lighting fixtures may not be effective.",
    "Holographic Lighting: For a more futuristic solution, you could use holographic lighting to illuminate a room. By projecting holographic images of light sources onto walls or other surfaces, you can create the illusion of a lit space without the need for actual lighting fixtures. This can be achieved through the use of holographic technology, which can project 3D images into space.",
    "Sunlight Harvesting: Finally, you could use sunlight harvesting technology to light up a room during the day. By incorporating solar panels or other sunlight-harvesting devices into the room, you can store energy from the sun during the day and use it to power lighting fixtures at night. This can provide a sustainable and renewable source of lighting, reducing the need for artificial lighting sources."
