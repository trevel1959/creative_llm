    "Size and Shape: The relative sizes and shapes of objects can also be used to differentiate between them. For instance, a long, narrow object like a pencil can be distinguished from a round, circular object like a ball.",
    "Material: The material of an object can also be a distinguishing factor. A shiny metal object can be differentiated from a soft fabric object.",
    "Function: The function of an object can provide clues about its identity. For example, a book can be identified by its cover and spine, which can be seen even in black and white.",
    "Context: The context in which an object is placed can also help differentiate between it and other objects. For instance, a person holding a book in a library can be differentiated from a person holding a book in a kitchen.",
    "Light and Shadow: The play of light and shadow can create contrasts and highlights that can be used to identify objects. For example, the shadow of a tree on the ground can be used to identify the tree."
