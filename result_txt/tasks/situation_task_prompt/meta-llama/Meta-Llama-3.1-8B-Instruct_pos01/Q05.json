    "**Solar Power Storage**: Develop a device that can store solar energy during the day, allowing for a backup power source when the sun doesn't rise. This could be achieved through advanced battery technology or even a new type of supercapacitor.",
    "**Luminescent Paint**: Create a special type of paint that can absorb and store energy during the day, emitting a soft glow at night. This could be applied to buildings, streets, or even personal items like clothing.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Engineer plants that can produce their own light through bioluminescence, providing a natural and sustainable source of illumination. This could be achieved through genetic modification or the introduction of specialized microorganisms.",
    "**Quantum Dot Lighting**: Develop a new type of lighting system using quantum dots, which can be powered by a small amount of energy and emit a high-intensity light. This could be used to illuminate entire cities or communities.",
    "**Atmospheric Energy Harvesting**: Design a system that can harness energy from the Earth's atmosphere, such as wind, thermal gradients, or even the kinetic energy of falling water. This could provide a reliable and sustainable source of power for lighting and other applications."
