    "**Developing Renewable Energy Solutions:** You could focus on creating or improving renewable energy solutions that could be used in areas without access to electricity. This could involve developing solar panels that are more efficient, portable, and affordable. You might also explore wind turbines that can be used in various settings, even in remote locations. Additionally, you could work on creating energy storage systems that can efficiently store energy generated from these sources.",
    "**Innovative Lighting Solutions:** Since lighting is a major issue in living without electricity, you could develop new lighting solutions that don't require an electrical grid. For example, you might create self-sustaining bioluminescent plants or insects that can provide light at night. Alternatively, you could invent new types of oil lamps, candles, or other forms of lighting that are highly efficient and safe for use in low-light conditions.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Construction Techniques:** With no electricity, traditional building techniques may not be practical. You could research and develop energy-efficient construction methods that rely less on electricity, such as passive solar design, which uses the sun's energy to heat and cool buildings naturally. This might include designing buildings with large windows to maximize natural light, strategically placed shading elements, and materials that have high thermal mass to maintain internal temperatures.",
    "**Emergency Communication Devices:** Without electricity, communication becomes a significant challenge. You could create or improve upon devices that enable communication during power outages. This might involve developing low-power electronic devices that use alternative energy sources like kinetic energy (from motion) or thermoelectric generators (from temperature differences). These devices could help people stay connected during emergencies or in remote areas where electricity is unreliable.",
    "**Eco-friendly Transportation Solutions:** Living without electricity affects transportation as well. You could focus on developing eco-friendly, electrically independent modes of transportation. This could include designing bicycles with built-in power generators that convert pedaling into electricity, or creating electric cars that can recharge using kinetic energy from their own movement or by harvesting energy from the road surface through conductive plates. Additionally, you could work on creating efficient, lightweight, and durable materials for constructing vehicles that reduce the need for electricity in powering them."
