    "Water sports and coastal exploration: As mountains are often associated with water bodies, the loss of these would lead to an increase in water sports and coastal exploration. Beaches, lakes, and rivers would become the new playgrounds for kayaking, paddleboarding, windsurfing, and snorkeling.",
    "Rock climbing and urban climbing: In the absence of mountains, rock climbing would need to adapt to urban environments. City skyrises and walls would become the new terrains for rock climbing, urban bouldering, and street art.",
    "Desert exploration: With mountains gone, deserts would expand and become the new frontier for desert exploration. Sand dunes would offer opportunities for sandboarding, sandkiting, and sand yoga.",
    "Virtual reality and augmented reality experiences: In a world without mountains, virtual and augmented reality experiences would become the new way to explore the outdoors. These technologies could recreate mountainous terrains and allow users to experience the beauty of the natural world from the comfort of their homes.",
    "Inland cave exploration: With mountains gone, inland caves would become the new attraction for spelunkers and cave explorers. These caves would offer unique opportunities for cave diving, zip-lining, and cave photography."
