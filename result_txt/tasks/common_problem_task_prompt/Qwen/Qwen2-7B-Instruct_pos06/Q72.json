    "**Innovative Solar Farm Integration with Vertical Urban Agriculture**: Combine a solar farm with vertical farming techniques in urban areas. The solar panels serve as the base for growing crops vertically, maximizing land use efficiency while generating clean energy. Water from the irrigation can be used for cooling the solar panels, reducing energy consumption. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Geothermal-Powered Aquaculture Farms**: Use geothermal energy to heat or cool aquaculture farms, ensuring optimal water temperatures for fish and other aquatic species. This not only supports sustainable food production but also reduces the carbon footprint of traditional farming methods. Confidence Score: 0.92",
    "**Wind Turbine Integration with Community Spaces**: Develop wind turbines that are integrated into community spaces like parks, schools, and libraries. These turbines can serve dual purposes - providing clean energy and serving as educational tools for the public about renewable energy. Confidence Score: 0.90",
    "**Hydropower from Urban Stormwater Management**: Implement hydropower systems in city stormwater management infrastructure. As rainwater collects in reservoirs, it can be harnessed to generate electricity. This not only provides a clean energy source but also helps manage stormwater effectively, preventing flooding and improving water quality. Confidence Score: 0.88",
    "**Biomass Energy from Urban Waste Streams**: Establish facilities that convert organic waste (from households, businesses, and agriculture) into biogas through anaerobic digestion. The biogas can then be used to generate electricity and heat. This approach reduces landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions, making it an efficient solution for both energy production and waste management. Confidence Score: 0.86"
