    "**Scheduling Conflicts**: With multiple films to be screened at the same time, scheduling conflicts may arise, particularly if popular films are scheduled at the same time. We could use software to create a conflict-free schedule, or have a system in place to allow attendees to switch between films if a conflict arises.",
    "**Technical Issues**: With multiple screens and sound systems, technical issues are inevitable. To prevent this, we could have a comprehensive maintenance check before the festival, or have a team of technical experts on standby to troubleshoot any issues that arise.",
    "**Volunteer Burnout**: With a large team of volunteers working on the festival, burnout is a real risk. To prevent this, we could offer regular breaks and rewards for volunteers, or have a system in place to rotate volunteers in and out of different roles.",
    "**Security Concerns**: With a large crowd of attendees, security concerns are a real issue. To mitigate this, we could have a robust security plan in place, including metal detectors and security cameras, or have a team of trained security personnel on site.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: With a large number of films to promote, marketing and promotion can be a daunting task. To overcome this, we could use social media to promote the festival, or have a team of marketing experts on hand to create promotional materials."
