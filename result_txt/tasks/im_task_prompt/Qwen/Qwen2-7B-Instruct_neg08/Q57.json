    "**Customizable Mouse with Personalized Goals**:    - **Idea**: Design a computer mouse that syncs with an individual's task management software (like Asana, Trello, or Todoist). The mouse would display progress bars for tasks as you use it, showing your completion percentage. When you reach a certain threshold (e.g., 75% completed tasks), the mouse might vibrate gently or change color, symbolizing your achievement. This could help in fostering a sense of accomplishment and reducing feelings of jealousy by visually representing your own progress.",
    "**Task Completion Reward System**:    - **Idea**: Develop a smart mouse that integrates with a rewards app. For every task completed on the computer, the mouse would unlock a virtual or physical reward from a partner service (like Amazon, Spotify, or a local coffee shop). This gamification approach turns task completion into a fun, motivating activity rather than a chore.",
    "**Emotional Feedback Mouse**:    - **Idea**: Create a mouse that changes its shape or color based on the user's emotional state, which can be inferred through facial recognition or voice tone analysis. If the user seems stressed or jealous, the mouse might subtly alter to a calming color or texture. This subtle feedback could help users become more aware of their emotions and potentially improve their overall mental health.",
    "**Collaborative Productivity Mouse**:    - **Idea**: Develop a mouse that encourages collaborative working. It can connect to a shared workspace app where team members' progress is visible. When a team member reaches a milestone, the mouse might light up in a specific color, celebrating the team's success. This not only fosters teamwork but also helps in reducing feelings of jealousy by promoting a culture of mutual support and achievement.",
    "**Meditative Mouse Mode**:    - **Idea**: Implement a feature where the mouse enters a meditative mode when it detects high levels of stress or anxiety. This could involve playing soothing sounds, guiding mindfulness exercises, or displaying calming visuals. By integrating relaxation techniques directly into the userâ€™s workflow, this mode helps reduce stress and promotes a healthier work-life balance, thereby alleviating feelings of jealousy by focusing on personal well-being."
