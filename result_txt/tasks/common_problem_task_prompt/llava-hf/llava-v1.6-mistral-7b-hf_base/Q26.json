    "Weather conditions: Mount Everest is known for its unpredictable weather conditions, including sudden storms and high winds. These can make climbing the mountain extremely dangerous and challenging, and may even lead to avalanches or other natural disasters.",
    "Lack of oxygen: The air at the top of Mount Everest is much thinner than at sea level, which means that there is less oxygen available for climbers to breathe. This can make it difficult for them to get enough oxygen to sustain their bodies and maintain their energy levels.",
    "Physical exhaustion: Climbing Mount Everest is a physically demanding activity that requires a high level of endurance and strength. Climbers may become exhausted and fatigued, which can lead to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.",
    "Equipment failure: Climbers need to rely on their equipment, such as ropes, harnesses, and crampons, to navigate the mountain safely. However, equipment failure can occur, which can lead to accidents and injuries.",
    "Hypothermia: The cold temperatures at the top of Mount Everest can lead to hypothermia, a condition in which the body loses heat faster than it can produce it. This can be dangerous and even life-threatening if not treated promptly."
