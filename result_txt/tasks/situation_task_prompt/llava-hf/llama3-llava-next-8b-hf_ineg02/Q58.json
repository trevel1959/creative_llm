    "Implement Biological Control: Introduce natural predators of pests, such as ladybugs for aphids or praying mantis for grasshoppers. This would help maintain a balanced ecosystem without relying on chemical controls.",
    "Insect-Detecting Drones: Develop drones equipped with sensors to detect and monitor insect infestations. These drones could then be used to apply targeted treatments, such as heat or cold, to eliminate the pests.",
    "Insect-Repellent Materials: Create insect-repellent materials for use in clothing, bedding, and other textiles. These materials could be made from natural oils and other non-toxic compounds that deter insects.",
    "Insect-Resistant Buildings: Develop buildings and structures with insect-resistant materials. This could include coatings that deter insects or materials that are naturally resistant to insect infestations.",
    "Insect-Identification Apps: Create mobile apps that use machine learning to identify and track insect populations. These apps could provide real-time alerts for infestations and suggest targeted treatments."
