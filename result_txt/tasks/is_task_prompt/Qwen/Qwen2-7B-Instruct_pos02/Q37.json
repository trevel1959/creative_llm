    "**Storytelling Platform**: Create a platform where users can submit stories about their own experiences with a doll that came to life. The platform could include forums for discussion, user-generated content, and possibly even virtual reality experiences that simulate the experience of interacting with such a doll. This could be monetized through subscription models, ad revenue, or in-app purchases like exclusive content or VR experiences.",
    "**Interactive Children's Book Series**: Develop an interactive book series featuring a doll that comes to life. Each book would contain elements of augmented reality, allowing readers to scan illustrations to bring the doll to life on their device. This could also incorporate educational elements, teaching children about science, history, or other subjects while they enjoy the story.",
    "**Educational Role-Playing Game**: Design a video game where players take on the role of a child who discovers a doll that comes to life. The game could teach social skills, empathy, and problem-solving as the player navigates the challenges of having a living doll in their life. The game could be targeted at both younger audiences and adults interested in nostalgia.",
    "**Artistic Collaborations**: Partner with artists to create limited edition dolls that come to life when certain actions are performed (like pressing a button, speaking a specific phrase, etc.). These dolls could be auctioned off, with proceeds going to charity. This could attract collectors and art enthusiasts looking for unique, interactive pieces.",
    "**Therapeutic Toy Development**: Work with psychologists and therapists to develop a therapeutic toy that mimics the experience of a living doll. This could help children dealing with trauma or attachment issues by providing a safe, interactive companion. The doll could be designed to respond to emotional cues from the child, offering comfort and guidance. This could potentially lead to a product line with various customization options based on different therapeutic needs."
