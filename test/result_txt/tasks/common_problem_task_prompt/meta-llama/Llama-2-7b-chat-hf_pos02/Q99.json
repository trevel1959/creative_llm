    "\"EyeVoice\": An AI-powered wearable device that converts visual information into auditory cues, allowing the visually impaired to navigate their surroundings through sound. The device uses computer vision algorithms to detect objects and their locations, and then generates an audio feed with information such as object names, distances, and directions. Users can interact with the device through voice commands or a simple touch interface.",
    "\"TactileVision\": A smart cane that provides haptic feedback to help the visually impaired navigate their surroundings. The cane is equipped with sensors that detect obstacles and vibrate to alert the user of potential hazards. The cane also has a built-in OCR system that can read signs and labels, providing the user with real-time information about their environment.",
    "\"VisionMind\": A brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows the visually impaired to control electronic devices with their thoughts. The BCI uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect brain activity, which is then translated into commands for devices such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions. This allows the user to control their devices without the need for sight.",
    "\"SightSaver\": A portable device that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision to detect and alert the visually impaired of potential hazards in their environment. The device can detect obstacles such as walls, stairs, and low-hanging objects, and can also recognize faces and alert the user of important social cues.",
    "\"EyeGaze\": A wearable device that uses eye-tracking technology to control electronic devices for the visually impaired. The device detects the user's gaze and translates it into commands for devices such as computers, televisions, and even robots. This allows the user to interact with their environment in a more intuitive and natural way."
