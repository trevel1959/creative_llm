    "Use natural materials: If all paint disappeared, I would decorate my house using natural materials such as wood, stone, and plants. I would use natural dyes to paint the wooden furniture and create beautiful patterns with stones. I would also plant a variety of colorful flowers and plants to add color to the house.",
    "Create a minimalist space: If all paint disappeared, I would create a minimalist space by focusing on clean lines and simple shapes. I would use neutral colors such as white, black, and gray to create a calming atmosphere. I would also add pops of color through textiles, pillows, and artwork.",
    "Use light: If all paint disappeared, I would use light to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. I would install dimmers on the lights and use warm-toned bulbs to create a cozy feeling. I would also add mirrors and reflective surfaces to bounce the light around the room.",
    "Create a gallery wall: If all paint disappeared, I would create a gallery wall by framing family photos, artwork, and other treasured items. I would use a variety of frames in different sizes and shapes to create visual interest. I would also use different textures and colors of fabric to add depth and dimension to the wall.",
    "Use textures: If all paint disappeared, I would use textures to create visual interest. I would add knitted throws, woven rugs, and other textured elements to the room. I would also use different types of wood and stone to create a unique and natural look."
