    "Once, in a vast sky, lived a fluffy cloud named Nimbus. Unlike other clouds that soared high, Nimbus was afraid of heights. Every time his friends floated up, he trembled, fearing he might drift away. Instead, he lingered low, casting gentle shadows over the earth below. One day, a little bird landed on him, chirping, “Why don’t you join us?” Nimbus hesitated but felt the warmth of the bird’s encouragement. Gathering courage, he took a deep breath and floated upward. To his surprise, the view was breathtaking! Nimbus realized that sometimes, overcoming fears can lead to the most beautiful experiences.",
