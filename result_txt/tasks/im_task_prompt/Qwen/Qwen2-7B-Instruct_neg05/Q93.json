    "**Innovative Bowling Ball Design for Improved Performance**: Develop a bowling ball with a unique, patented design that allows for better grip and control during the throw. The ball could have a textured surface with raised patterns or a series of micro-suction cups on its exterior, which would increase friction between the ball and the lane, providing a more consistent roll and potentially increasing speed down the alley.",
    "**Customizable Weight Distribution in Bowling Balls**: Create a line of bowling balls that allow users to adjust the weight distribution within the ball itself. By incorporating modular weights or removable weight pockets, players can fine-tune the ball's balance and mass transfer characteristics to better suit their personal style or the specific conditions of the bowling alley.",
    "**Educational and Interactive Bowling Ball App**: Design an app that pairs with a traditional or smart bowling ball. The app would provide personalized coaching and analytics, offering insights into the user's technique, ball speed, hook potential, and lane reaction. Users could set goals, track progress, and even compare their performance with friends or professional bowlers.",
    "**Sustainable Bowling Ball Material**: Introduce a new line of bowling balls made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastics or plant-based resins. These balls would be biodegradable or recyclable, reducing waste and promoting sustainability in the sport. Additionally, they could incorporate a system that allows for easy refurbishment or repair, extending the life of the product.",
    "**Therapeutic Bowling Balls for Rehabilitation**: Develop a series of bowling balls designed specifically for individuals recovering from injuries or physical therapy sessions. These balls might feature softer, more forgiving materials that reduce the risk of strain or injury during use. They could also include ergonomic grips or adjustable weights to accommodate different levels of strength and mobility. This approach could make the sport accessible to a broader audience, including seniors and people with disabilities."
