    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature where the blender can clean itself with the push of a button. Users would simply add water and a drop of dish soap, and the blender would run a cleaning cycle, rinsing out all residues and making it hassle-free for users who dislike the cleanup process.",
    "**Modular Blender Design**: Create a blender with detachable components that allow users to customize their blending experience. For example, users could switch out blades for different textures (smoothie, chunky salsa, or nut butter) or add attachments for chopping or grinding. This modularity would cater to various culinary needs without needing multiple appliances.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a blender made from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics or recycled metals. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce plastic waste, while still providing the durability and performance expected from a high-quality kitchen appliance.",
    "**Integrated Nutritional Analyzer**: Equip the blender with a built-in nutritional analyzer that scans ingredients as they are added and provides real-time nutritional information, including calorie count, macronutrients, and vitamins. This feature would be especially useful for health-conscious individuals looking to track their intake.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Functionality**: Incorporate voice control technology into the blender, allowing users to operate it hands-free. This could be particularly beneficial when users are busy preparing other ingredients or cooking. Voice commands could include starting, stopping, adjusting speed, or even asking for recipe suggestions."
