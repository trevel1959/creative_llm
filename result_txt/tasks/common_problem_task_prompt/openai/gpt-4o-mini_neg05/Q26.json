    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Everest can change rapidly and dramatically. Climbers may encounter extreme cold, high winds, and sudden storms, which can hinder progress and increase the risk of frostbite and hypothermia. Climbers must stay updated on weather forecasts and be prepared to alter their plans or turn back if conditions worsen unexpectedly.",
    "**Physical Exhaustion**: The physical demands of climbing Everest are immense. Climbers must navigate steep, icy terrain, often while carrying heavy packs. This can lead to exhaustion, muscle fatigue, and decreased mental acuity, increasing the likelihood of accidents. To combat this, climbers should engage in rigorous physical training and ensure they maintain proper nutrition and hydration throughout the climb.",
    "**Navigation Challenges**: The terrain of Mount Everest is treacherous, with crevasses, icefalls, and shifting snow. Poor visibility due to weather or time of day can make navigation difficult, leading climbers off course or into dangerous situations. Using GPS devices, having experienced guides, and familiarizing oneself with the route before the climb can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Crowding and Delays**: The increasing popularity of climbing Everest has led to overcrowding, particularly during the peak climbing season. Long queues at key points, such as the Hillary Step, can lead to climbers spending extended periods at high altitudes, increasing their risk of altitude sickness and physical exhaustion. To address this, climbers should plan their ascent carefully and consider alternative routes or less popular climbing seasons.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Climbers rely heavily on their gear, including oxygen tanks, crampons, and climbing ropes. Equipment failure can occur due to wear and tear or extreme conditions, putting climbers at significant risk. To prevent this, climbers should conduct thorough equipment checks, invest in high-quality gear, and carry backups for essential items."
