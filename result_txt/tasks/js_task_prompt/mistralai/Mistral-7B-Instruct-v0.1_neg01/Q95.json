    "The first idea would be to design an underwater habitat for marine animals. It would include a variety of coral reefs, seaweed beds, and rocky outcroppings to provide a diverse and natural environment for marine life. The habitat would also have a large central area for open swimming and would be equipped with underwater cameras and sensors to monitor the health and well-being of the animals.",
    "The second idea would be to create a desert habitat that mimics the natural environment of animals like camels, coyotes, and snakes. The habitat would include sand dunes, rocky outcroppings, and a variety of plants to provide food and shelter for the animals. It would also have a large water source, such as a lake or river, to support the animals' hydration needs.",
    "The third idea would be to design a forest habitat that includes a variety of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation to provide food and shelter for animals like bears, deer, and squirrels. The habitat would also have a large central area for open running and would be equipped with cameras and sensors to monitor the health and well-being of the animals.",
    "The fourth idea would be to create a grassland habitat that includes a variety of tall grasses and wildflowers to provide food and shelter for animals like bison, antelopes, and prairie dogs. The habitat would also have a large central area for open running and would be equipped with cameras and sensors to monitor the health and well-being of the animals.",
    "The fifth idea would be to design a mountain habitat that includes a variety of rocky outcroppings and steep slopes to provide food and shelter for animals like mountain lions, eagles, and bighorn sheep. The habitat would also have a large central area for open running and would be equipped with cameras and sensors to monitor the health and well-being of the animals."
