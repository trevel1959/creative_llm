    "Limited development resources: Developing a mobile app requires specialized skills and resources, such as designers, developers, and testers. If the developer doesn't have access to these resources, it may slow down the development process or result in a lower quality app.",
    "Technical difficulties: Developing a mobile app involves complex technical processes, such as coding and testing. If the developer encounters technical difficulties, it may cause delays or result in a less functional app.",
    "Competition: There are already many mobile apps on the market, and creating a new app may be difficult due to competition from established apps.",
    "User adoption: Even if the app is developed and launched, users may not adopt it if they don't see the value in it or if they are already using other similar apps.",
    "Maintenance and updates: Once the app is launched, it will need to be maintained and updated regularly to keep up with new technology and user feedback. This can be time-consuming and expensive."
