    "Solar-Powered Watering System: Create a solar-powered watering system that harnesses the energy of the sun to pump water from a nearby source to the plants. This system could include a solar panel that charges a battery during the day, which then powers a small pump to water the plants at night or on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Develop a technology that can seed clouds with water droplets to induce rainfall. This could involve using specialized aircraft or drones to release tiny saltwater droplets into the clouds, which would then condense and fall to the ground as rain.",
    "Desiccated Plant Pods: Create a system of desiccated plant pods that can be placed in the soil around the plants. These pods would absorb water from the surrounding air and release it to the plants as needed, mimicking the natural process of transpiration.",
    "Geothermal Watering: Utilize the natural heat of the Earth to warm water for plant irrigation. This could involve drilling a well or trench to access underground water sources, which would then be heated using a geothermal heat exchanger. The warmed water could then be pumped to the plants for watering.",
    "Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Develop a system that captures and condenses water vapor from the atmosphere, which could be done using a network of specialized towers or a portable, inflatable device. The collected water could then be stored in tanks or used directly for irrigation."
