    "Upside-down Winery: Create a winery where the fermentation tanks are placed upside-down, with the liquid inside, rather than the usual way around. This unique design allows for a more efficient use of space, as the tanks can be stacked on top of each other, maximizing the available space. The upside-down design also allows for a more consistent temperature and humidity control, as the liquid inside the tanks is closer to the ceiling, where the temperature and humidity are more stable. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Winery in a Shipping Container: Transform a shipping container into a winery. This innovative idea allows for a compact and portable winery that can be easily moved to different locations. The container can be equipped with all the necessary equipment, including fermentation tanks, crushers, and presses. The winery can also be designed to be energy-efficient, with solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Vertical Winery: Create a winery that is built vertically, with the tanks and equipment stacked on top of each other, rather than side by side. This design allows for a more efficient use of space and can accommodate more tanks, increasing production capacity. The vertical design also allows for better temperature and humidity control, as the tanks are closer to the ceiling and the temperature and humidity are more stable. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Floating Winery: Build a winery on a barge or floating structure, which can be moved to different locations along a river or lake. This unique winery allows for a relaxed and scenic atmosphere, with the opportunity to host events and tastings on the water. The floating winery can also be designed to be energy-efficient, with solar panels and wind turbines to generate power. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Underground Winery: Create a winery that is built underground, taking advantage of the natural coolness and stability of the earth. The underground design can include a series of interconnected tunnels and chambers, where the tanks and equipment are located. The underground winery can also be designed to be energy-efficient, with geothermal"
