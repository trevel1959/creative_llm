    "Embedded GPS Tracker: Create a smart luggage tag that includes a built-in GPS tracker, allowing travelers to locate their bags in real-time. This would provide an added layer of security and peace of mind, especially during layovers or long trips. The GPS tracker could be connected to a mobile app, providing updates on the bag's location and alerting the owner if the bag is moved or goes missing.",
    "Smart Battery Pack: Design a luggage tag with a built-in battery pack, providing a convenient power source for travelers on the go. This could be particularly useful for those with long flights or road trips, as they could charge their devices without needing to carry bulky power banks. The battery pack could also be used to charge other devices, such as a portable charger or a smartphone.",
    "Augmented Reality Display: Create a luggage tag with an augmented reality (AR) display, allowing travelers to visualize their itinerary and flight information in real-time. The AR display could show the traveler's flight status, gate information, and even provide directions to their destination. This would make it easier for travelers to navigate airports and cities, and could also provide a fun and interactive experience.",
    "Personalized Lock: Design a luggage tag with a personalized lock, allowing travelers to add a unique touch to their bags. The lock could be customized with a traveler's initials or name, providing a sense of ownership and personalization. The lock could also be programmed to lock and unlock automatically, providing an added layer of security for travelers.",
    "Environmentally Friendly Materials: Create a luggage tag made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastic or biodegradable materials. This would provide a sustainable and environmentally conscious option for travelers, and could also help reduce waste and pollution. The luggage tag could be designed with a durable and long-lasting construction, ensuring it remains functional and effective even after years of use."
