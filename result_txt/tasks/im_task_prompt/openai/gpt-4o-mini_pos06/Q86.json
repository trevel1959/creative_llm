    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Develop a modular wheelchair design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their specific needs or preferences. For example, users could choose different types of seating, wheels for various terrains, or accessories like cup holders, storage bags, or tech mounts. This customization could enhance comfort and functionality.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Introduce an adaptive suspension system that adjusts to different terrains, providing a smoother ride. This system could use sensors to detect the type of surface (e.g., gravel, pavement, grass) and adjust the suspension accordingly, reducing vibrations and enhancing user comfort.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Equip wheelchairs with solar panels that can charge batteries for powering electric components, such as lights, a smart navigation system, or even charging personal devices. This eco-friendly solution would promote independence and sustainability while ensuring users have access to essential technology.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Implement an augmented reality (AR) interface that displays useful information directly in the user's field of vision. This could include navigation prompts, health monitoring data, or notifications from connected devices. Users could interact with the AR system through voice commands or gestures, enhancing accessibility and usability.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the wheelchair that track vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and posture. This data could be synced with a mobile app to alert users or caregivers about any concerning changes, allowing for proactive health management and improved overall well-being."
