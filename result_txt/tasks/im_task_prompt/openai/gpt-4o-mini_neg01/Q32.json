    "**Eco-Friendly Print Mode**: Develop a dedicated eco-friendly print mode that automatically adjusts print settings to minimize ink and paper usage. This mode could include features like double-sided printing, draft quality printing for less important documents, and the ability to print multiple pages on a single sheet. Users could also receive a report showing their eco-impact, encouraging sustainable printing practices.",
    "**3D Printing Capabilities**: Enhance traditional printers by adding a 3D printing feature. Users could print prototypes, custom designs, or even household items directly from their computers. This could be achieved through an upgrade kit or a new printer model that includes a dual-functionality design, appealing to both standard document users and creative makers.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Introduce voice recognition technology that allows users to print documents using voice commands. This feature could be integrated with popular virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, making printing hands-free and more convenient, especially for multitasking users or those with disabilities.",
    "**Personalized Print Templates**: Create an online platform where users can design and save personalized print templates for various occasions, such as invitations, flyers, or reports. Users could easily access these templates from their printers or connected devices, streamlining the printing process for special events and making it more fun and creative.",
    "**Modular Printer Design**: Design a modular printer that allows users to easily swap out components based on their needs. For example, a user could upgrade from a standard inkjet to a high-resolution photo printer by simply replacing the print head. This would reduce electronic waste and allow users to customize their printers without needing to purchase an entirely new device."
