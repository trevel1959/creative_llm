    "Encourage guests to carpool or take public transportation to the wedding by providing information on local transportation options and offering incentives for those who choose to do so.",

    "Consider donating a portion of the wedding budget to a non-profit organization that supports environmental conservation efforts. This is a great way to give back to the planet while celebrating your special day."
