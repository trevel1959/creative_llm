The system sends alerts to drivers when it's time to rotate or replace their tires, and can also provide recommendations on which tires to choose based on driving habits and road conditions.",
    "Eco-Friendly Tires: Tires made from sustainable materials like natural rubber, rice husks, or recycled rubber, that have a lower carbon footprint and are biodegradable. These tires can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and promote eco-friendly transportation.",
    "Tire-Powered Generator: A device that converts the kinetic energy of a tire into electricity, which can be used to power small devices like phones or GPS units. This could be useful for outdoor enthusiasts who need to stay connected while on the go.",
    "Smart Tire Design: Tires with built-in sensors that can communicate with other vehicles on the road, providing real-time information on road conditions, traffic, and other hazards. This could help improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.",
    "Tireless Vehicles: Vehicles that use a new type of propulsion system that eliminates the need for tires altogether. These vehicles could be powered by a combination of electric motors and magnetic levitation technology, allowing them to travel smoothly and efficiently on any surface."
