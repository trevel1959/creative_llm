    "Vase made of living plants - Create a vase that is made entirely of living plants. This could be achieved by using a combination of mosses, ferns, and other low-maintenance plants that can be trained to grow in a shape of a vase. The vase would be biodegradable and would require minimal care, making it a unique and eco-friendly option for flower arrangements.",
    "Glow-in-the-dark vase - Develop a vase that emits a soft, blue glow in the dark. This could be achieved by using a special type of glass or ceramic that absorbs light during the day and then emits it at night, creating a magical and whimsical effect. The vase could be used as a decorative piece or as a unique way to display flowers.",
    "Shape-shifting vase - Create a vase that can change its shape and size depending on the type of flowers it contains. For example, a vase that starts as a small, delicate shape and then expands to accommodate larger flowers, or a vase that changes its shape to match the style of the flowers it holds. This would add an extra layer of creativity and functionality to the traditional vase.",
    "Interactive vase - Develop a vase that can interact with the flowers it contains. For example, a vase that can change its color or shape based on the type of flowers it holds, or a vase that can play music or display images when flowers are placed inside. This would add an extra layer of interactivity and fun to the traditional vase.",
    "Smell-emitting vase - Create a vase that emits a specific scent based on the type of flowers it contains. For example, a vase that emits a floral scent when roses are placed inside, or a vase that emits a citrusy scent when orchids are placed inside. This would add an extra layer of sensory experience to the traditional vase, making it more enjoyable and engaging."
