    "**Vision Correction Tattoos**: A new trend could emerge where skilled artists create intricate tattoos on the sclera (the white part of the eye) that help to manipulate light and improve focus. These tattoos would be designed to refract light in a way that compensates for specific vision impairments, offering a unique and stylish solution that also serves an artistic purpose.",
    "**Smart Glasses with Augmented Reality**: In the absence of traditional glasses, tech companies could develop advanced smart glasses equipped with augmented reality capabilities. These glasses would use cameras to analyze the environment and project corrective images directly onto the lenses, allowing users to see clearly. The glasses could also include features like facial recognition, object identification, and navigation assistance, making them a multifunctional tool for daily life.",
    "**Community Vision Support Networks**: Communities could establish support networks where individuals with poor vision come together to share resources and experiences. These networks could facilitate vision-sharing workshops where members help each other learn techniques to cope with their visual impairments, such as using sound cues, tactile maps, or guided tours of their neighborhoods to enhance their mobility and confidence.",
    "**Natural Eye Training Techniques**: A movement could emerge around natural eye training methods, where individuals learn to enhance their vision through exercises that strengthen eye muscles and improve focus. This could include practices such as the Bates Method, eye yoga, and mindfulness techniques that help individuals become more aware of their surroundings and learn to adapt their vision without corrective lenses.",
    "**Vision-Enhancing Biomechanical Devices**: Engineers could design lightweight, wearable devices that attach to the head or face, similar to a visor or headband. These devices would use advanced optics and sensors to adjust the focus and clarity of the user's vision in real-time. They could also incorporate features like night vision or thermal imaging for enhanced visibility in low-light conditions."
