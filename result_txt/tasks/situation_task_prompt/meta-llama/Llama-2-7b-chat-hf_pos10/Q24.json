    "Low-tech Solutions: People with poor vision could adapt to a world without glasses or contact lenses by using low-tech solutions such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, or even binoculars. These devices can help enhance vision and make daily tasks more manageable.",
    "Braille and Tactile Signage: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, braille and tactile signage could become more crucial for navigation and communication. Public spaces, such as buildings, streets, and parks, could incorporate braille and tactile signs to help people with poor vision navigate and communicate more effectively.",
    "Virtual Reality Training: Virtual reality (VR) technology could be used to train people with poor vision to navigate and interact with their surroundings more effectively. VR simulations could help them practice recognizing objects, detecting obstacles, and developing spatial awareness.",
    "Assistive Technology Integration: With the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, assistive technology could be integrated into daily life to help people with poor vision. For instance, smart glasses could be developed that use AI to recognize objects and provide audio or haptic feedback to help people with poor vision identify them.",
    "Community Support Networks: People with poor vision could form community support networks to help each other cope with the challenges of living without glasses or contact lenses. These networks could provide emotional support, practical assistance, and shared knowledge and resources to help people adapt to their new reality."
