    "- Solar-Powered Batteries: One potential solution to power devices without batteries is to create solar-powered batteries that harness the energy of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries could be designed with solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "- Bio-Batteries: Another option is to develop bio-batteries that use organic matter, such as plants or bacteria, to generate electricity. These batteries could be designed to convert chemical energy from organic sources into electrical energy, providing a sustainable and renewable power source.",
    "- Thermal Energy Storage: Another option is to develop devices that use thermal energy storage to power devices. These devices could be designed to store thermal energy generated by natural sources, such as geothermal or waste heat, and convert it into electrical energy when needed.",
    "- Air-Powered Batteries: Another creative solution is to develop air-powered batteries that use compressed air to generate electricity. These batteries could be designed to store compressed air and release it as electrical energy when needed, providing a reliable and sustainable power source.",
    "- Graphene-Based Batteries: Finally, researchers could explore the use of graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material, to create batteries that are more efficient and sustainable than traditional batteries. Graphene-based batteries could be designed to store electrical energy more efficiently and release it faster, providing a more reliable and sustainable power source for devices."
