    "**Smart Soles**: Develop a line of shoes with built-in, wearable technology that tracks the wearer's physical and mental health. The shoes would have sensors to monitor vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and stress levels. This data would be synced with a mobile app, providing personalized recommendations for exercise, nutrition, and relaxation techniques. The shoes could also detect and alert the wearer to potential health issues, such as foot problems or uneven gait. For example, if the wearer has a history of plantar fasciitis, the shoes could provide real-time feedback to encourage proper walking form and prevent further injury.",
