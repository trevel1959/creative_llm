    "**Glowing Blooms**: My new species of plant, which I'll call \"Luminaria,\" would have the unique ability to absorb and store energy during the day, and then release a soft, ethereal glow at night. This would not only provide a beautiful display of light, but also attract pollinators and other nocturnal creatures, increasing the plant's chances of reproduction. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Water-Repellent Leaves**: My plant, \"Aquafend,\" would have leaves that are covered in a waxy, hydrophobic coating, allowing it to survive in areas with high rainfall or flooding. This would be achieved through a combination of genetic engineering and selective breeding. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Adaptive Roots**: My plant, \"Terragrim,\" would have roots that can change their shape and structure in response to different environmental conditions. For example, in dry soil, the roots would grow deeper to access water, while in wet soil, they would spread out to absorb more nutrients. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Self-Healing Stems**: My plant, \"Medicura,\" would have stems that can repair themselves quickly and efficiently in response to injury or disease. This would be achieved through the production of specialized cells that can rapidly close wounds and restore damaged tissue. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: My plant, \"Aeropex,\" would have leaves that can absorb water vapor from the air, even in arid environments. This would be achieved through the development of specialized structures that can condense and collect water droplets, providing a reliable source of hydration for the plant. Confidence: 0.9"
