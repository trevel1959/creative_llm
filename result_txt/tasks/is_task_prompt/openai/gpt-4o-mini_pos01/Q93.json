    "In a vibrant garden, a boastful hare challenged everyone to a race, confident he'd win against any opponent. A humble snail, tired of the hare's arrogance, accepted the challenge. The day of the race arrived, and the animals gathered, chuckling at the snail's audacity. As the race began, the hare dashed ahead, but soon, he grew overconfident and decided to take a nap. The snail, slow but steady, kept moving forward. When the hare woke up, he panicked and sprinted towards the finish line, but it was too late. The snail crossed first, teaching everyone that perseverance beats arrogance. ",
