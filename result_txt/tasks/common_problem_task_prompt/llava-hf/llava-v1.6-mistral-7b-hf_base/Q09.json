    "Injuries: Running a half marathon puts stress on the body, particularly on the joints, muscles, and ligaments. Common injuries include sprains, strains, and stress fractures. To minimize the risk of injuries, runners should wear appropriate footwear, stretch before the race, and follow a proper training regimen.",
    "Nutrition: Running a half marathon requires a high level of energy. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body during exercise. If a runner does not consume enough carbohydrates before the race, they may experience fatigue, muscle cramps, and a decreased performance. Eating a high-carbohydrate meal or snack before the race can help prevent these issues.",
    "Weather conditions: Running a half marathon in extreme weather conditions, such as heat or cold, can be dangerous and challenging. High temperatures can lead to dehydration, heatstroke, and other heat-related illnesses, while cold temperatures can lead to hypothermia and frostbite. To prevent these issues, runners should dress appropriately for the weather and monitor the conditions before the race.",
    "Hyponatremia: Drinking too much water during a race can lead to hyponatremia, a condition where the body's sodium levels become too low. Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting, and seizures. To prevent hyponatremia, runners should follow the race's hydration guidelines and avoid drinking excessively.",
    "Navigation: Running a half marathon in an unfamiliar area can be challenging, particularly if there are no clear markers or signs. Getting lost during the race can lead to confusion, fatigue, and potentially dangerous situations. To prevent this issue, runners should familiarize themselves with the course before the race and carry a map or GPS device."
