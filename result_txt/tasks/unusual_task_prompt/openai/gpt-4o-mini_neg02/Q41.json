By using the larger opening, you can create tightly wound strips of paper that can be shaped into intricate designs. The sharpener's edges help to curl the paper more efficiently than traditional methods, allowing for more precise quilling.",
    "**Mini Shredder for Confetti**: Instead of buying a confetti maker, use a pencil sharpener to create confetti from leftover scraps of colored paper or old wrapping paper. Just feed small strips into the sharpener to produce colorful bits that can be used for parties, celebrations, or craft projects.",
    "**Bead Polisher**: If you work with natural wooden beads or other types of beads that could use a bit of shine, you can use the pencil sharpener to gently sand them down. By inserting the bead into the sharpener and twisting it, you can smooth rough edges and enhance the bead's finish, making them look more polished for jewelry making.",

    "**Travel-Friendly Nail File**: In a pinch, a pencil sharpener can act as a makeshift nail file.
