    "**Food Preservation Issues**: Refrigeration is essential for preserving perishable foods. Without electricity, food items such as meat, dairy, and fresh produce can spoil quickly, leading to waste and potential foodborne illnesses. Individuals would need to find alternative methods for food preservation, such as canning, pickling, or relying on non-perishable items, which could limit their diet and nutritional intake.",
    "**Inability to Complete Daily Tasks**: Many daily tasks rely on electricity, such as cooking, cleaning, and personal grooming. Without electric stoves, dishwashers, or electric razors, individuals may struggle to maintain hygiene and prepare meals efficiently. This could lead to a decline in overall well-being and increase the time spent on mundane chores.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: Living without electricity can create safety issues, especially at night. Lack of lighting increases the risk of accidents, such as falls or injuries, and makes homes more vulnerable to break-ins. Without electric security systems, individuals may feel less secure and anxious about their safety, especially in unfamiliar or high-crime areas.",
    "**Health Care Access Limitations**: Many medical devices and equipment require electricity to function, including oxygen machines, insulin pumps, and refrigeration for medications. Individuals with chronic health conditions may face life-threatening situations if they cannot access the necessary medical care or if their treatments are disrupted due to a lack of power.",
    "**Impact on Work and Productivity**: For those who work from home or rely on technology for their jobs, living without electricity can halt productivity entirely. This could lead to financial strain if work cannot be completed, deadlines are missed, or clients are lost. Additionally, remote work and virtual meetings become impossible, further isolating individuals from their professional networks."
