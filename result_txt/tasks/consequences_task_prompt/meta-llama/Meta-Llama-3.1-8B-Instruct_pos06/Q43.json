    "**Neural Information Overload**: With unlimited storage capacity, our brains would become a treasure trove of knowledge, but also a repository of chaos. We'd struggle to prioritize and organize the vast amounts of information, leading to mental fatigue, anxiety, and decreased productivity. It's like having an endless library with no cataloging system – it would be impossible to find what we need in time. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Synaptic Overload and Memory Loss**: The brain's neural connections would become saturated, causing a phenomenon known as synaptic overload. This would lead to memory loss, as the brain would struggle to consolidate and retain new information. It's like trying to fill a bucket with water, but the bucket has no bottom – the water would just keep pouring in, but the bucket would never be full. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**The Information Paradox**: With unlimited storage, we'd face a paradox: we'd have access to all knowledge, but the value of knowledge would decrease. Information would become commoditized, and the pursuit of knowledge would lose its allure. It's like having a magic book that contains all the answers, but the book becomes so ordinary that nobody wants to read it. Confidence: 0.85",
    "**The Great Mental Upload**: Humans would become a collective, hive-like entity, with individual minds uploading and sharing information seamlessly. This would lead to a loss of personal identity and creativity, as our thoughts and ideas would become intertwined with those of others. It's like being part of a giant, cosmic computer network – our individuality would be lost in the noise. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**The Rise of the Meta-Mind**: With unlimited storage, humans would evolve into meta-minds, capable of processing and understanding complex systems, patterns, and relationships. We'd become super-intelligent, but also detached from our human experiences, emotions, and intuition. It's like becoming a supercomputer, but losing our connection to the world around us. Confidence: 0.9"
