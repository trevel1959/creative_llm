    "The Snoring Sun: A Sleep-Inducing App - Create an app that simulates the sound of a snoring sun to help people relax and fall asleep. The app can be programmed to produce different levels of snore sounds, allowing users to customize their sleep experience. The app can also include features such as a sunrise simulation, guided meditation, and white noise to create a soothing and calming environment for sleep.",
    "Snore-Reducing Pillow - Design a pillow with built-in technology that can detect and adjust snoring sounds in real-time. The pillow can use sensors to monitor the user's snoring patterns and adjust the sound of the snore to a more soothing and less disruptive level. This can help reduce the negative impact of snoring on both the snorer and their bed partner.",
    "Snore-Themed Board Game - Create a board game that incorporates elements of snoring into gameplay. Players can take turns rolling dice and moving around the board, with each space representing a different snoring sound. The game can also include cards that can be used to disrupt or enhance the snoring sounds, adding an element of strategy and competition.",
    "Snore-Inducing Headphones - Design headphones that can induce snoring sounds through bone conduction. The headphones can use vibrating speakers to transmit the snore sounds directly to the user's skull, creating a more immersive and realistic snoring experience. This can be especially useful for people who have trouble sleeping due to their own snoring or for those who find the sound of snoring relaxing.",
    "Snore-Themed Art Installation - Create an interactive art installation that simulates a room filled with snoring sounds. The installation can use speakers and sensors to detect and respond to the viewer's movements, creating a dynamic and immersive experience. The installation can also include visual elements such as LED lights and projection mapping to enhance the overall atmosphere. Visitors can be encouraged to lie down and listen to the snoring sounds, creating a meditative and relaxing environment."
