    "**Innovative Umbrella Design**: Create an umbrella that not only protects from rain but also provides a cooling effect in hot weather. This could be achieved by integrating solar panels into the umbrella's canopy which can generate electricity to power a mini fan attached to the handle. The fan can be activated when needed, providing a gentle breeze to keep the user cool.",
    "**Umbrella as a Multi-Functional Tool**: Develop an umbrella that transforms into various tools such as a small shovel, a hammer, or a saw, making it useful for camping trips, outdoor events, or even urban adventures. The design would include hidden compartments for these tools within the umbrella frame, ensuring they are easily accessible and safe to carry.",
    "**Interactive Umbrella Entertainment System**: Design an umbrella with built-in speakers, LED lights, and a touch screen. This umbrella can play music, display information or news, and even act as a small gaming console. It would be perfect for rainy days at home or outdoor gatherings, providing entertainment without the need for separate devices.",
    "**Customizable Umbrella Printing Service**: Launch an online platform where users can upload their own designs, photos, or messages and have them printed on custom-made umbrellas. This allows people to express their personal style or commemorate special occasions, making their umbrellas unique and memorable.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Invent an umbrella coated with a special nano-material that repels water and dirt, significantly reducing the need for cleaning. This umbrella would automatically clean itself using ultraviolet light (UV-C) when exposed to sunlight, keeping it fresh and functional throughout the year. Additionally, this technology could be integrated into other products like clothing or tents, promoting self-cleaning and maintenance-free items."
