    "**Underwater Mountain Climbing**: The disappearance of mountains would lead to the creation of underwater mountain ranges as the Earth's crust adjusts. Exploring these underwater peaks could provide a unique and thrilling diving experience, complete with breathtaking views and possibly undiscovered marine life. Dive instructors could lead guided tours, offering lessons on underwater navigation, cave exploration, and scientific research.",
    "**Skydiving over Plains**: Without mountains, the landscape would be mostly flat plains. This could create ideal conditions for skydiving enthusiasts. Organized skydiving events could take place across vast expanses, allowing participants to jump from high altitudes and experience the thrill of freefall over an unobstructed view of the horizon. Safety measures would include advanced weather monitoring, extensive training sessions, and state-of-the-art equipment.",
    "**High Altitude Gliding**: The absence of mountains would result in increased air pressure at lower elevations, making it easier for humans to perform high-altitude gliding without the need for oxygen tanks. Professional gliding clubs could be established to offer lessons, competitions, and scenic flights for enthusiasts. Participants would soar over expansive plains, experiencing a sense of freedom and connection with nature that is typically associated with mountainous regions.",
    "**Geological Exploration**: With mountains gone, geologists and paleontologists would have access to vast, previously inaccessible geological formations. Expeditions could focus on uncovering new fossil sites, studying ancient fault lines, or mapping out new types of rock formations. These expeditions could be organized by universities, research institutions, or adventure travel companies, providing opportunities for education and discovery.",
    "**Aerobatic Flight Shows**: Airports and open fields would become ideal venues for aerobatic flight shows, featuring high-performance aircraft performing acrobatic maneuvers over flat landscapes. Spectators could enjoy spectacular displays of aerial stunts, including loops, rolls, and dives, without the interference of mountains. These shows could be part of large-scale festivals or integrated into national celebrations, promoting aviation culture and inspiring future generations of pilots."
