    "**Elevated Transportation:** Cars and other vehicles would need to be redesigned to accommodate the reduced gravity. This could include lower and wider vehicles to maintain stability and prevent accidents.",
    "**Structural Changes:** Buildings and infrastructure would need to be adapted to withstand the reduced gravity. This could involve additional support structures or modifications to the foundations.",
    "**Environmental Impact:** The reduced gravity would affect the natural world, including the movement of water and the behavior of animals. It could also alter the way plants grow and the distribution of soil.",
    "**Energy Consumption:** With gravity reduced, energy consumption would likely increase, as people and machines would need to exert more effort to move around and lift objects.",
    "**Impact on the Atmosphere:** The reduced gravity could affect the way gases are distributed in the atmosphere, potentially leading to changes in weather patterns and climate."
