    "**Modular Cooking Plates**: Design the sandwich toaster with interchangeable cooking plates that can accommodate different types of sandwiches (e.g., paninis, open-faced, or even desserts). These plates could have varying textures and designs, such as ridged for grill marks or flat for a crisp finish. Users could purchase additional plates separately, allowing for versatility in their sandwich-making experience.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Create a sandwich toaster that features a built-in ingredient dispenser for spreads, sauces, or even sliced ingredients. Users could select their desired amount through a dial or app, and the toaster would automatically apply it to the bread before toasting. This innovation would streamline the sandwich-making process and allow for consistent flavor distribution.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature using a steam-based system. After use, the toaster could initiate a cleaning cycle that generates steam to loosen food particles and grease, which could then be easily wiped away. This would reduce the hassle of cleaning and encourage users to make sandwiches more frequently without the fear of a messy appliance.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Expand the capabilities of the sandwich toaster by adding multiple cooking modes, such as grilling, baking, or even air frying. A user-friendly interface with preset options would allow users to easily switch between modes for a variety of meals, from crispy sandwiches to baked snacks or healthier air-fried options.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Focus on sustainability by creating a sandwich toaster made from recycled materials and incorporating energy-efficient heating elements. Additionally, the toaster could have a low-energy standby mode and a timer to prevent it from overheating. This eco-conscious approach would appeal to environmentally aware consumers while reducing the carbon footprint of the appliance."
