    "Aqua City: Create an underwater city, complete with towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and vibrant neighborhoods. This city would be designed to accommodate the rising ocean levels, with built-in flood protection systems and advanced water filtration and purification technologies. The city would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar panels, and would feature a thriving economy, cultural centers, and recreational areas.",
    "Water-Breathing Pods: Develop portable, self-sustaining pods that can house individuals and families. These pods would be equipped with advanced water filtration systems, oxygen generators, and renewable energy sources, allowing inhabitants to live comfortably underwater. The pods could be connected to form larger communities, providing a sense of community and support for those living in the water.",
    "Floating Islands: Create floating islands that can be built using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and natural fibers. These islands would provide a safe and stable living space for those affected by rising ocean levels, with enough space for agriculture, housing, and other essential needs. The islands could be connected by bridges or tunnels, allowing for easy transportation and trade between communities.",
    "Underwater Biodomes: Design underwater biodomes that mimic natural ecosystems, providing a habitat for marine life and supporting biodiversity. These biodomes could be used to study and protect endangered species, as well as to cultivate new forms of marine life. The biodomes could also serve as a source of food and resources for those living in the surrounding areas.",
    "Ocean-Friendly Cities: Transform existing coastal cities into ocean-friendly environments that are designed to work in harmony with the ocean's natural rhythms. This could involve implementing sustainable urban planning practices, such as green roofs, green walls, and rainwater harvesting systems. The cities could also feature underwater parks, coral reef restoration projects, and other initiatives that promote ocean health and biodiversity."
