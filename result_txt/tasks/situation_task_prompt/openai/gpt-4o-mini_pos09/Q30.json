    "**Insect Farming**: Harness the nutritional potential of edible insects, which are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. By setting up urban insect farms, communities could cultivate species like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers. These insects could be processed into protein bars or powders, providing a sustainable source of nutrition while also delivering essential nutrients that are typically found in plant-based foods.",
    "**Lab-Grown Nutrient Packs**: Utilize biotechnology to create lab-grown nutrient packs that mimic the vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables. These packs could be made using cellular agriculture techniques, allowing for the cultivation of plant cells in a lab setting. The result would be a product that contains the desired nutrients without needing the actual plants, thus ensuring a steady supply of essential vitamins and minerals.",
    "**Nutritious Seaweeds**: Expand the use of seaweeds as a staple food source. Seaweeds are rich in iodine, iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Innovative culinary techniques could be developed to incorporate different types of seaweeds into everyday meals, such as seaweed-infused pasta, salads, or snacks. Additionally, seaweed farming could be promoted as a sustainable way to provide essential nutrients while protecting marine ecosystems.",
    "**Nutrient-Infused Animal Products**: Rethink animal husbandry by feeding livestock and poultry specially formulated diets enriched with essential vitamins and minerals. For instance, animals could be given supplements containing the nutrients typically found in fruits and vegetables. This would allow consumers to obtain necessary vitamins and minerals through animal products like eggs, milk, and meat, while also ensuring that the animals are healthy and well-fed.",
    "**Functional Grains and Legumes**: Innovate with grains and legumes by biofortifying them with essential nutrients. Research could be conducted to enhance the nutrient profiles of staple foods like rice, wheat, quinoa, and beans. This could involve genetic modification or selective breeding to increase their vitamin and mineral content, creating a new class of \"functional grains\" that provide the nutrition previously sourced from fruits and vegetables."
