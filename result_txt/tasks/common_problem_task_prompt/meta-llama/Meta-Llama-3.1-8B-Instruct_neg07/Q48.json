Players navigate a large, three-dimensional course with trampolines and aerial silks, performing acrobatic stunts while trying to score points by landing on designated targets or completing specific challenges. The twist: the course is designed to change shape and layout in real-time, requiring players to adapt and think on their feet.",
    "**Quantum League**: A futuristic, high-tech sport that takes place in a massive, enclosed arena with a zero-gravity environment. Players wear special suits that allow them to manipulate their movements and trajectory, using a combination of jumping, hovering, and gravitational manipulation to outmaneuver opponents. The objective: score goals by propelling a glowing, high-tech ball through a series of targets and obstacles.",
    "**Echoes**: A team-based sport that combines elements of orienteering, navigation, and strategy. Players are given a set of cryptic clues and challenges that they must complete in a designated area, using a combination of physical and mental skills to overcome obstacles and reach the finish line. The twist: each player has a unique \"echo\" â€“ a virtual duplicate that can be sent ahead to scout out the terrain, providing valuable intel and strategic advantages.",
    "**Luminaria**: A fast-paced, high-intensity sport that takes place in a large, darkened arena with a series of glowing, neon-lit obstacles and challenges.
