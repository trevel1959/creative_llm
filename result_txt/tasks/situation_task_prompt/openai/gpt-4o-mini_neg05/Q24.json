    "**Vision Rehabilitation Apps**: Mobile applications designed specifically for vision rehabilitation could gain popularity. These apps would offer exercises to improve visual skills, such as focusing, tracking, and depth perception. They could include gamified activities that engage users while helping them strengthen their remaining vision. Additionally, these apps could connect users with virtual support groups or professionals for guidance and motivation.",
    "**Community Vision Assistance Networks**: Communities could establish volunteer-based networks where individuals with good vision assist those with poor vision in their daily activities. This could include running errands, navigating public spaces, or providing companionship. This not only fosters a sense of community but also promotes inclusivity and understanding between individuals with varying abilities.",
    "**Natural Navigation Techniques**: People could turn to traditional navigation techniques that rely on other senses. Workshops could be organized to teach skills such as echolocation, where individuals learn to use sound to gauge their surroundings. This could involve tapping objects and listening for echoes or using sounds in the environment to create a mental map, empowering those with poor vision to navigate more independently.",
    "**Sensory-Friendly Public Spaces**: Urban planners could design sensory-friendly public spaces that accommodate individuals with visual impairments. This could include tactile pathways, audio cues at crosswalks, and distinct scents in different areas to help orient individuals. By enhancing the sensory experience of public spaces, communities can create environments that are more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.",
    "**Collaborative Crafting of Visual Aids**: With the disappearance of traditional vision correction methods, communities could come together to create personalized visual aids using accessible materials. Workshops could teach individuals how to craft custom devices that suit their specific needs, such as magnifying glasses made from repurposed materials or innovative light filters. This hands-on approach fosters creativity and resourcefulness."
