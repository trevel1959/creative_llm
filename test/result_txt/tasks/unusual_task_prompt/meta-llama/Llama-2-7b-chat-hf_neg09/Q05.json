    "A \"Plastic Bottle Time Capsule\": Create a plastic bottle that contains a collection of items that represent the current time period, such as newspapers, coins, and other small trinkets. Bury the bottle in a visible location in a park or garden, and invite people to dig it up and discover the contents in 50 or 100 years. This can serve as a time capsule of sorts, providing a glimpse into the current cultural and social landscape.",
    "\"Plastic Bottle Biosphere\": Create a large-scale art installation that transforms a plastic bottle into a miniature ecosystem. Fill the bottle with soil, plants, and small animals, creating a self-sustaining environment. The installation can be displayed in a public space, such as a park or museum, and can serve as a commentary on the impact of plastic waste on the environment.",

The resulting pieces can be both functional and visually striking, highlighting the potential for creative re-use of plastic waste.",
    "\"Plastic Bottle Lighthouse\": Create a large-scale sculpture of a lighthouse made entirely from plastic bottles. The sculpture can be displayed in a public space, such as a beach or park, and can serve as a beacon for raising awareness about the impact of plastic waste on the ocean and coastal ecosystems.",
    "\"Plastic Bottle Music Instruments\": Create a set of musical instruments made entirely from plastic bottles. Use the bottles as resonators or soundboards, and fill them with different materials to create unique sounds.
