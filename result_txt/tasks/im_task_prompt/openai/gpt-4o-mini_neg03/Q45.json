    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Blades**: Create a ceiling fan with a modular design where users can easily swap out blades in different styles, colors, or materials. This allows for customization based on seasonal decor or personal taste. The fan could also feature a quick-release mechanism for easy cleaning and maintenance.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting with Mood Settings**: Design a ceiling fan that incorporates adjustable LED lighting, which can change color and intensity based on the time of day or user preference. This feature would allow users to create different moods, from bright and energizing during the day to soft and warm in the evening, all controlled via a remote or smartphone app.",
    "**Whisper-Quiet Technology**: Develop a ceiling fan with advanced noise reduction technology, utilizing specially designed motor and blade shapes to minimize operational noise. This would be ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, or study areas, providing a comfortable environment without the distraction of a loud fan.",
    "**Air Purification Feature**: Incorporate an air purification system within the ceiling fan that uses HEPA filters and UV light to clean the air as it circulates. This would help reduce allergens and improve indoor air quality, making it particularly beneficial for those with allergies or respiratory issues.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Design a ceiling fan made from sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood or recycled metals, paired with energy-efficient motors. This would not only reduce the environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, the fan could be designed to operate at low energy consumption levels, making it cost-effective in the long run."
