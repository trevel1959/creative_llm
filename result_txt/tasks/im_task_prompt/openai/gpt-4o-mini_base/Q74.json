    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handle**: Redesign the watering can with an adjustable handle that can be set to different angles and heights. This would allow users to comfortably water plants at various levels, reducing strain on the wrists and back. The can could also feature a non-slip grip for added comfort and control.",
    "**Dual-Function Watering Can and Sprayer**: Create a watering can that can easily convert into a spray nozzle. This would allow users to switch between pouring water for larger plants and spraying a fine mist for delicate seedlings or foliage. A simple mechanism, like a twist or pull lever, could facilitate this transformation.",
    "**Built-in Filtration System**: Equip the watering can with a built-in filtration system that purifies tap water before it reaches the plants. This could include a charcoal filter to remove chlorine and other chemicals, ensuring that plants receive cleaner, healthier water. The filtration system could be replaceable and easy to access.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering System**: Introduce a color-coded system for different types of plants. Each watering can could come with interchangeable spouts or labels that indicate the water needs of various plants (e.g., succulents, tropical plants, etc.). This would help gardeners remember which plants require more or less water, reducing the risk of over or under-watering.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Develop a watering can with solar panels that power a small pump. This can allow the user to collect rainwater in a reservoir and use the pump to water plants automatically based on a timer or moisture level. The solar-powered feature would make it environmentally friendly and reduce the need for manual labor."
