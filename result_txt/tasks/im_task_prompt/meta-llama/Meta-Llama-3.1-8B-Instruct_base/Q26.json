    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can with Integrated Composting**: Design a trash can that incorporates a built-in composting system, allowing users to easily separate organic waste from non-organic waste. The can would have two separate compartments, one for trash and one for composting. The composting compartment would have a built-in aerator, ensuring optimal decomposition conditions. The system would also include a sensor that monitors the moisture levels and temperature, providing real-time feedback to the user on the composting process. This innovative design would encourage users to reduce their waste and create nutrient-rich soil for gardening.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with AI-Powered Waste Sorting**: Develop a smart trash can that uses AI technology to sort waste into different categories, such as recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclable waste. The can would be equipped with computer vision and machine learning algorithms that can identify the type of waste and direct it to the appropriate compartment. This would significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and increase recycling rates.",
    "**Trash Can with Built-in Recycling Station**: Design a trash can that doubles as a recycling station, complete with a compact recycling bin and a built-in recycling guide. The can would have separate compartments for different types of recyclables, such as paper, plastic, and glass. The recycling guide would provide users with information on what can be recycled and how to prepare materials for recycling. This design would make recycling easier and more accessible for users.",
    "**Solar-Powered Trash Can with Integrated LED Lighting**: Develop a trash can that harnesses solar power to charge its LED lighting system, providing users with a safe and visible way to navigate to the can at night. The can would also have a built-in sensor that detects when the trash needs to be emptied, sending a notification to the user's phone or email. This design would reduce energy consumption and make trash disposal more convenient.",
    "**Trash Can with Integrated Pest Control and Odor Elimination**: Design a trash can that incorporates a built-in pest control system, using ultrasonic technology to repel pests and rodents. The can would also have an odor-eliminating system, using natural air-purifying agents to eliminate unpleasant smells. This design would keep trash cans clean and pest-free, reducing the risk of disease transmission and unpleasant odors. "
