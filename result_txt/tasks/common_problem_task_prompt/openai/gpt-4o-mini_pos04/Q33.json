    "**Food Scarcity and Nutrition**: Surviving on a deserted island poses the challenge of finding sufficient and nutritious food. Relying solely on foraging can lead to malnutrition or food poisoning from inedible plants. To address this, one could create a small garden using seeds salvaged from any food packaging found or collected, while also learning about local edible plants and fishing techniques to diversify their diet.",
    "**Shelter from the Elements**: Weather conditions can be unpredictable, and surviving without proper shelter can lead to exposure-related illnesses. Building a sturdy shelter using natural materials like palm fronds and driftwood can provide protection from rain, wind, and sun. Incorporating features like raised floors can help keep the shelter dry and insulated.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: One of the most pressing concerns is how to signal for help. Without proper communication tools, it can be difficult to attract the attention of passing ships or planes. A creative solution would be to build a large SOS sign using stones or logs on the beach, which can be seen from the air. Additionally, creating a large smoke signal using green leaves and driftwood can attract attention during the day.",
    "**Mental Health and Isolation**: The psychological toll of being stranded can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and despair. To combat this, one could establish a daily routine that includes physical activities like swimming or hiking, creative expression through journaling or crafting, and meditation to maintain mental clarity and positivity. Engaging in these activities can foster a sense of purpose and keep morale high.",
    "**Injury and Medical Care**: Accidents can happen, and without access to medical care, even minor injuries can become serious. A proactive approach would involve creating a first-aid kit using natural resources. For example, using aloe vera for burns, honey for its antibacterial properties, and learning how to use plant-based remedies for common ailments can help manage injuries effectively."
