    "**Resilient Data Storage**: I'd focus on developing resilient data storage solutions that could withstand a global internet shutdown. This could be achieved through: \t* **Decentralized data storage**: Using decentralized storage solutions like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or Filecoin to store data across a network of nodes.",
    "**Alternative Information Channels**: I'd focus on creating"
