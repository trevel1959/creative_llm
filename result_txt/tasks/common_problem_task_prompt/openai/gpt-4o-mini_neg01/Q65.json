    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Use biodegradable or recyclable materials for the smartphone's casing and internal components. This would tackle the environmental issues associated with electronic waste. By partnering with organizations focused on sustainable materials, the smartphone could be made from plant-based plastics or recycled metals, and include a take-back program for old devices, ensuring they are disposed of responsibly.",
    "**Adaptive Display Technology**: Develop a smartphone with a display that adapts its size based on user preference. For example, it could extend to a tablet size for media consumption or retract for easy portability. This innovation would solve the problem of having to choose between a compact phone and a larger tablet, providing a versatile solution that can cater to different usage scenarios.",
    "**AI-Powered Health Monitoring**: Integrate advanced sensors and AI algorithms to monitor health metrics such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and stress levels. This would not only provide users with insights into their health but also encourage healthier lifestyles. The smartphone could offer personalized recommendations based on collected data, addressing the growing concern about health and wellness in the digital age.",
    "**Holographic Interface**: Instead of a traditional touchscreen, create a smartphone that utilizes holographic projection technology to display a 3D interface. Users could interact with virtual buttons and icons in mid-air, providing a futuristic and immersive experience. This would address the limitations of screen size and improve accessibility for users with visual impairments by allowing customizable display settings.",
    "**Universal Connectivity Hub**: Design the smartphone to function as a universal connectivity hub that seamlessly connects to various smart devices in a userâ€™s home. It could integrate IoT protocols, allowing users to control lights, thermostats, and security systems directly from their phone. This would simplify the user experience and enhance the concept of a smart home, addressing the fragmented nature of current smart device ecosystems."
