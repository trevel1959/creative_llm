For example, sunglasses for hiking might feature polarized lenses to reduce glare from snow or water surfaces, while those for cycling could have adjustable arms to prevent slipping during high-speed movements.",
    "**Smart Sunglasses with Health Monitoring Features**: Create a pair of sunglasses that can monitor the wearer's health parameters such as heart rate, UV exposure, and eye health. They could be equipped with miniaturized sensors and connected to a smartphone app for real-time data tracking and alerts about potential health issues.",
    "**Sustainable Sunglasses from Recycled Materials**: Develop a collection of eco-friendly sunglasses made from recycled materials like ocean plastics, recycled glass, or biodegradable acetate. This not only reduces environmental impact but also appeals to consumers who prioritize sustainability.",
    "**Customizable Sunglasses for Personal Branding**: Offer a service where customers can customize their sunglasses with unique designs, logos, or colors. This can be done online through a dedicated platform where users can upload their own artwork or choose from a variety of templates. The sunglasses can then be produced and shipped directly to them.",
    "**Sunglasses with Augmented Reality Technology**: Integrate AR technology into sunglasses to enhance user experience. For instance, they could display information like weather updates, navigation directions, or even virtual reality content when viewing certain scenes. This would create an immersive and interactive way of using sunglasses beyond just sun protection."
