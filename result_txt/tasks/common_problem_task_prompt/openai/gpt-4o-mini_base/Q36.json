    "**Regulatory Hurdles**: Each city has its own zoning laws and regulations regarding solar panel installations. There could be restrictions on aesthetics, building codes, or neighborhood guidelines that might complicate or prevent the installation of solar panels. Navigating these regulations can be time-consuming and may require public hearings or changes in local laws.",
    "**Financial Barriers for Homeowners**: While solar panels can reduce electricity costs in the long run, the upfront costs for installation can be prohibitive for many homeowners. Some may not qualify for financing options or may be hesitant to take on debt, leading to inequity in access to renewable energy. There may need to be a subsidy or incentive program to help lower-income families participate.",
    "**Intermittent Energy Production**: Solar panels produce energy only when the sun is shining, which means that energy production can be inconsistent. This variability can create challenges for homeowners relying solely on solar energy, especially during cloudy days or in winter months. Homeowners may need to invest in battery storage systems or remain connected to the grid, complicating the intended goal of energy independence.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Issues**: Solar panels require maintenance and, eventually, replacement of parts like inverters or batteries. Homeowners may not be aware of these ongoing costs or may lack the skills to perform basic maintenance, leading to underperformance of the solar system. There could also be a shortage of qualified technicians to handle repairs, especially in areas with a sudden surge in installations.",
    "**Impact on Property Values**: While many believe that solar panels increase property values, the opposite could also be true in certain markets. Homes with poorly installed or unattractive solar systems might deter potential buyers, especially if the aesthetic does not align with neighborhood standards. Additionally, if the solar installation is seen as a financial burden rather than a benefit, it could negatively impact the resale value."
