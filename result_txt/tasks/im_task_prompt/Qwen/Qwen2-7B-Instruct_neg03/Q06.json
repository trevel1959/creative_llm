    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Rain and Sun**: Create an umbrella that adjusts its size according to the intensity of rain or sun exposure. When it's raining heavily, the umbrella automatically expands to provide more coverage, while in sunny conditions, it can retract to allow some sunlight through. This design could also include a smart feature that connects to a smartphone app to adjust the umbrella's size based on real-time weather updates.",
    "**Umbrella as a Portable Power Station**: Develop an umbrella that doubles as a portable power bank for charging electronic devices. It would have built-in solar panels that recharge the internal battery when exposed to sunlight, making it a practical solution for outdoor events, camping trips, or emergency situations where power access is limited.",
    "**Interactive Umbrella Advertising Platform**: Create a large-scale promotional tool by designing an advertising umbrella for public spaces like malls, airports, or parks. The umbrella would display digital advertisements that change every few minutes, attracting attention from passersby. The advertisements could be interactive, using QR codes or NFC tags to engage viewers further.",
    "**Smart Umbrella with Smart Home Integration**: Design an umbrella that can integrate with a smart home system. The umbrella could open automatically when the user's smartwatch detects they are walking in the rain and close when they reach their destination. It could also connect to other smart devices like lights or heating systems, creating a seamless experience between outdoor and indoor environments.",
    "**Umbrella Recycling Program**: Initiate a creative project to address environmental concerns by promoting the recycling of used umbrellas. Partner with local businesses to offer discounts on new umbrellas for customers who bring in their old ones. These umbrellas could then be disassembled and repurposed into eco-friendly products such as bags, mats, or insulation materials, reducing waste and promoting sustainability."
