    "**Color-Changing Pencil**: Develop a pencil that changes color as the user writes or draws, creating a dynamic and interactive experience. This could be achieved through a thermochromic or photochromic material that reacts to temperature or light changes, allowing the pencil to shift colors as the user writes.",
    "**Smart Pencil with Bluetooth Connectivity**: Create a pencil that connects to a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, allowing users to access a digital canvas and upload their drawings or writings directly to their device. This feature would enable users to share their creations with others, track their progress, and receive feedback.",
    "**Scent-Emitting Pencil**: Design a pencil that releases a pleasant scent as the user writes or draws, creating a multisensory experience. This could be achieved through a fragrance-infused core or a scent-emitting coating on the pencil's surface.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Pencil**: Develop a pencil that glows in the dark, allowing users to write or draw in low-light environments. This could be achieved through a glow-in-the-dark coating or a special phosphorescent material that absorbs light and emits it over time.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Pencil**: Create a pencil that changes shape or form as the user writes or draws, allowing for greater creativity and flexibility. This could be achieved through a mechanism that adjusts the pencil's tip or body in response to the user's movements."
