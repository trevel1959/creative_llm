    "**Solar Power Charging Sleeping Bag:** Design a sleeping bag that integrates solar panels into its fabric. The panels would charge an internal battery, which can power small devices such as phones or lights during the night. This innovative idea could be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts who often find themselves in remote locations without access to electricity.",
    "**Waterproof Insulated Sleeping Bag:** Develop a sleeping bag made of waterproof materials, ideal for use in wet environments. The insulation should be highly effective at retaining heat while keeping moisture out, ensuring warmth even when sleeping on damp ground. This would be especially beneficial for hikers, campers, and people living in humid climates.",
    "**Smart Temperature Adjusting Sleeping Bag:** Incorporate smart technology into the sleeping bag, allowing it to adjust its temperature based on the user's body heat and external weather conditions. This could involve sensors that detect changes in body temperature and automatically adjust the insulation level, providing comfort in various environments.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Recyclable Sleeping Bag:** Create a sleeping bag made from sustainable materials that are both biodegradable and recyclable. The bag could be made from natural fibers like hemp or recycled materials like plastic bottles. This would reduce waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Emergency Survival Sleeping Bag:** Design a lightweight, compact sleeping bag that can double as emergency survival gear. It could have features like reflective materials for signaling rescuers, built-in water purification capabilities, or a whistle for distress signals. This would be particularly useful for adventurers and those living in areas prone to natural disasters."
