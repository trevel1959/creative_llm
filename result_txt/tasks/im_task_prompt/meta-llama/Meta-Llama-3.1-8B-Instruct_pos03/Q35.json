    "What's a good title for a movie based on the story of how the Titanic sank?  \"Titanic\" already is a movie based on this story,  so it's got to be more creative.  How would you approach this and come up with a title? ",
    "No puns. ",
    "**No obvious connections**: The title should not be too obvious, but still be relatable and thought-provoking.",
    "**Creative wordplay**: Use wordplay to convey the meaning, and also to create a new perspective on the story.",
    "**Originality**: Each title should be entirely original and unique, with its own distinct voice and perspective."
