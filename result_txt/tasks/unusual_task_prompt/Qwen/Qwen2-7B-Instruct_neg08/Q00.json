    "**Biodegradable Building Material**: Create a new type of building material by mixing organic waste (like food scraps) with a mortar made from natural binders. This mixture can be poured into a mold and allowed to harden around bricks, creating a sustainable, biodegradable structure that can be used for temporary shelters or eco-friendly housing.",
    "**Interactive Public Art Installation**: Design a large-scale sculpture using interconnected bricks that change color based on the viewer's emotional state. Sensors could detect facial expressions or heart rate variability, triggering a corresponding color change, thus transforming the artwork into an interactive piece that responds to human emotions.",
    "**Sound Absorbing Wall Panels**: Incorporate bricks with small holes drilled through them to create acoustic panels. These can be used to reduce noise pollution in urban areas, particularly in schools, hospitals, or residential buildings where sound management is crucial.",
    "**Self-Watering Garden Edging**: Create garden borders out of bricks filled with soil and containing a reservoir at the bottom. Water flows through small perforations in the bricks, slowly seeping into the soil, providing a consistent water supply to plants without the need for frequent manual watering.",
    "**Recycling and Waste Management Hub**: Design a modular structure using bricks that serves as a recycling station and composting facility. This could include areas for sorting recyclables, composting organic waste, and even generating energy through anaerobic digestion of organic materials."
