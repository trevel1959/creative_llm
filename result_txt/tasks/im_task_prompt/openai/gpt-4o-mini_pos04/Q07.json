    "**Self-Cleaning Toothbrush**:    - Develop a toothbrush with a self-cleaning feature using UV-C light technology. After each use, the toothbrush could automatically activate a UV-C light that sanitizes the bristles, killing bacteria and viruses. This would ensure that the toothbrush remains hygienic without the need for manual cleaning, making it more convenient and appealing to users who prioritize cleanliness.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**:    - Create a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or plant-based plastics. The bristles could be made from natural fibers like boar hair or a plant-derived polymer. This toothbrush would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and could be marketed with a subscription service that encourages users to recycle their old brushes responsibly.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**:    - Design a toothbrush that includes a small, built-in water flosser feature. This dual-action device would allow users to brush and floss simultaneously, improving their oral hygiene routine. The water flosser could be activated with a button, providing a gentle stream of water to help remove food particles and plaque between teeth while brushing.",
    "**Customizable Brush Head System**:    - Introduce a toothbrush with interchangeable brush heads that cater to different dental needs. Users could choose from various bristle types (soft, medium, hard), shapes (angled, flat), and even add features like gum massagers or tongue scrapers. This customizable approach allows individuals to tailor their brushing experience based on their specific oral health requirements.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**:    - Develop a toothbrush specifically designed for children that incorporates interactive features, such as built-in games or animated characters that guide them through the brushing process. The toothbrush could light up, play music, or provide rewards for completing brushing sessions. This would make brushing fun and engaging for kids, encouraging them to develop good dental habits early on."
