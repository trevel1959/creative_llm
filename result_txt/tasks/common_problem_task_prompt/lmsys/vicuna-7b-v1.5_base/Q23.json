    "Resistance to Change: Another potential problem is resistance to the new policy from various stakeholders, including government employees, citizens, and interest groups. This resistance can manifest in different ways, such as protests, petitions, or a lack of cooperation. To overcome this obstacle, the government could engage in open dialogue with stakeholders, address their concerns, and provide clear explanations for the policy's benefits.",
    "Resource Constraints: Implementing a new policy may require significant financial, human, or material resources. If the government lacks the necessary resources, the policy's implementation may be delayed or compromised. To address this issue, the government could prioritize the policy, seek additional funding, or reallocate resources from other areas.",
    "Technical Challenges: The policy's implementation may also face technical challenges, such as outdated infrastructure, insufficient technology, or a lack of skilled personnel. These challenges can slow down the implementation process and increase costs. To address this problem, the government could invest in modernizing its infrastructure, provide training to employees, or seek external expertise.",
    "Policy Ambiguity: A new policy may be ambiguous or unclear, which can lead to confusion among stakeholders about what is expected of them. This confusion can result in misinterpretations, misunderstandings, or a lack of commitment to the policy's goals. To address this issue, the government could work on clarifying the policy's objectives, creating clear guidelines, and providing regular updates to stakeholders.",
    "Political Opposition: A new government policy may face political opposition from opposing political parties or factions within the ruling party. This opposition can lead to delays, obstacles, or even the policy's abandonment. To overcome this obstacle, the government could build coalitions, engage in negotiations, or seek bipartisan support for the policy."
