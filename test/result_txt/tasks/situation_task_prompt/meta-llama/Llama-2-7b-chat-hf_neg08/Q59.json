    "Install a Solar Panel Roof: Create a specialized roof design that integrates solar panels to harness the sun's energy. This would provide a reliable source of sunlight, even on cloudy days. The panels could be angled to maximize energy production and could be easily installed on existing homes or built into new construction.",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Design tall, slender towers that can pierce through the clouds, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. These towers could be equipped with advanced materials and technologies to ensure structural stability and safety. They could be placed strategically throughout the region to provide consistent sunlight.",
    "Sun-Collecting Drones: Develop small, agile drones that can fly above the clouds, collecting sunlight and redistributing it to areas below. These drones could be powered by solar panels or advanced batteries, ensuring a sustainable energy source. They could be programmed to fly in patterns that maximize sunlight collection and delivery.",
    "Cloud-Avoiding Buildings: Design buildings with unique, cloud-penetrating shapes that allow sunlight to reach the ground. These buildings could be constructed with specialized materials that reflect or absorb cloud cover, ensuring a consistent supply of sunlight. They could be used for residential, commercial, or public purposes.",
    "Artificial Sunlight Generators: Develop advanced technologies that can generate artificial sunlight, mimicking the properties of natural sunlight. These generators could use advanced LEDs or other lighting technologies to produce a spectrum of light similar to natural sunlight. They could be used to supplement cloudy days, providing a consistent source of sunlight for various applications."
