    "Another potential problem is the impact of weather conditions on the construction process. High-rise buildings are exposed to more severe weather conditions than low-rise buildings. This could cause delays and additional costs due to weather-related damages. ",
    "Another challenge when constructing high-rise buildings is ensuring the safety of the building occupants and the public during the construction process. This includes maintaining safe access to the construction site and ensuring that construction equipment, materials, and debris do not pose a hazard.",
    "There is also the issue of coordinating with multiple stakeholders, including architects, engineers, contractors, and suppliers. Miscommunications or disagreements between these parties could lead to delays and additional costs.",
    "High-rise buildings also require extensive infrastructure, including roads, utilities, and transportation systems. This may result in disruptions during the construction process, including road closures, detours, and public transit disruptions.",
    "Land acquisition can be a major challenge. High-rise buildings require large plots of land, which can be in short supply in urban areas. The cost of acquiring land could also be a significant financial burden for the project."
