    "**Innovative Water Filtration Device**: Create a portable, compact device that utilizes advanced technology like nanotechnology or reverse osmosis to filter out contaminants from any water source. This could be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels, making it sustainable and accessible in remote areas. It could also have a built-in UV sterilization system to kill bacteria and viruses, ensuring the water is safe to drink.",
    "**Water Purification Pods**: Develop small, biodegradable pods that can be dropped into contaminated water bodies. These pods could release enzymes and other natural substances that break down pollutants and contaminants, gradually purifying the water over time. They could be designed to be eco-friendly, breaking down naturally after their job is done, and potentially even releasing nutrients beneficial for aquatic life.",
    "**Community Water Sharing Stations**: Establish community-based systems where people can exchange clean water bottles, refillable jugs, or containers. These stations could be equipped with filtration systems, allowing community members to access clean water. The concept encourages cooperation and sustainability within communities, reducing reliance on single-use plastics and promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Tablets**: Create a line of water purification tablets that are easy to use and highly effective against various contaminants. These tablets could be made from natural, biodegradable materials and contain a combination of filters, minerals, and chemicals that ensure the water is safe to drink. They could come in individual packets, making them convenient for travel, camping, or emergency situations.",
    "**Aquatic Plant-Based Water Purifiers**: Develop a system using aquatic plants known for their water-purifying properties, such as water hyacinth or duckweed. These plants can be grown in contained water bodies or tanks, where they absorb pollutants and nutrients, eventually producing clean water. This system could be used in conjunction with traditional water treatment methods, enhancing their effectiveness while providing additional benefits like oxygen production and ecosystem support. "
