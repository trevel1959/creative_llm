    "A decrease in the speed of light could result in a dramatic increase in theor the speed of sound, as this rate could no longer be limited by Light's speed. As such, the speed of sound would therefore increase in the range of at least several hundred times over about its current value.",
    "A slower rate of Light would also weaken the range in which radio signals could be transmitted. It would be to become more and more difficult for a human radio station to be heard by others at great distances, and so humans could be able to contact other humans on Earth about any distance greater than about ten or twelve kilometers. Similarly, satellite tvisions would be less efficient, and thus would less likely to be used about large areas of the planet.",
    "Theor theor the speed of light as is currently known is an event that occurs withing a range of one to thousand to one trillion times the rate of normal physical speeds. Consequently, this speed is not something that can be easily understood about humans, as a rate of about one trillion feet per second could never be something that they experience directly. So if a change were to occur, then it would be quite difficult for anyone to realize that it had changed, and thus they would continue along they way they are now.",
    "On the other hand, people would notice that their eyebook's were not working the way they normally do. For example, if someone were to try to catch a football, then it would be that they would not be able to do so. Moreover, when people were to have an earthquake, the groundwould no longer shake about as it does.",
    "One important effect of slower light would be about earthquakes. Suppose that the speed of light were to be about one half of its value, then Earth's gravity would be about twice as strong as it is now, and thus an earthquake might be about twice as strong, and thus twice as difficult to survive. This would be true mainly about large structures like skyscrapers and bridges, and would be therefore be a good idea for engineers to do as much building as they are now, while the range is still viable."
