    "Alternative Energy Sources: In a world without access to electricity or other modern conveniences, I would focus on alternative energy sources to power medical equipment and facilities.

This could involve building solar panels, wind turbines, or hydroelectric generators, as well as experimenting with other alternative energy sources. By being able to generate my own power, I would be able to provide medical care without relying on external sources of energy.",
