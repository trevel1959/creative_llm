    "**Interchangeable Attachments**: Design a hair dryer with a modular system that allows users to easily swap out different attachments based on their styling needs. For example, users could switch between a diffuser for curly hair, a concentrator for straightening, and a volumizing attachment for added body. This would enhance versatility and make the hair dryer suitable for all hair types and styles.",
    "**Built-in Aromatherapy**: Integrate an aromatherapy diffuser into the hair dryer that releases essential oils while drying hair. Users could choose their preferred scent, which would not only enhance their mood but also provide a calming experience during their hair care routine. The dryer could come with a selection of essential oil capsules that can be easily replaced.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Develop a hair dryer with advanced noise-canceling technology to minimize sound levels during operation. This would be particularly beneficial for early morning or late-night users who want to avoid waking others in the household. The design could incorporate sound-absorbing materials and a quieter motor to create a more pleasant drying experience.",
    "**Portable Travel Companion**: Create a compact, foldable hair dryer designed specifically for travelers. This hair dryer could have dual voltage capabilities, making it suitable for international use. Additionally, it could come with a built-in power bank for charging devices on the go, ensuring that users can stay connected while maintaining their hair care routine.",
    "**Color-Changing LED Indicator**: Introduce a color-changing LED light on the hair dryer that indicates the heat level and drying status. For example, blue could signify cool air, yellow for medium heat, and red for high heat. This visual cue would help users understand their settings at a glance and encourage them to use the appropriate heat for their hair type."
