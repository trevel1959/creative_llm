    "Genetic Engineering: One idea could be to use genetic engineering to create new foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. Scientists could modify plants or animals to produce certain nutrients naturally, such as vitamin A from algae or iron from bacteria. This approach could potentially lead to a wide variety of new and nutritious foods that could replace the ones we currently rely on.",
    "Synthetic Vitamins: Another idea could be to develop synthetic vitamins that can be easily added to food or taken orally as supplements. These vitamins could be designed to mimic the structure and function of natural vitamins, providing the body with all the necessary nutrients it needs.",
    "Alternative Sources: Instead of relying on traditional sources of vitamins and minerals, people could turn to alternative sources such as mushrooms, seaweed, and other edible fungi. Many of these foods are already known for their nutritional value and could potentially provide a significant amount of the vitamins and minerals we need.",
    "Hydroponic Farming: Hydroponic farming is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water instead. By using hydroponics, people could grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables that are high in vitamins and minerals, even in areas where traditional farming methods are not feasible.",
    "Community Gardens: Finally, community gardens could play an important role in ensuring that people have access to fresh fruits and vegetables even if they do not have access to a traditional grocery store. People could work together to grow a variety of crops, sharing the harvest and learning about different ways to incorporate more nutrition into their diets."
