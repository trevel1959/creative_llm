    "Vitamin and mineral supplements: One option would be to rely on vitamin and mineral supplements to fill the gap left by the disappearance of fruits and vegetables. These supplements could be in the form of pills, capsules, or powders, and could be taken daily to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients.",
    "Lab-grown produce: Another option would be to use advanced technology to grow produce in labs, using a controlled environment to replicate the conditions necessary for plants to thrive. This would allow for the production of fruits and vegetables without the need for soil or natural sunlight, ensuring a steady supply of essential nutrients.",
    "Insect farming: Insects are a rich source of protein and other essential nutrients, and could potentially be farmed on a large scale to provide a sustainable alternative to traditional fruits and vegetables. This could involve using specialized greenhouses or indoor farming systems to raise insects like crickets, mealworms, or grasshoppers.",
    "Algae-based nutrition: Algae are a diverse group of organisms that are rich in nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and protein. Algae could be farmed in large quantities and used as a supplement or as a base for other food products, such as algae-based milk or algae-based meat substitutes.",
    "Fermentation-based foods: Fermentation is a process that involves the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, resulting in the production of nutrient-rich foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir. By using fermentation to produce foods like these, it would be possible to maintain a steady supply of essential vitamins and minerals, even in the absence of fruits and vegetables."
