    "Once in the heart of the jungle, there lived a fierce tiger named Tigris, known for his strength and roar. Yet, beneath his majestic stripes, he harbored a secret fear—mice. The tiniest creatures sent him scurrying behind bushes, much to the amusement of the other animals. One day, a mischievous mouse named Milo decided to confront Tigris. “Why are you afraid of us?” he squeaked. Tigris, embarrassed, confessed his fear. Milo, with a brave heart, offered to teach Tigris about courage. Together, they faced the jungle’s challenges, and Tigris learned that true bravery comes in all sizes—even from a tiny mouse.",
