[
    "\"Magical Efficiency\": Create a spellbook that teaches witches how to maximize their productivity with minimal magical effort. This book would include spells and incantations for things like \"Instant Cleaning\" and \"Super Speed\" that help witches complete tasks quickly and efficiently.",
    "\"Task-Taming\": Develop a magical potion that allows witches to focus their energy on a single task, making them more productive and efficient. This potion would be called \"Task-Tamer\" and would come in different strengths for different tasks, such as \"Mega-Focus\" for large projects and \"Quick-Boost\" for smaller tasks.",
    "\"Magical Timetable\": Create a magical planner that helps witches schedule their tasks and prioritize their time. This planner would have different sections for different areas of life, such as work, personal, and spell-casting, and would allow witches to set reminders, deadlines, and goals.",
    "\"Effortless Enchantments\": Develop a line of magical tools and gadgets that make spell-casting easier and more efficient. This could include things like a \"Wand-O-Matic\" that automatically charges and selects the perfect wand for a spell, or a \"Spell-O-Matic\" that generates pre-written spells for common tasks like cleaning and organization.",
    "\"Magical Multitasking\": Create a magical ability that allows witches to perform multiple spells at once. This could be a spell that allows witches to split their magical energy into multiple tasks, or a potion that allows them to perform multiple spells simultaneously. This would help witches get more done in less time and reduce feelings of jealousy and inadequacy."
