    "Multiple Sharpener: Design a pencil with a built-in, replaceable sharpener that can be easily swapped out when the point gets too dull. This would allow users to maintain a sharp pencil without needing to constantly sharpen it manually.",
    "Mechanical Pencil Extender: Create a pencil extender that can be screwed onto the end of a mechanical pencil, extending its reach and allowing for more precise writing. This would be particularly useful for artists, draftsmen, and anyone who needs to write or draw at a distance.",
    "Eco-Friendly Materials: Develop a pencil made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled wood or sustainably sourced graphite. This would not only make the pencil more environmentally friendly but also give it a unique, natural aesthetic.",
    "Interchangeable Lead Types: Design a pencil with interchangeable lead types, allowing users to switch between different hardnesses and colors to suit their needs. This would be particularly useful for artists, who often require a variety of lead qualities for their work.",
    "Retractable Lead: Create a pencil with a retractable lead that can be extended and retracted, similar to a pen with a ballpoint tip. This would provide a more convenient writing experience, especially for those who prefer the smoothness of a pen but still want the convenience of a pencil."
