    "**Solar Desalination Pods**: Create portable solar-powered desalination pods that can be deployed in coastal areas. These pods would use solar energy to heat seawater, causing evaporation, and then condense the vapor into freshwater. The design would include a compact, modular system that can be easily transported and set up in disaster-stricken areas or regions with no clean water access.",
    "**Biofiltration Systems Using Mycelium**: Harness the natural filtering capabilities of mycelium (the root structure of fungi) to create biofiltration systems. These systems would use mycelium to break down pollutants in contaminated water, effectively cleaning it. The mycelium could be cultivated on agricultural waste, making it a sustainable option. Once filtered, the water would undergo additional purification steps to ensure itâ€™s safe for drinking.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting Drones**: Design drones equipped with rainwater harvesting technology that can fly to collect rainwater in areas where traditional methods are impractical. These drones would have a built-in filtration system to purify the collected rainwater before transporting it back to communities in need. This solution would be especially useful in regions experiencing intermittent rainfall.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Tablets**: Develop innovative purification tablets that utilize a combination of natural coagulants (like moringa seeds) and advanced filtration technology. These tablets could be added to contaminated water sources to coagulate and precipitate pollutants, making the water easier to filter. Users could then pour the water through a portable filter system to obtain clean drinking water.",
    "**Aquaponic Water Systems**: Establish aquaponic systems that integrate fish farming with plant cultivation. The fish waste would provide nutrients for the plants, while the plants naturally filter and purify the water. By maintaining a closed-loop system, this method not only provides clean water but also produces food, creating a sustainable source of both water and nutrition."
