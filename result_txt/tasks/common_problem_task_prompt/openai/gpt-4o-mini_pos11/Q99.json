    "**Haptic Feedback Cane**: Create a cane that uses haptic feedback to communicate information about the environment to the user. This cane could have sensors that detect obstacles and terrain changes, providing vibrations of varying intensity and patterns to convey information. For example, a quick vibration could indicate a nearby obstacle, while a longer, steady vibration might signal a change in elevation. This would enhance the traditional white cane experience by adding an extra layer of situational awareness.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Home System**: Design a voice-activated smart home system specifically tailored for visually impaired users. This system would allow users to control lights, appliances, and security features through simple voice commands. Additionally, the system could include an AI assistant that can read out notifications, reminders, and messages, making it easier for users to stay connected and manage their daily tasks without needing visual interfaces.",
    "**Wearable Object Identifier**: Develop a wearable device, like a wristband or pendant, that uses a camera and machine learning algorithms to identify objects in the user’s environment. When the user points the device at an object, it can recognize and announce the object’s name and relevant information (e.g., “This is a red apple” or “You are holding a smartphone”). This device would help visually impaired individuals identify everyday items and navigate their surroundings more easily.",
    "**Interactive Braille E-Book Reader**: Create an innovative e-book reader that features a dynamic Braille display. This device would allow users to read e-books in Braille with the ability to change text and formatting instantly. The reader could also include audio features, allowing users to switch between Braille and audio narration seamlessly. This would enhance the reading experience for visually impaired individuals, providing access to a wider range of literature and educational materials.",
    "**Social Interaction App for the Visually Impaired**: Develop a mobile app designed to facilitate social interactions for visually impaired individuals. The app could use voice recognition and AI to help users find and connect with others in their area who share similar interests or hobbies. It could also provide prompts for conversation starters and facilitate group meet-ups, fostering community engagement and reducing feelings of isolation."
