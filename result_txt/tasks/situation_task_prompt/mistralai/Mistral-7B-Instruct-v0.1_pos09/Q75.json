    "-to- conversion:-to-forest conversion is a process that involves converting forested areas into agricultural land. This process can be used to convert forests into farmland, which can then be used to grow crops that can be used as fuel for vehicles. The conversion process would involve clearing the forest, planting crops, and then harvesting them for use as fuel.",
    "hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are devices that convert hydrogen gas into electricity, which can then be used to power vehicles. These cells work by using a catalyst to combine hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air to produce electricity. The electricity can then be used to power an electric motor, which drives the wheels of the vehicle.",
    "wind turbines: Wind turbines are devices that convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. These turbines work by using wind to turn a rotor, which is connected to a generator. The generator produces electricity, which can then be used to power vehicles.",
    "solar panels: Solar panels are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. These panels work by using photovoltaic cells to capture the energy from the sun and convert it into electricity. The electricity can then be used to power vehicles.",
    "electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are vehicles that run on electricity, rather than gasoline or diesel fuel. These vehicles work by using an electric motor to drive the wheels, and they are powered by rechargeable batteries. To power the batteries, the vehicle can be plugged into an electric outlet."
