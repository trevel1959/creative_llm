    "Inefficient Route Planning: Poor route planning can lead to inefficiencies in the transportation system. For example, if the routes do not align with the city's demographic patterns, it can result in underutilized or overcrowded buses and trains, causing inconvenience to passengers and inefficiencies in the system.",
    "Infrastructure Limitations: The existing infrastructure may not be capable of supporting the new transportation system. For example, old bridges, tunnels, or roads may need to be repaired or replaced, which can be expensive and time-consuming.",
    "Environmental Impact: Overhauling the public transportation system can have a significant environmental impact. The construction and operation of new transportation systems can lead to air and noise pollution, and the use of fossil fuels can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Labor Disputes: Labor disputes can cause delays and disruptions in the transportation system. Workers may go on strike or engage in other forms of protest, which can lead to delays in the transportation system and inconvenience to passengers.",
    "Integration with Other Modes of Transportation: Integrating the new public transportation system with other modes of transportation, such as bicycles, scooters, and walking, can be challenging. The infrastructure and systems must be compatible, and passengers must be able to easily transfer between different modes of transportation."
