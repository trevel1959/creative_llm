    "Lack of Trust: Another issue that may arise with owning a self-driving car is the lack of trust among passengers. Many people may be hesitant to rely on a machine to drive them around, especially in situations where human judgment is critical, such as in heavy traffic or inclement weather. This could lead to a decrease in demand for self-driving cars, making them less viable in the market.",
    "Cybersecurity Risks: As self-driving cars rely on complex software and connectivity to operate, they may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. Hackers could potentially gain access to the car's systems and cause accidents, disrupt traffic flow, or steal sensitive information. This could lead to a loss of public trust in self-driving cars and slow their adoption.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas: With self-driving cars, there may be situations where the AI system has to make difficult decisions, such as choosing between hitting a pedestrian or swerving into oncoming traffic. These ethical dilemmas could lead to legal and moral disputes, as there may not be clear guidelines on how to handle such situations.",
    "Regulatory Challenges: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, there may be a need for new regulations to govern their use. However, the lack of clear regulations could lead to confusion and uncertainty, making it difficult for manufacturers and users to know what is allowed and what is not. This could slow the adoption of self-driving cars and hinder their widespread use.",
    "Privacy Concerns: Self-driving cars collect a vast amount of data, including information on the car's location, speed, and occupants. This could raise privacy concerns, as the data could be used for purposes other than the car's operation, such as targeted advertising or surveillance. This could lead to a decrease in public trust and a reluctance to use self-driving cars."
