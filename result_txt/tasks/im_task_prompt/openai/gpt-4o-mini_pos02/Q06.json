    "**Self-Closing Mechanism**: Design an umbrella that features a self-closing mechanism. When the user presses a button on the handle, the umbrella automatically folds itself up, eliminating the hassle of manually closing it. This would be especially useful in crowded areas or when getting into a vehicle, allowing users to keep one hand free and avoid dripping water everywhere.",
    "**UV-Blocking Fabric**: Develop an umbrella made from a specialized fabric that not only protects against rain but also blocks harmful UV rays. This fabric could be lightweight and breathable, making it suitable for both sun and rain protection. The design could include a reflective coating that keeps the umbrella cool to the touch, enhancing user comfort during hot sunny days.",
    "**Portable Charging Station**: Create an umbrella with built-in solar panels that can charge small electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The handle could house a battery pack that stores solar energy collected while the umbrella is in use. This way, users can stay connected even during rainy weather, making it perfect for outdoor events or emergencies.",
    "**Modular Umbrella System**: Design a modular umbrella system that allows users to customize their umbrella based on weather conditions. The user could switch out different canopy designs for sun, rain, or wind resistance. Additionally, the handle could be interchangeable, offering features like a flashlight, a speaker, or a personal safety alarm, depending on the user's needs.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design**: Innovate an umbrella with a double-canopy structure that allows wind to pass through without flipping the umbrella inside out. This design could incorporate flexible ribs made from advanced materials that bend but do not break in high winds. The umbrella could also feature a weighted base for stability, making it suitable for use on windy days at the beach or during outdoor events."
