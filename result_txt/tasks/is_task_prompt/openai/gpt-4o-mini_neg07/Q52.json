    "Once upon a time in a lush green pond, there lived a frog named Ferdinand who dreamed of being a prince. Every night, he gazed at the stars, wishing for a magical transformation. One fateful evening, a shimmering firefly appeared and offered to grant his wish, but with a twistâ€”Ferdinand would only become a prince for one day. Excited, he accepted. The next morning, he awoke in a grand castle, adorned in royal attire. However, he soon realized the burdens of royalty: endless meetings and no time for fun. By sunset, he returned to his pond, grateful for his simple, joyful life.",
