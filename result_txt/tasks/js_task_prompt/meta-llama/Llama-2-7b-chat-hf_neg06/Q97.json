    "Sour-Sweet Symphony: This new candy would be a fusion of tangy and sweet flavors, creating a unique taste experience. The candy would have a crunchy texture, similar to a peanut butter crunch, but with a twist. The outer layer would be covered in a sour sugar coating, while the inside would be a sweet and fruity mix of strawberry and lemon. Each bite would start with a puckering sensation from the sour coating, followed by a burst of sweetness and a fruity tang.",
    "Spicy Surprise: This candy would be a spicy take on the classic peppermint. The outer layer would be a crunchy peppermint shell, but instead of the usual refreshing mint flavor, it would be infused with a spicy kick from chili peppers. The inside would be a creamy caramel filling, adding a rich and smooth texture to the candy. Each bite would start with the cooling sensation of the peppermint, followed by a slow-building heat from the chili peppers, finishing with a sweet caramel aftertaste.",
    "Fruity Fusion: This candy would combine the best of both worlds by blending tropical fruit flavors with a creamy, smooth chocolate center. The outer layer would be a colorful mix of pineapple, mango, and passionfruit, while the inside would be a rich, velvety chocolate. Each bite would start with a sweet and fruity explosion, followed by a smooth and creamy chocolate finish.",
    "Nutty Nirvana: This candy would be a playful take on the classic peanut butter cup, but with a twist. Instead of a peanut butter filling, the candy would have a creamy cashew butter center, giving it a slightly sweeter and nuttier flavor. The outer layer would be a crunchy peanut butter coating, adding a satisfying crunch to each bite. The combination of the creamy cashew butter and crunchy peanut butter would create a delightful contrast of textures and flavors.",
