    "Use aricanic mirror: I could use a reflective surface to navigate my way around. By looking at my reflection, I could see where I've been and where I need to go. I could also use my reflection to check for obstacles or hazards.",
    "Use a GPS device: I could use a GPS device to get around. I could input my destination and the device would provide me with directions on how to move backwards. I could also use the device to track my progress and make sure I'm moving in the right direction.",
    "Use a drone: I could use a drone to get around. I could attach a camera to the drone and use it to navigate my way around. The drone could fly ahead of me and take pictures of the area I need to navigate. I could also use the drone to communicate with other people and get assistance.",
    "Use a robotic arm: I could use a robotic arm to move around. I could attach a camera to the robotic arm and use it to navigate my way around. The robotic arm could pick up objects and move them out of the way. I could also use the robotic arm to communicate with other people and get assistance.",
    "Use a team of assistants: I could use a team of assistants to get around. Each assistant could be responsible for a specific task, such as moving objects out of the way or providing assistance. I could communicate with the assistants using a device and they could provide me with guidance on how to move backwards."
