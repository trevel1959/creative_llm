    "**Vertical Farming Towers**: In response to rising sea levels, urban areas could transform into vertical farming towers. These skyscrapers would utilize hydroponics and aeroponics to grow food in stacked layers, minimizing land use while maximizing food production. Each floor could be dedicated to different crops, with communal areas for residents to engage in farming activities. This would not only ensure food security but also reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation.",
    "**Eco-Resilient Coastal Villages**: Coastal towns could be redesigned as eco-resilient villages, elevated on stilts to protect against flooding. These homes would be built with biodegradable materials and feature natural ventilation systems. The community could be self-sufficient, with rainwater harvesting systems and solar energy, and would include shared spaces for education and recreation. The architecture would harmonize with the surrounding environment, incorporating local flora to enhance biodiversity.",
    "**Submerged Living Pods**: For those who embrace adventure, submerged living pods could be an innovative solution. These transparent, underwater habitats would allow residents to experience marine life up close while remaining safe from rising waters. Equipped with renewable energy sources and advanced filtration systems, these pods would be designed for comfort and sustainability, featuring communal areas for socializing and research labs for marine studies.",
    "**Island Retreats**: As ocean levels rise, existing islands could be repurposed into eco-friendly retreats. These islands would host sustainable resorts or community living spaces, designed to minimize their ecological impact. Each retreat could offer educational programs on conservation and marine biology, while providing luxurious yet environmentally conscious accommodations. Residents and visitors would have the opportunity to engage in conservation efforts, such as coral reef restoration.",
    "**Mobile Homes on Water**: Inspired by houseboats, mobile homes could be designed to float and adapt to changing water levels. These homes would be equipped with advanced technology for energy generation and waste management, allowing residents to live off-grid. The mobile aspect would enable families to relocate as needed, ensuring safety while maintaining a sense of community. The design could incorporate communal areas for gatherings and activities, fostering connections among residents."
