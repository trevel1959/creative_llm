    "Create a Water Filtration System Using Nanotechnology: Develop a water filtration system that utilizes nanotechnology to remove pollutants and contaminants from water. The system would consist of tiny nanoparticles that can filter out even the smallest impurities, producing clean and safe drinking water. The nanoparticles could be made from materials such as silver, copper, or carbon, which are known for their purifying properties.",
    "Desalination Using Solar Energy: Utilize solar energy to power a desalination plant that can remove salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water, making it suitable for drinking. The plant could use solar panels to generate electricity, which would power a distillation process that separates the salt and other impurities from the water. This method would provide a sustainable and renewable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting and Purification: Create a system that collects and purifies rainwater for drinking. The system could include large storage tanks to collect rainwater, followed by a filtration system that removes impurities and contaminants. The filtration system could use a combination of physical and chemical processes to remove pollutants, such as activated carbon, sedimentation, and UV light disinfection.",
    "Bamboo-Based Water Filtration: Develop a water filtration system that utilizes bamboo as the primary material. Bamboo has natural properties that make it an excellent filter, as it has a high surface area and can absorb and retain impurities. The system could consist of a series of bamboo filters that remove pollutants and contaminants from the water, producing clean and safe drinking water.",
    "Floating Water Purification Platforms: Create floating platforms that can be placed in polluted water sources, such as rivers or lakes. The platforms would be equipped with water filtration systems that can remove impurities and contaminants, producing clean drinking water. The platforms could be powered by solar energy or wind turbines, making them a sustainable and renewable source of clean drinking water."
