    "Teleportation: If planes were no longer an option, teleportation could be a viable alternative. This technology would allow individuals to instantly transport themselves from one location to another, the continent. With teleportation, travel time would be reduced to a matter of seconds, the travel time.",
    "Space travel: Another option for traveling to another continent without planes would be to use space travel. This would involve building a spacecraft capable of reaching the destination continent's orbit and then descending to a suitable landing site. With space travel, the travel time would be much longer than teleportation, but it would allow individuals to travel to any location on the planet, not just the next continent.",
    "Underwater travel: If planes were no longer an option, underwater travel could be another viable alternative. This would involve building a submersible capable of reaching the destination continent's coastline and then navigating inland. With underwater travel, the travel time would be much longer than planes, but it would allow individuals to travel to any location along the coastline of the destination continent.",
    "Maglev trains: If planes were no longer an option, maglev trains could be another viable alternative. These trains use magnetic levitation technology to propel themselves along tracks, allowing for high speeds and efficient travel. With maglev trains, travel time would be reduced compared to traditional trains, but it would still be much longer than planes.",
    "Hot air balloons: If planes were no longer an option, hot air balloons could be another viable alternative. These balloons use hot air to lift and propel themselves through the air, allowing for slow and travel. With hot air balloons, travel time would be much longer than planes, but it would allow individuals to experience the beauty of the journey and explore different landscapes along the way."
