    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light or a small built-in vacuum system to remove hair strands and debris after each use. This feature would not only save time but also promote better hygiene by preventing the buildup of bacteria and oils on the bristles.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush that combines multiple tools in one. For instance, it could have interchangeable bristle heads for different hair types (fine, thick, curly) and a built-in comb or detangler. Additionally, it could feature a mini hairdryer or heated bristles for quick styling, allowing users to dry and style their hair simultaneously.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Hairbrush**: Incorporate aromatherapy into a hairbrush by embedding essential oil diffusers within the handle. Users could choose their preferred scents, such as lavender for relaxation or citrus for energy, to enhance their hair care routine. The brush could also have a built-in speaker that plays calming music or nature sounds to create a soothing atmosphere while brushing.",
    "**Interactive Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush that includes a small touchscreen display on the handle, featuring tutorials for different hairstyles, tips for hair care, and even a virtual stylist. Users could select their desired hairstyle, and the brush would provide step-by-step instructions, making it easier for them to try new looks and techniques.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, and offer a refillable option for the bristles. Additionally, implement a recycling program where users can send back their old brushes for proper disposal or repurposing, promoting environmental responsibility while maintaining a stylish grooming tool."
