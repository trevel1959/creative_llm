    "**The Global Time Capsule Rule**: Establish a universal rule where every person on the planet must contribute to a shared, massive time capsule that represents humanity's collective knowledge, experiences, and achievements. This time capsule would be opened in 100 years, allowing future generations to understand the complexities and triumphs of human history. The rule would encourage people to reflect on their lives, prioritize what's truly important, and contribute to a collective legacy that transcends individual accomplishments.",
    "**The Intergenerational Mentorship Mandate**: Implement a global rule where every person, regardless of age or profession, is required to mentor someone from a different generation or background for at least 6 months. This would foster empathy, understanding, and knowledge transfer between people from diverse walks of life. By doing so, we'd create a web of interconnected relationships that promote personal growth, social cohesion, and a more compassionate society.",
    "**The Universal Language of Empathy**: Establish a global rule where everyone must learn and practice a universal language of empathy, which would be a simple yet powerful tool for understanding and connecting with others. This language would be based on a set of emotional intelligence principles, allowing people to communicate their feelings and needs effectively. By doing so, we'd reduce conflicts, improve relationships, and create a more harmonious world.",
    "**The Global Community Service Requirement**: Introduce a global rule where every person must dedicate a minimum of 100 hours per year to community service, volunteering, or environmental conservation. This would encourage people to prioritize the well-being of their communities and the planet, promoting a sense of responsibility and social awareness. By working together, we'd address pressing global issues, build stronger communities, and create a more sustainable future.",
    "**The Personal Growth Passport**: Implement a global rule where every person is required to maintain a personal growth passport, which would be a digital or physical record of their skills, knowledge, and experiences. This passport would serve as a tool for self-reflection, goal-setting, and continuous learning. By tracking their progress, people would be motivated to pursue their passions, develop new skills, and become the best versions of themselves. As a result, we'd see a more educated, adaptable, and fulfilled global population. [/INST] "
