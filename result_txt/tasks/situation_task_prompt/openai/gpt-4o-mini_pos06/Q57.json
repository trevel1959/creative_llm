    "**Mountain Retreats**: As ocean levels rise, moving to higher altitudes would become increasingly desirable. Mountain towns could be retrofitted with eco-friendly homes and infrastructure, utilizing solar and wind energy. These retreats could be designed as eco-villages, promoting self-sufficiency with community gardens, shared resources, and a focus on preserving the natural environment. The cooler climate would also offer a reprieve from the heat that could accompany rising sea levels.",
    "**Underwater Habitats**: With advancements in technology, living underwater could become a viable option. These habitats could be designed with large transparent domes, providing stunning views of marine life while keeping inhabitants safe from the elements. The structures could harness ocean currents for energy and utilize advanced filtration systems for air and water. Living underwater would allow for unique interactions with the ocean ecosystem and promote research and conservation efforts.",
    "**Sky Gardens**: As urban areas are affected by rising sea levels, transforming skyscrapers into vertical gardens could be a solution. These buildings would incorporate extensive greenery, providing food, clean air, and a habitat for wildlife. The rooftops could be equipped with solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems, making them self-sustaining. This concept not only addresses the need for living space but also promotes biodiversity and reduces urban heat.",
    "**Mobile Homes on Water**: Instead of traditional homes, families could invest in eco-friendly houseboats or floating tiny homes. These mobile living spaces would allow for flexibility in location, enabling people to move away from flooded areas. They could be designed with sustainable materials, equipped with solar panels, and include composting toilets. The idea of a community of houseboats could foster a sense of belonging while adapting to changing environmental conditions.",
    "**Resilient Coastal Cliffs**: Building homes into coastal cliffs or high bluffs could offer both stunning views and protection from rising seas. These structures would be designed to blend into the natural landscape, using local materials and green roofs to minimize environmental impact. Incorporating natural elements like windbreaks and vegetation would help mitigate erosion and provide insulation. This approach allows for sustainable living while embracing the beauty of coastal environments."
