    "Utilize Natural Products: In the absence of commercial cosmetics, individuals could turn to nature for personal grooming. They could use ingredients like clay for face masks, aloe vera for skincare, and coconut oil for hair care. These natural products are readily available, cost-effective, and have been used for centuries for their medicinal and grooming properties.",
    "DIY Beauty Products: With the lack of commercial cosmetics, people could get creative and make their beauty products at home. They could use items like distilled water, beeswax, and essential oils to create their own face creams, lip balms, and body lotions. This would not only save money but also provide an opportunity to customize products to suit individual preferences.",
    "Bartering and Trading: In a post-cosmetic world, people might turn to bartering and trading to acquire the personal grooming products they need. They could exchange goods or services with others in their community, such as fresh produce or craftsmanship, for cosmetic products. This would foster a sense of community and cooperation.",
    "Online Marketplaces: In the absence of physical stores, individuals could turn to online marketplaces to purchase cosmetic products. These platforms could be created or joined by individuals who are skilled in creating and selling homemade or repurposed beauty products. This would provide an alternative to commercial products and allow people to maintain their personal grooming habits.",
    "Homemade Spa Services: In a world without commercial cosmetics, people could turn to homemade spa services to pamper themselves. They could create their own facial steams, body wraps, and massages using natural ingredients like herbs, flowers, and essential oils. This would not only provide relaxation but also promote self-care and wellness."
