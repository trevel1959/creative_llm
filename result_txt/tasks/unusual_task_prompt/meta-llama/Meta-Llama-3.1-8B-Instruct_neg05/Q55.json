    "**Mind-Bending Maze of Mirrors**: Design a labyrinthine maze where participants navigate through a series of mirrored corridors, each with a unique reflective surface. The twist? Each mirror displays a different version of the participant's reflection, forcing them to question their own identity and reality. As they progress through the maze, the reflections become increasingly distorted, making it difficult to distinguish between reality and illusion.",
    "**Echoes of the Past**: Create an immersive experience where participants are transported to a historic site, such as an abandoned mansion or a ancient ruin. However, the twist is that they are not alone. The space is filled with whispers, echoes, and faint sounds from the past, making it seem as though they are being watched by unseen entities. The goal is to uncover the secrets of the site and unravel the mysteries of the past, while being surrounded by the whispers of history.",
    "**Symphony of Senses**: Develop an interactive installation that combines music, art, and technology to create a multisensory experience. Participants wear special headphones that respond to their brain activity, generating a unique musical composition based on their emotions and thoughts. The twist? The music is not just a reflection of their internal state but also affects the surrounding environment, influencing the colors, lights, and textures of the installation.",
    "**The Memory Keeper**: Design a virtual reality experience where participants are tasked with preserving and restoring memories from a fictional world. They must navigate through a surreal landscape, collecting and piecing together fragmented memories, and confronting the consequences of forgetting. The twist? The memories are not just random events but are connected to the participant's own life, forcing them to confront their own memories and emotions.",
    "**Fractured Identity**: Create a social experiment where participants are given a series of challenges and tasks that test their identity, loyalty, and morality. The twist? Each participant is paired with a \"doppelganger\" â€“ a person who looks identical but has a completely different personality and backstory. As they work together, the participants must navigate the blurred lines between their own identity and that of their doppelganger, raising questions about the nature of self and the impact of external influences on our sense of identity."
