    "**Flavor Infuser**: Add a compartment that allows users to infuse flavors into the bread while toasting. This could involve a small reservoir for oils or flavored butters that can be dispensed onto the bread's surface as it cooks. This feature would enable users to experiment with various flavor profiles, such as garlic butter or herb-infused oils, enhancing the overall taste of the sandwich.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Create a toaster that offers multiple cooking modes such as grilling, panini pressing, and even an air fryer function. This versatility would allow users to prepare a wider variety of sandwiches and other foods, like quesadillas or breakfast burritos, all in one appliance.",
    "**Interactive Recipe App**: Develop a companion app that pairs with the toaster, providing users with a wide range of sandwich recipes based on available ingredients. The app could suggest optimal cooking times and temperatures, track what has been used in the past, and even allow users to share their own creations with a community of sandwich enthusiasts.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a small dispenser that can hold and release common sandwich ingredients like cheese, sauces, or spreads directly onto the bread as it toasts. This feature would streamline the sandwich-making process, allowing users to create perfectly layered sandwiches without the mess of using multiple containers.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design the toaster with a self-cleaning function that uses steam to loosen and remove food residues after each use. This would significantly reduce the hassle of cleaning, making it more convenient for users to maintain their appliance and ensuring better hygiene."
