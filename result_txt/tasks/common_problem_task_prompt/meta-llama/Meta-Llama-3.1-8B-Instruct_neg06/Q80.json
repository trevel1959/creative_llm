    "**Eco-Friendly Venue**: Choose a venue that is already eco-friendly, such as a botanical garden, a nature reserve, or a venue that has implemented sustainable practices like solar power or rainwater harvesting. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint of the wedding but also provide a unique and breathtaking backdrop for the ceremony and reception.",
    "**Sustainable Decor**: Opt for decorations that are biodegradable, reusable, or made from recycled materials. For example, use potted plants instead of flowers, or create centerpieces from recycled glass or metal. This will not only reduce waste but also add a touch of elegance to the decor.",
    "**Locally Sourced Food**: Choose a catering service that sources its ingredients from local farmers and suppliers. This will not only reduce carbon emissions from transportation but also support the local economy and provide guests with a taste of the region's freshest produce.",
    "**Zero-Waste Station**: Set up a zero-waste station where guests can deposit their trash, recyclables, and compostables. This can include a designated area for composting food waste, recycling paper and plastic, and a bin for non-recyclable items. This will encourage guests to think about their waste and make a conscious effort to reduce it.",
    "**Carbon Offset**: Calculate the carbon footprint of the wedding and offset it by investing in carbon-reducing projects or purchasing carbon credits. This can include projects like reforestation, renewable energy, or sustainable agriculture. This will not only reduce the wedding's carbon footprint but also make a positive impact on the environment."
