    "\"Well, everyone has to start somewhere, right? Maybe you just need some practice to get better at pencil drawing. Perhaps you could try drawing something simple, like a tree or a flower, and then gradually move on to more complex subjects. Don't be too hard on yourself, remember that it takes time to improve and you'll get there eventually!\"",
    "\"It's not just about the pencil, it's about the mindset. Maybe you're not giving yourself enough credit for what you're already capable of. You could try drawing something that you find interesting or meaningful to you, like a landscape or a portrait of a loved one. The more you enjoy the process, the more likely you are to improve.\"",
    "\"Perhaps you're not using the right tools or techniques. There are many different types of pencils and drawing tools available, so it might be worth experimenting to find the ones that work best for you. You could also try using different drawing techniques, like cross-hatching or stippling, to add texture and depth to your work.\"",
    "\"It's possible that you're not giving yourself enough time to practice. Drawing is a skill that requires patience and persistence. You could try setting aside a specific time each day to practice, even if it's just for a few minutes. Over time, you'll see improvement and you'll be able to draw more complex subjects.\"",
    "\"Maybe you're not getting enough feedback on your work. It can be difficult to know what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong without some guidance. You could try joining a local art group or taking a drawing class to get feedback from other artists and learn new techniques. You could also try posting your work online and asking for feedback from others.\""
