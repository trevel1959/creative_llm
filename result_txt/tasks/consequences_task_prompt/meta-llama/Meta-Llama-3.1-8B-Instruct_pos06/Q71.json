    "**Societal Reorganization**: With immortality, the concept of a fixed lifespan would become obsolete, leading to a significant shift in societal structures. Governments, institutions, and economies would need to adapt to accommodate an infinite population. This could result in a more meritocratic society, where individuals are judged on their skills and contributions rather than their age or birthright. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Immortality would fundamentally alter human psychology, leading to a reevaluation of personal goals, relationships, and priorities. People might become increasingly focused on self-improvement, personal growth, and experiences, rather than traditional markers of success like wealth or status. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Resource Depletion**: With an infinite population, the demand for resources like food, water, and energy would skyrocket, potentially leading to catastrophic resource depletion. This could result in a new era of scarcity, where the wealthy and powerful control access to these essential resources. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Evolutionary Stagnation**: Immortality would essentially freeze human evolution, as natural selection would no longer be able to drive adaptation and innovation. This could lead to a stagnant, unchanging human population, with potential long-term consequences for the species as a whole. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Existential Risks**: With immortality, humanity might become increasingly reckless and dismissive of risks, leading to a higher likelihood of catastrophic events like wars, pandemics, or environmental disasters. This could ultimately lead to the downfall of human civilization. Confidence: 0.8"
