    "Training for the Senses: People with poor vision could be trained to rely more on their other senses, such as touch, hearing, and smell, to navigate their environment. This could involve specialized training programs that teach individuals how to interpret sensory information more effectively to compensate for their lack of clear vision.",
    "Surgical Solutions: People with poor vision could opt for surgical solutions, such as laser eye surgery, to correct their vision. While not an immediate solution, it could provide a long-term alternative to glasses and contact lenses.",
    "Visual Implants: The development of visual implants, such as retinal implants or bionic eyes, could offer an alternative to traditional glasses and contact lenses. These implants would be surgically inserted into the eye and would provide clear vision without the need for external devices.",
    "Augmented Reality (AR) Integration: AR technology could be integrated into everyday objects and environments to provide real-time visual assistance. For example, smartphones or smart glasses could be equipped with AR capabilities to overlay visual information onto the user's field of view, helping them navigate and perceive their surroundings more effectively.",
    "Haptic Feedback: Haptic technology could be used to provide tactile feedback, allowing people with poor vision to sense their environment through touch. This could involve specialized gloves or other wearable devices that provide a sense of touch, enabling individuals to feel their surroundings and interact with objects more effectively."
