    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable, solar-powered generator that can provide electricity for various essential appliances. The generator could be made using a combination of solar panels, batteries, and a small internal combustion engine. This would allow for a reliable source of electricity during the day, even without access to the grid.",
    "Utilize Rainwater Collection: Set up a rainwater collection system that can collect and store rainwater for various uses, including drinking, cooking, and hygiene. This would provide a sustainable source of clean water, even during periods of drought or when the grid is down.",
    "Create a Composting Toilet: Design and install a composting toilet that can convert human waste into a nutrient-rich compost. This would eliminate the need for water for flushing and provide a sustainable source of fertilizer for gardening and agriculture.",
    "Build a Wind Turbine: Construct a small, portable wind turbine that can generate electricity using wind energy. This would provide a reliable source of electricity during the day and night, even without access to the grid.",
    "Develop a Hydroelectric System: Create a small-scale hydroelectric system that can generate electricity using the flow of water from a nearby stream or river. This would provide a sustainable source of electricity during periods of drought or when the grid is down."
