    "A Heliosphere-Centered Solar System: In this design, the Sun would remain at the center, but the planets would be arranged in a ring-like structure around it. This would allow for more efficient energy transfer and betteration of the planets.",
    "A Gravitational Lensing Solar System: This design would involve the placement of massive objects, such as asteroids or comets, between the Sun and the planets. These objects would bend light from the Sun, allowing the planets to receive more energy and potentially even create artificial gravity fields.",
    "A Dyson Sphere Solar System: This design would involve the construction of a massive, spherical structure around the Sun, which would capture and direct all incoming solar energy towards the planets. This would allow for a more stable and predictable energy supply.",
    "A Multi-Planetary Solar System: In this design, multiple solar systems would be created around different stars, with each system having its own set of planets. This would allow for greater diversity and complexity in the solar system.",
    "A Magnetic Field-Generated Solar System: This design would involve the creation of a massive magnetic field around the Sun, which would generate a form of energy that could be harnessed by the planets. This would allow for a more sustainable and efficient energy supply."
