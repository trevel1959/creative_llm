    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular bed that allows users to customize their sleeping experience. Components could include adjustable firmness levels for different sections of the mattress, detachable headboards with built-in storage or shelves, and side panels that can be swapped out for different styles or materials. This would cater to individual preferences and aesthetics.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Features**: Design a bed that incorporates wellness features such as built-in massage functions, aromatherapy diffusers, and sound therapy speakers. The bed could offer pre-set programs for relaxation, sleep induction, or even morning energizing routines, promoting overall well-being and enhancing the sleep experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate with sustainable materials for the bed frame and mattress. This could involve using recycled or upcycled materials, natural latex, organic cotton, or bamboo fibers. Additionally, a modular approach could allow for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of the bed's life cycle, minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Convertible Functionality**: Design a bed that can transform into different furniture pieces. For instance, it could convert into a sofa during the day or have built-in desks or storage solutions that can be accessed when not in use. This would be especially useful for small living spaces, maximizing functionality without compromising on comfort.",
    "**Personalized Aesthetics**: Introduce customizable bed aesthetics where users can choose fabrics, colors, and patterns for the mattress cover, headboard, and bed frame. This could be achieved through a system of interchangeable panels or covers, allowing individuals to refresh their bedroom style easily without needing to purchase an entirely new bed."
