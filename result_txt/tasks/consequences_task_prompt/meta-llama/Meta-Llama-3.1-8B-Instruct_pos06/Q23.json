    "**Eyes of the Night**: Humans could see in the dark due to a unique genetic mutation that allows their eyes to produce a specialized form of light-sensitive cells. This would enable them to navigate and hunt in the dark, leading to a shift in the global food chain. As a result, nocturnal creatures would adapt to the new environment, and their populations would surge, while diurnal creatures would struggle to survive. The human population would also experience a significant decrease in sleep disorders and accidents caused by darkness. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Bioluminescent Cities**: With the ability to see in the dark, humans would develop cities that thrive at night. Buildings would be designed with bioluminescent materials, creating a radiant, ethereal atmosphere. This would lead to a new form of urban planning, where cities are designed to maximize light production and minimize energy consumption. The economy would boom as people flock to these vibrant, 24/7 cities, and a new industry would emerge to cater to the needs of these nocturnal metropolises. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Nighttime Sports**: The ability to see in the dark would give rise to new sports and games that take place at night. Athletes would develop unique skills, such as night vision-enhanced agility and spatial awareness. New stadiums and arenas would be built with specialized lighting that simulates various environments, from moonlit forests to starry skies. The sports industry would experience a significant boost, and new leagues and tournaments would emerge. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Underwater Exploration**: Humans could explore the ocean depths without the need for scuba gear or submersibles. This would lead to a revolution in marine biology, as scientists could study oceanic ecosystems in unprecedented detail. New technologies would emerge to harness the energy of bioluminescent organisms, and the ocean would become a hub for sustainable energy production. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Dreamwalkers**: With the ability to see in the dark, humans would develop a new form of consciousness that allows them to tap into the collective unconscious. This would give rise to a new profession: Dreamwalkers, who would navigate the realms of the subconscious, helping people overcome psychological traumas and tap into their creative potential. The field of psychology would undergo a significant transformation, and new forms of therapy would emerge. Confidence score: 0.95"
