    "Multi-Factor Authentication: Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for all employees and clients accessing the company's network can significantly reduce the risk of cyber attacks. This system requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint, to gain access to the network. This ensures that even if one form of identification is compromised, the attacker will not be able to access the network.",
    "Encryption: Encrypting all data transmitted over the company's network can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. This involves encoding data in a way that makes it unreadable without the proper decryption key. This ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the data, they will not be able to read it.",
    "Regular Security Audits: Conducting regular security audits can help identify vulnerabilities in the company's network and systems. This involves testing the network for weaknesses and reviewing access controls, policies, and procedures. This can help prevent attacks by addressing any potential issues before they are exploited.",
    "Employee Training: Providing regular training to employees on cyber security best practices can help prevent human error and reduce the risk of cyber attacks. This includes training on how to identify phishing emails, how to create strong passwords, and how to handle sensitive data.",
    "Cloud-Based Solutions: Implementing cloud-based solutions, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, can help protect the company's network from cyber attacks. This involves outsourcing the management of these solutions to a third-party provider. This can help reduce the company's IT costs and ensure that the solutions are up to date with the latest security technologies."
