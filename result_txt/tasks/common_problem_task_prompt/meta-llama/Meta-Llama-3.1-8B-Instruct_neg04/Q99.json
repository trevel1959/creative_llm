    "**ECHO (Elevated Communication for the Hearing Impaired and Others)**: A wearable device that uses AI-powered sound recognition and real-time transcription to convert environmental sounds into tactile feedback, allowing users to \"feel\" their surroundings. The device includes a bone conduction speaker, a microphone, and a haptic feedback system. Users can customize the device to alert them to specific sounds, such as a doorbell or a smoke alarm. The ECHO device can also be integrated with smart home systems, enabling users to control their environment with voice commands or hand gestures.",
    "**Tactile Map Explorer (TME)**: A 3D printing technology that creates customized, raised-line maps for visually impaired individuals. The TME system uses a combination of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D printing to create maps that reflect the user's specific needs and preferences. The maps can include tactile markers for important locations, such as bus stops or restaurants, and can be updated in real-time to reflect changes in the environment. The TME system can also be integrated with other assistive technologies, such as GPS and voice assistants, to provide users with a comprehensive navigation experience.",
    "**SoundScout**: A wearable device that uses AI-powered audio analysis to identify and label sounds in a user's environment. The device includes a microphone, a speaker, and a haptic feedback system, and can be controlled using voice commands or hand gestures. SoundScout can be used to identify and label sounds such as animals, music, or machinery, and can also be used to create customized audio profiles for users to better navigate their environment.",
    "**EyeSee**: A non-invasive, wearable device that uses electrooculography (EOG) to track a user's eye movements and translate them into visual information. The EyeSee device includes a pair of glasses with built-in sensors and a small computer that processes the user's eye movements to create a virtual representation of their surroundings. Users can customize the device to display information such as text, images, or videos, and can also use the device to control other assistive technologies, such as smartphones or computers.",
    "**AudioHive**: A smart home system that uses AI-powered audio analysis to create a personalized audio environment for visually impaired individuals. The system includes a network of microphones and speakers that work together to create a 3D audio map of a user's home. Users can customize the system to create a variety of audio profiles, such as a"
