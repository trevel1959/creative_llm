    "In a quaint village nestled between mountains, there was a river that defied nature, flowing backward. The villagers believed it was a blessing, bringing prosperity from the mountains to the valley. One day, young Mira, curious about its magic, followed the river upstream. She discovered an ancient stone altar where the river began, guarded by a wise old turtle. The turtle revealed that the river flowed backward to restore lost memories of the past. Mira learned that by releasing her fears, she could let the river guide her to forgotten joys. From then on, the village thrived, remembering their roots.",
