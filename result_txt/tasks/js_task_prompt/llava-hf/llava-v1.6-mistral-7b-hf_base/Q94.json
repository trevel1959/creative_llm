    "Geothermal Energy: This energy source would tap into the heat generated by the Earth's core. The heat could be used to create steam, which could then be used to generate electricity.",
    "Wind Energy: This energy source would use large wind turbines to harness the power of the wind. The wind would turn the turbines, which would then generate electricity.",
    "Nuclear Energy: This energy source would use nuclear reactions to generate electricity. The electricity could then be used to power homes and businesses.",
    "Tidal Energy: This energy source would use the power of ocean tides to generate electricity. The movement of the tides would turn turbines, which would then generate electricity.",
    "Biomass Energy: This energy source would use organic matter, such as wood, crops, and waste, to generate electricity. The organic matter would be burned in a power plant, which would then generate electricity."
