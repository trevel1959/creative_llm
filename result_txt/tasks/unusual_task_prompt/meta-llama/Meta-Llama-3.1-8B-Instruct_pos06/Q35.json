    "Wallet as a Time Capsule: Design a wallet that doubles as a time capsule, where users can store small mementos and notes from their daily life. The wallet could have a hidden compartment that can be opened after a set period of time, such as 1 year, 5 years, or 10 years, to reveal the memories and experiences from that time. This concept combines the practicality of a wallet with the emotional value of a time capsule, allowing users to reflect on their past and appreciate the passage of time.",
    "Wallet with a Built-in Smart Card Reader: Integrate a smart card reader into the wallet, allowing users to easily pay for transactions, store loyalty cards, and access rewards programs. This feature would eliminate the need for separate cards and devices, making the wallet a hub for all payment and loyalty needs.",
    "Wallet with a Built-in Air Quality Monitor: Incorporate a small air quality monitor into the wallet, providing users with real-time information about the air quality around them. This feature would be particularly useful in urban areas, where air pollution is a significant concern. The wallet could also include a filter or mask to help users breathe cleaner air.",
    "Wallet with a Built-in NFC Tag: Embed an NFC (Near Field Communication) tag in the wallet, allowing users to easily share contact information, social media profiles, or other digital content with others. This feature would simplify the process of exchanging contact information and enable users to share their digital presence with others.",
    "Wallet with a Built-in Augmented Reality Display: Incorporate a small augmented reality (AR) display into the wallet, allowing users to access virtual information and experiences. This feature could include features such as virtual try-on, product information, or even interactive games and puzzles. The AR display would enable users to interact with their surroundings in new and innovative ways."
