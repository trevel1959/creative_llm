They floated gently, changing colors with his emotionsâ€”red for joy, blue for sadness, and yellow for excitement. One day, during the annual festival, Leo's hands transformed into a magnificent rainbow, captivating everyone. Inspired, the townsfolk joined him, creating a vibrant parade filled with laughter and dance. Leo realized his uniqueness brought happiness to others. From that day on, he embraced his balloon hands, turning them into a symbol of joy, reminding everyone that being different is what makes life truly colorful.",
