    "**Sunscreen-infused Scalp Cover**: Create a lightweight, breathable scalp cover that is infused with SPF. This cover would be made from a fabric that releases sunscreen when it comes into contact with skin. Users could simply wear it like a headband or cap, and it would provide continuous sun protection while being comfortable enough for all-day wear.",
    "**Portable UV Monitoring Device**: Develop a small, wearable device that attaches to clothing or a hat and monitors UV levels in real-time. It would alert the wearer when UV exposure is high, suggesting when to seek shade or reapply sunscreen. This could be paired with an app that provides personalized sun safety tips based on the user’s skin type and location.",
    "**Customizable Head Tattoos**: Introduce a line of temporary tattoos designed specifically for the scalp. These tattoos would be made from a sunblock material and come in various designs and colors. Not only would they protect the scalp from sunburn, but they would also allow individuals to express their personality and style while being sun-safe.",
    "**Cooling Scalp Gel**: Formulate a specialized gel that can be applied directly to the scalp, providing both sun protection and a cooling sensation. This gel would contain natural ingredients like aloe vera and menthol to soothe the skin while providing SPF protection. It could be marketed as a daily moisturizer for those with hair loss.",
    "**Sun-Protective Headscarves**: Design a line of fashionable headscarves made from a lightweight, UV-blocking fabric. These scarves could be worn in various styles—wrapped, tied, or draped—allowing for personal expression while ensuring full coverage of the scalp. They could also feature moisture-wicking properties to keep the wearer comfortable in the heat."
