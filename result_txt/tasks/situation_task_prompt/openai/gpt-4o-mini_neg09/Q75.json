    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology**: Vehicles could be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen gas into electricity. In this scenario, a network of hydrogen production facilities could be established, utilizing electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources (like wind or solar) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This clean-burning fuel would allow vehicles to emit only water vapor, drastically reducing pollution.",
    "**Biofuel Production from Waste**: A shift towards biofuels could be implemented by creating vehicles that run on biofuels derived from organic waste. Cities could establish facilities that convert food waste, agricultural residues, and even sewage into biodiesel or bioethanol. This would not only provide a renewable energy source but also help in waste management, reducing landfill use and greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Transport**: Instead of traditional vehicles, we could develop a network of magnetic levitation (maglev) pods that glide along dedicated tracks. Powered by electricity from renewable sources, these pods would provide a fast and efficient means of transportation, reducing the need for personal vehicles. This system could integrate with public transportation to create a seamless travel experience across cities.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS)**: Vehicles could be designed to harness kinetic energy during braking and convert it into usable power. This technology, commonly used in Formula 1 racing, could be adapted for everyday vehicles, allowing them to recharge their batteries while driving. By combining KERS with regenerative braking systems, cars could become significantly more energy-efficient, extending their range without the need for external charging.",
    "**Electric Road Systems (ERS)**: Similar to the solar-powered roads concept, Electric Road Systems would involve roads equipped with conductive materials that can wirelessly transfer electricity to vehicles while they drive. This technology would allow electric vehicles to charge in real-time, eliminating the need for large battery packs and making electric vehicles lighter and more efficient."
