    "Wheelchair with a twist: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, you could design a wheelchair with a unique twist. For instance, you could add a pair of detachable hover jets that allow you to glide across the floor, giving you more mobility and flexibility. Or, you could incorporate a retractable third wheel that helps you navigate tight spaces and corners with ease.",
    "Magnetic movement: Imagine a suit that has magnetic fields embedded in it, allowing you to move around with ease. The magnetic fields would attract and repel each other, enabling you to propel yourself forward, backward, or sideways without touching the ground. This technology could also be used to create a \"magnetic cocoon\" around your body, providing extra protection and support.",
    "Bionic legs: If you couldn't stand up, you could use a pair of bionic legs that are equipped with advanced sensors and motors. These legs would allow you to walk, run, and even jump with greater ease and precision than ever before. The bionic legs could be controlled by your thoughts or muscle signals, giving you a newfound sense of mobility and independence.",
    "Gravity-defying chair: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, you could use a gravity-defying chair that uses advanced magnets or electromagnetic fields to levitate off the ground. This would allow you to move around without touching the ground, giving you more freedom and mobility. The chair could also be equipped with adjustable height and tilt functions, allowing you to find the most comfortable position for your needs.",
    "Exoskeleton suit: An exoskeleton suit is a wearable device that provides support and mobility for people with mobility issues. Instead of a traditional wheelchair, you could use an exoskeleton suit that allows you to walk, run, and even jump with greater ease and precision than ever before. The suit would be equipped with advanced sensors and motors that respond to your body movements, giving you a newfound sense of mobility and independence."
