    "I would use a wheelchair with a large, cushioned seat that can be easily reclined, allowing me to rest while still being able to move around. This would be especially helpful if I needed to conserve energy or recover from an illness or injury.",
    "I would use a wheelchair with a tilting function, which would allow me to adjust the angle of the seat to make it easier to get up and down from the seat without the need for physical strength.",
    "I would use a wheelchair with a leg extension, which would allow me to move around by pushing with my legs while still having the support of the wheelchair.",
    "I would use a wheelchair with a joystick or other input device that is mounted on a long pole, which would allow me to move the wheelchair with one hand while still having the use of my legs.",
    "I would use a wheelchair with a seat that can be easily adjusted to different heights, which would allow me to maintain a comfortable posture while moving around."
