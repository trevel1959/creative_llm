    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a spatula with interchangeable heads that can be easily swapped out depending on the cooking task. For example, one head could be a traditional flat spatula for flipping pancakes, another could be a slotted spatula for draining liquids, and a third could be a silicone head for scraping bowls. This would reduce the need for multiple utensils and save space in the kitchen.",
    "**Spatula with Built-In Timer and Recipe Display**: Create a spatula that features a small, waterproof display screen and a built-in timer. The spatula could show cooking times for various foods, and the user could set timers for specific tasks. This would help keep track of cooking times without needing to refer to a separate timer or phone.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Adjustable Handle**: Develop an ergonomic spatula with an adjustable handle that can be lengthened or shortened based on the user's preference or the cooking task. This would be especially useful for people with mobility issues or for tasks that require reaching into deep pots or pans. The handle could also have a soft grip to enhance comfort during use.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Introduce a spatula made from a special non-stick material that incorporates self-cleaning technology. After use, the spatula could be placed in a designated base that uses UV light or steam to sanitize and clean the spatulaâ€™s surface. This would save time on cleaning and ensure better hygiene in the kitchen.",
    "**Spatula with Integrated Storage Compartment**: Design a spatula with a hollow handle that serves as a storage compartment for small kitchen tools, such as measuring spoons, a mini whisk, or a spice shaker. This would allow cooks to have essential tools on hand without cluttering the countertop, making it ideal for small kitchens or for taking to outdoor cooking events."
