    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Vehicles could transition to hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen gas into electricity through a chemical reaction. To produce hydrogen sustainably, we could harness excess renewable energy from sources like wind and solar to electrolyze water, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen refueling stations could be set up across cities, making it convenient for drivers to access this clean energy source.",
    "**Biofuel from Algae**: Utilizing genetically modified algae that can produce high yields of biofuels could be a game-changer. These algae can be cultivated in wastewater or saltwater, making them environmentally friendly. The biofuel produced could be used in modified internal combustion engines, allowing for a smoother transition from traditional fuels while minimizing carbon emissions.",
    "**Electric Vehicle Swapping Stations**: Instead of traditional charging stations, we could develop battery-swapping stations where drivers can quickly exchange their depleted battery for a fully charged one. This system would eliminate long charging times and make electric vehicles more convenient for long-distance travel. With standardized battery sizes, a network of swapping stations could be established, similar to gas stations today.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Vehicles could be designed to capture and convert kinetic energy into electricity as they move. For example, regenerative braking systems could be enhanced to recover even more energy during deceleration. Additionally, roads could be equipped with piezoelectric materials that generate electricity from the pressure exerted by passing vehicles, which could then be used to power nearby charging stations or traffic lights.",
    "**Compressed Air Vehicles**: Innovating vehicles that run on compressed air could offer a unique solution. These vehicles would store air in high-pressure tanks and release it to power pistons that drive the wheels. While this technology is still in its infancy, advancements in materials and tank design could lead to lightweight, efficient vehicles powered by compressed air, making them an eco-friendly alternative."
