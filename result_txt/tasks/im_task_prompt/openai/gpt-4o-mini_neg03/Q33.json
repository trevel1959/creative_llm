    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes ultrasonic waves to dislodge food particles and bacteria from the blades and container. After blending, users can simply add water and a drop of dish soap, and the blender would initiate a cleaning cycle, ensuring itâ€™s ready for the next use without the hassle of manual scrubbing.",
    "**Modular Blender Design**: Create a blender with detachable components that can be swapped out for different functions. For instance, users could replace the standard blending jar with a food processor attachment or a smoothie cup with a built-in straw. This modular approach would cater to various culinary needs while minimizing the number of appliances needed in the kitchen.",
    "**Temperature Control Feature**: Design a blender that allows users to control the temperature of their mixtures while blending. This could be particularly useful for recipes that require heating, such as soups or sauces. By integrating a heating element and a temperature gauge, users could blend and heat simultaneously, ensuring perfect consistency without the need for a separate pot.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Focus on creating blenders from recycled materials and incorporating energy-efficient motors. Additionally, the blender could feature a solar-powered option, allowing it to charge during the day and run on solar energy. This would not only appeal to eco-conscious consumers but also reduce energy costs.",
    "**Integrated Recipe Book with Touchscreen Display**: Incorporate a built-in touchscreen display that offers an interactive recipe book. Users could browse through a variety of recipes, and the blender would automatically adjust settings based on the selected recipe. It could also provide step-by-step guidance, including video tutorials, making it easier for novice cooks to create complex dishes."
