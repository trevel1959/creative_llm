    "**Self-Cleaning Properties**: Introduce towels made from materials treated with antimicrobial agents that inhibit the growth of bacteria, fungi, and algae. This not only keeps the towel smelling fresh longer but also reduces the need for frequent washing, minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Adjustable Temperature Control**: Develop towels that incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) capable of absorbing and releasing heat based on ambient temperature. This allows users to feel cooler in hot weather and warmer in cold conditions without needing additional layers or heating devices.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design towels using recycled polyester, organic cotton, or other eco-friendly fabrics. These towels could be biodegradable, reducing landfill waste and minimizing environmental harm.",
    "**UV Protection**: Create towels woven with UV-protective fibers that shield users from harmful sun rays. This feature would be particularly beneficial for outdoor activities like beach trips, picnics, and camping.",
    "**Smart Towels with Built-in Sensors**: Integrate sensors into the towel fabric to monitor moisture levels, body temperature, or even skin health metrics. This could be especially useful in medical applications, sports training, or personal wellness monitoring."
