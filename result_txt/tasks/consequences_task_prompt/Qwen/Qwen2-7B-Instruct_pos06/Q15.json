    "**Economic Shifts:** The global economy would experience significant disruptions. Industries heavily reliant on oil such as transportation, manufacturing, and construction would be severely impacted. Governments may need to reallocate resources, potentially causing inflation and economic downturns in countries dependent on oil imports. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Energy Transition Acceleration:** The depletion of oil could significantly accelerate the shift towards renewable energy sources. This transition might involve increased investments in solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power. Countries could see a surge in innovation and development in these sectors to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.93",
    "**Geopolitical Changes:** The current geopolitical landscape is heavily influenced by oil reserves and supply chains. If the world ran out of oil, the balance of power might shift dramatically. Countries without substantial reserves could become more vulnerable to international pressures. Conversely, nations with abundant renewable energy resources might gain influence. Confidence Score: 0.89",
    "**Social and Environmental Impact:** A global shortage of oil could lead to increased air pollution due to higher usage of alternative fuels like coal, which emit more greenhouse gases than oil. It could also lead to food shortages as agricultural practices that depend on fossil fuels are disrupted. Confidence Score: 0.90",
    "**Technological Advancements:** In response to the scarcity of oil, there would likely be a surge in research and development focused on alternative fuel technologies, including electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and advanced biofuels. This could lead to breakthroughs in energy storage and distribution systems, transforming how we consume and transport energy. Confidence Score: 0.92"
