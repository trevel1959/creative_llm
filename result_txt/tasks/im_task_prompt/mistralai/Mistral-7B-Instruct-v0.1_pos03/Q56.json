    "A bicycle bell that changes its sound depending on the speed of the rider. The faster the rider goes, the higher the pitch of the bell. This can help other cyclists and pedestrians to anticipate and avoid collisions.",
    "A bicycle bell that doubles as a GPS tracker. When a rider rings the bell, it sends a signal to a smartphone app that tracks the rider's location and speed. This can be useful for keeping track of friends on long rides or for navigating unfamiliar areas.",
    "A bicycle bell that emits a different sound for each type of terrain. For example, the bell might emit a high-pitched sound on gravel or dirt roads and a lower-pitched sound on paved roads. This can help riders to adjust their speed and avoid hazards.",
    "A bicycle bell that plays music. When a rider rings the bell, it emits a tune that can be customized to their liking. This can be a fun way to add some personality to a bike ride and make it more enjoyable.",
    "A bicycle bell that uses augmented reality to display information. When a rider rings the bell, it projects a holographic image onto the ground in front of them. This image can display information such as the distance to the next intersection or the speed limit on the road. This can be a useful tool for cyclists who want to stay informed and stay safe on the road."
