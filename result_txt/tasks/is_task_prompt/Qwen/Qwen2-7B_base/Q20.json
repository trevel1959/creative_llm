They have adapted to the lack of sunlight by wearing goggles that block out the stars, and have developed a deep reverence for the darkness. In this world, light is a precious commodity, and the people work tirelessly to conserve it. They have discovered that plants absorb light through their roots, and have developed a method of growing crops in complete darkness.",
