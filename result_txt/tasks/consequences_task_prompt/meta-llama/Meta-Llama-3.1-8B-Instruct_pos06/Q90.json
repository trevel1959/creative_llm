    "**Global Economic Shift**: Erasing all world debt would lead to a massive transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors. This would create a significant shift in the global economic landscape, with countries that were previously struggling to pay their debts now having the resources to invest in their economies and improve the lives of their citizens. This could lead to a surge in economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Inflation and Currency Devaluation**: With the sudden removal of debt, the value of currencies would likely plummet, leading to inflation and a decrease in purchasing power. This could have severe consequences for countries that rely heavily on imports, as the cost of goods would increase significantly. Additionally, the sudden injection of money into the economy could lead to inflationary pressures, making it difficult for governments to control. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Social and Political Unrest**: Erasing debt would likely lead to a significant increase in social and political unrest, as those who had invested in debt would see their assets suddenly devalued. This could lead to widespread protests, civil unrest, and potentially even regime change in some countries. Additionally, the sudden shift in economic power could lead to a re-evaluation of social and economic hierarchies, potentially leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Global Economic Integration**: With the removal of debt, countries would be more likely to integrate their economies, as the burden of debt would no longer be a barrier to cooperation. This could lead to increased trade, investment, and economic cooperation between countries, potentially creating a more integrated and interconnected global economy. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Risk of New Forms of Debt**: Erasing all world debt could create a false sense of security, leading to a decrease in financial discipline and a increase in reckless spending. This could lead to the creation of new forms of debt, such as unsustainable government spending or unsecured lending, which could ultimately lead to another debt crisis. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
