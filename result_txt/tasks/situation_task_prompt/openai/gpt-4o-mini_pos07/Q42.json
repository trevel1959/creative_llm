    "**Build a Multi-Purpose Shelter**:    Instead of a traditional hut, design a multi-purpose shelter using palm fronds and driftwood. Construct it in a dome shape to withstand wind and rain, and incorporate a shaded area for daytime relaxation. Include a small elevated platform for sleeping to avoid insects and moisture. Add a section that can be closed off with leaves for privacy and security, making it adaptable to different weather conditions.",
    "**Forage for Edible Plants and Create a Survival Garden**:    Research local flora to identify edible plants, fruits, and nuts. Use your knowledge of botany to forage sustainably, ensuring you only take what you need. Additionally, start a survival garden by planting seeds from fruits you consume, using coconut husks as biodegradable pots. This garden can provide a renewable source of food and create a habitat for beneficial insects.",
    "**Innovative Fishing Techniques**:    Instead of traditional fishing methods, create a fish trap using natural materials like bamboo or large shells. Design a funnel-shaped trap that allows fish to swim in but makes it difficult for them to escape. You can also experiment with making fishing lures from shiny objects found on the beach, such as bottle caps or pieces of foil, to attract fish more effectively.",
    "**Signal for Rescue with Art**:    Create large symbols or messages on the beach using rocks, sticks, or sand to signal passing ships or planes. Consider making a giant SOS sign that is visible from the air, and incorporate bright colors using crushed fruits or flowers to enhance visibility. This artistic approach not only serves a practical purpose but also lifts your spirits and gives you a sense of purpose.",
    "**Utilize Animal Behavior for Survival**:    Observe the local wildlife to learn about food sources and environmental cues. For example, watch where birds gather to find potential fruit trees or where fish jump to identify feeding areas. By understanding animal behavior, you can better predict where to find food and resources, effectively becoming an ecosystem navigator."
