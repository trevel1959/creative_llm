    "**Odor-Absorbing Technology**: Design a trash can with a dual-layer structure that includes an odor-absorbing material, such as activated charcoal or zeolite, between the outer and inner layers. This would help to neutralize unpleasant smells emanating from the trash, making it more pleasant to have in living spaces. Additionally, a small fan could circulate air through the can to enhance odor control.",
    "**Compacting Mechanism**: Incorporate a compacting mechanism that automatically compresses the trash inside the can. This could be activated by a foot pedal or motion sensor, allowing users to fit more waste into the can without needing to empty it frequently. A visual indicator could alert users when the can is nearing full capacity, making it easier to manage waste disposal.",
    "**Recycling Reminder Alerts**: Develop a trash can that syncs with a smartphone app to remind users when to take out the trash or recycling based on their local collection schedule. The app could also provide tips on reducing waste, recycling correctly, and composting, fostering a more environmentally conscious household.",
    "**Multi-Functional Trash Can**: Create a trash can that doubles as a small compost bin. The design would include a separate compartment for organic waste with a built-in aeration system to promote composting. The outer design could feature a sleek, modern look that fits into home decor while also educating users about composting through illustrated guides on the side.",
    "**Customizable Design**: Offer a trash can with interchangeable outer panels that can be customized according to personal style or seasonal themes. Users could purchase different designs or colors to swap out, making the trash can an attractive addition to home decor rather than an eyesore. This could also include options for families to label compartments for different types of waste."
