    "Smart AC: Develop an air conditioner that can learn and adapt to the user's preferences and habits. It can use sensors to detect the user's temperature, humidity, and lighting preferences and adjust the cooling and ventilation accordingly. The smart AC can also use machine learning algorithms to optimize its performance and energy efficiency.",
    "Air Purifier: Create an air conditioner that incorporates advanced air purification technology, such as HEPA filters, UV light, and activated carbon. This will not only cool the air but also remove pollutants, allergens, and bacteria, providing a healthier and more comfortable indoor environment.",
    "Solar-Powered AC: Develop an air conditioner that can harness the power of the sun to cool the air. This can be achieved through the use of solar panels that can power a compressor and fan, or through the use of a thermoelectric device that converts heat into electricity. This innovative solution can reduce energy consumption and lower carbon emissions.",
    "Portable AC: Create a lightweight and compact air conditioner that can be easily moved from room to room or taken on the go. This portable AC can be powered by batteries or a USB connection, making it ideal for use in small spaces or for people who need cooling on the go.",
    "Air Conditioner with Air Quality Monitoring: Develop an air conditioner that can monitor the air quality in the room and adjust its cooling settings accordingly. This can be achieved through the use of sensors that detect the level of pollutants, humidity, and temperature in the air. The air conditioner can then adjust its fan speed and cooling settings to maintain a comfortable and healthy indoor environment."
