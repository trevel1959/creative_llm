    "Widespread transportation disruption: If the world ran out of oil, the transportation sector would be severely impacted, leading to a decline in the global economy. Planes, trains, and ships rely on oil to operate, and a shortage would make it difficult to transport goods and people efficiently. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Increased reliance on alternative energy sources: In the face of an oil shortage, there would be a sudden and urgent need to explore and develop alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power. This could lead to a significant shift in the global energy landscape and a reduction in carbon emissions. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Changes in agricultural practices: Oil is used extensively in agriculture for machinery, irrigation, and fertilizers. Without oil, farmers would need to adopt more labor-intensive and sustainable practices, such as manual labor and organic farming methods, to maintain food production. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Increased investment in energy storage technology: With oil becoming scarce, there would be a pressing need for energy storage technologies to ensure a stable energy supply. This could lead to significant investment in research and development of new battery technologies and energy storage systems. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Shift towards a more circular economy: In the face of an oil shortage, there would be a need to adopt a more circular economy approach, where resources are used more efficiently and waste is minimized. This could lead to a reduction in waste and a more sustainable future. Confidence score: 0.9"
