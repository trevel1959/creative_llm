    "**Interactive Clothing Organizer**: Design a clothes hanger that doubles as an interactive digital display. The hanger would have a small screen that could be connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. You could use this feature to track the weather forecast, play music, show your daily schedule, or even display reminders or messages. The hanger's arm would be adjustable to accommodate various clothing items and sizes.",
    "**Heated Clothing Hangers**: Develop a hanger that includes a built-in heating system. This is particularly useful in colder climates or during winter months. The hanger would heat up gradually when plugged into an electrical outlet, keeping your clothes warm and fresh throughout the day. It could also have a timer function for automatic shut-off safety.",
    "**Color-Changing Hangers**: Create a series of clothes hangers that change color based on the type of garment hanging from them. For example, shirts could be white, dresses could be pink, and pants could be blue. This system would help visually organize your wardrobe and make it easier to find specific items quickly.",
    "**Smart Fabric Conditioner Hangers**: Incorporate microfiber strips or diffusers within the hanger to release fabric conditioner or deodorizer automatically. This would keep your clothes smelling fresh and looking crisp without the need for separate sprays or sachets. Users could choose different fragrances or conditioning levels through a smartphone app.",
    "**Adjustable and Expandable Hangers**: Design a hanger that can expand and adjust its width and length to accommodate a variety of garments, from wide dresses to narrow ties. This would save space in your closet and ensure that all your items are neatly displayed. The hanger could also have a locking mechanism to prevent accidental expansion, ensuring that delicate garments are not stretched out of shape."
