    "**Inflatable Solar Panels**: Create large inflatable solar panels that can be inflated during the day to capture sunlight and store energy in batteries. These could be placed on rooftops or open fields. The stored energy can then be used during the night. This idea is creative because it uses an unconventional shape for solar panels, which could increase their efficiency due to better exposure to sunlight.",
    "**Sunlight Reflector Buses**: Develop buses specifically designed to reflect sunlight onto urban areas where sunlight might not reach directly due to high-rise buildings or dense urbanization. The bus could have reflective surfaces that are activated during the day, reflecting sunlight into dark areas, thus providing additional light. This idea is innovative as it addresses a specific urban challenge and uses existing technology (buses) in a new way.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Engineer plants that emit light naturally through bioluminescence. These plants could be grown in public spaces, homes, and even in vertical gardens to provide light during the day. This concept is unique as it merges biology with urban lighting solutions, potentially offering sustainable and aesthetic options.",
    "**Cloud Dispersal Systems**: Design systems that could disperse clouds using drones or high-pressure air cannons, increasing sunlight penetration during cloudy days. This solution would need careful environmental consideration but could significantly impact light availability during periods when the sun is obscured. This idea is original as it tackles the issue of reduced sunlight by actively changing weather conditions.",
    "**Light-Penetrating Windows**: Develop windows that allow more light to penetrate through their structure, perhaps by incorporating nanotechnology that manipulates light at a microscopic level. This could involve creating materials that scatter or absorb less light, thereby increasing indoor illumination. This concept is innovative as it seeks to enhance natural light within buildings without relying on artificial sources. "
