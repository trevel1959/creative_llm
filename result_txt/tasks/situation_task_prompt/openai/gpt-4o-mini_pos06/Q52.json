    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: If you have access to a safe outdoor area, you can create a fire pit using stones or bricks. Once you have a controlled fire, you can use it to roast or grill food. Skewering vegetables, meats, or fruits on sticks and holding them over the flames can create delicious grilled meals. Alternatively, you can wrap food in large leaves (like banana leaves) and place them in the hot coals for a unique flavor.",
    "**Ceviche Preparation**: Leverage the power of acidity to \"cook\" food without heat. By marinating fresh fish or seafood in a mixture of citrus juice (like lime or lemon), salt, and chopped vegetables, you can create a refreshing ceviche. The citric acid will denature the proteins in the fish, giving it a cooked texture and flavor. This method is perfect for creating a light and zesty meal.",
    "**Fermentation Feast**: Embrace the art of fermentation to create flavorful dishes. You can prepare a variety of fermented foods, such as kimchi, sauerkraut, or yogurt, using raw vegetables, fruits, and dairy. By allowing these ingredients to ferment naturally, you can create probiotic-rich meals that are not only nutritious but also packed with unique flavors.",
    "**Stone Cooking Method**: Find smooth, flat stones and heat them in a fire until they are hot. Once heated, you can place food directly on the stones to cook it. This method works well for meats, fish, and vegetables, which can be seared or steamed when covered with wet leaves. The heat from the stones will transfer to the food, cooking it evenly.",
    "**Candle Cooking**: Use candles as a heat source for small-scale cooking. You can create a makeshift stove by placing a candle in a sturdy holder and placing a small metal container or tin can on top. This setup allows you to melt butter, heat sauces, or warm small portions of food. Itâ€™s a creative way to utilize minimal heat for delicate cooking tasks."
