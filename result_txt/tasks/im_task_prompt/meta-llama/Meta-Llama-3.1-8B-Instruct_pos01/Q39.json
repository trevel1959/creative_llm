    "**Smart Garden Hose**: A high-tech garden hose with built-in sensors and a mobile app that tracks water usage, soil moisture, and temperature. The hose would be equipped with sensors that monitor the water flow, temperature, and humidity, providing real-time data to the user's smartphone. The app would allow users to set reminders, track water usage, and receive alerts when the soil is dry or the temperature is too high. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Garden Hose Wind-Up**: A compact, portable garden hose that can be wound up onto a spool using a manual or electric winding mechanism. The hose would be made of a durable, flexible material that can withstand repeated winding and unwinding. The device would be perfect for small gardens, camping, or emergency situations where a traditional hose is not feasible. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Garden Hose with Built-in Water Filter**: A garden hose with a built-in water filter that removes impurities and contaminants from the water supply. The filter would be designed to remove chlorine, lead, and other common contaminants found in tap water, providing clean drinking water for plants and animals. The hose would be equipped with a replaceable filter cartridge that can be easily swapped out when needed. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Garden Hose with Integrated LED Lighting**: A garden hose with built-in LED lights that illuminate the area around the hose, providing visibility and safety in low-light conditions. The lights would be energy-efficient and waterproof, making them perfect for nighttime watering or gardening. The hose would also feature a built-in timer and sensor that adjusts the light intensity based on the surrounding environment.
