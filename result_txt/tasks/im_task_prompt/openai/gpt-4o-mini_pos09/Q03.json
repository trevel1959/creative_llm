    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Develop a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes steam and high-frequency sound waves to break down food residues and grease inside the microwave. Users could simply add water and select the self-cleaning mode, and the microwave would take care of the rest, eliminating the need for harsh chemicals and scrubbing.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Design a multifunctional lid that can be used for various purposes, such as steaming, grilling, or baking. This lid could have adjustable vents to control steam release and a built-in heating element to allow for grilling or broiling. It would enable users to prepare multiple types of dishes in one appliance, enhancing versatility.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**: Incorporate a touchscreen interface on the microwave that allows users to access a database of recipes. The microwave could suggest cooking times and power levels based on the selected recipe. Users could also upload their own recipes, and the microwave would provide step-by-step cooking instructions, making meal prep easier and more fun.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Mode**: Introduce an energy-efficient mode that uses lower power levels for reheating food. This mode would be ideal for warming up leftovers or beverages without using full power, saving energy and reducing electricity bills. Additionally, the microwave could be equipped with a solar panel option for outdoor use, allowing it to run on renewable energy.",
    "**Built-In Food Scale**: Integrate a food scale into the microwave's base that allows users to weigh their food before cooking. This feature would help with portion control and recipe accuracy. The scale could automatically suggest cooking times based on the weight of the food, ensuring perfect results every time."
