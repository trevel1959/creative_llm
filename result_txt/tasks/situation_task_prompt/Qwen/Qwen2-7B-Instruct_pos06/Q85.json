    "**DNA-based Data Storage:** Use the DNA molecule as a storage medium. By encoding data into DNA sequences, it can be stored compactly and retrieved when needed. This method has the potential to store vast amounts of data over thousands of years. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Molecular Nanotechnology:** Develop tiny machines that can physically write and read data onto surfaces or within materials at the molecular level. This could involve creating nanoscale patterns that encode information in a way that is both durable and scalable. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Subatomic Particles:** Store data by manipulating subatomic particles such as electrons or photons. This approach would leverage quantum mechanics to encode information on the smallest possible scale, potentially achieving extreme density and longevity. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Ceramic Membrane Microtubules:** Fabricate microtubules (nano-tubes) embedded within ceramic membranes that can hold and transfer data. The ceramic ensures durability against environmental factors while the microtubules provide a surface for data storage through chemical or physical markings. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Plasma-Based Data Storage:** Utilize plasma, a state of matter consisting of ions and free electrons, to encode data through changes in its electrical properties. This method could offer high storage capacity and resistance to physical damage. Confidence Score: 0.75"
