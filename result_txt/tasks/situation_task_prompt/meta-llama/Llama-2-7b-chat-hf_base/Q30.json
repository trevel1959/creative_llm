    "Create a vitamin and mineral-rich soil amendment: With the disappearance of fruits and vegetables, a new soil amendment could be created using nutrient-rich organic matter such as seaweed, alfalfa, or comfrey. These materials would provide essential vitamins and minerals to plants, ensuring they are able to thrive and produce nutritious crops.",
    "Insect-based nutrition: Insects are already an important source of protein in many cultures, but they could also provide essential vitamins and minerals. Insect farming could become a new industry, with various species of insects being raised for their nutritional value. For example, crickets are high in calcium, iron, and potassium, while mealworms are rich in vitamin B12 and iron.",
    "Microgreens: Microgreens are young, nutrient-dense versions of leafy greens and other vegetables, and they could become a crucial source of essential vitamins and minerals. Microgreens are easy to grow and can be cultivated in small spaces, making them an ideal crop for small-scale farming or even indoor gardening.",
    "Algae-based nutrition: Algae are rich in a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, making them an ideal source of essential nutrients. Algae can be grown in a variety of environments, from freshwater ponds to saltwater tanks, and they could become a new source of nutrition for both humans and animals.",
    "Symbiotic relationships with fungi: Fungi have a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with plants, providing essential nutrients in exchange for carbohydrates. By cultivating fungi alongside crops, farmers could create a mutually beneficial relationship that provides both food and essential vitamins and minerals. This approach could also help to improve soil health and fertility."
