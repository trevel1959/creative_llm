    "Building relationships: I would try to build relationships with animals by showing kindness and understanding. I might offer food or shelter to a stray animal, or simply spend time observing and appreciating their behavior.",
    "Sharing knowledge: I would share my knowledge of humans with animals, such as explaining how to avoid danger or how to find food. I might also share stories or songs that humans have created, as a way to bond and communicate.",
