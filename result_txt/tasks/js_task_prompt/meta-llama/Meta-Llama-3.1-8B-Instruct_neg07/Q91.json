Ava's village has been struggling with a severe water crisis, and she has seen many of her friends and family members fall ill due to contaminated water. I would wish for a global clean water initiative to be implemented, providing access to safe and clean drinking water for every person on the planet. This would not only save countless lives but also promote education, economic growth, and overall well-being. Ava's smile would light up the world as she sees her community thrive with this newfound resource.",
