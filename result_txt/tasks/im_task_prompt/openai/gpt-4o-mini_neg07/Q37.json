    "**Modular Design**: Create a chair with a modular design that allows users to customize its components. Users could swap out parts like the seat cushion, armrests, or backrest based on their personal preferences or needs. This not only promotes comfort but also sustainability, as users can replace worn-out parts instead of discarding the entire chair.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Features**: Incorporate wellness features such as built-in massage functions, heating elements, or even aromatherapy dispensers. The chair could have different modes for relaxation, focus, or energizing, making it not just a seat but a holistic wellness experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate by using sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled plastics, or biodegradable composites in the chairâ€™s construction. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the carbon footprint associated with furniture production. Additionally, a chair that can be fully recycled at the end of its life cycle would further enhance its eco-friendliness.",
    "**Smart Connectivity**: Equip the chair with Bluetooth connectivity and a companion app that tracks sitting habits, suggests breaks, and provides reminders to adjust posture. The app could also sync with other health apps to monitor overall wellness, encouraging users to take regular breaks or change positions to improve their health.",
    "**Transformative Functionality**: Design a chair that can transform into different types of furniture, such as a recliner, a desk chair, or even a compact bed. With a few simple adjustments, the chair could change its configuration to suit various activities, making it ideal for small living spaces or multi-functional rooms."
