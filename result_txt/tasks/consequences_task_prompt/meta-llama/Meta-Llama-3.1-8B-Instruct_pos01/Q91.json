    "**The Great Reversal**: Imagine waking up to find that gravity has reversed, causing everything to float upwards. People would be stuck to the ceiling, and objects would be drifting towards the sky. Chaos would ensue as people try to adapt to this new reality. The government would likely declare a state of emergency, and emergency services would be stretched to the limit. As people try to find ways to cope, they would discover that the reversed gravity affects not just objects, but also the natural world. Trees would be uprooted, and animals would be floating in mid-air, leading to a global wildlife crisis. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Gravity Surfing**: With gravity reversed, people would find creative ways to navigate this new world. They would develop new sports and activities, such as \"gravity surfing,\" where they would ride the waves of floating objects. The world would see a surge in popularity of \"zero-gravity\" theme parks, where people could experience the thrill of weightlessness. Entrepreneurs would capitalize on this trend, creating businesses that cater to the new demand for gravity-defying experiences. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**The Great Escape**: As people adapt to the reversed gravity, they would start to explore the possibilities of escaping the planet. With everything floating upwards, it would be easier to launch objects into space. Space agencies would see an opportunity to accelerate their space exploration programs, and private companies would start to develop new technologies to harness the power of reversed gravity. This could lead to a new era of space travel and colonization. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**The Floating Metropolis**: Cities would need to be redesigned to accommodate the new reality. Buildings would be constructed with floating foundations, and streets would be paved with a special material that allows for smooth movement. The world would see a shift towards more vertical and compact cities, with towering skyscrapers that defy gravity. This would lead to a new era of urban planning and architecture. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**The Great Unification**: As people struggle to adapt to the reversed gravity, they would realize that they are not alone in this experience. The entire planet would be affected, and nations would put aside their differences to work together to find a solution. This would lead to a new era of global cooperation and unity, as people come together to address the challenges posed by the reversed gravity. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
