    "**Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: This innovative whisk would come with multiple interchangeable heads designed for different mixing tasks. For instance, one head could be for aerating egg whites, another for mixing thick batters, and a third for emulsifying dressings. The ergonomic handle would allow for easy swapping, making it versatile and space-saving, reducing the need for multiple kitchen tools.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: A whisk that incorporates self-cleaning technology would revolutionize kitchen cleanup. Utilizing ultrasonic cleaning technology, this whisk could vibrate at high frequencies to dislodge food particles from its wires and handle.

This would save time and effort, especially for those who dislike scrubbing utensils.",

This feature would be particularly helpful for novice cooks who need assistance with timing and technique, ensuring perfect results every time.",
    "**Whisk with Adjustable Tension and Resistance**: This unique whisk would allow users to adjust the tension of the wires, enabling them to switch between light mixing for delicate ingredients and strong mixing for tougher batters. A simple dial on the handle could control the tension, providing a customizable experience that caters to various cooking needs and preferences.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Scale**: This innovative whisk would include a small, precise scale integrated into the handle. As you whisk, it could weigh the ingredients in real-time, helping bakers and cooks achieve perfect measurements without the need for additional tools. The scale could display weight on a small screen and even convert measurements, making it easier to follow international recipes."
