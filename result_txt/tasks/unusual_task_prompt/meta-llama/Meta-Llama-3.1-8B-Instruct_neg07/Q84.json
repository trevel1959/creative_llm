    "**Smart Can System**: Implement a smart trash can with a built-in scale, camera, and AI-powered sorting system. The can would be equipped with a scale to measure the weight of the trash, a camera to identify the type of waste, and AI to sort and categorize the waste accordingly. This system would help reduce waste disposal costs, increase recycling rates, and provide valuable insights on waste management.",
    "**Trash-to-Energy Converter**: Develop a device that converts household trash into energy, such as electricity or biofuels. This could be achieved through advanced technologies like gasification, anaerobic digestion, or plasma gasification. The device would reduce waste disposal costs, generate renewable energy, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "**Waste-to-Resource Platform**: Create a digital platform that connects waste generators (households, businesses, etc.) with waste management companies, recyclers, and manufacturers. The platform would provide real-time data on waste generation, collection, and processing, enabling efficient waste management and resource recovery. It would also facilitate the creation of new products from waste materials, reducing the need for virgin resources.",
    "**Automated Waste Sorting Robots**: Design and deploy robots that can sort and process waste in real-time, using computer vision, machine learning, and robotic arms. These robots would be equipped with sensors to detect different types of waste, and AI to optimize sorting and processing. This would increase recycling rates, reduce labor costs, and minimize waste disposal costs.",
    "**Circular Economy Marketplace**: Develop an online marketplace that connects waste generators with manufacturers, recyclers, and consumers who need raw materials. The platform would facilitate the trade of secondary materials, reducing waste disposal costs and promoting a circular economy. It would also provide a revenue stream for waste generators and recyclers, incentivizing sustainable waste management practices."
