    "**Rainbow Umbrellas**: Design an umbrella that changes color based on the weather conditions. It uses sensors to detect sunlight, rain, and temperature. When it's sunny, the umbrella might turn shades of yellow or orange; when raining, it could display blues and greens; during cooler temperatures, it could have more reds and purples. This idea not only adds a fun element to rainy days but also serves as a stylish accessory.",
    "**Portable Umbrella-Backpack**: Create an umbrella that can be transformed into a backpack for convenience when not in use. This would feature a retractable handle and a compact design that allows the user to easily carry it around. This is especially useful for commuters who don't want to juggle an umbrella while carrying other items.",
    "**Heated Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that integrates heating elements, providing warmth during cold and rainy weather. This could be particularly beneficial for those living in colder climates. The umbrella would have a power source, possibly a rechargeable battery, which powers the heating elements when turned on.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Introduce an umbrella that utilizes nanotechnology to repel water and dirt. This could involve applying a coating to the fabric that makes it hydrophobic and self-cleaning, reducing the need for frequent washing and saving resources.",
    "**Interactive Umbrella Display**: Create an umbrella that can display messages, advertisements, or even personalized content. Using LED lights and wireless connectivity, this umbrella could serve as a digital billboard, promoting brands or sharing important information like traffic updates or weather forecasts. It could also be personalized by the user to display messages or designs on the umbrella."
