    "Personalized hovercraft: With all roads disappearing, a personalized hovercraft would be an excellent mode of transportation. Each individual could design and customize their hovercraft to suit their specific needs and preferences. They could choose from a variety of styles, sizes, and colors, and even add personalized features such as a built-in music system or a special compartment for carrying pets.",
    "Network of underground tunnels: To move around without roads, a network of interconnected underground tunnels could be constructed. These tunnels could be designed to accommodate various modes of transportation, including electric or self-driving cars, bicycles, and even walking paths. The tunnels could be equipped with advanced navigation systems and safety features, ensuring a smooth and safe journey for all users.",
    "Air transportation: With roads gone, air transportation could become the primary mode of movement. Small, personalized air vehicles could be designed for individual use, while larger airships could be used for transporting goods and people over longer distances. To make air transportation more accessible, airports could be built on rooftops or in strategic locations, providing easy access to the sky.",
    "Waterways and canals: For those living near waterways or canals, these could become the primary means of transportation. Personal watercraft, such as jet skis or small boats, could be used for short distances, while larger boats and ships could be used for longer journeys. To make water transportation more efficient, waterways could be dredged and widened to accommodate larger vessels, and specialized routes could be designated for different types of traffic.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could be used to move people and goods around the town or city without the need for roads. These trains could operate on elevated tracks, reducing the need for infrastructure and minimizing the impact on the environment. Maglev trains could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, making them an eco-friendly mode of transportation."
