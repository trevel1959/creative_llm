    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a juicer with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses steam or ultrasonic waves to clean its components after each use. This could save users time and effort, ensuring that the juicer is always ready for the next round of juicing. The self-cleaning process could be activated with a simple button press or set on a timer, making maintenance hassle-free.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Smoothie and Soup Modes**: Create a juicer that can also function as a blender and a soup maker. With different modes for juicing, blending, and cooking, users could easily switch between making fresh juices, smoothies, and hot soups. This versatility would cater to a wider audience and encourage healthier eating habits by simplifying meal prep.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Source**: Develop a juicer made entirely from biodegradable or recyclable materials, reducing its environmental impact. Additionally, incorporate solar panels or a hand-crank option for those who want to juice off the grid or in areas without electricity. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers and promote sustainable living.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Guide with Voice Assistance**: Integrate a voice-activated assistant into the juicer that provides users with step-by-step juicing recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. This could include suggestions for flavor combinations, tips on how to prepare the produce, and information about the health benefits of different juices. Users could also ask for substitutions if theyâ€™re missing an ingredient.",
    "**Juice Preservation Technology**: Introduce a juicer that uses vacuum-sealing technology to preserve juice for longer periods without losing nutrients. After juicing, the machine could automatically seal the juice in airtight containers, minimizing oxidation and extending shelf life. This feature would be perfect for those who want to prep juices in advance for the week."
