    "**Heat and Insulation**: Tiny houses often struggle with temperature regulation, especially in extreme climates. Poor insulation can lead to high heating and cooling costs, as well as discomfort for the inhabitants. To address this issue, consider using eco-friendly insulation materials like sheep's wool or recycled denim, and incorporate passive solar design elements such as south-facing windows and thermal mass materials.",
    "**Privacy and Socialization**: Tiny houses can be cozy but might lack privacy, especially when shared by multiple people. To maintain personal space and ensure comfort, consider incorporating sliding walls or partitions that can be closed off during social gatherings. Additionally, outdoor living spaces like decks or patios can serve as private areas for relaxation.",
    "**Accessibility and Mobility**: For those who choose a mobile tiny house, accessibility becomes a concern. Ensuring the house can be easily navigated by individuals with disabilities requires careful planning of layout and fixtures. Ramps, wider doorways, and adjustable lighting are crucial features to include from the start.",
    "**Waste Management**: Tiny houses typically have smaller waste capacities than larger homes. Efficient waste management systems are necessary to prevent unpleasant odors and health hazards. Installing composting toilets, utilizing greywater recycling systems, and compacting trash storage options can help mitigate these issues.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: With limited space, safety becomes paramount. Properly installed smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and non-slip surfaces are essential. Additionally, electrical wiring must be carefully planned to avoid overloading circuits and potential fire hazards."
