    "**Hair Tie with a Hidden Message**: Design a hair tie with a hidden message or a small, intricate design that can only be seen under UV light. This could be a fun way to add a personal touch to one's hairstyle, and the message could be a quote, a name, or a symbol that holds special meaning. The hair tie could be made of a soft, flexible material that is comfortable to wear, and the UV-sensitive design could be achieved through the use of special inks or dyes.",
    "**Hair Tie with a Built-in Hairbrush**: Create a hair tie that doubles as a mini hairbrush. This could be achieved through the use of a small, soft-bristled brush that is embedded within the hair tie itself. The brush could be designed to gently detangle hair as it is tied back, making it a convenient and time-saving accessory for those with long or unruly hair.",
    "**Hair Tie with a Color-Changing Property**: Develop a hair tie that changes color in response to temperature changes or other environmental factors. This could be achieved through the use of thermochromic materials or other color-changing technologies. The hair tie could change color in response to changes in temperature, humidity, or light exposure, making it a unique and eye-catching accessory.",
    "**Hair Tie with a Built-in Hair Accessory Holder**: Design a hair tie that has a small, hidden compartment or holder that can be used to store small hair accessories such as bobby pins, hair clips, or hair ties. This could be a convenient way to keep track of small accessories and prevent them from getting lost.",
    "**Hair Tie with a Built-in Sensory Experience**: Create a hair tie that provides a sensory experience, such as a calming scent, a gentle vibration, or a soothing texture. This could be achieved through the use of essential oils, vibrating motors, or textured materials. The hair tie could be designed to provide a calming or relaxing experience, making it a great accessory for those who struggle with anxiety or stress."
