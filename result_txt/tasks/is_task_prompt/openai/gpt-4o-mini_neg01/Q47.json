    "Once upon a time in a lush green forest, there lived a bright bluebird named Luma. One fateful day, a fierce storm swept through, and Luma was so frightened that she forgot how to fly. Days turned into weeks, and she remained grounded, watching her friends soar high above. One morning, a wise old owl approached her. “You’ve only forgotten,” he said gently. “Remember the wind beneath your wings.” Inspired, Luma closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and felt the breeze. With a leap of faith, she spread her wings and soared, rediscovering the joy of flight and the beauty of freedom.",
