    "Geothermal Heating and Cooling: Geothermal systems harness the heat generated by the Earth's core to provide heating and cooling. These systems can be installed underground or above ground and can be used to generate electricity or provide direct heat to buildings. This technology can provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy, even in cloudy conditions.",
    "Wind Turbines: Wind turbines are another renewable energy source that can be used to generate electricity. They use the wind's power to turn blades, which in turn generate electricity. While they require wind to function, they can still generate electricity even on cloudy days when the sun is not shining.",
    "Energy Storage Systems: Energy storage systems, such as batteries, can store excess energy generated during the day for use during cloudy periods. These systems can be used to store solar or wind-generated electricity, allowing for a continuous supply of energy even when the sun is not shining.",
    "Green Roofing: Green roofs can be used to capture sunlight and convert it into heat. These roofs are covered with vegetation, which can absorb and retain solar radiation. This can help to maintain a comfortable temperature inside buildings, even on cloudy days.",
    "Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV): BIPV systems integrate solar panels into the building's fa√ßade, allowing them to blend seamlessly with the architecture. This not only captures sunlight but also provides a more visually appealing and efficient use of space."
