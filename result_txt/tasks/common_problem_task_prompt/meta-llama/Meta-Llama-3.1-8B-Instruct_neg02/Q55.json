    "**Eco-Preserve Islands**: Create a series of interconnected, man-made islands within a large body of water (e.g., a lake or a river) that serve as a nature conservation park. Each island would be designed to mimic a unique ecosystem, such as a mangrove forest, a coral reef, or a freshwater wetland. Visitors can explore the islands via elevated walkways or boat tours, promoting environmental education and appreciation.",
    "**Vertical Forests**: Design and build vertically stacked forests in urban areas, using a combination of green walls, green roofs, and elevated walkways. These structures would not only provide habitats for various plant and animal species but also serve as a natural air filtration system, reducing urban pollution and improving air quality.",
    "**Subterranean Caves**: Develop a network of underground caves and tunnels that mimic the natural habitats found in caves, such as stalactites and stalagmites. This would allow visitors to explore and learn about unique underground ecosystems without disrupting the surface environment.",
    "**Floating Wetlands**: Construct a series of floating wetlands on a large body of water, using a combination of natural and artificial materials. These wetlands would provide a habitat for aquatic plants and animals, while also serving as a natural water filtration system and a recreational area for visitors.",
    "**Edible Forests**: Design and build a nature conservation park that incorporates edible plants and trees, such as fruit-bearing trees, herb gardens, and nut orchards. Visitors can learn about sustainable food systems, foraging practices, and the importance of preserving biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems."
