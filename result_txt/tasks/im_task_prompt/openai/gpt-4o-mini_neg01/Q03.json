    "**Multi-Function Steam and Crisp Technology**: Combine steaming and crisping functions in one microwave. By incorporating a dual chamber system, users could steam vegetables while simultaneously crisping proteins or baking items. This would allow for healthier meal preparation without sacrificing texture or flavor, offering a more versatile cooking experience.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional buttons with a large, interactive touchscreen that provides users with a visual interface for cooking. This screen could display recipes, cooking videos, and nutritional information, as well as allow users to customize settings more intuitively. Users could even create and save their own cooking presets for their favorite meals.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature using steam technology. Users could fill a designated reservoir with water, and the microwave would generate steam to loosen food particles and stains. After the cycle, users could simply wipe down the interior, making maintenance easier and more hygienic.",
    "**Energy-Saving Eco Mode**: Implement an energy-efficient eco mode that reduces power consumption during standby. The microwave could enter a low-energy state when not in use, and users could set timers for automatic wake-up times, allowing the appliance to be ready when they need it while conserving energy when itâ€™s not in use.",
    "**Integrated Food Sensor Technology**: Equip the microwave with advanced sensors that can detect the type and weight of the food being cooked. This technology would automatically adjust cooking times and power levels for optimal results, eliminating guesswork and preventing overcooking or undercooking."
