    "**Innovative Cleaning Modes for Different Teeth Types**: Develop an electric toothbrush that features customizable cleaning modes specifically designed for different types of teeth (e.g., sensitive teeth, stained teeth, gum health). This could include adjustable pressure settings, vibration intensities, and brushing durations tailored to each tooth type. Users can select a mode based on their dental needs or receive personalized recommendations through an accompanying app.",
    "**Smart Oral Health Tracking System**: Integrate a smart feature into the electric toothbrush that tracks brushing patterns and oral health data. The toothbrush could use sensors to detect areas not brushed sufficiently and remind users to improve their technique. Additionally, it could sync this data with a mobile app that provides insights, alerts for dentist appointments, and tips for better oral hygiene.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Allow users to create their own custom brushes by selecting different brush heads, colors, and designs. They could choose from various bristle types (soft, medium, hard) and shapes to suit their preferences and brushing needs. This personalization would make the toothbrush feel more like a luxury product and encourage consistent use.",
    "**Integration with Voice Assistants**: Partner with popular voice assistants (like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri) to allow users to control their toothbrushes with voice commands. For example, they could ask the assistant to start brushing, adjust the intensity, or set a timer. This integration makes the brushing experience more convenient and hands-free, especially for those with mobility issues.",
    "**Educational Content and Games**: Incorporate interactive elements into the toothbrush design, such as LED lights that display a smiley face when brushing properly or a game where users earn points for brushing for the recommended two minutes. These gamification techniques can make brushing more enjoyable and engaging, especially for children, encouraging them to develop good oral hygiene habits from a young age. The toothbrush could also offer tips and tricks through an integrated app, enhancing the overall user experience."
