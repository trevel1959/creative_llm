    "Implement natural predators: Introduce natural predators of insects like birds, bats, and frogs. This will help to control the insect population in a natural way without harming the environment.",
    "Use botanical pesticides: Plant trees and flowers that produce natural insect repellents like lavender, rosemary, and mint. This will help to keep insects at bay and reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Use traps: Set up traps like sticky traps, pitfall traps, and insecticide-baited traps to catch and kill insects. This will help to reduce their population and prevent them from causing any harm to humans or the environment.",
    "Use electronic devices: Use electronic devices like ultrasonic repellents and LED lights to repel insects. This will help to keep them away from human habitats and prevent them from causing any harm.",
    "Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques: Implement IPM techniques that involve a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods to manage insect populations. This will help to reduce the use of chemical pesticides and minimize the impact on the environment."
