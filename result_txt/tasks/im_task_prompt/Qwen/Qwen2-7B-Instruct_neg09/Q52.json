    "**Time Capsule Keychain**: Create a keychain that includes a small, waterproof container for storing personal items or messages. The idea is to write down your current feelings, goals, or dreams, seal them in the container, and then bury it somewhere safe. In five years, you can dig it up to see how far you've come. This can serve as a reflective tool and a reminder of your journey.",
    "**Memory Lane Keychain**: Design a keychain with slots for small photographs or mementos. Attach clips or small magnets so that these memories can be easily changed or added. It can serve as a daily reminder of cherished moments, people, or places. You can add new photos every time you visit a special place or have a significant event.",
    "**Progress Tracker Keychain**: Create a keychain with a circular design divided into segments. Each segment represents a goal or milestone. As you achieve each goal, you can attach a small charm or sticker to the corresponding section. This visual representation helps track progress and provides motivation.",
    "**Lucky Charm Keychain**: Make a series of small charms, each with a different symbol of luck or good fortune (like a horseshoe, four-leaf clover, etc.). Each charm can be attached to the keychain using a simple mechanism that allows easy swapping. This way, you can customize your keychain based on your mood or situation, always carrying a bit of luck with you.",
    "**Seasonal Keychain**: Design a keychain that changes with the seasons. For example, you could create a set of four keychains, each with a different color scheme or design associated with a season (spring flowers, summer beach scenes, autumn leaves, winter snowflakes). This can be a fun way to mark the passing of time and celebrate the beauty of each season."
