    "**Solving the Fermat Paradox**: The Fermat Paradox is a famous problem in mathematics that asks why there are no prime numbers of the form 2^n + 1, where n is a positive integer. I would use my time-controlling power to solve this problem by going back in time to when Fermat was alive and presenting him with a proof of the solution. This would not only solve one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics but also prevent the endless debate and speculation surrounding the paradox.",
    "**Helping to end poverty**: I would use my time-controlling power to create a world without poverty by going back in time and distributing wealth and resources more evenly throughout history. By redistributing resources and promoting economic equality, I could create a more stable and prosperous world for all.",
    "**Saving the environment**: I would use my time-controlling power to create a sustainable future by going back in time and implementing environmentally friendly policies and technologies. By working with leaders and activists of the past, I could help to prevent climate change and protect the planet for future generations.",
    "**Preventing pandemics**: I would use my time-controlling power to go back in time and prevent the spread of deadly pandemics, such as the Black Death, the Spanish Flu, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. By stopping these pandemics before they started, I could save countless lives and prevent the long-term effects they had on society.",
    "**Solving the energy crisis**: I would use my time-controlling power to go back in time and invest in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, before they were widely adopted. By promoting the use of renewable energy, I could create a more sustainable future and prevent the worst effects of climate change."
