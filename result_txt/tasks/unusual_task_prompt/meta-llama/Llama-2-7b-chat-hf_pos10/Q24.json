    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that uses AI to track and analyze brushing habits, providing personalized feedback and recommendations to improve oral hygiene. The toothbrush could also include a built-in timer, Bluetooth connectivity for tracking brushing sessions, and a companion app for data analysis and insights.",
    "Toothbrush Sanitizer: Create a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in UV-C sanitizing light, ensuring that the toothbrush is clean and free of bacteria after each use. This would provide an additional layer of hygiene and peace of mind for users.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-In Flosser: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water-pump-powered flosser, allowing users to clean between their teeth without the need for a separate flosser. This would streamline the brushing process and make it easier for people to maintain good oral hygiene.",
