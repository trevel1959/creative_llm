    "**Adjustable Whisk Head**:    Imagine a whisk that allows users to change the head type based on the task at hand. With interchangeable heads (like balloon, flat, or spiral), users could switch from whisking eggs to mixing dough without needing multiple tools. The heads could be designed to snap on and off easily, and the whisk handle could include a small compartment for storing the extra heads.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Vibration Absorption**:    A whisk with a specially designed ergonomic handle that reduces strain on the wrist and hand during prolonged use. The handle could feature a soft, textured grip and be slightly curved to fit the natural grip of the hand. Additionally, it could include a built-in vibration absorption system to minimize the impact felt by the user when whisking dense mixtures.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**:    This innovative whisk would have a self-cleaning mechanism that uses a combination of water jets and UV light to sanitize the whisk after use. The user would simply place the whisk in a designated holder that activates the cleaning process. This would save time on cleaning and ensure that the whisk is always hygienic, especially useful in busy kitchens.",
    "**Multi-Functional Whisk with Built-in Scale**:    This whisk would have a small digital scale integrated into the handle, allowing users to weigh ingredients as they whisk. The scale could have a tare function to subtract the weight of the bowl or container, making it easier to measure ingredients accurately. This feature would be especially beneficial for baking, where precision is key.",
    "**Whisk with Collapsible Design for Easy Storage**:    A whisk that can collapse into a more compact size for easy storage. The handle could be telescopic, and the whisk head could fold down or flatten. This design would be perfect for those with limited kitchen space or for travelers who want to bring kitchen tools on the go without taking up too much room."
