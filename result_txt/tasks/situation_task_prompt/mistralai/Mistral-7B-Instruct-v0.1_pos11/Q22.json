    "Develop a network of underground tunnels: In the event that all roads disappear, one creative solution could be to develop a network of underground tunnels that connect various points in the city. These tunnels could be used for transportation, and could be equipped with various modes of transport such as trains, trams, and buses. This would allow people to move around the city without the need for roads, and would also provide a safer and more efficient mode of transportation.",
    "Create a network of bike paths: Another solution could be to create a network of bike paths that crisscross the city. These paths could be designed to be safe and scenic, and could be used for both commuting and recreation. This would allow people to move around the city while getting some exercise, and would also reduce traffic congestion on the roads.",
    "Build a network of floating bridges: In some cities, waterways are a common feature. In such cases, a creative solution could be to build a network of floating bridges that connect various points in the city. These bridges could be used for transportation, and could be equipped with various modes of transport such as boats and ferries. This would allow people to move around the city while enjoying the beauty of the waterways.",
    "Develop a network of pedestrian walkways: A network of pedestrian walkways could be another creative solution. These walkways could be designed to be safe and comfortable, and could be used for both commuting and leisure activities. This would allow people to move around the city on foot, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.",
    "Create a network of vertical gardens: In some cities, vertical gardens are becoming increasingly popular. In the event that all roads disappear, a creative solution could be to create a network of vertical gardens that are used for transportation. These gardens could be designed to be safe and comfortable, and could be used for both commuting and leisure activities. This would allow people to move around the city while enjoying the beauty of nature."
