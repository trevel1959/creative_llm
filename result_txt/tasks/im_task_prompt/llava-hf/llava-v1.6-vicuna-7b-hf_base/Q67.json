    "Creating a paint brush with interchangeable bristles, which could be easily taken out and replaced as they become dirty or worn. This would enable users to keep their brush clean while continuing their work, and prevent the buildup of paint on the brush and its bristles.",
    "Developing a smart paintbrush that can detect the color and thickness of the paint being used, and adjust the brush strokes accordingly. This would improve precision, consistency, and potentially reduce the amount of paint used.",
    "The concept of a retractable paintbrush. A built-in mechanism that would retract the brush head and bristles into a compact, portable case when not in use, making it easier to transport and store.",
    "Paintbrush with detachable handle that could be replaced with different ergonomic grip options, providing a more comfortable and personalized painting experience.",
    "Multi-purpose paintbrush with interchangeable heads, one for flat surfaces and the other for textured surfaces, allowing users to switch between the two without needing to clean the brush."
