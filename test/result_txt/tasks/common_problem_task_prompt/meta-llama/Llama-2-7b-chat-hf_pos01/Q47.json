    "Design and Build a Custom Water-Cooling System: Create a custom water-cooling system that incorporates a reservoir, pump, and radiator to keep the computer components cool. This system would be more efficient than traditional air cooling methods, especially for high-performance computers. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Incorporate a Custom-Made Heatsink: Design and 3D print a custom heatsink that is tailored to the specific components of the computer. This heatsink would be optimized for heat dissipation and would provide better cooling performance than a generic heatsink. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Use a Novel Cooling Material: Experiment with a new cooling material that has never been used in computer cooling systems before. This material could have unique properties that allow it to absorb and dissipate heat more efficiently than traditional materials. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Implement a Passive Cooling System: Design a passive cooling system that uses natural convection to cool the computer components. This system would be energy-efficient and could be used in environments where electricity is scarce or expensive. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Incorporate a Thermoelectric Cooling System: Integrate a thermoelectric cooling system into the computer that converts heat into electricity. This system would be more efficient than traditional cooling methods and could be used to power other devices. Confidence Score: 0.8"
