    "**Economic Overhaul**: With immortality, the concept of retirement would become obsolete. People would have to work for potentially centuries, which could lead to a radical shift in economic models. Retirement systems, healthcare costs, and social security plans would need to be completely restructured to accommodate an indefinitely long working life.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The idea of living forever introduces profound psychological implications. People might experience existential crises, questioning the purpose of life or their personal growth. There could also be issues related to boredom, as the monotony of repeating experiences might lead to dissatisfaction or restlessness.",

    "**Technological Advancements**: To support and maintain immortality, significant technological advancements would be required. This includes medical treatments that prevent aging, methods for dealing with potential genetic mutations, and perhaps even ways to enhance cognitive abilities. The pursuit of these technologies could spur rapid progress in various scientific fields.",
    "**Cultural and Philosophical Shifts**: The discovery of immortality would likely lead to significant shifts in cultural practices and philosophical thought. It might challenge traditional views on death, the meaning of life, and human existence. Religious beliefs could be tested, with some religions potentially adapting or evolving to accommodate the concept of eternal life, while others might face crisis due to this revelation."
