    "**Self-Cleaning Steam Feature**: Enhance the self-cleaning function of ovens by introducing a steam cleaning feature. By using high-pressure steam, food residue and grease can be loosened and washed away more effectively than traditional self-cleaning cycles. This feature would not only save time but also reduce the need for harsh chemicals, making it an eco-friendly option.",
    "**Modular Oven Racks**: Design modular oven racks that can be easily adjusted or removed based on the size of the dishes being cooked. These racks could be height-adjustable and have interchangeable sections that can be added or removed, allowing for greater flexibility when cooking multiple dishes at once or accommodating larger items like turkeys or roasts.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide**: Incorporate a digital display that features a built-in recipe guide with step-by-step cooking instructions. Users could select a recipe from a database, and the oven would automatically adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the selected dish. This feature would also allow for voice commands, making it easier for users to follow along without needing to touch the screen with messy hands.",
    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Introduce advanced cooking modes that combine various cooking techniques in one cycle, such as air frying, baking, and broiling. Users could select a \"roast\" mode that uses a combination of convection baking and broiling to achieve perfectly cooked meats with crispy skin, all in one go. This would streamline the cooking process and save energy.",
    "**Personalized Cooking Profiles**: Develop a feature that allows users to create personalized cooking profiles based on their preferences and dietary needs. The oven would remember settings for different dishes, such as preferred doneness for meats or baking times for specific recipes. This feature could also suggest cooking adjustments based on past usage patterns, making meal preparation more efficient."
