    "In a bustling city, a group of mice had found a way to escape the hustle and bustle. They had discovered an old, abandoned music box in a hidden alleyway, and when wound up, it played the most beautiful and melodious tunes. The mice would gather around the music box, their voices harmonizing with the notes, creating a symphony that echoed through the alleyways. One day, a passerby heard the music and was captivated by the melody. She followed the sound to the alleyway and was surprised to find the mice singing. She decided to keep the music box, and the mice continued to sing, but now they had a new audience. The mice, with their newfound fame, continued to sing, but they also made sure to return to their hidden alleyway before the dawn.",
