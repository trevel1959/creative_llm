    "**AI-Powered Scene Recognition**: Incorporate advanced AI algorithms that can analyze the scene in real-time and automatically adjust camera settings (like ISO, shutter speed, and aperture) based on the detected environment. This feature would help novice photographers capture high-quality images without needing to understand complex settings, while also allowing professionals to focus more on creativity than technical adjustments.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular camera system where users can easily swap out components such as lenses, sensors, and even the body style. This would allow photographers to customize their cameras for specific shooting scenarios, whether they need a lightweight setup for travel or a more robust configuration for professional shoots.",
    "**Built-in Drone Functionality**: Develop a camera that can detach from its body and transform into a small drone. This would enable users to capture aerial shots effortlessly. The camera could be programmed to follow the user or capture predetermined shots, offering unique perspectives without the need for additional equipment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design cameras using sustainable and biodegradable materials. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of camera production but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the camera could include a recycling program where users can return old models for upgrades or discounts on new purchases.",
    "**Smart Connectivity Features**: Enhance connectivity options by integrating 5G technology for instant sharing of images and videos to social media platforms or cloud storage. This could also include remote collaboration features, allowing multiple users to connect and edit images together in real-time, making photography a more social and interactive experience."
