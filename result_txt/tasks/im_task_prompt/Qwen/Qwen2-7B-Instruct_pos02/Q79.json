    "**Eco-Friendly Clothes Hanger**: Develop a line of clothes hangers made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic. These hangers can be marketed as eco-friendly alternatives to traditional wood or plastic hangers, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Each hanger could also be designed with features such as a non-slip grip or adjustable width for various clothing items.",
    "**Smart Clothes Hanger**: Create smart hangers that integrate sensors to monitor the humidity and temperature of the clothes stored on them. The hangers can send alerts when the conditions are not optimal for storing specific garments (e.g., wool sweaters) and can be connected to a mobile app for users to easily monitor and adjust the conditions.",
    "**Customizable Clothes Hanger System**: Design a modular clothes hanger system where the body of the hanger can be customized with different colors, materials, and finishes. This allows customers to match their hangers with their personal style or home decor. The system could include interchangeable components like hooks, clips, and shelves to maximize space and accommodate various clothing types.",
    "**Invisible Clothes Hanger**: Develop a transparent or invisible hanger using advanced materials that blend in with any wardrobe, making it virtually unseen. This could be particularly useful in minimalist or high-end retail environments, enhancing the overall visual appeal of the clothing displayed. The hangers could be made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber or high-gloss plastics.",
    "**Artisanal Clothes Hanger Collection**: Create a line of handcrafted clothes hangers made by local artisans using traditional techniques. These hangers could be adorned with unique patterns, textures, or embellishments, offering a one-of-a-kind touch to any wardrobe. By supporting local artists, this collection would also contribute to community development and cultural preservation. The hangers could be sold through boutique stores or online marketplaces targeting consumers who value craftsmanship and support artisan communities."
