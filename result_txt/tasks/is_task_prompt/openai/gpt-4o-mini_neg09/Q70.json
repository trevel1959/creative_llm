    "In a quaint little town, a boy named Leo dreaded his upcoming birthday. His friends, unbeknownst to him, planned a surprise party. They whispered excitedly, but Leo felt invisible, believing no one cared. On the day of his birthday, he sat alone in his room, staring at the ceiling. Suddenly, he heard giggles and whispers outside. Curiosity piqued, he peeked through the window. To his amazement, his friends had decorated the yard with balloons and streamers, but no one was there. They had planned a scavenger hunt for him to find them. Leo stepped outside, and the laughter erupted, making him feel seen and cherished.",
