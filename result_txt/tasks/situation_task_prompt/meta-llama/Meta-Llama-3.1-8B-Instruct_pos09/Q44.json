    "**Solar-Powered Pedal Bike**: Design a pedal bike that incorporates solar panels to generate electricity, which would power an advanced regenerative braking system. This system would capture kinetic energy and convert it into electrical energy, allowing the bike to travel longer distances while minimizing the strain on the rider.",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cell-Powered Scooter**: Develop a lightweight, high-efficiency scooter that uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity. This would provide a clean, quiet, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation for short to medium distances. The scooter could be easily transported on public transport or stored in a compact space.",
    "**Amphibious Bike**: Create a bike that can transform into a watercraft, allowing riders to travel long distances over water and land. This would be achieved through the use of advanced materials and clever design, enabling the bike to adapt to different environments and modes of transportation.",
    "**Wind-Powered Trike**: Design a trike that harnesses wind energy to generate power, which would be used to propel the vehicle forward. This would be achieved through the use of advanced aerodynamics and a sophisticated wind turbine system. The trike could be designed for long-distance travel, with the ability to carry passengers and cargo.",
    "**Geodesic Dome-Shaped Travel Pod**: Develop a geodesic dome-shaped travel pod that uses advanced materials and a compact design to provide a safe and comfortable mode of transportation. The pod could be powered by a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and regenerative braking, allowing it to travel long distances while minimizing its environmental impact. The pod could be easily transported on public transport or stored in a compact space. [/INST] "
