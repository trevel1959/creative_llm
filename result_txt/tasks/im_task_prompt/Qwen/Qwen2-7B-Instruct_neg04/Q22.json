    "**Portable Recharging Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that can be recharged using kinetic energy from walking or running. The flashlight would have a small generator inside that converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy to charge its battery. This concept could be particularly useful for people who often find themselves in situations where they might not have access to electricity.",
    "**Emergency Beacon Flashlight**: Create an emergency beacon flashlight that includes a built-in GPS system. If the flashlight is turned on during an emergency, it will automatically send out a distress signal with the user's location to rescue services. This idea can greatly enhance safety during outdoor activities or camping trips.",
    "**Waterproof and Durable Fishing Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight specifically designed for fishing enthusiasts. The flashlight would be waterproof and shock-resistant, allowing anglers to use it without fear of damage while fishing in rough waters or near underwater obstacles. It could also include features like color temperature adjustments to mimic natural light conditions for better visibility under water.",
    "**Infrared Night Vision Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that uses infrared technology to see through darkness and fog. The flashlight would emit infrared light which can penetrate darkness and fog, allowing users to see further distances compared to traditional flashlights. This innovation would be particularly beneficial for military operations, search and rescue missions, and night-time photography.",
    "**Bioluminescent Charging Flashlight**: Invent a flashlight that can charge itself by absorbing sunlight or other light sources. The flashlight would contain bioluminescent materials that convert light energy into electrical energy when exposed to light. This concept could lead to a more sustainable and eco-friendly flashlight that doesn't rely on batteries or external power sources for charging."
