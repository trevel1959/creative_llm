    "Alarm Clock: This clock would allow users to set an alarm that rings at the exact time they need to wake up, but also includes a feature that reminds them to go to bed at a specific time each night. This helps regulate their sleep cycle and ensures they get enough rest.",
    "Smart Alarm Clock: This clock would be connected to a user's smart home system, allowing them to control the alarm from their phone or tablet. It could also sync with their calendar to remind them of upcoming events or deadlines.",
    "Voice-Activated Alarm Clock: This clock would be voice-activated, allowing users to set their alarm without having to touch it. They could simply say \"Hey Assistant, set my alarm for 7 am tomorrow\" and the clock would do the rest.",
    "Multi-Room Alarm Clock: This clock would allow users to set their alarm to ring in multiple rooms, ensuring that everyone in the household wakes up at the same time. It could also be used to set different alarms for different people, such as a baby's alarm set to a different time than an adult's.",
    "Alarm Clock with Ambient Light: This clock would have an ambient light feature that gradually turns on a few minutes before the alarm goes off, simulating a sunrise and helping users wake up more naturally. It could also be programmed to sync with the user's sleep cycle and adjust the light intensity based on their needs."
