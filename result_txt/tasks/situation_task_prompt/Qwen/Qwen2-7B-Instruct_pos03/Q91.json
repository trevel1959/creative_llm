    "**Magnetic Sensory Suit**: Design a wearable suit equipped with magnetic sensors that can detect changes in its environment. The suit would contain numerous small magnets placed strategically around it. When the suit detects sudden movements or potential dangers (like an oncoming vehicle or falling objects), the magnets would align themselves in a way that causes the suit to expand or stiffen, effectively protecting the wearer from impact.",
    "**Temperature-Responsive Clothing**: Develop a type of clothing made from smart textiles that can change their physical properties based on temperature. For instance, if the temperature suddenly drops, the clothing could become more rigid to prevent frostbite or cold-related injuries. Conversely, if the temperature rises, the fabric could soften, reducing the risk of burns or heat exhaustion.",
    "**Pressure-Sensitive Gloves**: Create gloves with pressure-sensitive material that can detect when they are being squeezed too tightly. These gloves could have built-in actuators that gently vibrate or provide a mild electrical shock when the pressure reaches a dangerous level, thus preventing damage to fingers or hands.",
    "**Elasticity-Modulating Shoes**: Design shoes that can adjust their elasticity based on the terrain and the user's actions. In slippery or uneven surfaces, the shoes could become more rigid for better traction and stability. During running or jumping, they could soften to absorb shocks, reducing the risk of injury.",
    "**Chemical-Alerting Socks**: Invent socks that can detect potentially harmful chemicals in the air or ground. The socks might contain microscopic sensors that react to specific chemical compounds. Upon detection, the socks could release a substance that neutralizes the harmful chemicals, or they could inflate to cover sensitive areas like the feet, providing a protective barrier against toxic substances."
