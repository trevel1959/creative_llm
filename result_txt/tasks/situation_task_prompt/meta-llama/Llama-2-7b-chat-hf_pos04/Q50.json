These units could be equipped with educational materials, computers, and other necessary resources. This would ensure that children receive a consistent and quality education, regardless of their location.",
    "DIY Science Kits: Children could be provided with DIY science kits that they could use to conduct experiments and learn about different scientific concepts. These kits could include materials such as magnifying glasses, test tubes, and other basic science tools. Children could also conduct experiments at home with the help of their parents or guardians.",
    "Gamified Learning Apps: Educational apps could be created that make learning fun and engaging for children.
