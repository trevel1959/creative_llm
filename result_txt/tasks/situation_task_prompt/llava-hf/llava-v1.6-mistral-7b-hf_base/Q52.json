    "Raw food diet: Adapt to the no-cooking environment by focusing on raw foods instead of cooked. Opt for consuming fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, which can provide essential nutrients and a variety of flavors without needing cooking equipment.",
    "Fire cooking: In the absence of a stove and other essential cooking tools, you can still use the power of a fire to cook your meals. Create a simple open fire or use a portable fire pit, hang your food on skewers or roasting sticks, and cook it that way.",
    "Pressure cookers to the rescue: Adopting pressure cooking as a makeshift solution is another possible scenario. Utilize pressure cookers, typically used for preserving food or canning, to cook your meals. Though not as versatile as a conventional stove, you can still achieve a decent result using this method.",
    "Slow cooking: Use the slow cooker, which doesn't require direct flame for cooking, to prepare meals. Slower cooking methods like baking can still be employed if you have the necessary equipment to generate enough heat for a prolonged period.",
    "Outdoor camping techniques: Refocusing on outdoor cooking methods like campfire cooking, open flames, and portable stoves can be a versatile option. These tools are usually portable and can be used to cook food even in the absence of modern cooking equipment."
