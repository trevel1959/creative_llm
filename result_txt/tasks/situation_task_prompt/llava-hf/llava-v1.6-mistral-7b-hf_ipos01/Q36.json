    "Office Chair on Wheels: If the man has access to an office chair with wheels, he could roll it up to the desk and use it to sit. This would be a temporary solution, but it would allow him to maintain a seated position while working.",
    "Stack of Papers: The man could use a stack of papers or documents as a makeshift seat. He would need to arrange the papers in a way that provides enough support for his back and allows him to sit comfortably.",
    "Colleague's Chair: If a colleague's chair is nearby and unoccupied, the man could use it. This would be the most conventional solution, but it might require asking for permission or waiting for the colleague to return.",
    "Workstation Shelf: If there's a shelf or a high table near the desk, the man could stand on it and use it as a temporary seat. This would provide him with a different perspective while working and could be a creative solution for a short period.",
    "Lunch Table: If there's a lunch table or a break room nearby, the man could use it as a temporary seat. This would allow him to take a break from work and enjoy a meal or a drink while seated."
