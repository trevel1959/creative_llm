    "Virtual Vacuum: Create a virtual reality app that simulates the experience of using a vacuum cleaner. Users can put on a VR headset and \"clean\" their virtual space, using a virtual vacuum to pick up virtual dirt and debris. The app could also include different levels, obstacles, and challenges to keep the user engaged.",
    "Vacuum-Powered Vehicle: Design a vacuum-powered vehicle that can be used for cleaning hard-to-reach areas such as tight spaces, stairs, and upholstery. The vehicle could be a small, agile car that uses the vacuum to propel itself and pick up dirt and debris.",
    "Smart Vacuum: Create a smart vacuum cleaner that can navigate and clean an entire home on its own. The vacuum could use sensors and mapping technology to create a detailed map of the home and navigate to different rooms and areas. It could also adjust its cleaning path and intensity based on the type of surface it's cleaning.",
    "Vacuum-Powered Exercise Equipment: Design a vacuum-powered exercise equipment that provides a full-body workout while cleaning. The equipment could be a stationary bike or a rowing machine that uses the vacuum to generate resistance and provide a challenging workout. As the user pedals or rows, the vacuum would pick up dirt and debris from the surrounding area.",
    "Vacuum-Powered Art: Create a vacuum-powered art piece that uses the suction power of the vacuum to create unique and intricate designs. The art piece could be a large-scale sculpture or a series of smaller pieces that can be hung on a wall. The vacuum would be used to pick up and arrange small objects such as beads, pebbles, or even sand to create the desired design."
