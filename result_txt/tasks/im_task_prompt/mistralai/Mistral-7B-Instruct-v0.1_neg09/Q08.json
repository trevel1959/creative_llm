    "Create a smart refrigerator: The refrigerator could be equipped with a smart display that shows the current temperature, weather updates, and news updates. It could also have a built-in camera that scans the contents of the refrigerator and generates a shopping list based on the items that are running low.",
    ": The refrigerator could have an AR feature that allows users to view recipes and cooking instructions directly on the refrigerator door. Users could scan the QR code on the recipe with their smartphone and the recipe would appear on the refrigerator's display.",
    "Icebox: The refrigerator could have an icebox built-in, which would keep the ice and water frozen for easy access. The icebox could also be equipped with a water filter to ensure that the water is always clean and fresh.",
    "Self-cleaning: The refrigerator could have a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light to kill bacteria and viruses on the interior walls and shelves. This would help to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria, keeping the refrigerator clean and hygienic.",
    "Voice-activated: The refrigerator could be voice-activated, allowing users to control the temperature, open the door, and even add items to the shopping list without having to touch the refrigerator. This would be especially useful for people with disabilities or those who are busy and don't have time to manually interact with the refrigerator."
