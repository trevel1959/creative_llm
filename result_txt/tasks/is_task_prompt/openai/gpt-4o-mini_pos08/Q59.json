While the others soared high, Fluffy clung to the lower skies, dreaming of adventure but too scared to join. One sunny day, a curious bird named Breezy befriended Fluffy and challenged him to rise just a little higher. Together, they floated up, and Fluffy discovered the joy of the view above. They encountered a flock of birds, who invited Fluffy to join their games. With each little rise, Fluffy learned that heights weren’t so scary after all, but a playground of dreams.",

As they ascended, the world below shrank, revealing a breathtaking panorama. Cirrus felt exhilarated and free. He realized that heights were not to be feared but celebrated. From that day forward, Cirrus floated higher, inspiring other clouds to conquer their fears alongside him.",
