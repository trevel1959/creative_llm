    "**Sleep-Inducing Aromatherapy Systems**: In a world without night-time, people could turn to innovative aromatherapy devices that release calming scents to signal bedtime. These systems would be equipped with sensors that detect the user’s stress levels and fatigue, releasing specific blends of essential oils like lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood at optimal times. The scents would create a serene environment, helping the mind and body unwind and prepare for sleep, effectively compensating for the absence of darkness.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Soundscapes**: To combat the perpetual brightness, individuals could use wearable devices that generate personalized soundscapes designed to promote sleep. These devices would analyze the user's heart rate, breathing patterns, and even brainwave activity to create a unique audio experience. For example, the soundscape might include a blend of soft white noise, gentle rain, or ocean waves, which would help drown out distractions and create a tranquil environment, allowing for deeper sleep even in constant daylight.",
    "**Mood-Adjusting Smart Clothing**: Picture clothing embedded with smart technology that adjusts its color and texture based on the time of day and the wearer’s sleep needs. These garments would transition to darker, softer fabrics that promote relaxation as bedtime approaches. Additionally, the clothing could have built-in temperature regulation, keeping the wearer cool or warm depending on their preferences. This would create a physical cue for the body to recognize when it’s time to sleep, regardless of the external lighting conditions.",
    "**Dynamic Sleep Environment Control**: In this concept, homes would be equipped with dynamic environmental controls that can simulate night-time conditions. This would include blackout curtains that automatically close at designated sleep times, soundproofing features to block out daytime noise, and climate control systems that adjust the temperature to optimal sleeping conditions. Smart home technology would allow users to create a customized sleep environment that feels like night, encouraging a restful sleep experience despite the absence of natural darkness.",
    "**Interactive Sleep Coaching Apps**: People could utilize advanced sleep coaching apps that guide them through tailored sleep rituals. These apps would assess individual sleep patterns and provide personalized recommendations for winding down, including meditation, light stretching, or breathing exercises. They could also offer interactive features, such as virtual reality environments that simulate calming night-time scenes, helping users mentally escape the perpetual daylight and prepare for sleep."
