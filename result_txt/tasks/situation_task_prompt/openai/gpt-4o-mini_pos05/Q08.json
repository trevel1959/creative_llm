    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: Implement community-wide rainwater harvesting systems that capture and filter rainwater. Roofs can be fitted with gutters leading to storage tanks equipped with filtration systems to ensure the water is clean. This solution would require community education on maintenance and hygiene but could significantly increase local water supplies during rainy seasons.",
    "**Biomimetic Filtration**: Develop filtration systems inspired by natural processes, such as the filtration methods used by certain plants and organisms. For example, a system that mimics the structure of fish gills could effectively filter out pollutants and contaminants. These biomimetic filters could be made from biodegradable materials and scaled for use in both households and larger community setups.",
    "**Mobile Water Purification Stations**: Create mobile water purification stations that can be transported to areas in need. These stations would use advanced purification technologies such as reverse osmosis, UV light treatment, and activated carbon filtration to clean contaminated water on-site. The mobility of these stations would allow for rapid response in disaster-stricken areas or places with sudden pollution events.",
    "**Community Water Gardens**: Establish community water gardens that use a combination of aquatic plants and biofiltration techniques to purify water. These gardens would be designed to treat greywater and rainwater, filtering out contaminants while providing a habitat for local wildlife. The gardens could also serve as educational spaces to teach the community about sustainable practices and the importance of clean water.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Devices**: Design and distribute portable water purification devices that use advanced filtration and purification methods, such as ceramic filters or UV light. These devices would be small enough for individuals to carry, allowing them to purify small quantities of water from various sources. This could empower individuals to take control of their water needs, especially in emergency situations."
