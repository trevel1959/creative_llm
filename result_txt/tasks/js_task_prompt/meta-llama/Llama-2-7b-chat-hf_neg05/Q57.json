    "A Hive Mind System: This new form of government would be based on the principles of collective intelligence and consensus-building. In this system, all citizens would be connected through a network of sensors and neural implants, allowing them to share information and make decisions in real-time. Decisions would be reached through a process of iterative voting, where each person's input is weighted based on their expertise and experience. This would create a \"hive mind\" effect, where the collective intelligence of the population is far greater than any individual's.",
