    "**Creating a Sustainable Water Collection System:** One of the primary challenges of surviving on a deserted island is securing a consistent water supply. A creative solution could be constructing a rainwater collection system using large, waterproof containers like barrels or plastic tanks placed under overhanging trees or structures that naturally collect water runoff. These systems can be augmented with a filtration mechanism, such as sand or charcoal filters, to make the collected water safe for drinking.",
    "**Building a Solar-Powered Desalination Plant:** Another idea involves utilizing solar energy to desalinate seawater into fresh water. By building a simple solar still, where seawater is heated by the sun, the steam rises and condenses on a surface, leaving behind salt and allowing fresh water to collect. This can be further enhanced with a solar panel to power a small pump that could help in the collection process, especially if the island doesn't have natural wind currents.",
    "**Designing a DIY Seed Bank:** Given that the island may not have fertile soil or the right conditions for growing certain plants, creating a seed bank would ensure the availability of seeds for various plants that can grow in the environment. Using small, waterproof containers filled with compost and seeds, this seed bank can be stored in a cool, dry place (like a cave or a hollowed-out tree) and retrieved when needed. This can also include seeds for food crops, medicinal plants, and those that can improve soil quality.",
    "**Crafting a Multi-Functional Survival Tool:** A survival tool that combines several functions can significantly aid in various survival tasks. This could be a multi-tool designed with a blade, pliers, a saw, a hammer, and a bottle opener, all integrated into a compact design. The tool can also include a built-in compass, a fire starter, and a whistle for signaling. By optimizing its size and functionality, this tool can replace multiple items, making it more efficient and easier to carry.",
    "**Inventing a Portable, Self-Sustaining Farming System:** To address the need for food, a portable hydroponic farming system can be developed. This system would use a combination of water, nutrients, and light to grow plants without soil. It can be designed to fit inside a waterproof container with a transparent lid to allow sunlight in. The container could also include a small pump to circulate water and nutrients to the plants. This system would require minimal maintenance and could produce a variety of vegetables, fruits, and herbs, providing a steady source of nutrition."
