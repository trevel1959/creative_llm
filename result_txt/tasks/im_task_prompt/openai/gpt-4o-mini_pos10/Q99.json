    "**Modular Tape Dispenser**: Design a modular tape dispenser that allows users to customize it with different tape rolls. This dispenser could have interchangeable compartments for various types of tape (e.g., washi, duct, masking) and a simple locking mechanism to switch out rolls easily. Users could also add additional compartments for scissors or other office supplies.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Comfort Grip**: Create a tape dispenser with an ergonomic design that includes a comfort grip handle. This would reduce hand fatigue during prolonged use. The base could also have a weighted design to prevent it from tipping over, making it easier to use with one hand.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Tape Dispenser**: Develop a tape dispenser made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, it could come with a refillable tape cartridge system, encouraging users to buy tape refills instead of disposable dispensers. The dispenser could also feature a built-in recycling compartment for empty tape rolls.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tape Dispenser**: Combine a tape dispenser with other office tools such as a stapler, hole punch, or ruler. This all-in-one device would save space on desks and provide users with multiple tools at their fingertips. The tape dispenser could have a retractable mechanism to keep the tape protected when not in use.",
    "**Color-Changing Tape Dispenser**: Design a tape dispenser with a color-changing feature that responds to temperature or light. The dispenser could change colors based on the user's mood or the environment, adding a fun and interactive element to the office or crafting space. This could also serve as a visual indicator for different types of tape, with colors representing various functions."
