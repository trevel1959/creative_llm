    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH)**: Develop a system that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments, using a combination of nanotechnology and advanced materials. This water can be used to generate electricity through a Fuel Cell or a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis system. The electricity can then power electric vehicles, reducing the need for fossil fuels.",
    "**Bio-Electricity Harvesting**: Engineer microorganisms that can convert biomass into electricity. These microbes can be used to break down organic waste, producing bio-electricity that can power electric vehicles. This approach not only reduces waste but also provides a sustainable source of energy.",
    "**Graphene-Based Super Capacitors**: Develop high-capacity, graphene-based supercapacitors that can store electrical energy. These supercapacitors can be integrated into vehicles, allowing them to capture and store regenerative braking energy, reducing the need for traditional batteries. This technology can also enable vehicles to rapidly recharge from solar panels or other energy sources.",
    "**Quantum Dot Solar Windows**: Design solar windows that utilize quantum dots to convert sunlight into electricity. These windows can be integrated into buildings, providing a dual function of generating electricity while also serving as transparent windows. The electricity generated can be used to power electric vehicles or other devices.",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells with Algae-Based CO2 Capture**: Develop hydrogen fuel cells that use algae to capture CO2 from the atmosphere, producing oxygen and hydrogen as byproducts. The hydrogen can be used to power fuel cell electric vehicles, while the algae can be used to produce bio-oil or other valuable products. This approach not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also provides a sustainable source of energy."
