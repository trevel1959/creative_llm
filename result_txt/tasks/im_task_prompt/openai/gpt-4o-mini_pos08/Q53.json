    "**Color-Changing Notes**: Develop Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or UV light exposure. This could serve as a visual cue for deadlines (turning red as the due date approaches) or as a way to indicate urgency. Users could also write on them with special pens that react to the color change, adding an interactive and playful element to note-taking.",
    "**Interactive Sticky Notes with QR Codes**: Create Post-it Notes that come with a small QR code printed on them. When scanned, the code could link to a digital version of the note or a related resource, such as a video tutorial, a relevant article, or a checklist. This would provide a seamless transition between physical and digital note-taking, enriching the user's experience and providing additional context.",
    "**Mood-Reflective Notes**: Design Post-it Notes that have a surface that reacts to the writer's mood, using a combination of thermochromic and photochromic materials. For instance, if someone is feeling happy while writing, the note could turn a vibrant color, while a more somber mood could result in a muted tone. This would add a layer of emotional expression to note-taking, allowing users to reflect on their feelings alongside their thoughts.",
    "**Post-it Note Projector**: Develop a small, portable projector that can display the content of a Post-it Note onto any surface. This would be particularly useful for presentations or brainstorming sessions, allowing users to share their ideas without needing to transfer them to a digital format. The projector could also allow for annotations, making collaborative sessions more dynamic and engaging.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Notes**: Create a line of Post-it Notes made from a special reusable material that can be wiped clean and rewritten on multiple times. These notes could come in various sizes and colors, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. By reducing paper waste, this product would not only be practical but also align with sustainable practices."
