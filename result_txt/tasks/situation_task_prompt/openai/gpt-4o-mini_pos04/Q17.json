    "**Natural Water Filtration System**: Create a natural water filtration system using sand, gravel, and charcoal. This system would allow the community to purify local water sources. By constructing a series of filtration tanks and teaching residents how to use them, the community could ensure access to clean drinking water. Workshops on rainwater harvesting could also be conducted to maximize water availability.",
    "**Edible Urban Landscaping**: Transform public spaces into edible gardens by planting fruit trees, vegetables, and herbs. This initiative would not only provide food security but also beautify the community. Residents could be encouraged to participate in planting and maintaining these gardens, promoting cooperation and engagement. The project could also include foraging workshops to educate people on identifying and harvesting wild edible plants.",
    "**Skill-Sharing Network**: Develop a skill-sharing network where individuals can trade services based on their unique skills. For instance, someone who knows how to sew could trade their services for someone who can repair bicycles. This barter system would foster community ties and reduce reliance on external resources, ensuring that everyone's needs are met without the need for money or electricity.",
    "**Candle-Making and Natural Lighting Workshops**: Organize workshops to teach candle-making using beeswax or soy wax. Participants can learn to create their own lighting solutions, which would be crucial in a world without electricity. Additionally, workshops on creating natural lighting using materials like lanterns or reflective surfaces could help individuals adapt their homes for better visibility at night.",
    "**Firewood and Heat Management Classes**: With no electricity for heating, teaching the community how to effectively manage firewood and build efficient wood stoves or rocket stoves would be essential. Classes could cover topics like safe fire-building techniques, types of wood for different heating needs, and how to insulate homes using natural materials. This knowledge would help families stay warm and cook food efficiently."
