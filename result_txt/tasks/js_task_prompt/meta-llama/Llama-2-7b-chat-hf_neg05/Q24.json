    "Floating Gardens: The city would have numerous floating gardens that would provide a natural oasis in the midst of the urban landscape. These gardens would be designed to maximize greenery and minimize the impact on the surrounding ecosystem. The floating gardens would be held aloft by a network of pillars or platforms, allowing for easy access and maintenance.",
    "Vertical Farms: To ensure a steady supply of fresh produce, the city would feature vertical farms that would utilize hydroponics, aeroponics, or other forms of sustainable agriculture. These farms would be integrated into the city's architecture, providing a self-sustaining system that would minimize the carbon footprint of food production.",
    "Energy-Generating Infrastructure: The city would be designed to harness and utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would include the integration of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric generators into the city's infrastructure, as well as the use of energy-efficient building materials and design.",
    "Self-Sustaining Water System: The city would have a self-sustaining water system that would utilize advanced water filtration and purification technologies to recycle and reuse water. This would minimize the amount of potable water used in the city, reducing the demand on local water sources and minimizing waste.",
    "Adaptive Architecture: The city would feature adaptive architecture that would allow buildings and infrastructure to adjust to changing environmental conditions. This could include buildings that can adjust their shape, size, and orientation to maximize energy efficiency, as well as structures that can adapt to changing weather patterns to provide optimal conditions for occupants."
