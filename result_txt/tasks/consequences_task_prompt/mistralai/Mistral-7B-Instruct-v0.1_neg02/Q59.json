    "A world where everyone is a genius would be a utopia, where problems are solved quickly and efficiently. However, it could also lead to overpopulation and a lack of individuality as everyone becomes a carbon copy of each other.",
    "The education system would have to be completely overhauled to accommodate the needs of geniuses, and it's possible that some people might be left behind if they don't have the resources to keep up.",
    "The economy could be drastically changed as people with newfound intelligence would be able to create new technologies and industries that we can't even imagine yet.",
    "There would be a shift in power dynamics, as those who were previously considered \"smart\" would now be considered \"average\" or \"below average.\" This could lead to social unrest and a lack of understanding between different groups.",
    "The concept of creativity and innovation would be completely redefined as everyone would be able to think outside the box and come up with new ideas at the same time. This could lead to a world where everyone has a unique perspective and new ideas are constantly being generated."
