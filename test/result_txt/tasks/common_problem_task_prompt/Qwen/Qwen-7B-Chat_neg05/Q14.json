    "Utilize sustainable materials: Instead of using traditional building materials that contribute to environmental degradation, use eco-friendly alternatives like bamboo or recycled steel. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also make the building more resilient against natural disasters.",
    "Incorporate green spaces: Create rooftop gardens or incorporate vertical farming techniques to grow fresh produce within the building. Not only does this provide residents with access to fresh produce, but it also helps improve air quality and reduces energy consumption.",
    "Design for accessibility: Make sure the building is accessible to people with disabilities by incorporating features such as elevators, ramps, and wider doorways. This will ensure that everyone can enjoy the benefits of living in the building regardless of their physical abilities.",
    "Implement smart technology: Use sensors and other smart technologies to optimize energy usage and reduce waste. For example, automatically adjust lighting and temperature based on occupancy levels, or use rainwater harvesting systems to conserve water.",
    "Foster community engagement: Encourage residents to get involved in the building's design and operation by hosting workshops and events. This will help create a sense of ownership and pride among residents, while also promoting social interaction and community-building."
