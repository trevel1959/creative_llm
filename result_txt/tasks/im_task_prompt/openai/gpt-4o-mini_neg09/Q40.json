    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses with Biodegradable Materials**: Create sunglasses made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics or bamboo. This design not only focuses on style and functionality but also promotes sustainability. The packaging would be eco-friendly as well, encouraging consumers to choose products that are less harmful to the environment.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Develop a sunglasses model with an easy-to-use interchangeable lens system that allows users to switch between various lens colors and types (polarized, photochromic, etc.) depending on their activity or mood. This would be particularly useful for athletes who require different lenses for different sports, or for fashion-conscious individuals who want to match their sunglasses with their outfit.",
    "**Built-in UV and Blue Light Monitoring**: Incorporate a small, discreet sensor in the sunglasses that monitors UV exposure and blue light levels. Users would receive real-time feedback via a connected app about their exposure, along with tips on when to seek shade or take breaks from screens. This feature would promote eye health and awareness of harmful light exposure.",
    "**Sunglasses with Sound Integration**: Design sunglasses that come equipped with bone conduction speakers or small, discreet audio outputs. Users could listen to music, take phone calls, or access voice assistants without the need for additional headphones. This would enhance the experience of outdoor activities, allowing for both eye protection and auditory enjoyment.",
    "**Personalized Fit Technology**: Introduce a line of sunglasses that utilize 3D scanning technology to create a personalized fit for each user. By scanning the face, the sunglasses could be tailored to fit perfectly, ensuring comfort and style. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with unique facial features, reducing pressure points and enhancing overall wearability."
