    "Use natural light: Without clocks, we would have to rely on natural light to determine the time of day. We could use the position of the sun to estimate the time and plan our activities accordingly. For example, if the sun is high in the sky, we could assume it is midday and plan our activities accordingly.",
    "Use the position of the stars: We could use the position of the stars to estimate the time of day. There are many apps available that can help us identify the stars and their positions in the sky. We could use this information to plan our activities.",
    "Use the movement of animals: We could observe the movement of animals to estimate the time of day. For example, if birds are singing, we could assume it is morning, and if music is playing, we could assume it is evening.",
    "Use the position of the moon: We could use the position of the moon to estimate the time of day. The moon rises and sets at different times depending on its position in the sky. We could use this information to plan our activities.",
    "Use the position of the sun and moon: We could use the position of the sun and moon together to estimate the time of day. For example, if the sun is high in the sky and the moon is low, we could assume it is midday. If the sun is low and the moon is high, we could assume it is evening."
