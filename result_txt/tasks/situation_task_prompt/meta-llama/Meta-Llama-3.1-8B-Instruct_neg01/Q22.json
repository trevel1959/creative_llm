    "**Aerial Navigation System**: Develop a network of drones that serve as aerial taxis, allowing people to travel from one point to another within the city. These drones would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, ensuring safe and efficient transportation. To accommodate different passenger needs, there would be various drone sizes, each catering to a specific number of passengers.",
    "**Personal Propulsion Packs**: Design wearable, portable propulsion packs that enable individuals to move around the city at high speeds. These packs would utilize advanced magnetism or air-jet propulsion technology, allowing users to traverse the urban landscape with ease. The packs could be recharged wirelessly or through a portable power source.",
    "**Smart Canals and Waterways**: Revitalize the city's waterways by creating a network of interconnected canals and waterways. These would be used for both transportation and recreational purposes. Electric boats and water taxis would be the primary modes of transportation, while the canals would also feature scenic walkways and public art installations.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Transportation Pods**: Develop vacuum-sealed, spherical transportation pods that use advanced magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground. These pods would be propelled by electromagnetic forces, eliminating the need for wheels or traditional propulsion systems. They would be energy-efficient and quiet, making them an ideal mode of transportation for urban areas.",
    "**Inflatable Transportation Tunnels**: Design inflatable, transparent tubes that can be deployed throughout the city to create a network of transportation tunnels. These tubes would be made of a durable, lightweight material and would be inflated with a gas that provides buoyancy and stability. People would travel through the tubes in small, pressurized capsules, enjoying a unique and thrilling experience while being transported quickly and efficiently."
