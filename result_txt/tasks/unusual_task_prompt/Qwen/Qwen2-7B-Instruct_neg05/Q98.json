    "**Innovative Power Strip with Smart Outlets**: Create a power strip that comes equipped with smart outlets which can be controlled remotely via an app or voice commands. Each outlet could also feature a sensor to detect when devices are not in use, automatically turning them off to save energy. This would be particularly useful for people who tend to forget to unplug their electronics, leading to wasted energy.",
    "**Safety-Enhanced Power Strip with Overload Protection**: Design a power strip that includes advanced circuitry to prevent overloading. If the strip detects too much current flowing through it, it automatically cuts off the power supply to all connected devices to prevent damage from overheating. Additionally, it could include a child-proof safety switch to ensure small hands cannot easily activate it.",
    "**Travel-Friendly Multi-Outlet Power Strip with International Adapters**: For frequent travelers, create a power strip that is compact and comes with interchangeable adapters for various countries. It could have multiple outlets to accommodate different charging cables and include features like surge protection to safeguard electronic devices against voltage fluctuations.",
    "**Smart Energy Management System with Power Strip**: Integrate a power strip into a larger smart home system that allows users to monitor and manage their energy usage. The power strip could connect to a smartphone app where users can view real-time data on their power consumption, receive alerts when devices are left plugged in, and even schedule charging times for devices based on user-defined preferences.",
    "**Portable and Rechargeable Power Strip**: Develop a power strip that is rechargeable and portable, making it ideal for outdoor activities or temporary office setups. It could have a built-in battery that charges via USB-C or another fast-charging method. The power strip would feature a modular design, allowing users to remove and replace individual outlets as needed. This could be particularly beneficial for those who often find themselves working in areas without access to a reliable electrical outlet."
