    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution to ensure enough light during the day without the sun's rise is to use solar-powered lanterns. These lanterns use photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which can then power LED lights. They are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and can provide a reliable source of light during the day.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Paint: Another option is to use glow-in-the-dark paint on walls, furniture, and other surfaces. This paint absorbs light and emits it back out, providing a soft, ambient light even without the sun. This can be especially useful in areas with limited natural light.",
    "LED Light Panels: LED light panels are another option for providing light during the day without the sun. These panels are thin, lightweight, and can be easily installed on walls or ceilings. They are also energy-efficient and can be powered by a battery or a power outlet.",
    "Mirrors with Built-in LED Lights: For a more aesthetically pleasing solution, mirrors with built-in LED lights can be used. These mirrors have LED lights embedded in the frame, providing a bright and even light source without the need for direct sunlight. They can be used in bathrooms, bedrooms, or any other room where lighting is needed.",
    "Daylight Harvesting System: A more complex but innovative solution is to implement a daylight harvesting system. This system uses sensors to detect the amount of natural light available in a room and adjusts the lighting levels accordingly. It can also use artificial light sources when necessary, ensuring that the room is always well-lit without relying solely on the sun."
