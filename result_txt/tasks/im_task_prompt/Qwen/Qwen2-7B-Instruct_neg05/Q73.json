    "**Smart Keyless Entry System**: Create a smart keyless entry system that uses biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition for unlocking cars. This not only provides an extra layer of security but also makes the keychain less cumbersome. The user can simply approach their car, and the system will unlock it automatically.",
    "**GPS-Linked Car Keys**: Develop car keys that are GPS-tracked. This way, if a person misplaces their keys, they can use a smartphone app to locate them on a map. This idea can be further enhanced by incorporating a panic button that sends an alert to the owner's phone when pressed.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Car Key Rechargeable Batteries**: Design car keys with rechargeable batteries powered by kinetic energy. Every time the user opens the car door, the key vibrates slightly, which charges the battery. This reduces waste from disposable batteries and encourages eco-conscious behavior.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation in Car Keys**: Integrate augmented reality (AR) into car keys. By scanning the car's environment, the key could overlay navigation instructions directly onto the windshield, making it easier for the driver to follow routes without looking down at a separate device.",
    "**Emergency Services Alert Car Key**: Incorporate an emergency button on the car key that, when pressed, immediately contacts local emergency services with the car's GPS location. This feature can be particularly helpful in situations where the driver might be incapacitated or unable to operate their phone."
