    "**Portable Waste Composting Units**: I would invest in compact, portable waste composting units that can be placed in homes, offices, or public spaces. These units would use microorganisms to break down organic waste, reducing the need for traditional trash cans. The composted waste could then be used as fertilizer for plants or gardens. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Community Waste Hubs**: I would establish community waste hubs where residents can bring their waste and sort it into different categories (e.g., recyclables, organics, hazardous waste). These hubs would provide education and resources on proper waste management and recycling practices. The sorted waste would then be collected and processed by local recycling facilities. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Smart Waste Management Systems**: I would develop a smart waste management system that uses sensors and AI to track waste generation, collection, and processing. This system would optimize waste collection routes, reduce waste sent to landfills, and provide real-time data on waste management performance. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Zero-Waste Grocery Stores**: I would create zero-waste grocery stores that offer products in bulk, with customers bringing their own containers or using reusable bags. The stores would also have a \"zero-waste\" policy, where all packaging materials are eliminated or minimized. This would reduce the amount of waste generated by grocery shopping. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Incinerators**: I would invest in waste-to-energy incinerators that convert non-recyclable waste into electricity or heat. These incinerators would reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and generate renewable energy. However, I would ensure that the incinerators are designed with advanced pollution control systems to minimize environmental impacts. (Confidence score: 0.8)"
