    "Use natural ingredients: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to rely on natural ingredients to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could use ingredients like honey, aloe vera, lemon juice, and baking soda to clean our skin, hair, and teeth. These ingredients are not only natural but also have their own benefits for our skin and hair.",
    "DIY beauty treatments: We could try making our own beauty treatments at home. We could use essential oils, herbs, and other natural ingredients to create face masks, hair masks, and body scrubs. This would not only save us money but also give us a chance to experiment with different ingredients and create our own unique beauty products.",
    "Embrace minimalism: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to embrace minimalism in our grooming habits. We could focus on the basics like washing our face, brushing our teeth, and combing our hair. This would help us appreciate the simplicity of life and reduce our reliance on material possessions.",
    "Get creative with food: We could use food to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could use fruits and vegetables to clean our skin, hair, and teeth. For example, we could use apple cider vinegar to clean our hair and teeth, or use avocado to moisturize our skin.",
    "Learn new skills: If cosmetic products disappeared, we would have to learn new skills to maintain our personal grooming habits. We could learn how to make our own skincare products, how to cut and style our hair, and how to apply makeup. This would give us a sense of accomplishment and help us appreciate the art of grooming."
