    "**Blockchain-based Currency System**: The sudden disappearance of paper money and coins would force a rapid shift towards digital currencies. Blockchain technology could be leveraged to create a decentralized and secure payment system. Each transaction would be recorded on a public ledger, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. This system could be accessible via mobile applications, enabling users to send and receive payments instantly.",
    "**Digital Identity Verification**: To ensure transactions are only conducted by authorized individuals, a robust digital identity verification system would need to be implemented. Users would register their personal information through a trusted third party or government agency, allowing them to prove their identity securely. Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans could be used to authenticate users quickly and accurately.",
    "**Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts could be programmed into the blockchain system to automate various financial processes. These self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code would facilitate the transfer of assets upon meeting specific conditions, like the completion of a service or the fulfillment of a product order. This would eliminate the need for intermediaries in many transactions, reducing costs and speeding up the process.",
    "**Universal Basic Income (UBI) System**: With traditional forms of money disappearing, governments could implement a UBI system, providing a basic amount of income to every citizen regardless of employment status. Payments could be distributed digitally, using the same blockchain infrastructure described above. This system would help reduce poverty, stimulate the economy, and ensure everyone has access to essential resources.",
    "**Alternative Payment Tokens**: New tokens could be created to serve as alternative means of payment. These tokens could be based on different value systems, such as time spent contributing to society, skills acquired, or environmental impact. For example, a \"time token\" could represent an hour of community service, while an \"impact token\" could signify a reduction in carbon emissions. These tokens could then be traded or redeemed for goods and services, fostering a new economy based on collective effort and sustainability."
