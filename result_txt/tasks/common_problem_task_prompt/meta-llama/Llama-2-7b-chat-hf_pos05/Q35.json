    "Virtual Reality Safari: Offer visitors a chance to experience a virtual reality safari where they can explore different habitats and interact with animals from around the world without leaving the zoo. This could include a virtual tour of the savannah, a visit to the Amazon rainforest, or a chance to see polar bears in their Arctic habitat.",
    "Interactive Animal Encounters: Create interactive exhibits where visitors can get up close and personal with the animals. For example, a \"petting zoo\" where visitors can touch and feed certain animals, or an \"animal playground\" where visitors can watch animals play and interact with each other.",
    "Zoo-to-Go: Offer a \"Zoo-to-Go\" program where visitors can take a portion of the zoo home with them. This could include a \"Zoo-to-Go\" kit that includes a stuffed animal, a book about the animal, and a seedling to plant at home. This would allow visitors to learn about and connect with the animals in a more personal way.",
    "Sensory Exploration: Create a sensory-based exhibit where visitors can explore different textures, sounds, and smells of the zoo. For example, a \"Textured Tundra\" exhibit where visitors can feel different textures of snow and ice, or a \"Sensory Safari\" where visitors can smell different scents of the African savannah.",
    "Nighttime Zoo Adventures: Offer nighttime zoo adventures where visitors can explore the zoo under the stars. This could include a \"Nighttime Safari\" where visitors can see nocturnal animals in their natural habitat, or a \"Nighttime Zoo Tour\" where visitors can learn about the zoo's nocturnal animals and their habits. This would be a unique and memorable experience for visitors."
