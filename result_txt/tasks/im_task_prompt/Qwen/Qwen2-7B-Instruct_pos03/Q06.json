    "**Rainbow Umbrellas**: Create an umbrella that changes color when exposed to sunlight. The umbrella would have a special coating that reacts to light, displaying a spectrum of colors when under the sun. This not only adds a fun, vibrant touch to rainy days but also provides shade from the sun. It could also serve as a conversation starter, promoting interaction among strangers.",
    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that harnesses solar energy to charge electronic devices or power small LED lights attached to the umbrella. This innovative design includes a solar panel on the top, which can recharge a built-in battery. This way, it serves as both a practical shelter from rain and a source of clean energy.",
    "**UV Protection Umbrella**: Design an umbrella that blocks harmful UV rays while still allowing water to pass through. This is particularly useful for outdoor activities like picnics, beach visits, or gardening during sunny days. The fabric used would be made from a material that filters out UV rays but remains waterproof, providing protection without the need for sunscreen.",
    "**Smart Umbrella Navigation System**: Create an umbrella equipped with GPS technology that guides you home in case you get lost in the rain. The umbrella would connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth, showing directions and suggesting nearby shelters or places to take refuge. This idea combines safety and convenience, ensuring you always find your way back even in poor visibility.",
    "**Recycling Umbrella**: Invent an umbrella made from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles, old tires, or fishing nets. Not only does this product promote sustainability by reducing waste, but it also raises awareness about environmental issues. By making the umbrella visually striking with patterns created from these materials, it can become a symbol of eco-friendly fashion and lifestyle choices."
