    "Solar-Powered Water Purification System: Create a solar-powered water purification system that utilizes the sun's energy to filter and purify seawater, making it safe for drinking. The system could consist of a series of solar panels, a water filtration system, and a storage tank. As the sun heats up the water, the system can use the heat to power a turbine, which generates electricity to run the filtration system. This would provide a sustainable source of clean drinking water, allowing you to survive comfortably on the deserted island.",
    "Bioluminescent Fishing Nets: Design bioluminescent fishing nets that emit a blue-green light, attracting fish and other sea creatures. The nets could be made of a special material that absorbs light from the sun and emits it back out, creating a glowing effect. This would make it easier to catch fish and other seafood, providing a reliable source of food on the island.",
    "Floating Garden: Create a floating garden using a combination of hydroponics and aquaponics. The garden would be designed to float on the surface of the water, using a frame made of driftwood or other natural materials. The plants would be grown in a nutrient-rich solution, using a combination of seawater and compost. This would provide a sustainable source of fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs, allowing you to survive comfortably on the island.",
    "Deserted Island Communication System: Develop a communication system that uses a combination of solar-powered radios, mirrors, and signal fires to communicate with the outside world. The radios could be used to send and receive messages, while the mirrors could be used to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or boats. The signal fires could be used to create a smoke signal during the day or a fire at night, providing a visible signal that can be seen from a distance. This would allow you to communicate with rescuers or other people on the island, increasing your chances of being found.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Shelter: Design a shelter that harnesses energy from the sun, wind, and rain to power a variety of tools and appliances. The shelter could"
