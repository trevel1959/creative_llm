    "**Modular Laundry Basket System**: Instead of a single basket, this design features a modular system of interlocking baskets that can be separated based on categories like colors, whites, and delicates. Each module could have its own lid and be stackable for easy storage. This way, users can transport only the needed basket to the washing machine, reducing trips and making sorting easier.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Using advanced materials that incorporate antimicrobial properties, this laundry basket could actively clean itself. It would feature a built-in UV light that activates periodically or when the lid is closed to kill bacteria and odors, keeping the basket fresh and hygienic. This is particularly beneficial for households with pets or for storing sports gear.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Hamper Divider**: This basket could come with a divider that can be adjusted to create separate compartments within the basket. Users can easily customize the size of each compartment to separate items based on family members, laundry types, or washing frequency. The divider could also be removable for easy cleaning.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Foldable Design**: To save space, this laundry basket could be designed to fold flat when not in use. It would be made from durable yet lightweight materials and feature a collapsible frame that allows it to expand into a full-size basket when needed. This would be perfect for small apartments or for use in dorms where storage space is limited.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Dryer Function**: This innovative basket would not only store dirty laundry but also have a feature to dry clothes. Using a combination of low-heat air circulation and a dehumidifier, the basket could dry small items like gym clothes or socks without the need for a full dryer cycle. This would be particularly useful for those who live in apartments without a dryer."
