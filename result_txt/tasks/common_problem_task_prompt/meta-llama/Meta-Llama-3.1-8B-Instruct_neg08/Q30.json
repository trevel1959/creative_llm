    "**\"Design vs. Functionality\"**: The app's design and functionality are at odds with each other. The visually appealing design is clashing with the user experience, leading to a confusing and frustrating experience for users. This issue could be addressed by bringing together the design and development teams to discuss and align their approaches, ensuring that both aesthetics and usability are prioritized.",
    "**\"Technical Debt\"**: The development team has taken shortcuts or used workarounds to meet the project's initial deadlines, resulting in a technical debt that needs to be paid off. This could lead to a host of issues, including bugs, performance problems, and security vulnerabilities. To tackle this, the team should conduct a thorough audit of the code and implement necessary refactoring and bug fixes to ensure the app's stability and performance.",
    "**\"Stakeholder Misalignment\"**: Different stakeholders have conflicting visions for the app's purpose and target audience, leading to confusion and delays. To resolve this, the team should engage in open and transparent communication with all stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that the app's development aligns with the shared vision.",
    "**\"Lack of Testing\"**: The app has been released without adequate testing, leading to a plethora of bugs and issues that are only discovered after launch. To prevent this, the team should prioritize thorough testing and quality assurance, including user acceptance testing, performance testing, and security testing, to ensure that the app is stable and meets user expectations.",
    "**\"Scalability Issues\"**: The app is designed to handle a small user base but fails to scale when the user base grows. This could lead to performance issues, crashes, and a poor user experience. To address this, the team should design the app with scalability in mind, using cloud-based services, load balancing, and caching to ensure that the app can handle increased traffic and user growth."
