    "**Terrarium**: Convert a vase into a mini-ecosystem by creating a terrarium. Layer pebbles, activated charcoal, soil, and small plants like succulents or air plants inside the vase. This not only beautifies your space but also brings a bit of nature indoors. The closed environment of a vase can create a self-sustaining habitat for the plants.",
    "**Candle Holder**: Use a vase as an unconventional candle holder. Place a pillar candle in the center or fill the vase with sand or pebbles to hold tealight candles. This creates a beautiful centerpiece for dinner parties or a cozy ambiance for evenings at home, with the glass reflecting light in interesting ways.",
    "**Wine Chiller**: An oversized vase can double as a stylish wine chiller. Fill it with ice and place your favorite bottle of wine or champagne inside. The vaseâ€™s elegant design can enhance your table setting, and it keeps the drinks cold while adding a decorative element to your gathering.",
    "**Bird Feeder**: Repurpose a vase into a bird feeder. Fill it with birdseed and attach it upside down to a sturdy branch or a post. The wide opening allows birds to access the seeds easily. This not only attracts beautiful birds to your garden but also provides a unique decorative touch.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: Use a vase as a natural scent diffuser. Fill it with water and add essential oils, then place bamboo skewers or reed sticks inside. The reeds will absorb the oil and disperse the fragrance throughout the room. This can be a beautiful way to keep your space smelling fresh and inviting."
