    "**UV-Blocking Canopy**: Instead of just providing shelter from rain, this umbrella would incorporate a special fabric that blocks harmful UV rays. This would make it a dual-purpose item, protecting users from both rain and sun exposure. The fabric could also be designed to change color when UV levels are high, providing a visual cue for sun safety.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Canopy**: Utilizing nanotechnology, this umbrella could have a self-cleaning surface that repels dirt and water. When the umbrella is closed, a built-in mechanism could activate to clean the surface using a gentle spray of water and a UV light to kill bacteria. This would keep the umbrella clean and hygienic, reducing maintenance for the user.",
    "**Collapsible and Expandable Design**: This innovative umbrella would feature a flexible frame that allows it to expand or collapse in size depending on the weather conditions. On sunny days, it could be used as a smaller sunshade, while on rainy days, it could expand to a larger size for maximum coverage. This adaptability would enhance its versatility.",
    "**Integrated Lighting and Sound System**: The umbrella could come with LED lights embedded in the ribs for visibility during nighttime use. Additionally, it could feature a Bluetooth speaker that allows users to play music or take calls while sheltered from the rain. The lights could also change color based on the weather or mood settings.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Charging Capability**: The handle of the umbrella could be designed to be ergonomic, reducing strain during use. It could also incorporate a solar charging panel that powers a small battery, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. This feature would be particularly useful during outdoor events or in emergency situations."
