    "Resource constraints: Organizing a charity event requires a significant amount of time, money, and logistical effort. If organizers underestimate the resources needed for the event, they may find themselves struggling to keep up with the numerous tasks involved in event planning and execution.",
    "Permits and regulations: Depending on the nature and location of the event, organizers may face restrictions on the permits required and the need to comply with various local, state, or federal regulations. This can add increased complexity to the planning process and increase the risk of potential fines or other penalties.",
    "Venue availability: Finding an appropriate venue that meets the event's needs, such as space, accessibility, and affordability, can be challenging when demand is high. Organizers might have to book venues well in advance and be prepared to compromise on their preferred date or location.",
    "Marketing and promotion: To ensure a successful event, organizers need to effectively promote the event to potential attendees, sponsors, and donors. Without a comprehensive marketing strategy, the event may not generate enough awareness, resulting in poor attendance and a disappointing turnout.",
    "Weather: Outdoor events can be heavily impacted by weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or extreme temperatures. Poor weather may result in a decrease in attendance, increased costs for contingencies, or even the cancellation of the event in severe circumstances."
