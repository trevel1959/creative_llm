    "AI-Powered Smart Iron: Develop an iron that uses artificial intelligence to optimize the ironing process. The iron could be equipped with sensors that detect the type of fabric being ironed and adjust the heat and pressure accordingly. The iron could also have a built-in AI assistant that guides the user through the ironing process, providing tips and tricks to achieve the best results.",
    "Iron with Built-In Steamer: Create an iron that combines the functions of an iron and a steamer. The iron could have a detachable water tank and a steam function that can be activated by a button or a voice command. This would allow users to quickly switch between ironing and steaming, making the process more efficient and convenient.",
    "Automatic Ironing System: Develop an automatic ironing system that uses robotics and AI to sort, iron, and fold clothes. The system could consist of a robotic arm that picks up clothes from a basket or drawer, irons them, and then folds them and places them back in the basket or drawer. This would save users time and effort, and ensure that clothes are ironed to perfection every time.",
    "Smart Iron with Customizable Temperature Profiles: Create an iron with customizable temperature profiles that can be set and controlled through a smartphone app. Users could program their preferred temperature settings for different types of fabrics, and the iron would automatically adjust the heat and pressure accordingly. This would ensure that clothes are ironed to the user's preferred texture and wrinkle removal.",
    "Portable Iron with Built-In Power Bank: Develop a portable iron with a built-in power bank that can charge other devices, such as smartphones or tablets, while in use. This would make the iron a convenient and practical accessory for travel or for use in areas without access to a power outlet. The iron could also have a detachable cord that can be used as a standard iron cord, making it easy to use and store."
