    ": is a vacuum cleaner that uses a unique technology called \"Pyrolysis\" to remove dust, dirt, and allergens from carpets and floors. Pyrolysis is a process that uses heat to break down organic materials into smaller particles, making it easier for the vacuum cleaner to suction them up. This technology is particularly useful for people with allergies or asthma, as it effectively removes allergens without using harsh chemicals.",
    ": is a vacuum cleaner that uses a combination of suction power and a unique brush roll design to clean hard floors and carpets.
