This could lead to the development of advanced technologies specifically designed to enhance the music creation process, such as AI-driven music composition tools.",
    "**Cultural Preservation**: Music could serve as a powerful tool for preserving cultural heritage and traditions. Every culture's unique musical expressions would become central to its identity, helping to keep ancient stories, folklore, and customs alive through the generations. This could foster a deeper appreciation for cultural diversity and encourage international collaborations that celebrate and preserve various musical traditions globally."
