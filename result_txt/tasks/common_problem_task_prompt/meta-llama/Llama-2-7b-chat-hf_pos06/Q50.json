    "Vertical Forest City: Build a series of interconnected skyscrapers covered in lush greenery, mimicking the structure of a forest. Each tower would be designed to maximize natural light and airflow, with built-in hydroponic gardens and rainwater harvesting systems. This innovative design would provide a self-sustaining ecosystem within the city, reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Eco-Friendly Floating Islands: Create a series of floating islands in the ocean or large bodies of water, designed to house a sustainable community. These islands would be made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic and biodegradable materials, and would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The islands would also feature organic farming systems and waste management systems, ensuring a closed-loop ecosystem. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Solar Powered Desert Oasis: Build a sustainable community in the middle of a desert, powered entirely by solar energy. The community would feature a series of interconnected buildings, each designed to maximize natural light and airflow, with built-in solar panels and water harvesting systems. The community would also feature a series of greenhouses, where plants and vegetables would be grown using hydroponic methods, providing a sustainable source of food. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Bioluminescent City: Create a city that incorporates bioluminescent technology into its design, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly lighting solution. The city would feature buildings and streets that are covered in bioluminescent panels, which would harness the energy of the sun and convert it into light, reducing the need for traditional lighting sources. This would not only reduce energy consumption but also provide a unique and visually striking atmosphere. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Climate-Controlled Biosphere: Build a sustainable community that is completely self-sufficient, featuring a climate-controlled biosphere that mimics the conditions of a tropical rainforest. The community would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and would feature a series of"
