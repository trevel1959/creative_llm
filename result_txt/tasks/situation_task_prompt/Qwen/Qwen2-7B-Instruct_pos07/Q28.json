    "**Inkless Writing**: Invent a device that uses a laser or other non-contact method to write on a special surface. This surface could be a clear plastic film or a glass pane, which can then be stored or transported without the risk of damage. The information can later be read by shining light through it or using a specific type of scanner. This system would allow for the recording of text, diagrams, and even digital information.",
    "**Sound Recording**: Record information as sound waves and store them on durable media such as metal or ceramic discs. These could be played back using specialized machinery that converts the vibrations back into readable text or audio. This method would be particularly useful for historical documents, recipes, or instructions that need to be passed down over generations.",
    "**Binary Code etching**: Use a high-precision laser or etching tool to inscribe binary code into various materials like metals, stones, or plastics. Each bit of data would be represented by a tiny dot or line. This would require an advanced system for reading and decoding the information but could potentially last for centuries.",
    "**Magnetic Ink**: Develop a type of ink that contains magnetic particles. Write messages onto a metal sheet using this ink, then use a magnet or magnetic reader to transfer the information onto a storage medium like a hard drive or a special type of magnetic tape. This method would allow for digital data to be stored and retrieved in a paperless environment.",
    "**Biological Memory**: Engineer a system where genetic material (DNA) is used to encode information. Cells could be created that contain specific sequences representing data. This method would be incredibly durable but also extremely complex and challenging to decode without the right technology. It would essentially be a form of biological data storage, with potential applications in medical records, historical archives, and secure data storage."
