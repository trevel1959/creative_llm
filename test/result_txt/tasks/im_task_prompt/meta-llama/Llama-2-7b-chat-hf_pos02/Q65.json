    "Smart Kettle with AI-Powered Temperature Control: Create an electric kettle that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically adjust the temperature of the water to the ideal brewing temperature for various types of tea or coffee. This kettle would use sensors to detect the type of beverage being brewed and adjust the temperature accordingly. This would ensure the perfect brewing temperature every time, eliminating the need for manual temperature adjustments.",
    "Wireless Charging Electric Kettle: Design an electric kettle that incorporates wireless charging technology, allowing users to simply place their kettle on a charging pad to power it up. This would eliminate the need for cords and make the kettle more convenient to use, especially in small kitchens or offices. Additionally, the kettle could have a built-in timer to automatically turn off the kettle when the water reaches the desired temperature.",
    "Color-Changing Electric Kettle: Create an electric kettle that changes color based on the temperature of the water inside. This would add a fun and visually appealing element to the kettle, making it a unique and stylish addition to any kitchen. The color-changing effect could be achieved through the use of thermochromic materials, which change color based on temperature changes.",
    "Voice-Controlled Electric Kettle: Design an electric kettle that can be controlled using voice commands, allowing users to easily and conveniently make their favorite hot beverages without having to physically interact with the kettle. This would be especially useful for people with disabilities or those who are busy and need to multitask while making their coffee or tea. The kettle could be integrated with popular virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing users to simply say \"Hey Alexa, brew me a cup of coffee\" to get their desired beverage.",
    "Portable Electric Kettle with Built-in Battery: Create an electric kettle that is portable and has a built-in rechargeable battery, allowing users to take their kettle with them on the go. This would be especially useful for people who enjoy camping or traveling, as they could now easily make hot beverages without needing access to a power outlet"
