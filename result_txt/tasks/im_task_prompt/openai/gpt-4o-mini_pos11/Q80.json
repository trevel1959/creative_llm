    "**Ergonomic Handle with Vibration Feedback**: The handle of the whisk could be designed with ergonomic contours for better grip and comfort during prolonged use. Additionally, it could incorporate vibration feedback technology that provides gentle vibrations when the whisk reaches optimal mixing speed or consistency, helping users know when they have achieved the desired texture without having to constantly check.",
    "**Interchangeable Whisk Heads**: This design would allow users to switch out different whisk heads for various tasks. For example, a balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for sauces, and a spiral whisk for emulsifying. Each head could be made from different materials (silicone, stainless steel, etc.) to cater to different cooking needs, and the handle could have a locking mechanism to securely attach and detach the heads.",
    "**Whisk with Integrated Scraper**: This whisk would feature a flexible silicone scraper along the side of the whisk, allowing users to scrape down the sides of the bowl while whisking. This would eliminate the need for a separate spatula and ensure that all ingredients are thoroughly combined, making it especially useful for thick batters and sauces.",
    "**Self-Whisking Mechanism**: This innovative whisk would have a built-in motor that allows it to whisk automatically at different speeds. Users could set the speed and duration, allowing for hands-free operation. It would be perfect for multitasking in the kitchen, letting users prepare other ingredients while the whisk does the work.",
    "**Whisk with Detachable Storage Compartment**: The handle of the whisk could be designed to open up, revealing a small storage compartment. This could be used to hold dry ingredients like sugar or spices that are often added during whisking. This would keep everything in one place and allow for quick access while cooking, reducing the need for multiple bowls or containers."
