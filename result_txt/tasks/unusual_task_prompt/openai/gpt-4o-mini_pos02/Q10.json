    "**Emergency Hairpin**: In a pinch, a pen can serve as an emergency hairpin. If you're out and need to secure your hair, you can use the pen to hold it in place. Simply twist your hair into a bun or ponytail and insert the pen horizontally through the hair to keep it secure. This works particularly well for quick fixes when you’re on the go.",
    "**Portable Phone Stand**: By removing the ink cartridge from a pen and bending the pen body into a slight curve, you can create a makeshift phone stand. This allows you to prop up your smartphone for hands-free viewing of videos or video calls, making it a handy tool when you don’t have a stand available.",
    "**Interactive Pet Toy**: If you have a pet, especially a cat, a pen can be transformed into a toy. You can tie a piece of string or yarn to the pen and dangle it for your pet to chase. The pen’s lightweight body makes it easy to flick and move around, enticing your pet to play and engage in exercise.",
    "**Emergency Bookmark**: If you’re in the middle of reading a book and need to leave quickly, a pen can serve as a temporary bookmark. Simply place the pen between the pages to mark your spot. It’s especially useful for those who tend to misplace traditional bookmarks or want to keep their place without damaging the book.",
    "**Personalized Gift Tag**: You can repurpose an old pen by using it to create personalized gift tags. Take a piece of cardstock, cut it into desired shapes, and use the pen to write messages, draw designs, or even doodle. Attach these tags to gifts to add a personal touch, making your presents stand out during special occasions."
