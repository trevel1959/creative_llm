    "\"ar-based virtual reality training program\": This idea involves creating an augmented reality (AR) based virtual reality training program. AR technology allows users to interact with virtual objects in their real-world environment, providing a more immersive and practical training experience. For example, a medical student could use an AR-based virtual reality program to practice surgeries on a virtual patient, while a construction worker could use it to practice assembling complex structures.",
    "\"gamified virtual reality training program\": This idea involves creating a virtual reality training program that incorporates game-like elements to make the learning experience more engaging and fun. For example, a salesperson could use a virtual reality training program to practice delivering presentations in a virtual conference room, with the program providing feedback on their performance and allowing them to earn points or badges for completing various tasks.",
    "\"v-based virtual reality training program\": This idea involves creating an avatar-based virtual reality training program. In this program, users create a virtual avatar that represents them in the virtual world, allowing them to interact with virtual objects and environments in a more personalized way. For example, a customer service representative could use an avatar-based virtual reality training program to practice handling customer complaints in a virtual store.",
    "\"social virtual reality training program\": This idea involves creating a virtual reality training program that allows users to interact with other users in a virtual environment. For example, a language learner could use a social virtual reality training program to practice speaking with native speakers from around the world, while a team leader could use it to practice managing virtual teams.",
    "\"-based virtual reality training program\": This idea involves creating an avatar-based virtual reality training program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide personalized feedback and guidance to users. For example, a salesperson could use an AI-based virtual reality training program to practice delivering presentations, with the program providing feedback on their performance and suggesting areas for improvement based on their personality and communication style."
