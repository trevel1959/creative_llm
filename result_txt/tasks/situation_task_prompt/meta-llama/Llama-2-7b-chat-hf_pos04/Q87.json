    "Tungsten-coated wire cutters: These cutters would be made of a special type of wire with a tungsten coating, which is extremely hard and durable. The wire would be flexible enough to bend and manipulate, allowing for precise cuts. The tungsten coating would provide the necessary cutting edge, making it effective for cutting through various materials such as paper, fabric, and even some metals.",
    "Laser-based cutting tool: In a world without scissors or knives, a laser-based cutting tool could be developed. This tool would use a high-powered laser to cut through materials with precision and accuracy. The laser could be adjusted to cut through different materials, such as paper, fabric, and even some metals. The tool could also be used for precision cutting tasks such as cutting intricate shapes or designs.",
    "Electromagnetic cutter: An electromagnetic cutter would use magnetic fields to cut through materials. The cutter would consist of a magnetic coil that generates a powerful magnetic field, which would be used to attract and cut through materials. This cutter would be particularly useful for cutting through metals and other magnetic materials, as it would not require any physical contact or pressure.",
    "Plasma cutter: A plasma cutter would use a high-temperature plasma arc to cut through materials. The plasma arc would be generated by ionizing a gas, such as air or nitrogen, and then accelerating the ions through an electromagnetic field. The resulting plasma arc would be incredibly hot, reaching temperatures of up to 30,000 degrees Celsius. This would make it capable of cutting through almost any material, including metal, glass, and stone.",
    "Sonic cutter: A sonic cutter would use high-frequency sound waves to cut through materials. The cutter would generate ultrasonic vibrations, which would be used to cut through materials such as metal, plastic, and even some metals. The sonic cutter would be particularly useful for cutting small, intricate shapes or designs, as it would provide a high degree of precision and accuracy. It could also be used for cutting through hard-to-reach areas, such as inside pipes or small crevices."
