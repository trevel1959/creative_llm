    "**Multi-Function Nozzle**: Design a watering can with an adjustable nozzle that allows users to switch between different watering modes, such as a gentle mist for seedlings, a steady stream for larger plants, and a concentrated jet for cleaning leaves. This versatility would make it suitable for various gardening tasks without needing multiple tools.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**: Create a watering can with an ergonomic handle that molds to the user's hand for better grip and comfort. The design could include textured surfaces or soft-touch materials that prevent slipping, making it easier to carry and pour, especially when filled with water.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration System**: Equip the watering can with a simple, replaceable water filtration system that removes impurities from tap water. This would be especially beneficial for indoor plants sensitive to chemicals found in municipal water supplies, ensuring they receive cleaner, healthier water.",
    "**Collapsible Watering Can**: Develop a collapsible watering can made from flexible materials that can be easily stored when not in use. This would be ideal for urban gardeners with limited space, allowing them to save room while still having a functional watering can available when needed.",
    "**Integrated Plant Care Tracker**: Incorporate a small digital display on the watering can that tracks the watering schedule and plant care tips. Users can input their plants' needs, and the can will remind them when to water, fertilize, or check for pests, making it a handy gardening assistant."
