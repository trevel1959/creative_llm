    "Society would become even more competitive: If everyone became a genius overnight, the level of competition in society would skyrocket. People would feel pressure to constantly outdo one another, leading to a never-ending cycle of one-upmanship. This could result in a toxic environment where people are more focused on proving their superiority than on collaborating and working together.",
    "Expertise would lose its value: With everyone suddenly possessing exceptional intelligence and skills, the value of expertise would diminish. People would no longer place as much weight on the knowledge and experience of specialists, as they could learn everything they need to know overnight. This could lead to a lack of respect for those who have spent years honing their craft, and a loss of appreciation for the depth of knowledge that comes from years of dedication and hard work.",
    "Innovation would slow: While having a population of geniuses might seem like a dream come true, it could actually stifle innovation. With everyone already at the top of their game, there would be less room for growth and progress. Innovation often comes from pushing boundaries and exploring new territory, but if everyone is already a genius, there would be less need to challenge the status quo. This could lead to a stagnation of ideas and a lack of new discoveries.",
    "Mental health could suffer: Suddenly having access to all the knowledge and skills in the world could be overwhelming, leading to anxiety and stress. People might feel like they are drowning in information, unable to process it all. Additionally, the pressure to constantly perform at an exceptional level could lead to burnout and depression. The constant need to prove oneself could become a source of immense mental strain.",
    "The concept of intelligence would need to be redefined: If everyone became a genius overnight, our understanding of intelligence would need to be reevaluated. Intelligence is often defined by cognitive abilities, but what if those abilities could be acquired overnight? Would we need to redefine what it means to be intelligent? Would it be more about creativity, emotional intelligence, or something else entirely? This shift in understanding could lead to new ways of thinking about intelligence and how it is measured."
