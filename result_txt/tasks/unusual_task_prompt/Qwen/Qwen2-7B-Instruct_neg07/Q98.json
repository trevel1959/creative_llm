    "**Smart Power Strip for Energy Efficiency**: Design a power strip that not only distributes electricity to various devices but also monitors and regulates energy consumption. The strip can have sensors that detect when devices are not in use and automatically turn them off or reduce their power usage to save energy. This could be particularly useful for communal spaces like offices or classrooms where devices might be left on unnecessarily.",
    "**Automated Power Strip for Smart Home Integration**: Create an advanced power strip that integrates with home automation systems. It would allow you to control the power to connected devices via voice commands, apps, or even through a simple interface. This could include features like setting schedules for device usage, automatically turning off devices when not in use, and integrating with other smart home components like lighting or thermostats.",
    "**Power Strip with USB Charging Ports and Built-in Battery**: Develop a power strip that includes built-in USB charging ports and a rechargeable battery. This would enable users to charge their devices even when there is no available outlet. The battery could be charged using any standard outlet or solar-powered charging methods, making it a versatile solution for outdoor events, travel, or emergency situations.",
    "**Power Strip with Surge Protection and Wi-Fi Booster**: Combine the functions of a power strip, surge protector, and Wi-Fi signal booster into one device. The surge protection would safeguard connected devices from power surges, while the Wi-Fi booster would enhance the strength of your home network, improving connectivity for devices that rely heavily on Wi-Fi. This would be ideal for homes with multiple electronic devices that require stable power and reliable internet access.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip**: Incorporate wireless charging technology into a power strip, allowing users to charge their smartphones and other compatible devices without needing cables. The strip could feature wireless charging pads at specific outlets, ensuring that devices can be charged conveniently without cluttering surfaces with wires. This would be particularly appealing for tech-savvy consumers looking for a modern, minimalist solution for managing their electronic devices."
