    "Transformative Vehicle: A transformative vehicle is a vehicle that can change its shape, size, or form depending on the situation. For example, it could transform into a boat, a plane, or a car. This would allow for more efficient and versatile transportation. It could be powered by a combination of electricity and hydraulics.",
    "Hyperloop: A hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to transport passengers and cargo. It would travel through a series of tubes at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. This would allow for fast and efficient transportation over long distances.",
    "Skytrain: A skytrain is a high-speed transportation system that uses electric propulsion to move passengers and cargo through the air. It would be powered by a combination of solar and wind energy. This would allow for fast and efficient transportation over long distances without the need for fossil fuels.",
    "Maglev Train: A maglev train is a high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to move passengers and cargo through the air. It would be powered by a combination of electricity and magnetic fields. This would allow for fast and efficient transportation over long distances without the need for fossil fuels.",
    "Flying Car: A flying car is a vehicle that can take off and land vertically, as well as travel on roads. It would be powered by a combination of electricity and gasoline. This would allow for fast and efficient transportation over short distances, as well as the ability to take off and land vertically."
