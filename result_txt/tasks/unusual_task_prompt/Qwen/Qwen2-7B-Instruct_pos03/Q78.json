The vibrations could amplify certain aromas or help balance flavors, providing a more immersive sensory experience for the drinker.",
    "**Wine Glass as a Social Media Tool**: Create a wine glass that doubles as a QR code reader. When scanned, it can display information about the specific wine, its history, or even a video tutorial on how to properly taste and appreciate the wine. This not only educates consumers but also creates an interactive experience between the product and the user.",
    "**Personalized Wine Glass Engraving Service**: Offer a service where customers can order custom engraved wine glasses. They can personalize their glasses with names, dates, or special messages, turning each glass into a unique piece of art. This could be particularly appealing for weddings, corporate events, or gift-giving occasions.",
    "**Sustainable Wine Glass**: Develop a wine glass made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled glass or biodegradable plastics. The glass could also come with a built-in filter that removes sediment from the wine, ensuring a cleaner drinking experience while promoting sustainability.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Wine Glass**: Integrate a small heating element into the base of the glass that allows users to adjust the temperature of their wine. This could be particularly useful for serving red wines at their optimal drinking temperature. The glass could connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to pre-set temperatures and monitor the glass's internal temperature remotely. "
