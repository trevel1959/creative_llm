    "**Seedling Starter**: Repurpose cereal boxes as biodegradable seedling starters for your garden. Cut the box into sections and fill them with soil. Plant seeds in each section, and when itâ€™s time to transplant, you can plant the entire section in the ground. The cardboard will decompose, enriching the soil while providing a sustainable planting solution.",
