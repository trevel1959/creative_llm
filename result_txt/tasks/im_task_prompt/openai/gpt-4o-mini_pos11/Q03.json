    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Introduce a variety of cooking modes beyond just heating, such as sous-vide, air frying, and dehydrating. This would allow the microwave to serve as a versatile kitchen appliance, enabling users to prepare a wider range of dishes without needing additional equipment. For example, a sous-vide mode could maintain precise water temperatures for perfect cooking.",
    "**Built-in Food Scanner**: Implement a built-in scanner that can analyze the food being placed inside the microwave. Using computer vision technology, it could identify the type of food, its weight, and its recommended cooking time. This feature would eliminate guesswork, ensuring food is cooked perfectly every time.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning feature using steam or UV light. After each use, the microwave could initiate a cleaning cycle that sanitizes the interior, removing food particles and odors. This would save time and effort for users, ensuring a hygienic cooking environment without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Database**: Create an interactive recipe database that connects to the microwave via Wi-Fi. Users could browse recipes from their smartphones or tablets and send cooking instructions directly to the microwave. The microwave would automatically adjust cooking times and power levels based on the selected recipe, simplifying meal preparation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Mode**: Design an energy-efficient mode that uses less power during standby and cooking. This mode could include features like an energy-saving timer that turns the microwave off when not in use for a certain period or a low-power setting for reheating foods. Additionally, the microwave could provide users with feedback on energy consumption, encouraging more sustainable cooking habits."
