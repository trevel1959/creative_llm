    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Instead of just tossing a tennis ball for your dog, you can create a treat-dispensing toy. Cut a small slit in the ball and fill it with your pet’s favorite treats. As your dog plays with the ball, treats will slowly fall out, providing mental stimulation and encouraging them to play longer.",
    "**Wrist Support for Lifting**: For those who lift weights or perform repetitive wrist motions, a tennis ball can be used to create a simple wrist support. Cut the ball in half and place it under your wrist while lifting. This provides additional cushioning and support, reducing strain on the wrist during workouts.",
    "**DIY Doorstop**: A tennis ball can be transformed into a quirky doorstop. Simply cut a small slit in the ball and insert a small weight or sand to give it stability. Then, place it at the bottom of a door. Not only does it keep the door open, but it also adds a fun and colorful touch to your home decor.",
    "**Garden Plant Protector**: Use a tennis ball to protect delicate seedlings in your garden from harsh weather or animals. Cut a tennis ball in half and place it over young plants to shield them from wind, frost, or foraging animals. This creates a mini greenhouse effect while allowing sunlight to reach the plants.",
    "**Shoe Freshener**: Tennis balls can help eliminate odors in shoes. Place a couple of tennis balls inside your shoes when you’re not wearing them. The balls will absorb moisture and odors, keeping your footwear smelling fresh. This is particularly useful for athletic shoes that can develop unpleasant smells after workouts."
