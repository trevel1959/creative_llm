    "**Eco-Adventure Tour**: Design a guided bicycle tour that takes participants through a lush, tropical forest, but with a twist. The tour will be powered by a combination of pedal power and a cutting-edge, bio-inspired propulsion system that mimics the way certain insects fly. This system, called \"Aerius,\" uses tiny, rotating wings to generate lift and thrust, allowing riders to cover longer distances with less effort. The tour will include stops at unique, sustainable ecosystems and interactive exhibits showcasing the latest advancements in eco-friendly technology.",

    "**Urban Agriculture Bike**: Design a hybrid bicycle that combines the benefits of cycling with the productivity of urban agriculture. The \"GreenCycle\" features a built-in, aeroponic garden that allows riders to grow their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs while commuting. The system uses a combination of LED lighting, hydroponics, and advanced climate control to optimize plant growth, even in urban environments with limited space. The GreenCycle will be marketed as a sustainable solution for urban dwellers, promoting local food production and community engagement.",
    "**Cycling-Themed Escape Room**: Create an immersive, cycling-themed escape room that challenges participants to solve puzzles and mysteries while navigating a simulated cycling course.
