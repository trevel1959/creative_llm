    "A Holographic Computer Mouse: Imagine a computer mouse that projects a holographic image of a cursor, allowing users to interact with their digital world in a more immersive and engaging way. This mouse would use advanced holographic technology to create a 3D image of a cursor that can be manipulated by the user's hand movements. The cursor could be customized with different shapes, sizes, and colors to suit individual preferences.",
    "A Smart Computer Mouse with Integrated Gesture Recognition: This mouse would be equipped with advanced gesture recognition technology, allowing users to control their computer with simple hand gestures. The mouse would be able to detect and interpret various hand movements, such as waving, pointing, or drawing shapes, and translate them into specific commands or actions.",
    "A Computer Mouse with Built-in Biometric Sensors: This mouse would be equipped with advanced biometric sensors that can track the user's heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs in real-time. The mouse would use this data to provide personalized feedback and recommendations to the user, such as suggesting exercise routines or stress-reducing activities based on their physiological responses.",
    "A Computer Mouse with Integrated Projector and Screen: This mouse would be equipped with a built-in projector and screen, allowing users to project images and videos directly onto their computer screen or other surfaces. The mouse would use advanced image processing technology to optimize the projection for the specific surface and environment, ensuring clear and crisp visuals.",
