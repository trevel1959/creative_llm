    "Solar panels: Although solar panels rely on electricity to charge, they can still be used to generate power from sunlight even if the batteries stop working. They could be used to charge new batteries or power devices directly.",
    "Hydroelectric power: If there are nearby water sources, hydroelectric power plants could be used to generate electricity. This would require the construction of new power plants, but it could be a long-term solution.",
    "Geothermal power: Geothermal power plants use heat from the Earth to generate electricity. This could be a reliable source of power even if batteries stop working.",
    "Wind power: Wind turbines could be used to generate electricity. This would require the construction of new wind farms, but it could be a long-term solution.",
    "Nuclear power: Nuclear power plants use nuclear reactions to generate electricity. This could be a reliable source of power even if batteries stop working, but it requires significant investment in infrastructure."
