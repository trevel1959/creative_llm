    "Virtual Reality Playing Cards: Create a deck of playing cards that utilizes virtual reality technology. Each card will have a unique QR code that, when scanned with a VR headset, transports the player to a virtual world where they can interact with the card's theme. For example, a \"7 of Diamonds\" card could transport the player to a glittering diamond mine, while a \"King of Hearts\" card could take them to a fantastical kingdom. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Smartphone App Playing Cards: Develop a mobile app that uses augmented reality technology to bring playing cards to life. Users can scan the cards with their smartphone camera, and the app will superimpose the card's image onto the real world. The app can also include interactive games and challenges, such as a \"card duel\" where users can compete against each other. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Interactive Playing Card Deck: Create a deck of playing cards with hidden sensors that detect when a card is drawn and trigger a corresponding sound or animation. For example, when a player draws the \"Ace of Spades,\" a robotic voice could say \"Ace of Spades!\" and a flashing light could illuminate the card. The deck can also include special \"power-up\" cards that give players bonus points or abilities. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Playing Card Art Installation: Design an immersive art installation that incorporates playing cards as the primary medium. The installation could feature large-scale playing card sculptures, interactive light installations, and even a \"card forest\" where visitors can walk among towering card trees. The installation can also include a soundtrack of card-themed music and sound effects. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Playing Card Video Game: Develop a video game that uses playing cards as the primary gameplay mechanic. Players can collect and trade cards, use them to build decks, and engage in turn-based combat with other players. The game can also include a variety of mini-games and challenges, such as a \"card-matching\" mini-game where players must match cards of the same suit or rank. Confidence score: 0.8"
