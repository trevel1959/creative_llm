    "**Digital Ink**: In this scenario, individuals would use electronic devices to create digital signatures or notes, mimicking the traditional process of signing documents on paper. These signatures could be stored in cloud-based databases or encrypted personal servers. This idea relies on the widespread adoption of digital signature technology and strong cybersecurity measures.",
    "**Memory Chips**: Instead of writing or printing, people would use small memory chips that can be inserted into devices like smartphones or computers. This would allow them to store vast amounts of data without physical limitations. These chips would be reusable and possibly biodegradable.",
    "**Light Writing**: Utilizing light-sensitive materials, people could write messages in air using lasers or other light sources. This could be displayed on screens or projected onto surfaces. It requires advanced technology and a suitable environment, but it could offer unique possibilities for public displays and interactive communications.",
    "**Molecular Recording**: Scientists could develop methods to encode information at the molecular level, similar to how DNA stores genetic information. This would allow for the storage of large amounts of data in very small spaces, potentially within existing infrastructure like buildings or even in nature.",
    "**Sound Waves**: Messages could be encoded into sound waves that are transmitted through the air or recorded onto physical media like CDs or vinyl. Listeners would need appropriate equipment to decode the messages. This idea is less secure than digital alternatives but could still be effective for certain applications."
