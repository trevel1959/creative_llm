    "**Interchangeable Plates for Versatility**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable cooking plates that allow users to create different types of waffles and other foods. For instance, users could switch from traditional waffle plates to pancake plates, grill plates, or even a plate for making hash browns. This feature would maximize the utility of the appliance and cater to a wider range of breakfast options.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature using steam technology. After use, the waffle iron could generate steam that loosens any batter residue, making it easier to wipe clean. Users could simply add water to a designated compartment, press a button, and let the iron do the work, promoting hygiene and convenience.",
    "**Built-in Flavor Infuser**: Incorporate a flavor infuser that allows users to add ingredients like chocolate chips, fruits, or spices directly into the batter while it cooks. This feature could work by having a small compartment that releases the ingredients at the right moment during the cooking process, ensuring even distribution and enhanced flavor without the mess of mixing.",
    "**Temperature Control and Cooking Sensors**: Enhance the waffle iron with advanced temperature control and cooking sensors that monitor the batterâ€™s doneness. The appliance could provide visual and auditory cues when the waffles are perfectly cooked, preventing overcooking and ensuring consistent results every time. This would be especially helpful for novice cooks who may struggle with timing.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Customizable Shape Molds**: Create a waffle iron that allows users to insert custom-shaped molds, enabling them to make waffles in fun shapes like hearts, stars, or even characters. This feature would be particularly appealing for families with children, making breakfast more enjoyable and engaging."
