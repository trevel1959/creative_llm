    "**Smart Bike Lane**: Design a smart bike lane that integrates with the existing bike infrastructure. The lane would be equipped with sensors that detect the speed and distance of approaching vehicles, and alert cyclists through a wearable device or a smartphone app. The app would also provide real-time traffic updates, suggesting the best route to take to avoid congested areas.",
    "**Bike-to-Work Program**: Develop a bike-to-work program that offers employees a stipend or reimbursement for bike-related expenses, such as bike purchases, maintenance, and accessories.
