[
    "A city that exists only in the minds of its inhabitants, built entirely of memories and experiences.",
    "A city that appears only when it rains, its buildings and streets materializing out of the water.",
    "A cityed entirely of light, where every building and object glows with a soft, ethereal light.",
    "A city that is constantly in a state of flux, its architecture and layout constantly changing and evolving.",
    "A city that is entirely made of sound, where buildings and streets are created by the collective voices and sounds of its inhabitants."
