    "Hanging Organizer: Create a clothes hanger with multiple compartments to organize and hang different types of clothing. For example, a hanger with three compartments, each one tailored to hold a specific type of garment, such as tops, bottoms, and dresses. This design allows users to easily separate and locate their clothes in a more organized manner.",
    "Smart Hanger: Design a clothes hanger that incorporates smart technology to monitor and analyze clothing usage patterns. This hanger can track the number of times a garment is worn, the temperature and humidity levels it's exposed to, and even detect when a garment is damaged or stained. The data collected can be synced to a user's smartphone app, providing insights on how to improve their wardrobe and reduce waste.",
    "Adjustable Hanger: Create a clothes hanger with adjustable hooks that can accommodate different garment sizes. The hooks can be easily moved up or down depending on the size of the garment, ensuring that clothes are hung in the most efficient and organized way possible. This design eliminates the need for multiple hangers and saves space in the closet.",
    "Hanger with Built-In Steamer: Design a clothes hanger with a built-in steamer function, allowing users to quickly and easily steam their clothes without the need for a separate steamer. This feature can be especially useful for people who live in humid climates or for those who prefer to steam their clothes before hanging them up.",
    "Interactive Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that interacts with users through voice commands or gestures. For example, a hanger with a built-in microphone that can recognize and respond to voice commands, such as \"hang up my dress\" or \"take out my jeans.\" This interactive hanger can also provide fashion recommendations based on the user's preferences and wardrobe, helping them create new outfits and stay on top of the latest trends."
