We could also use our dreams to explore our subconscious mind and gain a better understanding of ourselves.",
    "Dream sharing: If we could control our dreams, we could share them with others.

This could be especially useful for long-distance relationships, as it would allow people to connect emotionally and share their thoughts even when they are physically apart.",
    "Dream manipulation: We could use our ability to control our dreams to manipulate them in various ways.

This could be especially useful for people who are anxious or afraid to try new things in real life.",
    "Dream healing: Controlling our dreams could also be used for healing purposes.

    "Dream journaling: We could use our ability to control our dreams to create dream journals.
