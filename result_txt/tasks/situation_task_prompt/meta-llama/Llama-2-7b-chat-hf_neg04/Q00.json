    "Hovercrafts: In a world where all cars have stopped working, hovercrafts could be an innovative solution for inter-city travel. Hovercrafts use air pressure to lift and propel vehicles above the ground, reducing friction and allowing for faster and more efficient travel. They could be powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells, making them a more environmentally friendly option.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains above the ground, reducing friction and allowing for faster travel. These trains could be powered by electricity or advanced battery technology, making them a more efficient and sustainable option for long-distance travel.",
    "Personal airships: Personal airships, or small blimps, could be used for short-distance travel between cities. These airships could be powered by electric motors or solar panels, making them a more environmentally friendly option. They could also be equipped with amenities such as comfortable seating, air conditioning, and entertainment systems, making them a more enjoyable travel experience.",
    "Bicycle highways: In a world without cars, bicycle highways could become a popular mode of transportation for long-distance travel. These highways would be dedicated lanes for bicycles, separated from traffic and equipped with amenities such as bike lanes, rest stops, and food and shelter. This would make long-distance cycling a safer and more enjoyable experience.",
    "Teleportation: In a world where all cars have stopped working, teleportation technology could become a game-changer for inter-city travel. By using advanced quantum entanglement technology, people could be transported from one city to another instantly, eliminating the need for any form of transportation. This would not only save time and energy but also reduce the carbon footprint of travel significantly."
