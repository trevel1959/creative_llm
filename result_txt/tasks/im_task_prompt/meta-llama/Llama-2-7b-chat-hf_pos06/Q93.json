    "Bowling Ball with Built-In AI: Create a bowling ball with a built-in AI system that can analyze the lane conditions, calculate the perfect trajectory, and adjust the ball's spin and speed accordingly. The AI system could use sensors and cameras to gather data on the lane conditions and use machine learning algorithms to optimize the ball's performance. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Smart Bowling Ball with Bluetooth Connectivity: Design a bowling ball with Bluetooth connectivity that allows bowlers to track their scores, analyze their gameplay, and connect with other bowlers. The ball could have a small screen on the side that displays the score and provides real-time feedback on the bowler's technique. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bowling Ball with Customizable Weight Distribution: Create a bowling ball with a customizable weight distribution system that allows bowlers to adjust the weight of the ball based on their strength and technique. This could be achieved through a modular design with interchangeable weights or a smart weight distribution system that adjusts the weight in real-time based on the bowler's input. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bowling Ball with Integrated VR Training: Design a bowling ball with an integrated VR training system that allows bowlers to practice their technique in a virtual environment. The ball could have a built-in VR headset and motion sensors that track the bowler's movements and provide real-time feedback on their technique. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Bowling Ball with Adaptive Surface Technology: Create a bowling ball with an adaptive surface technology that adjusts the ball's surface based on the lane conditions. The ball could have a series of micro-sensors that monitor the lane conditions and adjust the surface of the ball to optimize its performance. Confidence Score: 0.9"
