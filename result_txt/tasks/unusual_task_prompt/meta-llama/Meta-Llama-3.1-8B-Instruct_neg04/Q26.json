    "**Tennis Ball Maze**: Design a 3D maze using tennis balls as the primary building blocks. The maze would be constructed using a combination of tennis balls and a strong adhesive, such as hot glue. The balls would be arranged in a intricate pattern, creating a challenging and visually striking maze. Players would navigate through the maze using a small ball or a specialized tool, aiming to reach the center or complete specific objectives.",
    "**Tennis Ball Sculpture Garden**: Create a public art installation featuring large-scale sculptures made entirely from tennis balls. The balls would be arranged in a way that creates a cohesive and thought-provoking piece of art. Each sculpture could represent a different theme, such as unity, diversity, or environmental awareness. The installation would be interactive, allowing visitors to walk through and around the sculptures, creating a unique and immersive experience.",
    "**Tennis Ball Sound Wave Generator**: Develop a device that uses tennis balls to generate unique sound waves. The device would consist of a series of tennis balls suspended from a metal rod, each ball attached to a small sensor that detects vibrations. When a ball is struck or dropped, it would create a distinct sound wave, which would be amplified and mixed with other sounds to create a captivating audio experience. This device could be used in music performances, art installations, or even as a tool for sound therapy.",
    "**Tennis Ball Water Filtration System**: Design a sustainable water filtration system using tennis balls as the primary filtration medium. The system would consist of a series of tennis balls packed into a container, which would be filled with water. As the water flows through the balls, it would be filtered, removing impurities and contaminants. The filtered water could then be collected and used for drinking, irrigation, or other purposes. This system could be particularly effective for communities in areas with limited access to clean water.",
    "**Tennis Ball Gravity-Defying Installation**: Create a mind-bending installation that appears to defy gravity, using tennis balls as the primary component. The installation would consist of a large, transparent dome or sphere, filled with tennis balls that seem to float in mid-air. The balls would be suspended using a combination of magnets, fans, and clever engineering, creating an illusion of weightlessness. Visitors would be able to walk around the installation, experiencing the sensation of being in a zero-gravity environment. This installation could be used as a thought-provoking exhibit in science museums or as a unique attraction in public spaces. </s> [/INST] Assistant"
