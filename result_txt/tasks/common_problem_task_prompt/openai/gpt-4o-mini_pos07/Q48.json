    "**Difficulty in Gaining Popularity**: New sports often struggle to gain traction in a crowded market filled with established games. Without a strong marketing strategy and community engagement, the sport may remain obscure. To overcome this, organizers can host promotional events, engage with local schools and community centers, and leverage social media to create buzz. Partnering with influencers or well-known athletes can also help elevate the sport's profile and attract a wider audience.",
    "**Equipment Accessibility**: A new sport may require specialized equipment that is not readily available or affordable for potential players. This can create barriers to entry, limiting participation. To combat this issue, organizers could collaborate with manufacturers to create affordable and accessible gear or offer rental programs. Additionally, promoting DIY equipment solutions or simplified versions of the sport can encourage participation from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.",
    "**Establishing a Competitive Structure**: Creating a competitive framework, including leagues, tournaments, and rankings, is crucial for a new sport's growth. However, this can be challenging without an existing infrastructure. To facilitate this, organizers can start with local clubs and community events, gradually building up to regional and national competitions. Establishing partnerships with existing sports organizations can also provide the necessary support and resources to create a competitive landscape.",
    "**Inclusion and Diversity Challenges**: Ensuring that the new sport is inclusive and appeals to a diverse audience can be a significant challenge. If the sport is perceived as exclusive or catering to a specific demographic, it may struggle to grow. To foster inclusivity, organizers should actively promote the sport to underrepresented groups, offer introductory sessions that welcome all skill levels, and highlight diverse role models within the sport. Creating an inclusive culture from the outset can help attract a broader range of participants.",
    "**Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: As the sport grows, it may face scrutiny regarding its environmental impact, particularly if it requires extensive facilities or resources. To address this concern, organizers can prioritize sustainability by utilizing eco-friendly materials for equipment, promoting zero-waste events, and encouraging participants to engage in environmentally conscious practices. By positioning the sport as environmentally friendly, it can attract environmentally conscious players and fans."
