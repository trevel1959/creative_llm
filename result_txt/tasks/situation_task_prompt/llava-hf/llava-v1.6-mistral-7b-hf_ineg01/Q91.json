    "Rely on tactile feedback from the environment: Train yourself to use other senses to detect potential dangers. For example, if you can't feel the heat of a stove, you could use a thermometer to measure the temperature before touching it. Similarly, you could use a pressure gauge to detect if an object is too heavy to handle.",
    "Develop a heightened sense of smell: Smell can be a powerful indicator of danger. For instance, you could use your sense of smell to detect a gas leak or smoke, which could prevent a fire or explosion.",
    "Use visual cues: While you may not feel physical sensations, you can still see and hear potential hazards. By paying close attention to your surroundings and using your eyes and ears, you can detect and avoid potential injuries.",
    "Learn from others: If you lose your ability to feel physical sensations, you can still learn from others who do have this ability. Observing their reactions to various stimuli can help you understand and anticipate potential dangers.",
    "Create a safety checklist: Develop a routine safety checklist that you can follow to ensure you are taking necessary precautions. This could include checking for sharp objects, ensuring that appliances are turned off, and verifying that the environment is safe before engaging in any activity."
