    "\"Rubber Hand Illusion\": A virtual reality experience where participants wear a VR headset and are given a rubber hand that they can manipulate in the virtual environment. The twist is that the rubber hand is connected to a robotic arm that is controlled by the participant's real hand movements. The participant's brain is tricked into thinking that the rubber hand is their own, and they begin to feel sensations in the virtual hand, such as touch and temperature. This experience can be used to study the neural mechanisms of body ownership and self-perception.",
    "\"Synesthesia Theater\": An immersive theater experience where actors wear special suits that can change color and texture in response to sound waves. The audience is seated in a room with a large screen that displays a visual representation of the sound waves. As the actors move and interact with each other, the audience sees a dynamic, colorful display that is synchronized with the sound. This experience can be used to explore the relationship between sound and visual perception, and how synesthesia can be used to create new forms of artistic expression.",
    "\"Dreamscapes\": A sleep laboratory where participants are equipped with EEG headsets and sensors that track their brain activity during sleep. The data is then used to generate a virtual reality experience that simulates the participant's dreams. The VR environment is designed to match the brain activity patterns of the participant, creating a surreal and immersive experience that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. This experience can be used to study the neural mechanisms of dreaming and the role of the brain in shaping our experiences.",
    "\"Neurofeedback Orchestra\": A musical performance where the musicians wear EEG headsets that track their brain activity in real-time. The data is then used to control the sound and visuals of the performance, creating a dynamic and interactive experience. The musicians can use their brain activity to control the tempo, pitch, and volume of the music, as well as the visuals and lighting of the performance. This experience can be used to explore the relationship between brain activity and creativity, and how neurofeedback can be used to enhance musical performance.",
    "\"Mirror Maze\": A physical installation where participants wear a VR headset and are placed in a maze with mirrors that reflect their virtual body. The twist is that the mirrors are designed to create a sense of disorientation and confusion, making it difficult for the participant to determine which direction they are facing. The participant's brain is tricked into thinking that their virtual body is being manipulated and distorted, creating a sense of disorientation and"
