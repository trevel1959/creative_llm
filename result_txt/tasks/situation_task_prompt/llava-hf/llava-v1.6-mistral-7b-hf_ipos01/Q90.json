    "Cloud Harvesting: Cloud harvesting involves using specially designed structures to collect water droplets from clouds before they reach the ground. This technology could be used to collect water in regions with high humidity but low rainfall.",
    "Aquifer Recharge: Aquifers are underground layers of water-saturated rock or sand. Aquifer recharge involves replenishing these natural water sources by injecting water into them through wells. This could be a sustainable way to collect water in areas where rainfall is limited.",
    "Solar Still: A solar still is a device that uses solar energy to distill water from saltwater or other contaminated sources. This could be a practical solution for collecting water in arid regions.",
    "Water Recycling: Water recycling involves treating wastewater to make it safe for reuse. This could be an effective way to collect water in urban areas where rainfall is scarce.",
    "Water Harvesting from Air: This technology involves extracting water from the air using a cooling system that condenses moisture from the air. This could be a practical solution for collecting water in areas with high humidity but low rainfall."
