    "The concept of retirement would need to be redefined: With a 200-year lifespan, the traditional retirement age of 65 would be equivalent to just 1% of a person's total lifespan. This would require a complete overhaul of the retirement system, as people would have the physical and mental capacity to work for much longer. Governments and companies would need to adapt their retirement policies to accommodate this change.",
    "Education and skill development would become a lifelong pursuit: With a longer lifespan, people would have the opportunity to explore multiple career paths and fields of interest. Continuous learning and skill development would become the norm, as people would need to adapt to the changing job market and technological advancements. This could lead to a more dynamic and diverse workforce.",
    "Social Security and healthcare systems would need major updates: A 200-year lifespan would put significant strain on social security and healthcare systems. Governments would need to find innovative ways to provide for the long-term care and well-being of their citizens, including the development of new healthcare technologies and support systems.",
    "Family dynamics would shift: With a longer lifespan, family structures and dynamics could change. Children may have more time to spend with their parents, leading to closer relationships and a greater sense of responsibility towards their elderly relatives. This could result in a more supportive and caring society.",
    "The concept of legacy and inheritance would evolve: A 200-year lifespan would give people more time to build their legacies and create lasting impact. This could lead to a greater focus on personal and professional achievements, as well as the creation of lasting cultural and artistic works. Inheritance laws and practices would also need to adapt to accommodate these changes."
