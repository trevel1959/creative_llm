    "**Visitor Safety and Accidents**: As the number of visitors to the national park increases, so does the risk of accidents and injuries. This could include encounters with wildlife, slips and falls on trails, or accidents during recreational activities like hiking or climbing. To mitigate these risks, park management could enhance safety measures by improving signage, conducting regular trail maintenance, and offering educational programs about wildlife encounters and safety protocols.",
    "**Environmental Degradation**: High visitor foot traffic can lead to soil erosion, littering, and damage to vegetation. This environmental degradation not only affects the park's natural beauty but also threatens its biodiversity. Park management could implement a \"Leave No Trace\" campaign, establish designated trails to minimize impact, and promote volunteer programs for park clean-up and restoration efforts.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of invasive plant and animal species can disrupt the native ecosystem and outcompete local flora and fauna. To combat this issue, park management could conduct regular monitoring and removal of invasive species, collaborate with conservation organizations for educational outreach, and develop a comprehensive plan for restoring native habitats.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, which can hinder maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. This can lead to deteriorating facilities and insufficient resources for park rangers. To address this, park management could explore alternative funding sources, such as partnerships with local businesses, grants, and crowdfunding campaigns, while also prioritizing projects based on urgency and visitor impact.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting weather patterns, wildlife migration, and plant growth. Rising temperatures can lead to increased wildfires, altered habitats, and changes in species distributions. Park management could develop a climate adaptation plan that includes habitat restoration, monitoring programs for vulnerable species, and educational initiatives to raise awareness about climate change's impact on natural ecosystems."
