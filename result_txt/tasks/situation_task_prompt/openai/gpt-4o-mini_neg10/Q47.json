    "**Sunscreen-Infused Scalp Mask**: Create a unique scalp mask that is infused with SPF protection and soothing ingredients like aloe vera and chamomile. This mask would be designed to fit snugly on the head and could be worn under a hat or alone. It would not only protect against sunburn but also hydrate and nourish the scalp, making it a dual-purpose product for skin health.",
    "**Solar-Powered Cooling Cap**: Develop a cap that integrates solar-powered fans to provide a cooling breeze while outdoors. The cap would be made from breathable fabric with UV protection and feature a sleek design. The fans would be powered by small solar panels on the top of the cap, ensuring that the wearer stays cool and comfortable while also protected from the sun's rays.",
    "**Reflective Scalp Tattoos**: Introduce a line of temporary tattoos that are made with a reflective material that bounces sunlight away from the scalp. These tattoos could come in various designs and patterns, allowing users to express their style while providing an additional layer of sun protection. The tattoos would be easy to apply and remove, making them a fun accessory for sunny days.",
    "**UV-Detecting Headbands**: Create a smart headband that changes color based on UV exposure. The headband would be made from a comfortable, stretchy material and would feature embedded UV sensors. When the UV levels rise to a point that could cause sunburn, the headband would change color, prompting the wearer to seek shade or apply sunscreen. This innovative accessory would combine fashion with sun safety awareness.",
    "**Portable Shade Canopy**: Design a compact, portable canopy that can be easily set up in outdoor settings. This lightweight structure would provide ample shade for the head and body, with a design that allows it to be staked into the ground or used as a free-standing unit. It could also feature UV-blocking fabric and be equipped with side panels to protect against wind, making it perfect for beach trips, picnics, or outdoor events."
