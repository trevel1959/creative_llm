    "**Mountain Biking in the Ocean**: If all mountains were to vanish, consider creating an artificial mountain range in the ocean using underwater structures or large boulders. This could provide thrilling mountain biking opportunities for adrenaline junkies. The environment would offer a unique experience with stunning underwater landscapes and marine life sightings.",
    "**Skydiving Parachute Gliding**: Utilize the vast open spaces created by the absence of mountains to create massive parachute gliding courses. Participants can experience the thrill of free-falling through the sky without the need for mountains as a drop zone. Safety measures and regulations must be strictly enforced to ensure participants' safety.",
    "**Inland Alpine Ski Resorts**: Without mountains, you can recreate the alpine skiing experience inland. Use artificial snow and ice-making technology to build ski resorts with slopes, jumps, and parks. This could attract winter sports enthusiasts who love skiing but no longer have access to traditional mountainous locations.",
    "**Waterfall Exploration Tours**: The disappearance of mountains might lead to new geological formations such as rivers, gorges, and valleys. These could create natural waterfalls. Establish guided tours to explore these new wonders, offering visitors the chance to see and swim in the cascading waters. Eco-friendly and sustainable practices should be prioritized during tour operations.",
    "**High-Altitude Adventure Parks**: Build adventure parks at high altitudes within existing geographical features like plateaus or hills. Include zip-lining, rope courses, and other high-altitude activities. This would offer a unique twist on traditional adventure park experiences, allowing people to enjoy outdoor thrills in a new and exciting way. Make sure to collaborate with local authorities to ensure the safety and environmental impact are managed responsibly."
