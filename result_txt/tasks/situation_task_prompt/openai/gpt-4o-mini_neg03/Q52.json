    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: Building a simple fire pit in your backyard or a safe outdoor area allows you to harness the power of an open flame. You could use stones to create a circular structure and cook directly over the fire using skewers or by wrapping food in large green leaves and placing them on hot coals. This method is excellent for grilling vegetables, meats, or even baking potatoes wrapped in foil.",
    "**Earth Oven**: You can dig a pit in the ground and create an earth oven. Start a fire in the pit and let it burn down until you have hot coals. Place food wrapped in leaves or in clay pots on top of the coals, then cover everything with soil to trap heat. This method can be used for baking bread, cooking whole fish, or roasting root vegetables.",
    "**Stone Cooking**: If you have access to smooth, flat stones, you can heat them over a fire and use them as cooking surfaces. Once the stones are hot, you can place food directly on them to sear meats or cook vegetables. This method can also be used to create a makeshift griddle for pancakes or eggs.",
    "**Steam Cooking with Leaves**: Gather large, sturdy leaves from plants like banana or corn. Place food inside the leaves, wrap them tightly, and then place them in a pot of boiling water or on hot stones. The steam generated will cook the food while imparting a unique flavor from the leaves, making it a great way to prepare fish, rice, or dumplings.",
    "**Fermentation**: Instead of cooking, you could prepare meals through fermentation. By using simple ingredients like vegetables, grains, or dairy, you can create fermented dishes such as kimchi, sauerkraut, or yogurt. This method not only preserves food but also enhances flavors and adds probiotics, making meals both nutritious and delicious."
