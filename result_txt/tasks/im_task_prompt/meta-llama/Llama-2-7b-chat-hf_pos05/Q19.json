    "Augmented Reality Glasses: Create glasses with augmented reality (AR) technology that enhances the wearer's visual experience. These glasses could display virtual objects, information, or graphics on top of real-world objects, allowing users to interact with their surroundings in a more immersive way. For example, a user could point the glasses at a painting and see a virtual tour of the artist's studio or a detailed analysis of the painting's composition.",
    "Smart Glasses for the Blind: Develop glasses with advanced sensors and AI algorithms that can detect and identify objects in the wearer's surroundings, providing audio or haptic feedback to help the wearer navigate. These glasses could also include a virtual assistant that can help the wearer with daily tasks, such as recognizing faces or identifying products.",
    "Glasses with Built-in Projector: Create glasses with a built-in projector that can display images or videos directly onto the wearer's retina. This could be useful for presentations, movies, or even video calls. The projector could be powered by a small battery or solar panels, making it a portable and eco-friendly option.",
    "Glasses with Personalized Lenses: Develop glasses with lenses that can be customized to the wearer's individual needs. For example, the lenses could change color or tint based on the wearer's surroundings, providing optimal visual comfort and clarity. These glasses could also include features such as anti-blue light coating or UV protection.",
    "Glasses with Telekinesis Controls: Create glasses with built-in sensors and actuators that allow the wearer to control objects with their eyes. This could be achieved through a combination of EEG sensors and motors that can move small objects, such as toys or small appliances, based on the wearer's eye movements. This could be a fun and innovative way for people to interact with their surroundings, and could also have practical applications in fields such as robotics or gaming."
