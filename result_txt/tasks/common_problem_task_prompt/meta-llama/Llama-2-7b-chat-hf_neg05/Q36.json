    "\"Solar-Powered Neighborhoods\": Create a program where homeowners can group together to install solar panels on their rooftops. Offer incentives for homeowners to participate, such as reduced energy costs or a share of the energy produced. This would not only provide a sustainable energy source but also create a sense of community among neighbors.",
    "\"Solar Leasing Program\": Offer a leasing program for solar panels, allowing homeowners to pay a monthly fee to use the panels without having to purchase them outright. This would make it more accessible for homeowners who may not have the initial investment to purchase the panels.",
    "\"Solar-Powered Community Centers\": Install solar panels on community centers, schools, and other public buildings to provide a central location for residents to charge their electric vehicles and use the energy generated. This would not only provide a convenient charging station but also serve as a symbol of the city's commitment to sustainability.",
    "\"Solar Panel Art Installations\": Create public art installations using solar panels, such as a large mural or sculpture that generates energy and provides a unique visual display. This would not only promote sustainability but also serve as a conversation starter and a source of pride for the community.",
    "\"Solar-Powered Green Spaces\": Create solar-powered green spaces in parks and other public areas, such as solar-powered fountains, gardens, and lighting. This would not only provide a beautiful and peaceful environment but also generate energy and reduce the city's carbon footprint."
