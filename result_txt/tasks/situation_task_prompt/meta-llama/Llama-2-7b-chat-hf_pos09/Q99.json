    "Shape Recognition: One way to differentiate between objects would be to focus on their shapes. Even in a black and white world, objects would still have unique shapes that can be identified. For example, a circular object like a ball would be easily recognizable, as would a rectangular object like a book. By paying attention to the shapes of objects, people could still identify and distinguish between them.",
    "Texture Differentiation: Another way to differentiate between objects would be to pay attention to their textures. Different objects would have distinct textures that could be felt even in a black and white world. For example, a rough, bumpy surface like a rock would be easy to identify, as would a smooth, flat surface like a piece of paper. By feeling the textures of objects, people could determine what they are.",
    "Sound Differentiation: In a black and white world, sounds could be used to differentiate between objects. Different objects would produce unique sounds when touched or moved, and these sounds could be used to identify them. For example, a metal object like a spoon would produce a distinctive clinking sound when moved, while a soft, flexible object like a piece of cloth would produce a more muted sound. By paying attention to the sounds of objects, people could identify them.",
    "Shadows: Shadows could also be used to differentiate between objects. In a black and white world, shadows would be the only remaining color, and they could be used to identify objects. For example, a round object like a ball would cast a round shadow, while a flat object like a book would cast a longer, more rectangular shadow. By paying attention to the shadows of objects, people could determine what they are.",
    "Smell Differentiation: In a black and white world, people could differentiate between objects based on their smell. Different objects would have unique scents that could be detected even in a world without color. For example, a fresh, clean scent like a new toy would be easy to identify, as would a musty, old scent like an old book. By paying attention to the smells of objects, people could determine what they are."
