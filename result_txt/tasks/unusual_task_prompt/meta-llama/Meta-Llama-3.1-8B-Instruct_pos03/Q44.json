    "A Smart Ice Cube Tray: This tray has built-in sensors that detect the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment. Based on this data, it can adjust the freezing time to ensure that the ice cubes are perfectly formed, with minimal water waste and maximum flavor retention. The tray also has a built-in timer and a mobile app that allows users to schedule ice cube production in advance. For example, if you're planning a party, you can set the tray to produce a batch of ice cubes at a specific time, so they're ready when you need them.",
    "Edible Ice Cubes: These ice cubes are made from natural ingredients such as fruit purees, herbs, and spices.

This tray is perfect for people who want to reduce their environmental impact and save money on ice.",
    "Smart Ice Cube Tray with Temperature Control: This tray has a built-in temperature control system that allows users to adjust the temperature of the ice cube to a specific level. This is useful for people who want to make perfect ice cubes for cocktails or other drinks that require a specific temperature. The tray also has a built-in timer and a mobile app"
