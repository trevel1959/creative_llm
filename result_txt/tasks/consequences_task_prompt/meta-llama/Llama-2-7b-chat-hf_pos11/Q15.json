    "Alternative Energy Sources: One implication of the world running out of oil would be a shift towards alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. This would require significant investments in infrastructure and research and development to harness these renewable energy sources efficiently. Governments and corporations would need to work together to create policies and incentives that encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies.",
    "Electric Vehicles: As oil becomes scarce, the cost of gasoline-powered vehicles would increase, making electric vehicles (EVs) more attractive. EVs would become the norm, and governments would offer incentives to encourage people to switch to EVs. This would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in air pollution.",
    "Carbon Capture and Storage: Another implication of running out of oil would be a focus on carbon capture and storage technologies. These technologies involve capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes, and storing them underground. This would help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, slowing down global warming.",
    "Circular Economy: A world without oil would require a shift towards a circular economy, where resources are used efficiently and waste is minimized. This would involve designing products and production processes that are restorative and regenerative by design. Companies would need to adopt sustainable practices, such as recycling, upcycling, and reducing waste.",
    "Space Exploration: As oil becomes scarce, humanity may turn to space exploration to find new sources of energy. This could involve establishing colonies on the moon or other planets and harnessing their resources. Space exploration could also provide new opportunities for scientific research and technological advancements. Governments and private companies would invest in space exploration, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as propulsion systems, life support technologies, and materials science."
