    "Glowing Petals: The new species, named Luminaria, would have petals that emit a soft, gentle glow, providing a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The glow would be a result of a special pigment called \"luminescence,\" which would be produced by a unique combination of chlorophyll and other pigments in the plant's cells. This would not only make the plant visually striking but also provide a source of light for the surrounding environment, perfect for gardens or indoor spaces with limited natural light.",

Additionally, the leaves could be used as a natural remedy for various ailments, such as inflammation and digestive issues.",
    "Air-Purifying Roots: The new species, called Aeruginosa, would have roots that are capable of purifying the air around it. The roots would contain specialized cells that could absorb harmful toxins and pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, and convert them into oxygen and other harmless compounds. This would make the plant an excellent choice for urban environments, where air pollution is a significant concern.",
    "Self-Healing Capabilities: The new species, called Regenera, would have the ability to heal itself in the event of injury or damage.
