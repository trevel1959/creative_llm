    "**QR Code for Contactless Information**:    Instead of traditional written information, this luggage tag could incorporate a scannable QR code. When scanned, it could lead to a secure webpage containing all relevant travel information, such as the owner's contact details, travel itinerary, and emergency contacts. This would not only reduce the risk of identity theft but also make it easier for someone to contact the owner if the luggage is found.",
    "**Personalized Design with Augmented Reality (AR)**:    Users could customize their luggage tags with unique designs that come to life through AR. By scanning the tag with an app, users could see animations or messages that reflect their personality or travel experiences. This would not only help in identifying luggage but also serve as a fun and interactive way to showcase personal style.",
    "**Multi-functional Luggage Tag with Built-in Pocket**:    This innovative luggage tag would feature a small, secure pocket that can hold essential items such as a boarding pass, travel insurance information, or a small amount of cash. This would be especially useful for travelers who want quick access to important documents without digging through their bags.",
    "**Biometric Identification Tag**:    A futuristic approach could involve a luggage tag that uses biometric technology, such as fingerprint recognition, to unlock the luggage. This would enhance security, ensuring that only the owner can access their belongings. Additionally, the tag could have a backup method (like a numeric code) for emergencies.",
    "**Eco-friendly and Reusable Tags**:    In response to environmental concerns, a line of luggage tags made from sustainable materials (like recycled plastics or biodegradable materials) could be developed. These tags would be designed to last longer and could be easily customized or updated with a new design, reducing waste and promoting eco-conscious travel."
