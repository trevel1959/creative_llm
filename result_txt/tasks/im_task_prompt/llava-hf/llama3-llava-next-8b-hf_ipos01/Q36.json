    "Ergonomic Knife: Designed for improved comfort and efficiency, this knife would feature an ergonomic handle that reduces hand fatigue during extended use. The blade would be serrated for smoother cutting and a sharper edge for precise cuts.",
    "Multi-Function Knife: This knife would have interchangeable blades, allowing the user to choose the most suitable blade for specific tasks. For example, one blade could be designed for slicing, another for chopping, and a third for carving.",
    "Magnetic Knife Strip: A magnetic knife strip would be attached to the knife, making it easy to store and retrieve the knife without the need for a knife block or drawer. This would also keep the blade sharp and prevent damage from contact with other utensils.",
    "Energy Harvesting Knife: This knife would have a piezoelectric material embedded in the blade, generating a small amount of electricity when the knife is used. This electricity could be stored in a small battery, providing a sustainable power source for other electronic devices.",
    "Self-Cleaning Knife: The knife would have a nanotechnology coating that repels water and prevents the growth of bacteria, making it easier to clean and reducing the risk of cross-contamination."
