The internet would become a tool for social mobility, education, and economic empowerment, especially for marginalized communities. ",

This could result in a reevaluation of international relations, trade agreements, and development aid. ",
    "**Rise of Digital Literacy and Education**: As internet access becomes a fundamental right, there would be a significant focus on digital literacy and education. Governments, organizations, and individuals would invest in programs that teach people how to use the internet safely, effectively, and responsibly. This would lead to a more informed and empowered global citizenry, capable of harnessing the internet's potential for personal and societal growth. ",
    "**New Forms of Social Activism and Organization**: The internet as a basic human right would enable new forms of social activism and organization. Online platforms would become powerful tools for mobilizing people, raising awareness, and advocating for social change. This could lead to a surge in online activism, with individuals and groups using the internet to challenge unjust systems, promote human rights, and push for policy reforms. ",
    "**Challenges to Traditional Power Structures**: The recognition of internet access as a basic human right would challenge traditional power structures, including those of governments, corporations, and other institutions. It would create new opportunities for marginalized voices to be heard, and for alternative forms of governance and decision-making to emerge. This could lead to a more decentralized and participatory society, where power is distributed more equitably among individuals and communities. "
