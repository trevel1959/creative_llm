    "**Multifunctional Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that combines multiple functions, such as a horn, light, and alarm system. This bell would feature a bright LED light for visibility during night rides, a loud horn for alerting pedestrians and cyclists, and a security alarm that can be activated when the bike is parked to deter theft. This multifunctional approach would enhance safety and convenience for cyclists.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material**: Create a bicycle bell made from sustainable and biodegradable materials. The bell could be constructed from recycled plastics or natural materials like bamboo. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists and promote sustainability in cycling accessories.",
    "**Interactive Bell with Voice Alerts**: Develop a bicycle bell that features voice alerts for various situations. For instance, it could announce when a cyclist is approaching a busy intersection, reminding them to slow down or alerting pedestrians nearby. This interactive feature could be enhanced with different voice options, allowing users to select their preferred tone or language.",
    "**Customizable LED Display**: Introduce a bicycle bell with a small LED display that can show messages or symbols. Cyclists could program the display to communicate with others on the road, such as \"On your left!\" or \"Slow down!\" This would add a layer of communication and awareness among cyclists and pedestrians, making rides safer and more interactive.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Redesign the bicycle bell with an ergonomic grip that allows for easy and comfortable activation. The bell could feature a larger, textured button that can be easily pressed with gloves or while riding on rough terrain. This improvement would enhance usability, especially for those with limited dexterity or while wearing cycling gloves."
