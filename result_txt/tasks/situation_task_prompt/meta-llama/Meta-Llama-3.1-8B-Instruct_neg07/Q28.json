    "**Digital Notebooks**: I would use a digital notebook app like Evernote or OneNote to record important information. These apps allow me to organize my notes into notebooks, tags, and even create custom notebooks for specific projects or topics. I can also use the camera to scan physical documents and save them digitally. With a digital notebook, I can access my information from anywhere, at any time, and even share it with others.",
    "**Voice Assistants**: I would use voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa to record important information. I can simply speak my thoughts, and the assistant will transcribe them into text. I can also use voice assistants to set reminders, schedule appointments, and even control other smart devices in my home.",
    "**Mind Mapping**: I would use mind mapping techniques to visually record important information. Mind mapping involves creating a diagram with words, images, and colors to represent ideas and concepts. I can use a digital tool like MindMeister or Coggle to create a mind map, and then share it with others or save it for future reference.",
    "**Video Recordings**: I would use video recordings to capture important information. I can use a smartphone or a dedicated camera to record a video, and then save it to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. This way, I can access the video from anywhere and even share it with others.",
    "**3D Modeling**: I would use 3D modeling software like Blender or Tinkercad to create interactive 3D models that record important information. For example, I can create a 3D model of a building or a machine, and then add interactive elements like buttons, sliders, or text to provide additional information. This way, I can create an immersive and engaging way to record and share important information."
