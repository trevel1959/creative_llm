    "**Temperature Control**: Design a hairbrush that integrates temperature control technology. This brush would have built-in sensors that allow users to heat or cool the bristles to suit their styling needs. For example, heated bristles could help in smoothing and straightening hair, while cool bristles could help set styles or add shine. The temperature settings could be adjusted via a smartphone app for personalized styling.",
    "**Smart Brush with Hair Analysis**: Create a smart hairbrush equipped with sensors that analyze the user's hair health as they brush. It could measure factors such as moisture levels, thickness, and breakage. The brush would then provide real-time feedback through a connected app, suggesting tailored hair care products or routines based on the analysis, helping users maintain healthy hair.",
    "**Interchangeable Bristle Heads**: Develop a hairbrush with interchangeable bristle heads that can be swapped out based on hair type and styling needs. For instance, users could have heads specifically designed for detangling, volumizing, or smoothing. Each head would come with unique bristle designs and materials, allowing for a customized brushing experience that caters to different hair types and styles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a line of hairbrushes made from sustainable, biodegradable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. These brushes could feature natural bristles sourced from ethically harvested materials. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds could go to environmental conservation efforts, appealing to eco-conscious consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Massage Functionality**: Integrate a gentle massaging feature into the hairbrush. The brush could have flexible bristles that vibrate or pulse, providing a soothing scalp massage while brushing. This would not only enhance the brushing experience but also promote blood circulation in the scalp, potentially leading to healthier hair growth."
