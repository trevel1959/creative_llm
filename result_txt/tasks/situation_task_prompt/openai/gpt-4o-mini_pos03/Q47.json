The cap would be connected to a smartphone app that alerts the wearer when UV levels are high, suggesting when to seek shade or reapply sunscreen. The cap could also feature built-in cooling technology to keep the scalp comfortable, using lightweight, breathable materials to ensure it can be worn for extended periods.",
