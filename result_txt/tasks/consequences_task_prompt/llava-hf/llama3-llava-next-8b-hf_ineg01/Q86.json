    "**Global Temperature Drop**: The sun's rays are the primary source of heat for Earth. Without the sun, the planet's temperature would drop dramatically, causing extreme cold and potentially even ice ages.",
    "**Crop Failures**: Without sunlight, photosynthesis would be impossible, leading to the collapse of agriculture and the food supply chain. This would result in widespread food shortages and a global crisis.",
    "**Atmospheric Changes**: The absence of sunlight would alter the Earth's atmospheric conditions. The temperature drop would cause water vapor to condense and freeze, leading to the formation of ice crystals in the upper atmosphere. This would have a cascading effect on weather patterns and climate.",
    "**Impact on Wildlife**: The sudden drop in temperature and the loss of sunlight would have a devastating impact on wildlife. Many species would face extinction due to the inability to find food, water, or suitable habitats.",
    "**Technological Disruptions**: The loss of solar energy would impact satellite communications, navigation systems, and various technological applications that rely on solar power for their operation."
