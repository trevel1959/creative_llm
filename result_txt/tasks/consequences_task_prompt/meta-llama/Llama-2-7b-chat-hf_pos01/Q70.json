    "Time Dilation: If the speed of light were reduced by half, time would appear to slow down for objects moving at that speed. This means that for an observer on Earth, time would pass more slowly for an object moving at half the speed of light compared to one moving at the speed of light. This effect would be most pronounced for objects moving closer to the speed of light, where time would appear to slow down significantly. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Reduced Distance Traveled: With a reduced speed of light, the distance traveled by an object would also be reduced. For example, if an object were traveling at half the speed of light, it would cover half the distance it would cover if it were traveling at the speed of light. This means that spacecraft traveling to other planets or stars would take longer to reach their destinations. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Altered Gravity: The reduced speed of light would also have an impact on gravity. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is affected by the curvature of spacetime. With a reduced speed of light, the curvature of spacetime would be reduced, resulting in altered gravitational forces. This could potentially lead to differences in the way planets orbit their stars and the way galaxies interact with each other. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Changes in the Electromagnetic Spectrum: The reduced speed of light would also affect the electromagnetic spectrum. The longer wavelengths of light, such as radio waves and microwaves, would be affected more than shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays and gamma rays. This could result in changes to the way we communicate and interact with the universe, as different frequencies of light would be affected differently. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "New Forms of Energy: A reduced speed of light could also lead to new forms of energy. According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases. With a reduced speed of light, the mass of an object would be reduced, potentially leading to new forms of energy that are more efficient and sustainable. Confidence Score: 0.6"
