    "**Multi-Functional Microwave with Built-in Air Fryer**: Combine the traditional microwave function with an air fryer. This appliance would allow users to not only heat and cook food quickly but also achieve that crispy texture associated with frying, all without the need for excess oil. The microwave could have different compartments to separate functions, ensuring even cooking and easy cleaning.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Microwave**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam technology to sanitize and clean the interior. Users would simply fill a designated reservoir with water, and the microwave would heat it to create steam, loosening food particles and grime. After the cycle, the user can wipe down the interior with minimal effort, keeping the microwave clean and hygienic without harsh chemicals.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Hub**: Create a microwave that connects to a recipe app via Wi-Fi. Users can browse and select recipes on their smartphones or tablets, and the microwave will automatically adjust cooking times and settings based on the chosen recipe. It could also provide notifications when the food is ready or when it needs to be stirred, making cooking more intuitive and less error-prone.",
    "**Modular Microwave Design**: Design a modular microwave that allows users to customize their appliance based on their cooking needs. Users could choose different attachments such as a grill, steam basket, or convection oven feature, which can be easily swapped out depending on what theyâ€™re cooking. This approach would reduce the need for multiple appliances and save kitchen space.",
    "**Health Monitoring Microwave**: Incorporate health monitoring technology that tracks nutritional information and suggests healthier cooking methods. The microwave could analyze the food being cooked and provide feedback on calorie count, fat content, and other nutritional values. It could even suggest alternatives for healthier meal prep, promoting a more health-conscious cooking environment."
