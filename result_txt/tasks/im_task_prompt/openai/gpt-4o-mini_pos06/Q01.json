    "**Personalized Aromatherapy Feature**: Incorporate a micro-diffuser into the wristwatch that can release essential oils or scents based on the wearer’s mood or activity. Users could select scents through an app that corresponds with relaxation, focus, or energy, providing a multi-sensory experience that enhances well-being throughout the day.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring**: Develop a watch that not only tracks heart rate and steps but also incorporates advanced health monitoring features like blood glucose levels, hydration levels, and stress indicators. Using non-invasive sensors, the watch could provide real-time health insights and reminders, making it a personal health assistant.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a wristwatch with a modular design that allows users to customize and swap out different components, such as straps, watch faces, and even functional modules (e.g., a fitness tracker, GPS, or a camera). This way, users can personalize their watch based on their daily activities and style preferences, promoting sustainability by reducing the need for multiple devices.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Incorporate AR technology that allows the watch to project information onto surfaces in the user’s environment. For example, when the user looks at a restaurant, the watch could project reviews or menus. This feature could also be used for navigation, showing directions on the ground in front of the user.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a wristwatch made entirely from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics, recycled metals, and organic fabrics for the straps. Additionally, the watch could feature solar charging capabilities, reducing the need for battery replacements and minimizing environmental impact."
