    "Pet-Friendly Campus: At this school, students will learn alongside pets, such as dogs, cats, and even birds. The pets will be trained to assist the teachers in the classroom, providing emotional support and helping students with special needs. For example, a dog could be trained to recognize when a student is feeling anxious and provide comfort, while a cat could help a student with ADHD stay focused. The pets will also be integrated into the curriculum, teaching students about animal behavior, care, and conservation.",
    "Pet Therapy Programs: This school will offer pet therapy programs, where trained animals will be brought into the classroom to help students with mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The animals will be trained to provide emotional support and comfort, and students will learn how to interact with them in a safe and respectful manner. This program will be especially beneficial for students who may struggle with traditional teaching methods or who have difficulty expressing themselves.",
    "Pet-Based Learning: In this school, pets will be used as a teaching tool to help students learn various subjects, such as science, math, and language arts. For example, a class studying the life cycle of a butterfly could raise butterflies in the classroom and observe their development, while a class studying the water cycle could have a pet fish that demonstrates the concept of evaporation and condensation. This hands-on approach to learning will make the material more engaging and memorable for students.",
    "Pet-Assisted Learning: At this school, pets will be used to help students with cognitive and physical disabilities learn and develop new skills. For example, a dog could be trained to assist a student with autism in learning social skills, while a horse could be used to help a student with physical disabilities develop balance and coordination. The pets will be trained to provide emotional support and assistance, and students will learn how to interact with them in a safe and respectful manner.",
