    "**Pet Bed or Play Area**: Repurpose an old pillow as a cozy bed or play area for your pets. Dogs and cats love soft surfaces, and a pillow can be an inviting space for them to lounge or play. You can even decorate it with fun fabric or patterns to match your home decor, making it a stylish addition to your living space.",
    "**Travel Neck Support**: Instead of buying a specialized travel pillow, use a standard pillow to create a custom neck support for long trips. By folding it in half or rolling it, you can mold it to fit your neck comfortably, preventing stiffness and discomfort during flights or road trips. Plus, it can double as a back support for lumbar support in car seats.",
    "**DIY Photography Prop**: Use pillows as unique props in photography sessions. They can add texture and color to portraits or product shots. For instance, you can arrange pillows in various shapes and sizes on a bed or sofa to create a visually appealing backdrop for lifestyle photos, making your images pop with comfort and style.",
    "**Artistic Wall Hangings**: Get crafty and turn pillows into artistic wall hangings. By sewing or attaching fabric-covered pillows to a wooden frame or directly to the wall, you can create a 3D art piece that adds depth and softness to your interior design. This can be particularly effective in children's rooms or play areas.",
    "**Scented Relaxation Aid**: Create a calming relaxation aid by filling a pillowcase with dried lavender, chamomile, or other soothing herbs. This aromatic pillow can be placed under your head while sleeping or used as a calming element during meditation or yoga. The natural scents can help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality."
