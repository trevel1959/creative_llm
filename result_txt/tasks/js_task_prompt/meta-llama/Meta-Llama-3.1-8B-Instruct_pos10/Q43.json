    "**Virtual Reality Architect**: I would use my ability to see through walls to design and visualize building structures, spaces, and layouts without the need for physical models or blueprints. I could see the internal structure of buildings, pipes, electrical wiring, and other infrastructure, allowing me to create accurate and efficient designs. This power would revolutionize the architecture and construction industries, enabling faster and more cost-effective project development.",
    "**Historical Detective**: With the ability to see through walls, I would uncover hidden secrets and lost artifacts from historical sites and buildings. I could reveal the layout of ancient cities, locate hidden treasures, and understand the evolution of architectural styles and techniques. This power would allow me to contribute significantly to historical research and preservation efforts, shedding new light on the past.",
    "**Environmental Investigator**: I would use my ability to see through walls to monitor and track environmental changes, such as pollution, climate shifts, and natural disasters. By observing the internal structure of the Earth, I could identify areas of high pollution, track the movement of pollutants, and predict natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes. This power would enable me to contribute to environmental conservation efforts and help mitigate the effects of human activities on the planet.",
    "**Medical Diagnostician**: With the ability to see through walls, I would be able to visualize the internal structure of the human body, allowing me to diagnose medical conditions and track the progression of diseases. I could see tumors, internal injuries, and other health issues, enabling me to develop targeted treatments and interventions. This power would revolutionize the medical field, saving countless lives and improving healthcare outcomes.",
    "**Urban Planner**: I would use my ability to see through walls to optimize urban planning and development. By visualizing the internal structure of buildings and infrastructure, I could identify areas of inefficiency, predict traffic patterns, and design more effective transportation systems. This power would enable me to create more livable, sustainable, and efficient cities, improving the quality of life for urban residents."
