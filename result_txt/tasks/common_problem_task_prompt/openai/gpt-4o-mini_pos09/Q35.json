    "**Financial Sustainability**: Zoos often rely on ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships to fund their operations. Economic downturns or shifts in public interest can lead to financial strain. If a zoo fails to generate enough revenue, it may struggle to maintain animal care, staff salaries, and facility upkeep, leading to a decline in the quality of the zoo experience.",
    "**Public Safety**: Ensuring the safety of visitors is critical. Incidents such as animal escapes, visitor interactions with animals, or accidents within the zoo can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. Zoos must implement stringent safety protocols, staff training, and emergency response plans to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Conservation Efforts**: While many zoos claim to focus on conservation, the reality can be complex. Issues may arise if a zoo does not actively participate in breeding programs or habitat restoration efforts. Failing to align with global conservation goals can lead to criticism from animal rights organizations and the public, undermining the zoo's mission.",
    "**Staffing Challenges**: A zoo requires a diverse range of skilled professionals, including zookeepers, veterinarians, educators, and maintenance staff. High turnover rates, staff burnout, or lack of training can lead to operational inefficiencies and impact animal care. Recruiting and retaining passionate staff who are committed to the zoo's mission is essential but can be challenging.",
    "**Visitor Engagement and Education**: A zoo's success often hinges on its ability to engage and educate visitors. If exhibits are outdated or lack interactive elements, visitor interest may wane. Zoos must continually innovate and offer educational programs that resonate with audiences, fostering a connection between visitors and wildlife."
