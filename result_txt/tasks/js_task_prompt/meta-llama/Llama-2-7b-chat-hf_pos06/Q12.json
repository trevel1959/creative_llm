    "Adaptation: The first and most obvious difference would be the need to adapt to the underwater environment. This would involve developing gills or other breathing organs to extract oxygen from the water, as well as a waterproof skin to protect against the pressure and corrosive properties of seawater. This adaptation would require significant changes to the body's physiology and would likely take generations to fully develop. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Lighting: Since sunlight cannot penetrate deep into the ocean, underwater life would need to rely on bioluminescence or other light sources to illuminate their surroundings. This could lead to a world of eerie, glowing creatures and landscapes, with the ability to manipulate light and color for communication and mood. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Housing: Living underwater would require a completely different approach to shelter and housing. Structures would need to be designed to withstand the pressure of the water, potentially using materials like coral or shells, and could take on unique forms like giant sponges or sea fans. The interiors could be designed for comfort and functionality, with built-in water filtration systems and specialized furniture. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Transportation: With no landmasses to travel across, underwater transportation would need to be reimagined. This could involve the development of advanced propulsion systems, such as magnetic levitation or hydrogen fuel cells, to power submersibles or other underwater vehicles. Alternatively, creatures like dolphins or whales could be used as mode of transportation, allowing for a unique and environmentally-friendly way to travel. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Cuisine: Living underwater would present a wealth of culinary opportunities, with a vast array of seafood and other ocean-based ingredients to choose from. Dishes could be designed to take advantage of the unique flavors and textures of these ingredients, such as seaweed-wrapped fish or algae-based desserts. Confidence score: 0.9"
