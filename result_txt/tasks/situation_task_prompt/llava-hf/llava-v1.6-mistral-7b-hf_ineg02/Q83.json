    "Embrace the Daylight: Without night-time, the world would be bathed in natural light all day, every day. This could lead to a more active and vibrant atmosphere, as people might engage in outdoor activities and events during the day, rather than relying on artificial lighting in the evenings.",
    "Develop New Nightlife: With no night-time, the nightlife industry would need to reinvent itself. Instead of bars, clubs, and late-night restaurants, the entertainment industry might focus on daytime activities, such as daytime festivals, outdoor concerts, and day-to-night events that cater to the new daylight cycle.",
    "Redesign Urban Spaces: In a world without night-time, cities would have to redesign their urban spaces to accommodate the new daylight cycle. This could include creating more public spaces, such as parks and plazas, where people can gather during the day, as well as designing buildings with more natural light and open spaces.",
    "Embrace the Digital Age: In a world without night-time, people would rely more heavily on technology to stay connected and entertained. This could lead to the development of new digital platforms, such as virtual reality experiences, immersive video games, and online streaming services that can be enjoyed during the day.",
    "Develop New Sleep Technologies: To adapt to the new daylight cycle, people might develop new sleep technologies, such as sleep pods that can be used during the day, or sleep-inducing devices that can help individuals fall asleep more easily."
