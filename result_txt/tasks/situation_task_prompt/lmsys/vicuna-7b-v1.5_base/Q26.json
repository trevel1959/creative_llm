    "Create a Compass: Another way to navigate without maps or GPS is to create a compass using a magnetized needle or a piece of iron. To do this, find a magnetized needle or piece of iron and suspend it in a container filled with water. The needle or iron will point north due to the Earth's magnetic field. Once you have your compass, you can use it to determine your heading and navigate accordingly.",
    "Use the Stars as a Guide: Navigating by the stars is an ancient practice that can still be used today. By identifying constellations and other celestial bodies, you can determine your latitude and longitude. For example, the Big Dipper can be used to find the North Star, which is located near the Earth's north pole. The North Star can then be used to determine your latitude, while other stars and constellations can be used to determine your longitude.",
    "Follow Rivers and Streams: Following rivers and streams can be an effective way to navigate without maps or GPS. Rivers and streams often follow a predictable path, and by following them, you can determine your location and head in the right direction. Additionally, rivers and streams can provide water and other resources, making them a valuable resource for navigation.",
    "Use Landmarks as a Guide: Landmarks such as mountains, hills, and other prominent features can be used to navigate without maps or GPS. By identifying these landmarks and using them as reference points, you can determine your location and head in the right direction. Additionally, landmarks can provide a sense of orientation and help you determine your heading.",
    "Ask for Directions: If all maps and navigation systems have disappeared, it may be necessary to ask for directions from other people. This can be done by approaching other travelers or locals and asking for help. People may be able to provide information about landmarks, rivers, and other features that can be used for navigation. Additionally, people may be able to provide information about the best routes and shortcuts to take."
