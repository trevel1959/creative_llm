    "**Language Barriers**: A foreign exchange student may not be fluent in the host family's language, leading to communication difficulties. This can result in frustration, miscommunication, or feelings of isolation for the student. To address this, the host family can use visual aids, simple language, and patience, while also encouraging the student to practice their language skills through games or informal conversations.",
    "**Homesickness**: The student may experience homesickness, missing their family, friends, and familiar surroundings. This emotional struggle can impact their adjustment and overall experience. To help, the host family can create a supportive environment, schedule regular video calls with the student's family, and involve the student in local activities to help them feel more connected and integrated.",
    "**Different Dietary Preferences**: The student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences based on their culture, religion, or personal choices (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, halal). This can lead to conflicts or dissatisfaction during meal times. The host family should discuss dietary needs upfront and involve the student in meal planning and preparation, allowing them to share their culinary traditions and preferences.",
    "**Adjusting to Different Educational Systems**: The foreign exchange student may find it challenging to adapt to a different educational system, which may have different teaching styles, grading systems, and expectations. This can lead to academic stress or confusion. To ease this transition, the host family can communicate with the student's school to understand the curriculum and offer tutoring or support for subjects that may be particularly challenging.",
    "**Social Integration**: The student might struggle to make friends and feel included in social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness or alienation. To foster social integration, the host family can introduce the student to local peers, involve them in community events, and encourage participation in clubs or sports that align with the student's interests, helping them build a support network."
