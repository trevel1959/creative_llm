    "Once upon a time in a mystical forest, there lived a unicorn named Lira who, unlike her kin, was born without a horn. She felt different and often wandered alone, envious of the majestic unicorns who dazzled the forest with their shimmering horns. One day, while exploring a hidden glade, Lira stumbled upon a group of woodland creatures in distress. A fierce storm had trapped them in a fallen tree. Using her strength and compassion, Lira guided them to safety. In that moment, she realized that true magic lies not in appearance but in the heart. The forest celebrated her bravery, and Lira found her own unique spark.",
