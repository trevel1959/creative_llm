    "**Temporal Tourism:** Establish a regulated time travel industry, where tourists can visit historical events and meet legendary figures. This could lead to a new form of cultural exchange, where people from different eras can learn from each other and share their perspectives. However, this would also raise concerns about disrupting the timeline and causing paradoxes.",
    "**Time Travel for Environmental Conservation:** Use time travel to go back in time and prevent environmental disasters, such as oil spills or deforestation. This could be achieved by identifying key moments in history where human actions led to significant environmental damage and correcting them. However, this raises questions about the Butterfly Effect and whether small changes could have unforeseen consequences.",
    "**Historical Justice:** Use time travel to rectify past injustices, such as the treatment of minority groups or the oppression of certain cultures. This could involve going back in time to prevent historical events that led to suffering and marginalization. However, this raises concerns about interfering with the natural course of history and potentially creating new problems.",
    "**Personal Redemption:** Allow individuals to travel back in time to correct past mistakes or regrets. This could be achieved through a process of self-reflection and personal growth, where individuals learn from their past errors and make amends. However, this raises questions about the ethics of altering one's own past and the potential consequences of changing the course of one's life.",
    "**Temporal Archaeology:** Use time travel to explore and document historical events and sites in a way that was previously impossible. This could involve sending teams of archaeologists and historians back in time to gather data and artifacts, providing a more complete understanding of the past. However, this raises concerns about the potential for cultural contamination and the impact of modern technology on historical sites."
