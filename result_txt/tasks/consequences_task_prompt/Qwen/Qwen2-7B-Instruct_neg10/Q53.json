    "**Biodegradable Construction Materials**: Create construction materials like beams, panels, and insulation that can degrade naturally over time without harming the environment. This could reduce the environmental impact of building projects and facilitate easier demolition and recycling processes.",
    "**Biodegradable Textiles**: Design a range of textiles that decompose in soil or water just like paper. This could be particularly useful for clothing and other textile products, potentially reducing waste and pollution from discarded garments.",
    "**Smart Biodegradable Electronics**: Develop electronics components and devices that not only use biodegradable materials but also incorporate self-destruct mechanisms to ensure they break down after a certain period of use, eliminating electronic waste.",
    "**Biodegradable Food Containers**: Introduce food containers and utensils made from biodegradable plastics that degrade within a short timeframe when disposed of. This would significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.",
    "**Biodegradable Plastics for Agriculture**: Create agricultural mulch films and plant pots that biodegrade in soil, providing nutrients to the plants while reducing plastic waste in farming practices."
