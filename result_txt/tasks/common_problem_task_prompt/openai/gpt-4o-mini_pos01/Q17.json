    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and the influx of tourists can lead to significant environmental degradation. To address this, organizers could adopt sustainable practices, such as utilizing eco-friendly materials for construction, ensuring waste management systems are in place, and promoting green transportation options. Additionally, a portion of the Olympic budget could be allocated to local environmental restoration projects to offset the carbon footprint.",
    "**Economic Disparity**: While hosting the Olympics can boost local economies, it can also exacerbate economic disparities. Local businesses may struggle to compete with large corporate sponsors. To combat this, organizers could create initiatives that prioritize local vendors and artisans, ensuring that a significant portion of the Olympic budget is directed toward small businesses and community projects, thereby promoting inclusive economic growth.",
    "**Security Challenges**: High-profile events like the Olympics can attract security threats, ranging from terrorism to protests. To enhance safety, host cities should invest in comprehensive security measures, including surveillance technology, crowd management strategies, and community engagement programs to foster trust between law enforcement and local residents. Additionally, hosting public forums on security measures can help alleviate public concerns.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics often showcase a multitude of cultures, which can lead to misunderstandings or cultural appropriation. To address this, organizers could create a cultural ambassador program that promotes local traditions and educates visitors about the host country's customs. This initiative could include workshops, performances, and art exhibitions that highlight the host nation's heritage while encouraging respectful engagement from international visitors.",
    "**Post-Olympic Utilization of Venues**: After the Olympics, many venues may fall into disuse, leading to wasted resources. To prevent this, host cities could develop a long-term plan for the sustainable use of Olympic facilities. This might include converting sports venues into community centers, schools, or training facilities for local athletes, ensuring that the benefits of hosting the Olympics extend well beyond the event itself."
