    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Virtual Reality Display: Imagine a steering wheel with a built-in virtual reality display that provides a 360-degree view of the surrounding environment. This technology would allow drivers to see what's around them without having to take their eyes off the road. The display could be projected onto the steering wheel using advanced LED technology, providing a clear and immersive visual experience. This feature would be especially useful for drivers who frequently find themselves in heavy traffic or navigating unfamiliar roads.",
    "Steering Wheel with Integrated Biometric Sensors: A steering wheel with integrated biometric sensors could monitor a driver's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, and provide real-time feedback to help them stay alert and focused on the road. For example, if the sensors detect a rapid heart rate or elevated blood pressure, the steering wheel could vibrate or provide a gentle buzz to alert the driver to take a break. This feature would be particularly useful for long-distance drivers who may be prone to fatigue or drowsiness.",
    "Steering Wheel with Personalized Settings: A steering wheel with personalized settings could allow drivers to customize the feel and functionality of the wheel to their individual preferences. For example, drivers could adjust the height and angle of the wheel, the amount of resistance, and the sensitivity of the steering, providing a more comfortable and intuitive driving experience. This feature would be especially useful for drivers with disabilities or those who prefer a specific driving style.",
    "Steering Wheel with Augmented Reality Display: An augmented reality display on the steering wheel could provide drivers with real-time information about their surroundings, such as traffic conditions, road signs, and even pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The display could use advanced AR technology to superimpose this information onto the driver's field of view, providing a more immersive and interactive driving experience. This feature would be particularly useful for drivers who frequently encounter heavy traffic or complex roadways.",
    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Safety Features: A steering wheel with built-in safety features could include sensors that monitor the driver's attention and alertness, providing real-time feedback to help them stay focused on the"
