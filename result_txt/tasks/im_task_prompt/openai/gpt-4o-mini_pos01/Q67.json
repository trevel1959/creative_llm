    "**Adjustable Bristle Density**: Design a paintbrush with adjustable bristle density that can be modified based on the type of paint or technique being used. Users could twist a dial on the handle to increase or decrease the number of bristles in contact with the surface, allowing for more control over strokes, from fine detail work to broad washes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Paintbrush**: Create a paintbrush with a built-in self-cleaning mechanism. This could involve a reservoir in the handle that holds a cleaning solution. After use, the artist could press a button that sends the cleaning solution through the bristles, effectively flushing out paint residue and making cleanup faster and easier.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Pressure Sensors**: Develop a paintbrush with an ergonomic grip that incorporates pressure sensors. This would provide real-time feedback to the artist about how much pressure they are applying, helping them to adjust their technique for different effects. The brush could connect to an app that offers tutorials and tips based on the artist's grip and pressure.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Introduce a paintbrush system with interchangeable heads that can be easily swapped out for different techniques, such as fine lines, broad strokes, or stippling. This modular design would allow artists to carry fewer tools and quickly adapt to different painting styles without needing multiple brushes.",
    "**Integrated Palette on Handle**: Incorporate a small, detachable palette into the handle of the paintbrush. This palette could hold a small amount of paint, allowing artists to mix colors on the go without needing a separate palette. The design could also include a small mixing area and a lid to keep the paint fresh when not in use."
