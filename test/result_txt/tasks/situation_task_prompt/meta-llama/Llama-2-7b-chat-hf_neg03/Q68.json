    "Build a global art installation: As the last person on Earth, I would use my time to create a massive art installation that showcases the beauty and diversity of human culture.

The symphony would be a celebration of the beauty and complexity of the universe, and a reminder of our place within it.",
    "Create a personal museum: As the last person on Earth, I would have the unique opportunity to curate a personal museum that showcases my own artistic and cultural heritage.

I would explore the origins of the cosmos, the evolution of life, and the fate of humanity, all through the lens of a single character's journey. The novel would be a sweeping epic that spans billions of years and countless worlds, and would offer a unique perspective on the nature of existence and the human experience.",
