    "**Scent Mapping**: I would use advanced technology to create a digital map of various natural scents, such as flowers, trees, and spices. This map would be used to create a database of fragrance profiles, which could be combined and manipulated to create new, unique scents.",
    "**Bioluminescent Fragrances**: I would work with biologists to create fragrances that are produced by living organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria. These bioluminescent scents would be harvested and used to create a new line of fragrances.",
    "**Fragrance Harvesting from Insects**: I would research and develop a method to harvest fragrances from insects, such as bees or butterflies. This could be done by analyzing the chemical composition of their scent glands and replicating the fragrances in a lab.",
    "**Plant-Based Fragrance Extraction**: I would use advanced technology to extract fragrances from plants in a more efficient and sustainable way. This could involve using ultrasonic waves or other non-invasive methods to release the fragrances from plant cells.",
    "**Aromatic Algae**: I would work with marine biologists to create fragrances from algae, which are rich in aromatic compounds. This could involve cultivating specific strains of algae and extracting their fragrances to create a new line of eco-friendly perfumes."
