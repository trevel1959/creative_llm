    "**Modular Attachments**: Design a hair dryer with interchangeable attachments that cater to different styling needs. For instance, one attachment could be a diffuser for curly hair, another could be a concentrator for sleek styles, and a third could be a volumizing brush. This modular approach would allow users to customize their drying experience and reduce the need for multiple styling tools.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Introduce an eco-friendly mode that reduces energy consumption by optimizing the drying time based on the user's hair length and thickness. The hair dryer could also be made from sustainable materials and incorporate a low-energy motor that still delivers powerful airflow, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Built-in Ionic Technology**: Enhance the hair dryer with advanced ionic technology that releases negative ions to reduce frizz and static. This feature could be adjustable, allowing users to select the level of ionization based on their hair type. Additionally, a built-in air purification system could help filter out pollutants and allergens from the air while drying.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with a Rotating Handle**: Redesign the hair dryer with an ergonomic handle that rotates 360 degrees, allowing for easier maneuverability and reducing wrist strain during use. The lightweight design would make it comfortable to hold for extended periods, especially for those with long hair or who frequently style their hair.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning function that uses a high-temperature blast of air to remove lint and hair buildup from the dryerâ€™s filter. This would ensure optimal performance and longevity of the device while reducing maintenance for the user. A notification system could alert users when cleaning is needed."
