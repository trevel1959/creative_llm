    "**A Floating City in the Ocean**: Imagine a city built entirely from eco-friendly materials that floats on the ocean's surface. This floating city would have vertical gardens, wind turbines for energy, and a water filtration system to recycle and clean its water. It could serve as an example of sustainable living and inspire similar projects around the world.",
    "**A Bioluminescent Forest**: In a remote area, a new type of forest is created where trees are genetically engineered to emit light when touched or shaken. This could not only provide a unique source of light in the dark but also attract visitors looking for an otherworldly experience. The forest would also incorporate sustainable practices, such as solar-powered lighting systems and eco-tourism activities.",
    "**A Time Capsule Mountain**: A mountain is built to contain a time capsule filled with artifacts representing modern life and culture. The capsule would be placed deep within the mountain, which can be accessed only by a series of complex puzzles and challenges, symbolizing the effort required to preserve history. This monument would encourage people to reflect on their past while imagining future possibilities.",
    "**An Underwater Museum of Future Technology**: Located off the coast of a popular tourist destination, this museum would showcase prototypes and models of futuristic technology. Visitors would experience interactive exhibits and virtual reality demonstrations that allow them to explore the future of transportation, communication, and energy. This museum would educate the public about technological advancements and inspire innovation.",
    "**A Solar-Powered Sky City**: A high-rise city constructed entirely from transparent, energy-efficient materials that harness sunlight. This city would have a complex network of solar panels, vertical gardens, and wind turbines to generate electricity and manage waste. It would demonstrate how urban areas can become self-sufficient in terms of energy production, setting a new standard for sustainable urban development."
