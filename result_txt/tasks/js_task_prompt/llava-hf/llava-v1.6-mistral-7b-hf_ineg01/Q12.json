    "**Underwater Farming**: Agriculture and food production would look very different underwater. Aquaponics and underwater gardening could become more prevalent, where plants and animals are grown in a symbiotic system that recycles water and nutrients. This could lead to new, sustainable food sources.",
    "**Underwater Education**: Schools and universities could be transformed into underwater campuses, providing a unique learning environment that could foster creativity and a deeper understanding of marine life and ecosystems.",
    "**Underwater Sports**: Sports would be adapted to the underwater environment, such as underwater soccer, basketball, and swimming races. Swimming would be the primary mode of transportation, and new sports would likely be developed to take advantage of the buoyancy and resistance of water.",
    "**Underwater Tourism**: Tourism would be a major industry, with people visiting underwater cities and resorts for a unique vacation experience. This could lead to the development of new underwater attractions, like underwater museums, restaurants, and casinos.",
    "**Underwater Art and Architecture**: Art and architecture would be influenced by the underwater environment, with a focus on organic shapes, bioluminescent materials, and aquatic life. Buildings and sculptures could be designed to interact with the surrounding water, creating a seamless integration with the environment."
