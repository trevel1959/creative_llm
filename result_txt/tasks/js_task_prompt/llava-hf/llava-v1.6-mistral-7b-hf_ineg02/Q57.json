    "**Citizen-Elected Representatives**: This form of government would involve citizens directly electing representatives to make decisions on their behalf. These representatives would be accountable to the citizens and would have to adhere to strict codes of conduct to ensure they are acting in the best interest of their constituents.",
    "**Citizen-Initiated Referendums**: In this model, citizens would have the power to propose and vote on laws and policies directly. This would allow for a more responsive government that is able to adapt to the needs and desires of the population.",
    "**Citizen-Jury System**: This form of government would involve randomly selected citizens serving as jurors to make decisions on various issues. These juries would be diverse and representative of the population, ensuring that decisions are made fairly and equitably.",
    "**Holacratic Governance**: In this model, decision-making power would be distributed among a network of self-organizing teams, rather than being centralized in a single entity. This would allow for a more flexible and adaptable system, where individuals and teams can respond quickly to changing circumstances.",
    "**Blockchain-Based Democracy**: This form of government would leverage blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent voting system. Citizens would use their digital identities to vote on issues, and the blockchain would ensure that votes are counted accurately and fairly."
