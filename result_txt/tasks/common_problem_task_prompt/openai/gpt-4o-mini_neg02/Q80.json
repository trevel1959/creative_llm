    "**Eco-Conscious Catering**: Catering can be a significant source of waste and carbon emissions. A problem may arise if the chosen caterer does not prioritize local, organic, or seasonal ingredients. To mitigate this, couples can seek caterers who specialize in farm-to-table dining, offer plant-based options, and use compostable or reusable serving materials. Creating a menu that highlights local produce not only supports the community but also minimizes transportation emissions.",
    "**Sustainable Attire Choices**: The wedding attire can contribute to environmental issues, particularly if the couple opts for fast fashion or new garments. A problem here is the waste generated from single-use or disposable clothing. To combat this, couples can consider renting attire, purchasing second-hand, or choosing designers who use sustainable fabrics. Additionally, they could encourage their guests to wear outfits they already own or borrow from friends, promoting a culture of reusing.",
    "**Waste Management and Recycling**: During a wedding, waste can accumulate quickly, leading to environmental concerns. A common issue is the lack of proper waste disposal options at the venue. To address this, couples can implement a comprehensive waste management plan that includes clearly labeled recycling and composting bins. Collaborating with a local waste management company that specializes in eco-friendly practices can ensure that the waste generated is handled responsibly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decor**: Traditional wedding decor often involves single-use items that contribute to landfill waste. A potential problem is sourcing decorations that are both beautiful and sustainable. Couples can explore options like renting decor items, using potted plants that guests can take home, or opting for natural elements like flowers that are in season and locally sourced. DIY projects using recycled materials can also add a personal touch while reducing waste.",
    "**Transportation Emissions**: Guests traveling to the wedding can create a significant carbon footprint. A problem arises if there are no sustainable transportation options available. To alleviate this, couples can encourage carpooling, provide shuttle services from local hotels, or select a venue that is easily accessible via public transportation. Additionally, including information about local transport options in the wedding invitation can help guests make eco-conscious choices."
