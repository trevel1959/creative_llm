    "**Modular Mini-Me**: Design a tiny, portable computer that can be built using interchangeable modules. Each module would contain a specific component, such as a CPU, GPU, or storage drive. Users could mix and match modules to create a customized system that fits their needs. The Mini-Me would be small enough to fit in a pocket, making it perfect for travel or everyday use.",
    "**The Brain-Computer Interface Box**: Develop a computer system that uses brain signals to control the device. This would be achieved through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, which would read brain activity and translate it into computer commands. Users could control the computer with their thoughts, making it an innovative tool for people with disabilities or those who want to experience a new level of interaction.",
    "**The Self-Healing Computer**: Create a computer system that can repair itself in real-time. This would be achieved through the use of self-healing materials, such as shape-memory alloys or polymers, that can detect and repair damage to the system. The computer would be able to adapt to changing conditions and maintain its performance, reducing the need for maintenance and repairs.",
    "**The Quantum Computer Cube**: Design a computer system that uses quantum computing principles to process information. The Quantum Computer Cube would be a compact, cube-shaped device that uses quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations. This would enable the computer to solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable with traditional computers, making it a powerful tool for fields such as cryptography and materials science.",
    "**The Eco-Friendly Computer Tree**: Develop a computer system that is powered by a living tree. The Eco-Friendly Computer Tree would use the natural energy generated by the tree's photosynthesis to power the system. The computer would be designed to be sustainable and environmentally friendly, using recycled materials and minimizing waste. The tree would also serve as a natural air purifier, making it a unique and innovative solution for a computer system. [/INST] [/INST] "
