    "**Symbol of Unity**: This design would feature two hands coming together to form a circle. The hands could be stylized as different skin tones, emphasizing unity and diversity. Inside the circle, a dove might be depicted flying towards the center, representing the peace it brings. This symbol aims to emphasize that peace is a shared goal, regardless of individual differences.",
    "**Cyclical Wave**: Imagine a wave-like symbol, with the crest of the wave being a circle. The wave could be represented by multiple lines radiating outwards from the circle, symbolizing the ripple effect of peace when achieved in one part of society spreading to others. The circle represents the continuous nature of peace, always needing to be nurtured and maintained.",
    "**Interlocking Circles**: A series of interlocking circles, each slightly larger than the previous, forming a chain. Each circle represents a different level or group in society (e.g., individuals, families, communities, nations). The circles are interlocked to show that peace must be built collectively across all levels for it to truly exist everywhere.",
    "**Tree of Peace**: This design features a tree with roots reaching deep into the earth, symbolizing stability and grounding. The branches reach upwards, extending peace beyond its origins. Leaves on the branches could be shaped like hands, holding leaves, symbolizing the giving and receiving of peace. The tree could also incorporate elements like birds sitting on the branches, symbolizing harmony and freedom.",
    "**Cosmic Harmony**: Imagine a design that incorporates elements of both Earth and the cosmos. It could start with a globe representing our planet, surrounded by symbols of celestial bodies such as moons, stars, and planets. These celestial elements could be connected to the globe by lines, suggesting that peace is not just a local concern but an interstellar value. Stars and moons could be further adorned with patterns resembling interconnected paths, signifying how peace can spread across vast distances."
