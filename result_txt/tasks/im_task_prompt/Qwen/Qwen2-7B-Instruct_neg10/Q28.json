    "**Solar-Powered LED Lighting**: Integrate solar panels on the helmet to charge LED lights automatically during daylight hours. These lights would enhance visibility for the cyclist, especially during low-light conditions like dusk or dawn. The lights could be programmed to flash, strobe, or steady depending on the rider's preference or environmental conditions.",
    "**Customizable Airflow Design**: Allow users to customize the airflow through the helmet using interchangeable vents or internal fan systems. This would enable cyclists to adjust the helmet to their specific needs, whether they prefer a cool breeze during hot rides or better insulation against cold winds.",
    "**Integrative Health Monitoring**: Incorporate sensors that track the rider's heart rate, breathing patterns, and overall fitness levels. This information could be transmitted to a smartphone app for analysis and feedback, helping cyclists optimize their training routines and ensure they're staying within safe limits while exercising.",
    "**Inbuilt Audio and Video Recording**: Equip the helmet with high-quality microphones and cameras to capture audio and video footage of the ride. This feature would allow cyclists to document their adventures, share experiences with friends, and potentially use the footage for safety purposes (e.g., in case of accidents).",
    "**Personalized Safety Alert System**: Use GPS tracking and machine learning algorithms to create a system that learns the cyclist's typical riding patterns and alerts them when they deviate from those paths unexpectedly. It could also send notifications if the rider doesn't arrive at their destination within a specified time frame, allowing family members or friends to quickly check on their safety."
