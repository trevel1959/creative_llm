    "Uncontrollable Economic Boom: Erasing all world debt would result in a massive injection of liquidity into the global economy, leading to an uncontrollable economic boom. This would cause inflation to skyrocket, and the value of currencies to plummet. As a result, prices of goods and services would increase significantly, making it difficult for people to afford basic necessities.",
    "Unstable Financial Systems: The sudden elimination of debt would throw financial systems into chaos. Banks and other financial institutions would struggle to adapt to the new economic landscape, leading to instability in the financial sector. This could result in bank runs, as investors and depositors become wary of the safety of their funds.",
    "Redistribution of Wealth: Erasing all world debt would result in a significant redistribution of wealth. Those who had accumulated wealth through debt would suddenly find themselves with a windfall, while those who were deeply in debt would be left with nothing. This could lead to social unrest and inequality, as the wealthy would be able to take advantage of the situation, while the poor and vulnerable would be left behind.",
    "Lack of Investment: Without debt, there would be little incentive for investment. Without the threat of debt, investors would be less likely to invest in new projects or businesses, leading to a lack of economic growth and innovation. This could result in a stagnant economy, with little room for progress or improvement.",
    "New Forms of Debt: In the absence of traditional debt, new forms of debt could emerge. For example, people might turn to alternative forms of debt, such as peer-to-peer lending or cryptocurrency-based lending. These new forms of debt could carry different risks and challenges, potentially leading to new financial crises in the future."
