    "**Color Changer**: Develop a paintbrush with interchangeable color cartridges. Each cartridge would contain a specific color of paint, and the user could switch between colors by simply replacing the cartridge. This would save time and reduce waste, as users wouldn't need to clean and reuse paintbrushes.",
    "**Sensory Stimulator**: Create a paintbrush with built-in sensory stimulation technology. The brush could vibrate, provide a gentle buzzing sensation, or even release a calming scent to help users relax and focus while painting. This would be especially beneficial for artists who struggle with anxiety or creative blocks.",
    "**Smart Brush**: Develop a paintbrush with integrated sensors and AI technology. The brush could detect the user's painting style, color palette, and brushstrokes, providing real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement. It could also track the user's progress, offering insights and recommendations for future projects.",
    "**Eco-Friendly**: Design a paintbrush made from sustainable, eco-friendly materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or bioplastics. The brush could be biodegradable, compostable, or even edible, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Virtual Reality Painter**: Create a paintbrush that connects to a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing users to paint in a fully immersive, 3D environment. The brush could track the user's movements, allowing them to paint in mid-air or on virtual canvases."
