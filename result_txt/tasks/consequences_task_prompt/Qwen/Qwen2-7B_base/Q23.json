    "**Night time exploration**: Humans currently mostly engage in activities only during daylight hours. If we could see in the dark, there would be no constraint as to when we could explore new places or do dangerous activities.",
    "**Enhanced surveillance**: Night vision could be beneficial for military and security purposes. Soldiers and officers could use it to protect their communities/missions and easily spot enemies or intruders at night.",
    "**Medical diagnosis**: This skill might also bring significant benefits to the field of medicine. For instance, doctors conducting eye examinations or performing operations would benefit from clearer vision in low-light environments.",
    "**Enhanced underwater observation**: Humans can dive deep underwater, but current technology restricts visibility. If we could see in the dark, we would be able to observe the deep sea and its inhabitants in greater detail.",
    "**Improved night driving**: Many accidents occur at night when visibility is reduced. If humans had improved night vision, they could drive more safely at night, reducing accidents caused by poor visibility."
