    "Herbal Remedies: One potential approach to treating a common cold without medication would be to rely on traditional herbal remedies that have been used for centuries to alleviate symptoms. For example, ginger, peppermint, and echinacea have anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties that could help reduce congestion and soothe a sore throat. A tea made from these herbs, combined with honey or lemon for added flavor, could provide relief from a cold's symptoms.",
    "Saltwater Gargle: Another option would be to use saltwater gargles to help reduce swelling in the throat and loosen mucus. Mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water and gargling several times a day could help alleviate a sore throat and promote healing.",
    "Humidifier: A humidifier can help moisten the air and relieve congestion by adding moisture to the nasal passages and throat. This can be especially helpful for people who live in dry climates or have dry air in their homes.",
    "Eucalyptus Oil Inhaler: Eucalyptus oil has natural decongestant properties that can help relieve nasal congestion and promote relaxation. Creating an inhaler by mixing eucalyptus oil with water in a spray bottle and inhaling the vapor several times a day could provide relief from a cold's symptoms.",
    "Steam Inhalation: Steam inhalation is another effective way to relieve congestion and promote healing. Filling a bathroom with steam by boiling water or using a steam inhaler and inhaling the vapor several times a day can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to the water can enhance its decongestant properties."
