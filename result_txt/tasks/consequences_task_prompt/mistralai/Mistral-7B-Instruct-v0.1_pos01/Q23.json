    "However, if humans could see in the dark, it could also have negative consequences. For instance, it could disrupt the natural behavior of nocturnal animals, leading to their extinction. Additionally, it could cause us to become more reliant on artificial light, potentially leading to an increase in energy consumption.",
    "Another possibility is that if humans could see in the dark, we could develop new technologies and industries based on our ability to see in low light. For example, we could create more advanced security systems or develop new forms of entertainment, such as movies or video games that take place in dark environments.",
    "Furthermore, if humans could see in the dark, it could also have a significant impact on our mental health. For instance, it could lead to an increase in anxiety or depression, as we may become more aware of the darkness and the unknown.",
    "Finally, if humans could see in the dark, it could also have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. For example, we could observe celestial events and phenomena that we currently cannot see, potentially leading to new discoveries and insights about the nature of the universe."
