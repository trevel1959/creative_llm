    "**Interchangeable Plates for Versatility**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable cooking plates that allow users to create different types of waffles, such as Belgian, classic, or even stuffed waffles. The plates could be easily swapped out and come with unique shapes or patterns, like hearts or stars, to make breakfast more fun. This would appeal to families and those looking to impress guests with creative breakfast options.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Waffle Iron**: Introduce a waffle iron with a self-cleaning feature. After cooking, users can activate a cleaning mode that uses steam and heat to loosen and dislodge any batter residue. This could be done with a built-in water reservoir that heats up and creates steam, making the cleaning process easier and more efficient, saving time and effort for busy individuals.",
    "**Temperature Control and Sensing Technology**: Equip the waffle iron with advanced temperature control and sensing technology that adjusts cooking time and temperature based on the batter's thickness and moisture content. This feature would ensure perfectly cooked waffles every time, regardless of the recipe used. A digital display could show the current temperature and countdown timer, allowing users to achieve their desired level of crispiness.",
    "**Built-in Topping Dispenser**: Create a waffle iron with a built-in topping dispenser that allows users to add toppings while the waffles are cooking. This could include options for syrup, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or fruit. The dispenser could have different compartments and a user-friendly interface, enabling users to customize their waffles easily and create unique flavor combinations.",
    "**Portable Waffle Iron with Rechargeable Battery**: Design a compact, portable waffle iron that runs on a rechargeable battery, making it ideal for camping trips, picnics, or even just for use in small kitchens. This waffle iron could be lightweight and have a foldable design for easy storage. It would allow users to enjoy freshly made waffles anywhere, promoting outdoor cooking and versatility."
