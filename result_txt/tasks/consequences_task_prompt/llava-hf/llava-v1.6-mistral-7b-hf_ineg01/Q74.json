    "Environmental Impact: A single city would consume a disproportionate amount of resources, leading to a significant increase in pollution, waste generation, and resource depletion. The world's natural habitats would be destroyed to make way for the city, causing a loss of biodiversity and environmental degradation.",
    "Infrastructure Strain: The sheer number of people living in one city would put immense pressure on the existing infrastructure, such as roads, public transportation, and utilities. This would lead to frequent breakdowns, inadequate maintenance, and an overall decline in the quality of life for residents.",
    "Cultural Homogenization: As people from diverse backgrounds and cultures would be living in close proximity, there might be a loss of cultural diversity and identity. This could lead to a homogenization of cultural practices, art, and language, as dominant cultures might overshadow minority ones.",
    "Economic Disparity: With a single city housing the entire world population, there would be an unequal distribution of wealth and resources. The rich would become richer, while the poor would become poorer, leading to a widening income gap and social unrest.",
    "Health Issues: The concentration of people in one city would increase the risk of disease transmission, as the proximity of individuals would facilitate the spread of illnesses. Additionally, the lack of green spaces and the high-density living conditions would exacerbate health issues related to air pollution and stress."
