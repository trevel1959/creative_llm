    "**Self-Cleaning Hairbrush**:    Design a hairbrush with a self-cleaning mechanism. The bristles could be made from a material that repels hair and dirt, and after brushing, the user could simply press a button to activate a small vacuum that collects hair strands and debris. This would save time and ensure the brush remains hygienic and effective after each use.",
    "**Thermal Brush for Styling**:    Create a hairbrush that incorporates heat settings for styling purposes. This brush could feature built-in heating elements that allow users to style their hair as they brush, similar to a heated straightening brush. With adjustable temperature settings, users could achieve different styles, from straightening to curling, while minimizing heat damage.",
    "**Ergonomic Multi-Function Brush**:    Design a hairbrush that combines multiple functions into one tool. This could include a detangling feature, a scalp massager, and even a built-in mirror for convenience. The handle could be ergonomically designed for comfort and grip, allowing users to easily switch between functions, making hair care more efficient and enjoyable.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**:    Introduce a hairbrush with color-changing bristles that react to temperature or moisture levels. For example, the bristles could change color when they detect excess heat or humidity, alerting the user to adjust their styling products or techniques. This would add a fun and functional element to the hairbrush while also promoting better hair care practices.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**:    Develop a hairbrush with interchangeable heads tailored for different hair types and styling needs. Users could easily switch between detangling, smoothing, or styling heads, each designed with specific bristle patterns and materials. This would make the brush versatile and adaptable, catering to various hair textures and styles."
