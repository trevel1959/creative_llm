    "**Resistance from Stakeholders**: Various stakeholders, including local businesses, non-profit organizations, and community leaders, may resist the new policy due to perceived threats to their interests or existing practices. This resistance can result in pushback that hinders effective implementation. To address this, involving stakeholders in the policy-making process through consultations and feedback sessions can help foster collaboration and reduce opposition.",
    "**Insufficient Resources for Implementation**: Implementing a new policy often requires financial and human resources that may not be readily available. This can lead to delays, incomplete execution, or ineffective outcomes. To counter this issue, a thorough resource assessment should be conducted before the policy rollout, and a budget plan should be developed that outlines necessary funding and personnel allocation to support the policy's implementation.",
    "**Inadequate Training for Personnel**: Government employees and agencies responsible for enforcing the new policy may not have the necessary training or knowledge to implement it effectively. This can lead to inconsistent application and confusion among the public. To overcome this challenge, a structured training program should be developed to educate all relevant personnel about the policy, its implications, and best practices for implementation.",
    "**Technological Barriers**: If the new policy requires the use of technology (e.g., online reporting systems, data collection tools), there may be significant technological barriers for both government employees and the public. These barriers could include lack of access to technology, inadequate infrastructure, or insufficient digital literacy. To address this, a phased approach to implementation can be taken, with investments in technology infrastructure and training programs to ensure all parties can engage with the new system effectively.",
    "**Legal Challenges and Compliance Issues**: New policies may face legal challenges from individuals or groups who believe the policy infringes on their rights or conflicts with existing laws. This can result in delays and the need for revisions. To mitigate this risk, a legal review of the policy should be conducted before implementation, and a strategy for addressing potential legal challenges should be established."
