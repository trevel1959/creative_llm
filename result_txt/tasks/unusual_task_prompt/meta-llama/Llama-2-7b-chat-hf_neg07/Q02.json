    "Interactive Mirror: Create an interactive mirror that allows users to place their hand on a virtual rubber hand. The mirror will display a virtual version of their hand in real-time, allowing them to see how their movements and gestures are replicated on the virtual hand. Users can then use their real hand to manipulate the virtual hand, creating a sense of unity and ownership between their physical and virtual bodies.",
    "Virtual Reality Therapy: Develop a virtual reality therapy program that utilizes the rubber hand illusion to help individuals overcome phantom limb pain. By placing a patient's real hand in a virtual environment and replicating its movements, the program can help the brain re-map the sensory inputs and reduce the perceived pain. The program can also include guided meditation and relaxation techniques to further enhance the therapeutic effect.",
    "Telepresence Robot: Create a telepresence robot that incorporates a rubber hand. The robot will allow individuals to control a virtual arm and hand using their real hand, creating a sense of presence and agency in a remote environment. This can be particularly useful for individuals who are unable to move their real hand due to injury or illness, as they can still interact with their surroundings through the virtual hand.",
    "Haptic Feedback: Develop a haptic feedback system that utilizes the rubber hand illusion to provide users with a more immersive gaming experience. By attaching a haptic feedback device to the user's real hand, the system can replicate the sensation of touch and movement in the virtual environment, creating a more realistic and engaging experience.",
    "Mindfulness App: Create a mindfulness app that incorporates the rubber hand illusion as a tool for meditation and relaxation. The app will display a virtual hand that users can place their real hand on, and will use haptic feedback to replicate the sensation of the virtual hand's movements. By focusing on the sensation of the virtual hand, users can become more aware of their own body and mind, leading to a deeper state of relaxation and mindfulness."
