    "Sustainable and eco-friendly materials: Use eco-friendly materials for the candle's wax, wicks, and packaging. This could include soy wax, beeswax, or recycled materials.

For example, a \"Mood Lamp\" candle could change color or release a different scent based on the user's mood, while a \"Sound Candle\" could change the tone of a song or play a new one based on the user's preferences. This adds an element of surprise and delight to the candle-using experience.",

By creating a personalized candle, customers would feel a greater connection to the product and be more likely to use it regularly.",
    "Candle subscription service: Offer a subscription service where customers can receive a new, unique candle each month. This could feature a different scent, color, or design each month, and customers could choose their preferred frequency of delivery (e.g., monthly, bi-monthly, etc.). This service would appeal to customers who enjoy trying new products and appreciate the convenience of having a new candle delivered to their doorstep each month."
