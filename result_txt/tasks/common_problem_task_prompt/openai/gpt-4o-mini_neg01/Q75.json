    "**Environmental Degradation from Tourism**: High visitor numbers can lead to environmental degradation, including soil erosion, littering, and damage to flora and fauna. This not only affects the natural beauty of the park but can also disrupt local ecosystems. To combat this, park managers could introduce a visitor cap during peak seasons, establish designated paths and viewpoints to minimize off-trail exploration, and implement a \"Leave No Trace\" campaign to educate visitors on sustainable practices.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Invasive species can threaten native plants and animals, disrupting the ecological balance of the park. These species often outcompete native organisms for resources, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Effective management strategies could include regular monitoring of invasive species, implementing removal programs, and educating visitors on the importance of not introducing non-native plants or animals into the park.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: Climate change poses significant threats to national parks, including altered weather patterns, increased frequency of wildfires, and shifting habitats for wildlife. This can lead to changes in park accessibility and visitor experience. Park management could address these challenges by developing adaptive management plans that include climate resilience strategies, investing in fire prevention measures, and conducting research to understand how climate change is impacting local ecosystems.",
    "**Resource Allocation and Budget Constraints**: National parks often face budget constraints that limit their ability to maintain facilities, conduct research, and provide adequate staffing. This can lead to reduced visitor services and insufficient conservation efforts. To address this issue, park management could explore alternative funding sources such as grants, partnerships with local businesses, and volunteer programs to engage the community in park maintenance and conservation efforts.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Preservation**: Many national parks contain significant cultural and historical sites that require protection and preservation. Inadequate attention to these sites can lead to their deterioration or destruction. Park management should prioritize the documentation and conservation of cultural heritage, involve Indigenous communities in decision-making processes, and create interpretive programs that educate visitors about the historical significance of these sites."
