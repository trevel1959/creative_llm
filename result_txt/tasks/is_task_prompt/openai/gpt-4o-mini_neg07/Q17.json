The fish, once vibrant, now lay scattered like forgotten memories. A young girl named Mira wandered the desolate shore, clutching a seashell—a relic from the past. One day, she discovered a hidden cave where the last whispers of the ocean remained. Inside, she found a shimmering pearl that pulsed with energy. As she held it, visions of the ocean’s beauty flooded her mind. Determined to restore it, Mira vowed to share the pearl's magic, bringing hope back to her world.",
