Over time, the journal becomes a visual representation of their accomplishments, serving as a powerful motivator to continue tackling tasks.",

Users can relive these moments, making adjustments to optimize their workflow and develop strategies for future productivity.",
    "**Task Trophy Case**: Design a physical trophy case that users can display their completed tasks in. Each task is represented by a small, collectible token, which is placed in the case once completed.
