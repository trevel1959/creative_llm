    "**Eco-Friendly City of the Future**: Envision a city that is powered entirely by renewable energy sources, with a closed-loop ecosystem that minimizes waste and maximizes efficiency. The city would be designed to be self-sustaining, with vertical farms, green roofs, and advanced water management systems. Residents would live in modular, sustainable homes that are made from recycled materials and can be easily disassembled and reassembled. The city would also feature advanced public transportation systems, including self-driving cars and hyperloops, making it easy to get around without contributing to pollution.",
