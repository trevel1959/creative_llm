    "Digital Luggage Tag: Another idea is to replace the traditional, analog luggage tag with a digital one. This could include an e-ink screen that displays the traveler's contact information, destination, and any other relevant details. The digital tag could also have touch controls for easy updating and adjustment.",
    "Luggage Locator System: Another option is to develop a system where luggage tags have built-in GPS and a mobile app that helps track the location of the bags. Travelers would be able to see the location of their bags on a map and receive notifications when their bags are moving or if they are off their path.",
    "Smart Luggage Tag: A smart luggage tag could have features like a built-in scale, so travelers can keep track of their luggage weight to avoid overweight fees. It could also have a built-in lock, making it more secure and reducing the need for a separate padlock.",
    "Augmented Reality Luggage Identification: The luggage tag could have markers that allow for augmented reality identification. Travelers could use an app to scan the tag and see a 3D model of their luggage, making it easier to identify their bags among a sea of similar suitcases.",
    "Customizable Luggage Tag Designs: Another improvement could be to allow for personalized designs on the luggage tag, such as a canvas area for graffiti-style art or a space for stickers, patches, and magnets. This would help travelers quickly identify their bags and express their personality."
