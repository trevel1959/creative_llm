    "Create a virtual reality simulation of the impacts of climate change on coastal communities: Develop a VR experience that immerses users in a coastal town threatened by rising sea levels, intense storms, and flooding. The simulation could show how the town's infrastructure, economy, and ecosystem are affected by climate change, and how different mitigation and adaptation strategies could help the community adapt to these changes. This could help policymakers and the general public better understand the impacts of climate change and the importance of taking action to address it.",
    "Develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the spread of invasive species: Create a machine learning model that can predict the spread of invasive species based on factors such as climate change, habitat destruction, and human activity. The model could be trained on data from past invasions and use this information to predict the likelihood of future invasions in different regions. This could help conservationists prioritize their efforts and develop more effective strategies for preventing the spread of invasive species.",
    "Create a mobile app for tracking carbon emissions: Develop a mobile app that allows users to track their carbon emissions from their daily activities, such as commuting, food choices, and energy usage. The app could provide personalized recommendations for reducing emissions based on the user's habits and lifestyle, and could also allow users to compete with friends and family to see who can reduce their emissions the most. This could help raise awareness about the importance of reducing carbon emissions and inspire people to make more sustainable choices.",
    "Develop a new type of solar panel that can harness energy from the ocean: Create a new type of solar panel that can harness energy from the ocean's movement, such as waves or tides. This could provide a new source of renewable energy that is not dependent on sunlight, and could help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. The panel could be designed to be deployed in the ocean, where it could generate energy continuously, or it could be used to charge batteries or power devices on land.",
    "Create a citizen science project for monitoring air quality: Develop a citizen science project that allows people to monitor air quality in their local area using low-cost air quality sensors. The sensors could be distributed through a network of volunteers, who could collect data on air poll"
