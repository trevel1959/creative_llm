    "**Interactive Recycling Station**: Develop an interactive recycling station for a public park or community center that uses augmented reality (AR) technology. Visitors can scan QR codes on recyclable items in the trash can to learn about their recycling process, see the impact of proper recycling through animations, and even play mini-games to win rewards like coupons or discounts at local businesses.",
    "**Smart Trash Can for Data Collection**: Create a smart trash can that doubles as a data collection device for urban waste management. Equipped with sensors, it can track the types and amounts of waste produced over time, helping city planners optimize waste collection routes and identify trends in waste production. The data collected could also be used for educational campaigns on waste reduction.",
    "**Compostable Trash Can Liners**: Collaborate with biodegradable materials companies to produce compostable trash can liners. These can be distributed for free or sold at a reduced price to encourage more sustainable waste disposal habits. The liners would break down quickly in composting facilities, reducing landfill waste and potentially creating valuable compost for local gardens and parks.",
    "**Recycling Rewards Program**: Launch a recycling rewards program where people can earn points by disposing of recyclables in the designated trash cans. These points can be redeemed for discounts at local shops, free public transportation rides, or even small gifts. The program can be advertised through social media, local news outlets, and community events to encourage participation.",
    "**Educational Trash Can Art Project**: Organize a community art project where artists create large-scale, interactive installations using trash from local recycling centers. These installations could be displayed in public spaces, educating the community about the importance of recycling and inspiring them to reduce waste. Additionally, workshops could be held teaching participants how to upcycle common household items into art pieces, promoting creativity and sustainability."
