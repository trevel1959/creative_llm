Features include adjustable brightness settings, built-in noise cancellation, and a touch interface for navigating through the library. This idea caters to avid readers who prefer digital formats but still appreciate having a physical collection.",
    "**Vertical Garden Bookshelf**: An eco-friendly option for those who enjoy indoor gardening. The design incorporates small planters into its structure, allowing users to grow herbs, succulents, or other small plants between shelves. Each plant holder has its own irrigation system and light source, ensuring the plants receive adequate care. This not only adds a touch of nature to the space but also promotes air purification and relaxation.",
    "**Audio-Enhanced Bookshelf**: This concept combines audio technology with traditional shelving to create an immersive experience.

This idea is perfect for a cozy reading nook or study area where the ambiance enhances focus and enjoyment.",
