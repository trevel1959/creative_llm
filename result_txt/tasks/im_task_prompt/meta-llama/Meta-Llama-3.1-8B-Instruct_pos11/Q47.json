    "**Smart Vacuum Companion**: Design a smart vacuum cleaner that doubles as a personal assistant. Equipped with AI-powered navigation, it can learn your daily cleaning habits and preferences. The vacuum cleaner would be connected to your smartphone, allowing you to schedule cleanings, receive notifications when it's done, and even control it remotely. To take it a step further, integrate a small touchscreen display on the vacuum, enabling users to access information like cleaning schedules, maintenance reminders, and even order replacement filters or batteries directly through the device.",
    "**Vacuum-Powered Air Purifier**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that not only cleans floors but also captures airborne pollutants and allergens. The device would feature a built-in HEPA filter, which would be designed to capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. This feature would be particularly beneficial for people with allergies or asthma. To make it even more effective, integrate a UV-C light to sanitize the air and a smart sensor to detect and adjust to changing air quality levels.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Vacuum with Compost Bin**: Create a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a built-in compost bin, allowing users to compost food waste and yard trimmings. The vacuum would feature a specialized collection system that separates organic materials from inorganic waste, making it easy to dispose of compostable materials. This innovative design would not only reduce waste but also provide a nutrient-rich compost for gardening. To take it further, integrate a smart composting system that monitors moisture levels, temperature, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios to ensure optimal composting conditions.",
    "**Robot Vacuum with Object Detection**: Design a robot vacuum that can detect and avoid objects in its path, preventing damage to furniture, cords, or other obstacles. The vacuum would be equipped with advanced sensors, such as lidar or stereo cameras, to map its surroundings and detect objects in real-time. This feature would be particularly useful for homes with pets or young children, where accidents can happen easily. To make it even more user-friendly, integrate a voice assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant to enable voice commands and scheduling.",
    "**Vacuum-Powered Water Purifier**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that not only cleans floors but also purifies water. The device would feature a built-in water filtration system, which would use advanced technologies like reverse osmosis or UV-C light to remove impurities and contaminants from water. This feature would be particularly beneficial for areas with poor water quality or for people who live in areas with frequent water"
