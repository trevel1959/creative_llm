    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that absorb sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which can then be stored and used to power devices. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices, eliminating the need for traditional batteries.",
    "Electromagnetic Induction: Create a device that uses electromagnetic induction to generate electricity. This device would use a coil of wire to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, which can then be used to power devices. This technology is similar to how power is generated in a generator, but would be more efficient and compact, making it ideal for small devices.",
    "Thermoelectric Generators: Develop a new type of thermoelectric generator that can convert heat into electricity. This generator would use a special material that can convert heat into electrical energy, allowing it to be used to power devices. This technology could be used in a variety of settings, from powering small devices in a remote area to providing electricity for a car or home.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Create a new type of fuel cell that uses hydrogen as the fuel source. These fuel cells would generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This technology would provide a clean and efficient source of power for devices, eliminating the need for traditional batteries.",
    "Wind-Powered Generators: Develop a new type of wind turbine that can generate electricity for devices. These turbines would use the wind to turn a rotor, which would be connected to a generator that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. This technology would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices, eliminating the need for traditional batteries."
