    "**Solar-Powered Signal Mirror**: To attract rescuers, create a solar-powered signal mirror using a reflective surface. You can fashion a makeshift mirror from the shiny underside of a piece of metal or even polished coconut shells. To enhance its effectiveness, create a series of reflective panels using aluminum foil (if available) or polished wood. Position the mirror to catch sunlight and reflect it toward passing ships or aircraft, using a signal pattern (like SOS) to convey distress.",
    "**Bioluminescent Night Path**: Use the natural bioluminescence of certain organisms to your advantage. If you notice bioluminescent algae or fungi on the island, collect them and create a path or marker that glows at night. This can serve as a guide to find your shelter or signal your location in the dark. Additionally, this glowing path can help you avoid hazards like cliffs or sharp rocks when navigating at night.",
    "**Coconut Fiber Rope**: Building shelters or tools requires sturdy materials. One innovative idea is to use coconut husks to create strong ropes. Remove the fibrous husk from coconuts and soak it in seawater to soften it. Once pliable, twist the fibers together to form ropes of various thicknesses. These ropes can be used for tying down shelter, fishing nets, or even as a makeshift fishing line.",
    "**Edible Plant Identification Guide**: Before embarking on any foraging, create a simple identification guide for edible plants. Use natural materials like leaves and bark to craft a visual guide that depicts various plants and their uses. This can be done by sketching or using mud prints. This guide will help you remember which plants are safe to eat and which are not, ensuring you avoid toxic varieties.",
    "**Wind-Powered Fishing Net**: To catch fish without the need for traditional fishing gear, construct a wind-powered fishing net using palm fronds and driftwood. Create a large net by weaving fronds together and securing them to a frame made of driftwood. Set this net in shallow waters and use the wind to help it catch fish as they swim by. This passive fishing method allows you to gather food without constant monitoring."
