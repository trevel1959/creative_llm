    "In a vast savanna, there lived a lion named Leo who had lost his roar. Despite his majestic mane and powerful build, he was mocked by the other animals. One day, a fierce drought struck the land, and all the animals panicked. Without a roar, Leo couldn’t intimidate the predators, but he could still lead. He gathered the animals and devised a plan to find water. Through teamwork and courage, they discovered a hidden oasis. In that moment, Leo realized that true leadership doesn’t come from a roar but from the strength of unity. The animals celebrated him, no longer caring about his silence.",
