    "**Lack of Infrastructure**: The community may not have the necessary infrastructure in place to support a zero-waste movement, such as recycling facilities or composting programs. To overcome this, the movement could work with local government and businesses to develop and implement new infrastructure.",
    "**Economic Barriers**: Some residents may not be able to afford the costs associated with adopting a zero-waste lifestyle, such as purchasing reusable bags or containers. To address this, the movement could offer financial assistance or incentives for low-income residents.",
    "**Information Overload**: With so much information available about zero waste, it can be overwhelming for residents to know where to start or how to make changes. To address this, the movement could create a centralized resource guide or website with easy-to-follow tips and advice.",
    "**Competeting Priorities**: Some residents may prioritize other issues, such as economic development or public safety, over the zero-waste movement. To address this, the movement could work with local leaders to integrate zero waste into existing community plans and goals.",
    "**Limited Access to Resources**: Some residents may not have access to resources such as recycling facilities, composting programs, or reusable products. To address this, the movement could work with local businesses to offer affordable and accessible options."
