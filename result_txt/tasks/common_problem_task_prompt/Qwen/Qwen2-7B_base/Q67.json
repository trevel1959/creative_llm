    "Labor shortage: Another common problem with setting up an organic farm is the labor shortage. Organic farming requires more labor than conventional farming, as it involves manual tasks such as weeding, crop rotation, and natural pest control. Additionally, many farmers struggle to find workers who are willing to work in the fields year-round, as conventional farming offers more stable employment.",
    "Financial stress: Setting up an organic farm can be financially stressful. Organic farming requires more upfront investment in equipment, infrastructure, and natural inputs like compost and animal manure. Additionally, it can take several years for organic farmers to become profitable, as they must invest in marketing and branding to differentiate themselves from conventional farms.",
    "Climate change: Organic farming faces challenges related to climate change. Rises in temperature and extreme weather patterns can negatively impact crop yields and soil quality. Additionally, droughts and floods can damage crops and infrastructure, causing long-term damage to the farm and its community.",
    "Market demand: Another common problem with organic farming is demand. While there has been a growing demand for organic products in recent years, the market may not always be able to support the increase in production. Organic farms may struggle to find buyers and may need to rely on non-organic outlets to sell their products.",
    "Seasonal availability: Organic farming faces challenges related to seasonal availability. Organic farms cannot produce certain crops year-round, which can limit their ability to meet consumer demand for fresh produce. This can lead to a reliance on non-organic products to fill gaps in the market, which may not be in line with the principles of organic farming."
