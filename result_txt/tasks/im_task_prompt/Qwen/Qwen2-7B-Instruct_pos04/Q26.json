    "**Eco-Friendly Recycling Station**: Design a trash can that not only collects waste but also categorizes it into different recycling bins (paper, plastics, glass, etc.). The can can be equipped with sensors to detect the type of waste and direct it to the appropriate bin. It could also include an integrated app that provides users with information on local recycling facilities and instructions on how to recycle specific items correctly.",
    "**Smart Trash Can for Smart Homes**: Create a smart trash can that integrates with home automation systems like Alexa or Google Home. The can can be programmed to open automatically when someone approaches, and close once they walk away. It can also send notifications to homeowners when the can is full or needs maintenance, and even order new bags online when supplies are low.",
    "**Interactive Art Installation**: Transform a trash can into a public art installation. Paint the can in vibrant colors or designs that reflect the local culture or community themes. It could also incorporate interactive elements such as QR codes leading to educational content about waste management or environmental conservation, or LED lights that change color based on the time of day or weather conditions.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Can Liners**: Develop a line of trash can liners made from biodegradable materials like cornstarch or plant fibers. These liners would decompose much faster than traditional plastic ones, reducing landfill waste and pollution. They could be marketed specifically for eco-conscious consumers who are concerned about their environmental impact.",
    "**Educational Trash Can for Schools**: Design a trash can that doubles as an educational tool for children. The can could feature fun and engaging graphics that teach kids about sorting waste, the importance of recycling, and basic environmental principles. It might have compartments labeled with symbols for different types of waste, encouraging children to learn and practice proper waste disposal habits at an early age."
