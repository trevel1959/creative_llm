    "Earth's atmosphere would be lifted into space: If the Earth's gravity were halved, the atmosphere would no longer be held in place by the planet's gravitational pull. This would cause the atmosphere to be lifted into space, creating a vacuum on the planet's surface.",
    "The oceans would become much smaller: The Earth's gravity keeps the oceans in place on the planet's surface. If the gravity were halved, the oceans would become much smaller and would eventually evaporate.",
    "The moon would no longer be in orbit: The Earth's gravity keeps the moon in orbit around the planet. If the gravity were halved, the moon would no longer be able to stay in orbit and would eventually fall to the Earth's surface.",
    "Plants would no longer be able to grow: The Earth's gravity is what holds plants in place and allows them to grow. If the gravity were halved, plants would no longer be able to grow and would eventually die.",
    "Humans would no longer be able to walk: The Earth's gravity is what allows humans to walk and move around. If the gravity were halved, humans would no longer be able to walk and would instead float around."
