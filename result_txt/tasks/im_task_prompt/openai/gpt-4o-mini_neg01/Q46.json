    "**Ergonomic Design with Customizable Grip**: Redesign the handle of the scissors to include interchangeable grips that can be customized for different hand sizes and preferences. This would not only improve comfort during extended use but also reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries. The grips could be made from various materials, such as soft rubber or hard plastic, and come in different colors for personalization.",
    "**Built-in Measurement Guide**: Incorporate a measurement guide along the side of the scissors, with clear markings for inches and centimeters. This would allow users to measure and cut simultaneously without needing a separate ruler. The guide could also include a protractor for angled cuts, making it a versatile tool for both crafting and home improvement projects.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Develop a pair of scissors with self-sharpening blades that use a ceramic sharpening mechanism. Each time the scissors are closed, the blades would lightly sharpen themselves, ensuring they remain sharp over time without the need for manual sharpening. This would save users time and effort, making the scissors more convenient and efficient.",
    "**LED Light for Precision Cutting**: Add a small, adjustable LED light to the tip of the scissors to illuminate the cutting area. This feature would be particularly useful for intricate cutting tasks, such as sewing patterns or delicate crafts, allowing users to see exactly where they are cutting, even in low-light conditions.",
    "**Magnetic Blade Holder**: Design a scissors holder that incorporates magnets to keep the blades closed when not in use. This would prevent accidental cuts and make storage safer, especially in households with children. The holder could also be mounted on walls or workbenches, making the scissors easily accessible while keeping them secure."
