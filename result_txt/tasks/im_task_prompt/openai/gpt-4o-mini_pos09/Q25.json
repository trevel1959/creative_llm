    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Reusable Staples**: Design a stapler that uses biodegradable or reusable staples made from sustainable materials. Instead of traditional metal staples, these could be made from compressed plant fibers or recycled plastics. The stapler could also include a mechanism for removing and reusing the staples, promoting an eco-conscious approach to office supplies.",
    "**Multi-Functional Stapler with Built-in Punch and Paper Trimmer**: Create a stapler that not only staples but also has built-in functionalities like a hole punch and a paper trimmer. This all-in-one device would reduce clutter on desks and save time by allowing users to perform multiple tasks with a single tool. The design could feature a modular approach, where different attachments can be swapped out as needed.",
    "**Ergonomic Stapler with Adjustable Grip**: Develop a stapler that has an adjustable grip mechanism to accommodate users with different hand sizes and strengths. This stapler could feature a soft, rubberized grip that can be expanded or contracted, ensuring comfort during use. It could also include a spring-loaded mechanism that requires less force to staple, making it accessible for everyone.",
    "**Interactive Stapler with Voice Commands**: Introduce a high-tech stapler that responds to voice commands. Users could simply say \"staple\" or \"remove staple,\" and the stapler would perform the action. This could be particularly useful for those with mobility challenges or for busy office environments where hands may be full. The stapler could also provide audio feedback, confirming actions taken.",
    "**Color-Changing Stapler for Visual Organization**: Design a stapler that changes color based on the type of documents being stapled. For instance, it could turn green for important documents, blue for casual notes, and red for urgent papers. This visual cue would help users quickly identify and organize their paperwork at a glance, enhancing productivity and organization in the workspace."
