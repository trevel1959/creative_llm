    "A \"green\" habitat: A habitat that is designed to be sustainable and environmentally friendly. It would include features such as solar panels, wind turbines, and rainwater harvesting systems to reduce the need for fossil fuels and water. The habitat would also be planted with native plants and trees to create a natural ecosystem.",
    "A \"smart\" habitat: A habitat that is equipped with advanced technology to monitor and control the environment. It would include sensors to track temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors, as well as automated systems to regulate lighting, heating, and cooling. The habitat would also be designed to communicate with other smart devices in the surrounding area to create a connected ecosystem.",
    "A \"multifunctional\" habitat: A habitat that is designed to serve multiple purposes. It could be a research facility, a breeding ground, a zoo exhibit, and a wildlife sanctuary all in one. The habitat would be designed to accommodate a variety of animals and provide them with the necessary space, resources, and protection.",
    "A \"vertical\" habitat: A habitat that is designed to be built vertically, using tall towers or skyscrapers. The habitat would be designed to maximize the available space and provide a unique living experience for the animals. It would include features such as hanging gardens, artificial waterfalls, and observation decks for visitors.",
    "A \"modular\" habitat: A habitat that is designed to be built in modules, allowing for easy expansion and customization. The habitat would be constructed using modular panels that can be assembled on-site, providing a flexible and cost-effective solution for creating a new animal habitat. The habitat would be designed to be adaptable to changing environmental conditions and animal needs."
