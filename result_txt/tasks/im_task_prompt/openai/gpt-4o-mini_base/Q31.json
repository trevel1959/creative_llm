    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Preview**: Develop a feature that overlays AR elements onto the cameraâ€™s viewfinder or screen. For instance, users could see how different filters or effects would look in real-time before taking the shot. This could also include a grid for composition, leading lines, or even the golden ratio to help photographers frame their shots perfectly.",
    "**Multi-Camera Syncing**: Create a system where multiple cameras can be synced to capture the same moment from different angles. This could be particularly useful for events, sports, or wildlife photography. Users could control all synced cameras from a single device, allowing for a cohesive editing experience later.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Photography**: Incorporate advanced voice recognition technology that allows photographers to take pictures, change settings, or even switch modes just by speaking commands. This would enable hands-free operation, making it easier to capture spontaneous moments without fumbling with buttons.",
    "**Built-in Editing Tools**: Equip cameras with powerful, user-friendly editing software that allows users to make adjustments like cropping, color correction, and filters directly on the camera. This would save time and streamline the workflow, allowing photographers to share images immediately after capturing them.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Focus on sustainability by using recycled materials for the camera body and packaging. Additionally, introduce a solar-powered charging option to reduce reliance on traditional power sources. This eco-conscious approach could appeal to environmentally aware consumers."
