    "**Modular Laundry Basket**:    Design a modular laundry basket that can be divided into sections for different types of laundry (e.g., colors, whites, delicates). Each section would have a removable liner, making it easy to transport specific loads directly to the washing machine without mixing. The modular design could also allow for expansion or contraction based on laundry needs, with the ability to snap together or pull apart.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**:    Create a laundry basket that uses UV-C light technology to sanitize itself after each use. This basket would have a lid that closes after clothes are added, and the UV-C lights would activate to eliminate bacteria and odors, keeping the basket fresh and hygienic. This feature would be particularly beneficial for households with pets or allergies.",
    "**Foldable Laundry Basket with Built-in Dryer**:    Develop a foldable laundry basket that transforms into a portable clothes dryer. Made from lightweight, heat-resistant materials, this basket could include an integrated heating element and fan system to gently dry clothes without the need for a traditional dryer. It would be ideal for small living spaces or for those who prefer air-drying clothes.",
    "**Color-Changing Laundry Basket**:    Introduce a laundry basket that changes color based on the type of fabric or the amount of dirt detected. Using color-changing technology similar to mood rings, the basket could signal when itâ€™s full, when clothes need to be washed, or when certain fabrics (like delicates) are present. This visual cue would help prevent laundry mishaps and ensure proper care for different clothing types.",
    "**Interactive Laundry Basket with Gamification**:    Design an interactive laundry basket that incorporates gamification elements to encourage children or reluctant family members to help with laundry. The basket could feature a digital screen that displays fun challenges or rewards for sorting clothes, folding them, or completing laundry tasks. It could also track points and offer small incentives, making the process more engaging."
