    "**Digital Art Wallpapers**: With paint gone, one creative way to decorate your house is by utilizing high-quality digital art wallpapers. These can be downloaded and printed on large sheets, or even digitally projected onto walls using modern technology. The benefit of this approach is that it offers an endless variety of styles, from minimalist designs to vibrant abstract art, without the need for physical paint.",
    "**Interactive Light Installations**: Since paint cannot be used, one could incorporate interactive light installations throughout the house. This could involve using LED strips, smart lighting systems, or even custom-made fiber optic panels that react to motion or music. This not only adds a unique aesthetic appeal but also transforms the space into a dynamic environment where light becomes the main decorative element.",
    "**Custom Textured Surfaces**: Without traditional paints, you can explore alternative materials like textured wallpaper, fabric, or even natural substances such as sand, stones, or wood chips. For instance, creating a wall covered in a mix of sand and glue can give a tactile texture that mimics the look of textured paint. This idea is perfect for adding depth and interest to any room.",
    "**Magnetic Decor**: Using magnetic paint on walls, combined with metal or magnetic stickers, magnets, and sheets of colored metal, can create a unique form of decoration. This allows you to display photos, artwork, or even magnetic letters to spell out words or phrases. Itâ€™s versatile, customizable, and provides a fun, interactive way to personalize your space.",
    "**3D Printing Decor**: With the advancement of 3D printing technology, you can create custom-shaped objects or sculptures to decorate your house. These could range from functional items like vases or shelves to purely decorative pieces. You can print objects in various materials such as plastic, resin, or even metal, offering endless design possibilities that are both innovative and sustainable."
