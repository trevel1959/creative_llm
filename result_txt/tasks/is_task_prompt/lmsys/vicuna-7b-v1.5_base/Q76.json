    "During the day in the marketplace of Cop√°n a mischievous parrot was sitting in a cage repeating \"I just love those bananas!\" The store owner told the bird, \"Go on then, eat them\". The parrot had learned that this phrase would get it its favorite treat. After realizing this, the store went out of business.",
    "In San Pedro Sula, there lived a parrot named Pablo Pablo who couldn't repeat simple phrases but repeated intricate musical scores perfect pitch. It would sit on the arm of a talented pianist and sing along every song played. The pianist gained popularity as a one-man band with the parrot as a background singer and pianist's fingers being the real player.",
    "There was a beautiful tropical bird who was a resident at a fancy hotel nestled in the Tico tropical rainforest. Unfortunately, it could only say bad jokes that the guests made at breakfast. Guests were forced to leave the breakfast early because no one could laugh anymore. It would repeat the punchlines of every amusing joke as they were made, leaving no laughter in the room.",
    "In a jungle near the border of Nicaragua and Honduras, a brave, adventurous parrot named Raffles, couldn't repeat important warnings of possible dangers. The parrots of the area would warn each other of approaching snakes or vicious jaguars. Raffles would say something like \"Beautiful day here!\" and the parrots left him to his foolishness. He was soon eaten by a snake and learned his lesson on the importance of listening to others warnings as the others celebrated his stupidity.",
    "In Flores Island off the coast of Honduras, there was a group of seafood vendors at the beach. One parrot sat on a cage and shouted repetitively, \"Yes, shrimp is excellent today!\" All day tourists would come seeking the best seafood on the beach only to find no seafood in sight, making them sad. The parrot's phrase was a trick of the word, \"shrimp\" sounded alike with \"shirt\" and \"shirt off\" and the tourists were happily undressed and enjoying the beach."
