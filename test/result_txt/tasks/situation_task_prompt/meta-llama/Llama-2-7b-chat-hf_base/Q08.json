    "AquaGenie: Create a network of underground water filtration systems that use nanotechnology to purify water. These systems could be installed in every home and business, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water. The AquaGenie system would use a combination of activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and UV light to remove impurities and pathogens from the water, making it safe for consumption.",
    "HydroPods: Develop floating water purification pods that can be deployed in any body of water, including oceans, lakes, and rivers. These pods would use a combination of solar power and advanced filtration systems to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water. The purified water could then be collected and transported to areas in need.",
    "Water Bamboo: Invent a new type of bamboo that has natural purification properties. This bamboo could be planted in areas near water sources, and its roots would absorb and filter out pollutants, providing clean drinking water. The bamboo could also be harvested and used as a filter medium for larger water systems.",
    "SolarSprings: Create a network of solar-powered water springs that can be installed in areas where traditional water sources are contaminated. These springs would use a combination of solar energy and advanced filtration systems to purify water, making it safe for consumption. The SolarSprings could be deployed in remote areas, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water for communities in need.",
    "Water Walls: Develop a system of water walls that can be installed in areas with limited land availability. These walls would use a combination of hydroponics and advanced filtration systems to purify water, making it safe for consumption. The Water Walls could be used in urban areas, providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water for residents."
