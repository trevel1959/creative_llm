    "Hydrogen-powered vehicles: Hydrogen is a clean, renewable source of energy that could be used to power vehicles. Hydrogen-powered vehicles emit only water vapor, making them an eco-friendly alternative to oil-powered vehicles. Hydrogen could be produced through water electrolysis, and fuel cells would convert the hydrogen into electricity to power the vehicles.",
    "Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are already becoming more popular as a cleaner alternative to oil-powered vehicles. If all the world's oil disappeared, the demand for electric vehicles would likely increase significantly. Governments and private companies could invest in expanding the charging infrastructure to support the growing number of electric vehicles on the road.",
    "Bio-diesel vehicles: Bio-diesel is a renewable fuel made from plant-based oils, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, or waste vegetable oils. It can be used to power diesel engines, providing a sustainable alternative to oil. Bio-diesel can be produced locally, reducing the need for transportation of fossil fuels and supporting local economies.",
    "Wind-powered vehicles: Wind turbines could be installed on the roofs of vehicles to harness the wind's energy and convert it into electricity. This would not only reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels but also make vehicles more efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Nuclear-powered vehicles: Nuclear power is a clean, reliable source of energy that could be used to power vehicles. Nuclear reactors could generate electricity to power electric vehicles, or nuclear-powered engines could be developed to directly power vehicles. While nuclear power has its risks, it is a low-carbon alternative to oil-powered vehicles."
