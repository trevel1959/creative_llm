    "**DIY Beauty Recipes**: In a world without commercial cosmetics, one could create their own beauty products using natural ingredients found in their kitchen or garden. For example, using avocado for face masks, coconut oil for hair treatment, or honey and cinnamon as lip scrub.",
    "**Natural Grooming Routines**: Embrace nature's gifts for grooming. For instance, use essential oils like lavender or peppermint for calming mists or invigorating sprays, use sea salt for exfoliating body scrubs, or use beeswax as a base for homemade chapsticks.",
    "**Upcycled Tools**: Use items from around the house as grooming tools. A soft-bristled toothbrush can become a facial brush, a clean, unused mascara wand can be used for applying eyeliner, and an old cotton t-shirt can be cut into strips to use as facial toner pads.",
    "**Creative Artisanal Products**: Support local artisans who specialize in handmade, eco-friendly grooming products. These could include soaps made from natural oils, lip balms crafted with organic beeswax, or scented oils made from locally sourced herbs and flowers.",
    "**Sustainable Packaging Alternatives**: If all packaging disappears, focus on reusable containers. Glass jars, metal tins, and silicone containers can be used to store homemade products. Additionally, opt for biodegradable or compostable packaging when purchasing items from stores that still exist, and encourage the use of refill stations to reduce waste."
