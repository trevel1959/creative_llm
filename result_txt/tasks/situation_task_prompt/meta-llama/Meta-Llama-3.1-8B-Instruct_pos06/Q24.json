    "**Adaptive Technology**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need to rely on adaptive technology to correct their vision. This could include wearable devices like smart glasses, augmented reality (AR) glasses, or even implantable devices that use artificial intelligence to enhance vision. For example, smart glasses could use machine learning algorithms to recognize and correct visual impairments in real-time, while AR glasses could project virtual images onto the real world to help users navigate and interact with their environment. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Advanced Medical Procedures**: In the absence of corrective eyewear, people with poor vision might undergo advanced medical procedures to correct their vision. This could include laser eye surgery, corneal implants, or even gene therapy to correct genetic vision disorders. These procedures would need to be highly effective and minimally invasive to ensure patient comfort and safety. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: People with poor vision might develop enhanced sensory perception to compensate for their lack of visual acuity. For example, they might develop a more acute sense of hearing, allowing them to detect subtle sounds that others might miss. Alternatively, they might develop a more sensitive sense of touch, allowing them to detect subtle changes in their environment through tactile sensations. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Alternative Navigation Systems**: In the absence of visual cues, people with poor vision might rely on alternative navigation systems to move around their environment. This could include audio-based navigation systems, like GPS-guided audio cues, or even wearable devices that use haptic feedback to guide users through their surroundings. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Brain-Computer Interfaces**: People with poor vision might turn to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to control devices and interact with their environment. BCIs would allow users to control devices with their thoughts, effectively bypassing the need for visual input. This could be achieved through neural implants, electroencephalography (EEG), or other non-invasive techniques. (Confidence score: 0.9)"
