    "**Universal Access and Digital Divide Reduction**: With internet access becoming a basic human right, governments and organizations would be incentivized to invest in infrastructure to ensure that everyone, regardless of geographical location or socioeconomic status, has access to the internet. This would lead to a significant reduction in the digital divide, allowing marginalized communities to access information, education, and economic opportunities that were previously out of reach. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Increased Online Safety and Security**: As internet access becomes a fundamental right, there would be a greater emphasis on online safety and security. Governments and organizations would be compelled to implement robust measures to protect users from cyber threats, harassment, and other forms of online abuse. This would lead to a safer and more secure online environment for all users. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Rise of Digital Literacy and Education**: With internet access as a basic human right, there would be a greater focus on digital literacy and education. Governments and organizations would invest in programs that teach people how to effectively use the internet, navigate online resources, and critically evaluate online information. This would lead to a more informed and digitally empowered population. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Shift in Economic and Social Dynamics**: As internet access becomes a fundamental right, traditional economic and social structures would be disrupted. New business models and opportunities would emerge, and existing ones would adapt to meet the changing needs of a digitally connected population. This could lead to greater economic mobility and social equality. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Potential for Increased Government Surveillance**: On the other hand, with internet access as a basic human right, governments might argue that they need to monitor and regulate online activity to ensure that users are adhering to the terms of their new right. This could lead to increased government surveillance, potentially infringing on users' right to privacy. (Confidence: 0.7)"
