    "The consequences of developing the ability to clone extinct animals could be vast and varied. One possibility is that we could potentially bring back species that were lost due to natural or human-caused extinction. This could have a positive impact on ecosystems and biodiversity.",
    "Another consequence could be that we could use cloning technology to create animals with desired traits, such as faster growth or increased endurance. This could have implications for agriculture, as well as for sports and entertainment.",
    "Cloning could also have ethical implications, as it raises questions about the value of life and the right to bring new life into the world. It could also raise concerns about the potential for misuse, such as creating \"designer babies\" or cloning animals for commercial purposes.",
    "There could also be environmental consequences, as cloning could lead to an overpopulation of certain species, which could have negative impacts on ecosystems.",
    "Cloning could also have economic implications, as it could lead to new industries and job opportunities in the field of cloning and genetic engineering. However, it could also lead to a concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few large corporations or governments."
