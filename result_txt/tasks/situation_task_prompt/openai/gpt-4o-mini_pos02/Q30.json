    "**Insect Protein Cultivation**: Insects are incredibly nutrient-dense and can serve as an alternative source of vitamins and minerals. Farming insects such as crickets or mealworms can yield high levels of protein, iron, zinc, and B vitamins. This approach could be paired with vertical farming techniques to maximize space and efficiency, creating urban insect farms that contribute to local food systems.",
    "**Synthetic Nutrient Supplements**: With advances in biotechnology, it is possible to create synthetic supplements that replicate the essential vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables. These supplements could be tailored to individual dietary needs, ensuring that everyone receives the nutrients they require. Innovations could include edible films or gels that release nutrients slowly throughout the day.",
    "**Fermented Foods**: Developing a wide range of fermented foods can provide a rich source of probiotics, vitamins, and minerals. Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir can be enhanced with added nutrients through the fermentation process. Local workshops could be established to teach communities how to ferment various ingredients, ensuring that they maintain a healthy gut microbiome and obtain essential nutrients.",
    "**Hydroponic and Aeroponic Systems**: Creating indoor hydroponic and aeroponic systems that grow nutrient-rich herbs and microgreens can provide essential vitamins in a compact and efficient manner. These systems can be set up in homes, schools, and communities, allowing people to grow their own nutrient-dense plants without the need for soil, thus minimizing the impact of fruit and vegetable shortages.",
    "**Nutrient-Infused Edible Packaging**: Developing edible packaging that is infused with vitamins and minerals can be an innovative way to deliver essential nutrients. For example, wraps made from seaweed or rice paper could be fortified with nutrients and used to encase foods, allowing consumers to gain additional vitamins while enjoying their meals. This could reduce waste while enhancing nutritional intake."
