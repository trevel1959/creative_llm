    "**Oil Lamp**: Transform a lightbulb into a stylish oil lamp. Remove the filament and fill the bulb with oil (like lamp oil or even vegetable oil). Insert a wick made from cotton or another absorbent material through the opening where the filament was. Light it up for a warm, ambient glow that’s both retro and rustic.",
    "**Bird Feeder**: Repurpose a lightbulb into a quirky bird feeder. Remove the glass part and create a small opening in the base. Fill the bulb with birdseed, then hang it from a tree using wire or string. Birds will flock to your unique feeder, and you’ll enjoy watching them up close.",
    "**Artistic Candle Holder**: Use lightbulbs as unconventional candle holders. Cut the bottom off a lightbulb and place a small tealight or votive candle inside. This can be a beautiful centerpiece for a dinner table or an artistic addition to your home decor. You can also paint or decorate the outside of the bulb for added flair.",
    "**Garden Watering System**: Create a slow-release watering system for your garden with a lightbulb. Fill a lightbulb with water and puncture small holes in the glass. Invert the bulb into the soil of your plants, allowing water to seep out gradually. This is an eco-friendly way to keep your plants hydrated without constant attention.",
    "**Insect Trap**: Turn a lightbulb into an insect trap by using its shape to your advantage. Fill the bulb with a mixture of sugar water or vinegar and place it in areas where insects are a problem. The design can lure insects inside, and once they enter, they can’t escape. It’s a clever way to manage pests without chemicals."
