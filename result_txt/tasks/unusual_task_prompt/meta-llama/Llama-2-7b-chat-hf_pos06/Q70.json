    "Smart Coat Rack with AI-Powered Coat Recognition and Automatic Coat Sorting: Create a coat rack that uses AI-powered coat recognition technology to identify and sort coats based on their owner's preferences. The coat rack would have a built-in camera that takes a photo of each coat as it's hung, and then uses machine learning algorithms to recognize the coat's shape, color, and pattern. The coat rack would then automatically sort the coats into different categories, such as \"work coats,\" \"social coats,\" and \"outdoor coats,\" and assign them to the appropriate owner's designated compartment.",
    "Coat Rack with Built-In Charging Station and USB Ports: Design a coat rack with built-in charging stations and USB ports for charging phones, tablets, and other devices. The coat rack would have multiple charging stations and USB ports located throughout, allowing users to charge their devices while they hang their coats. This would be particularly useful for people who are always on the go and need a convenient place to charge their devices.",
    "Coat Rack with Smart Lighting and Mood Setting: Create a coat rack with smart lighting and mood setting capabilities. The coat rack would have LED lights that can be programmed to change color and brightness based on the user's preferences. The user could also use a smartphone app to adjust the lighting and mood settings, creating a personalized atmosphere in their home.",
    "Coat Rack with Integrated Climate Control and Air Purification: Design a coat rack with integrated climate control and air purification systems. The coat rack would have built-in heating and cooling elements that could be adjusted based on the user's preferences, ensuring that their coats are always at the perfect temperature.
