    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Replaceable Heads**: Create a toothbrush designed with a sustainable approach in mind.

The handle could be crafted from recycled plastics or bamboo, promoting environmental responsibility while ensuring users can maintain their toothbrush for longer.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Integrate a UV light sanitizer into the toothbrush handle that activates after each use, killing bacteria and germs that accumulate on the bristles. This feature would ensure a cleaner brushing experience and reduce the risk of oral infections. The sanitizer could be powered by a small rechargeable battery, making it convenient and effective.",
    "**Multi-Functional Toothbrush with Floss and Mouthwash Dispenser**: Develop a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in floss dispenser and a mouthwash reservoir.
