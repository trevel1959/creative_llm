    "**Multi-Functional Attachment System**: Design a modular lawn mower that can switch between various attachments for different tasks. Beyond mowing, attachments could include a leaf blower, weed trimmer, and aerator. This versatility would allow homeowners to tackle multiple lawn care tasks with a single machine, reducing the need for multiple tools and saving storage space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Source**: Develop a lawn mower powered by solar energy or biofuels. This eco-friendly approach would reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The mower could feature solar panels on its body to recharge during the day, making it an excellent choice for environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Self-Navigating Technology**: Incorporate GPS and AI technology that allows the lawn mower to navigate the yard autonomously. This would eliminate the need for manual operation, allowing the mower to create a mowing map of the yard, avoiding obstacles, and ensuring even coverage. The technology could also learn the layout of the lawn over time for more efficient mowing.",
    "**Sound Dampening Design**: Create a lawn mower with advanced sound-dampening materials and technology to reduce noise levels significantly. This would make mowing less disruptive to the household and neighborhood, especially during early mornings or late evenings. Additionally, the mower could include a “quiet mode” for residential areas, ensuring a peaceful environment while still maintaining lawn care.",
    "**AI-Powered Lawn Health Monitor**: Integrate sensors into the mower that can analyze the health of the grass while mowing. These sensors could detect moisture levels, soil health, and areas needing more attention. The mower could then provide feedback through an app, suggesting watering schedules, fertilization needs, or areas that require additional care, helping homeowners maintain a healthier lawn."
