    "**Portable Light Amplification Devices**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision would turn to portable light amplification devices that use advanced LED technology to magnify light and make objects appear clearer. These devices would be small, wearable, and powered by rechargeable batteries. They could be attached to a person's head or clipped onto a pair of sunglasses, providing a convenient and discreet solution for everyday use. The devices would use a combination of LEDs and optical lenses to amplify light, allowing people to see objects and text more clearly. They would be particularly useful for tasks such as reading, cooking, and driving.",
    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses**: With the disappearance of traditional contact lenses, people with poor vision would turn to augmented reality (AR) contact lenses that provide a digital overlay of information and images onto the real world. These lenses would use advanced micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and display technology to project high-definition images and text onto the wearer's field of vision. AR contact lenses would enable people to see virtual objects, labels, and instructions superimposed onto real-world objects, making it easier to navigate and interact with their environment. They would be particularly useful for tasks such as reading street signs, navigating public transportation, and shopping.",
    "**Personalized Virtual Assistants**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision would rely on personalized virtual assistants that use AI-powered computer vision and natural language processing to assist with daily tasks. These assistants would be integrated into smart home devices, smartphones, or wearables, and would use machine learning algorithms to learn the user's preferences and habits. They would provide voice-activated instructions, reminders, and alerts, and would be able to recognize and read text, images, and objects in the user's environment. Personalized virtual assistants would enable people with poor vision to stay independent and confident in their daily lives.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Technology**: With the disappearance of traditional glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would turn to haptic feedback technology that uses tactile sensations to convey information about their surroundings. This technology would involve wearable devices that use advanced sensors and actuators to detect and transmit subtle vibrations, textures, and temperatures to the user's skin. Haptic feedback technology would enable people to \"feel\" their environment, even when they can't see it, and would be particularly useful for tasks such as cooking, gardening, and navigating unfamiliar spaces.",
