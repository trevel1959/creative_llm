    "**Homemade Candle Molds**: Use a clothes iron to melt down old candle stubs and pour the wax into a metal cookie cutter placed on a heat-resistant surface. The heat from the iron can help melt the wax quickly, and once it hardens, youâ€™ll have custom-shaped candles that can be used for decoration or gifts.",
    "**Flattening Craft Materials**: For crafters, a clothes iron can be used to flatten materials like felt or fabric that have been crumpled or wrinkled during storage. This is especially useful for projects requiring precise cuts or even surfaces, such as quilting or sewing.",
    "**De-Wrinkling Documents**: If you have important documents or art prints that have been stored and are now wrinkled, a clothes iron can be used to gently smooth them out. Just place a thin cloth over the document to protect it from direct heat and steam it lightly to remove creases.",
    "**Sealing Envelopes**: Instead of licking envelopes or using glue, you can use a clothes iron to seal them. Simply place a damp cloth over the flap of the envelope and press the iron over it briefly. The heat will activate the adhesive on the envelope flap, creating a secure seal.",
