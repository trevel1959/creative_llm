    "**Insulation and Energy Efficiency**: Tiny houses often struggle with maintaining a comfortable temperature, especially if they are not properly insulated. An issue could arise from excessive heat loss in winter or overheating in summer. To address this, use high-quality insulation materials and install energy-efficient windows. Incorporate passive solar design principles, such as strategically placed overhangs and thermal mass elements, to regulate indoor temperatures naturally.",
    "**Zoning and Building Regulations**: Many areas have strict zoning laws and building codes that could hinder the construction of a tiny house. This can lead to legal complications or the need for costly modifications. To mitigate this, research local regulations thoroughly before designing the house. Consider working with a builder who specializes in tiny homes and is familiar with the legal landscape to ensure compliance and avoid potential fines or the need for retrofitting.",
    "**Water and Waste Management**: Tiny houses often face challenges with plumbing, especially if they are off-grid. Issues may arise with water supply, sewage disposal, or limited bathroom facilities. A solution could be to install a composting toilet and a greywater recycling system. This would not only reduce the environmental impact but also allow for more flexible water management, especially in remote locations.",
    "**Aesthetic Cohesion**: With limited space, achieving a cohesive and stylish aesthetic can be difficult. Mixing too many design elements may lead to a disjointed look. To solve this, establish a clear design theme or color palette early in the planning process. Use consistent materials and finishes throughout the space to create a unified look. Incorporate decorative elements that reflect personal style without overwhelming the small area.",
    "**Storage Solutions**: In a tiny house, storage can quickly become a major issue. Limited closet space and storage options can lead to clutter and frustration. To combat this, design built-in storage solutions that blend seamlessly with the home’s decor, such as benches with hidden compartments or stairs with drawers. Encourage a minimalist lifestyle by implementing a “one in, one out” rule for belongings to keep possessions manageable."
