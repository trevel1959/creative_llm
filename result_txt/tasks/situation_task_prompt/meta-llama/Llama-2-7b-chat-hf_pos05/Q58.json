    "Bug Hotels: Create vertical gardens with various layers of materials like bamboo sticks, twigs, leaves, and soil. This would provide a habitat for insects to live in harmony with other living beings.",
    "Insect Traps: Develop eco-friendly insect traps using natural materials like honey, fruit, and vegetable peels. These traps would attract insects without harming them, allowing for their peaceful capture and release.",
    "Bug-friendly Crops: Plant crops that are beneficial to insects, such as sunflowers, which provide a source of food for pollinators like bees and butterflies. This would encourage insect populations to thrive alongside human ones.",
    "Insect-repelling Homes: Design homes with built-in insect-repelling features, such as screens with natural bug-deterring properties or homes made from materials that naturally keep insects away.",
    "Insect Conservation Centers: Establish specialized centers dedicated to the conservation and protection of insect species. These centers could provide a safe haven for endangered insects and educate the public on the importance of insect conservation."
