    "Cookie Jar with Automated Refill System: Create a cookie jar that has an automated refill system. It can be connected to a smart kitchen scale that detects when the jar is running low on cookies. When the jar is low, it can send a signal to the oven to bake a new batch of cookies, which will then be automatically placed into the jar. This system can be programmed to run on a schedule, ensuring that the cookie jar is always filled with fresh, delicious treats.",
    "Cookie Jar with Built-in Humidity Sensor: A cookie jar with a built-in humidity sensor can help keep your cookies fresh for longer. The sensor can detect when the humidity level in the jar is too high and automatically turn on the oven to bake a new batch of cookies. This will help to keep the cookies crisp and fresh, even if they are stored in the jar for an extended period.",
    "Cookie Jar with LED Lighting: A cookie jar with LED lighting can help to make your kitchen look more inviting and cozy. The lighting can be programmed to change colors or turn on and off at different times, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the kitchen. Additionally, the lighting can be used to highlight the cookies in the jar, making them more appealing to the eye.",
    "Cookie Jar with Built-in Music Player: A cookie jar with a built-in music player can help to create a more enjoyable baking experience. The music player can be programmed to play a selection of your favorite songs, or it can be used to play ambient music that is designed to help you relax and focus while you bake. The music can also be used to set the mood for different types of cookies, such as playing jazz music while baking chocolate chip cookies.",
    "Cookie Jar with Smart Cooking Assistant: A cookie jar with a smart cooking assistant can help to make baking easier and more efficient. The assistant can be programmed to suggest recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand, or it can help you to troubleshoot common baking problems. Additionally, the assistant can be used to set reminders for when to take the cookies out of the oven or when to let them cool. This can help to ensure that your cookies turn out perfectly every time."
