This could be especially useful for people who have trouble applying perfume correctly or who want to avoid overpowering those around them. The diffuser could be powered by a small battery or solar panel, ensuring that the perfume is always available without the need for frequent recharging.",
    "Interactive perfume bottle: Design a perfume bottle that responds to touch or voice commands, allowing users to control the amount of fragrance released. For example, a user could double-tap the bottle to release a light burst of fragrance, or use voice commands to gradually release a steady stream of scent throughout the day. This innovative design would add an extra layer of convenience and fun to the perfume-wearing experience.",

The bottle could include a small LED display that indicates when the perfume is ready to be applied, ensuring that the fragrance is released at the optimal temperature for maximum enjoyment.",
