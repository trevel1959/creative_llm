    "**Artwork Transportation and Handling**: Transporting artwork to the exhibition site poses risks such as damage during transit, theft, or loss of pieces. Fragile or large-scale installations may require specialized handling and transportation arrangements. Ensuring that the artwork arrives safely and is set up correctly can be a logistical nightmare, particularly if there are delays or unforeseen complications.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Failures**: An art exhibition needs effective marketing to attract visitors. Problems can arise from a poorly planned marketing strategy, leading to low attendance. This may include insufficient social media outreach, lack of collaboration with local influencers, or failure to engage with the target audience. Additionally, relying solely on traditional media without leveraging digital platforms could limit exposure.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Organizing an art exhibition can be costly, and unexpected expenses may arise. Problems can include underestimating costs for venue rental, insurance for the artwork, marketing materials, or catering for opening night. If funds are mismanaged or overspent, it can lead to financial strain, forcing organizers to cut corners or compromise on quality.",
    "**Artist Coordination Issues**: Coordinating with multiple artists can lead to communication breakdowns. Problems may arise from differing expectations regarding artwork presentation, last-minute changes to pieces, or logistical issues with artist attendance at the exhibition. If artists feel unsupported or their needs are not met, it could result in a negative experience and impact their willingness to participate in future events.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Creating an engaging experience for attendees is essential. Problems may arise if the exhibition lacks interactive elements or fails to provide educational content about the artworks. Poorly designed exhibition layouts can lead to overcrowding or confusion, detracting from the viewer's experience. Additionally, if there are no guided tours or artist talks, visitors may leave without a deeper understanding of the works on display."
