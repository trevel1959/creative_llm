    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Create solar-powered lanterns that can be placed around the room. These lanterns would use energy from the sun during the day to charge, providing a soft, warm glow at night.",
    "Glowing Plants: Genetically engineer plants to produce bioluminescence, allowing them to emit a soft, natural light. This would create a unique and calming ambiance in the room.",
    "Holographic Projections: Develop holographic lighting technology that projects a 3D image of a lamp or light source onto the wall or ceiling. This would create the illusion of a traditional lamp, while eliminating the need for an actual physical light source.",
    "LED Clothing: Design clothing with built-in LED lights that can be programmed to create different light patterns and colors. This would allow individuals to create their own personalized lighting effects without the need for separate lighting fixtures.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Develop mirrors with built-in LED lights that can be angled to direct light towards specific areas of the room. This would create a more efficient and flexible lighting system, as the mirrors could be moved or adjusted to suit different lighting needs."
