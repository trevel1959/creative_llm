    "**Neural Implant Technology**: Another possibility is the development of neural implant technology. This technology would involve a small device implanted in the eye that could stimulate the retina to create images directly. The device would be connected to a small computer or smartphone, which could process visual information and send it to the implant. This would allow people with poor vision to see clearly without the need for glasses or contact lenses.",
    "**Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering could be used to improve a person's vision. Scientists could manipulate genes to enhance vision, either by increasing the number of photoreceptors in the eye or by altering the shape of the eye to improve its optical properties. This could lead to a significant improvement in vision for those with poor eyesight.",
    "**Electronic Contact Lenses**: Electronic contact lenses could be another solution. These lenses would be embedded with tiny electronic components that could capture and process visual information, then display it on the lens in real-time. The lenses could be connected to a small wearable device that could adjust the visual information to suit the user's needs.",
    "**Bionic Eye Prosthetics**: Bionic eye prosthetics could be used to replace the natural eye. These prosthetics would be implanted in the eye socket and could be connected to a small computer or smartphone, which could process visual information and send it to the prosthetic. This would allow people with poor vision to see clearly without the need for glasses or contact lenses.",
    "**Visual Aids**: Visual aids such as telescopes, microscopes, and binoculars could be used to help people with poor vision. These aids could be designed to be worn on the head or mounted on a stand, allowing the user to see clearly without the need for glasses or contact lenses."
