    "**Fabric Wall Hangings**: I would explore the use of textiles to add color and pattern to my home. Large, vibrant fabric panels could be hung as wall art, featuring different textures and prints that reflect my personal style. I could also use tapestries, quilts, or even vintage scarves to create a patchwork effect on one wall, turning it into a stunning focal point. This method allows for easy changes and updates, as I could swap out fabrics seasonally or whenever I feel like refreshing the space.",
    "**Mosaic Masterpieces**: Instead of painting, I could create a mosaic wall using broken tiles, glass, and other materials. This would not only add color and vibrancy but also create a stunning piece of art that reflects my personality. I could design a large mural that tells a story or represents a theme, such as nature, travel, or family. The texture and light-reflecting qualities of the materials would add depth and interest to the space, making it a conversation starter.",
    "**Lighting Innovations**: I would focus on innovative lighting solutions to set the mood and create ambiance throughout the house. Using colored LED lights, I could install fixtures that change color based on the time of day or my mood. Additionally, I could use light projections to cast patterns or images onto the walls and ceilings, creating an ever-changing atmosphere. This approach would allow me to experiment with different themes and vibes without the permanence of paint.",
    "**Temporary Wallpaper**: To add a touch of design without paint, I could use removable wallpaper. There are countless designs available, from bold geometric patterns to serene landscapes. This option allows for flexibility and creativity, as I could easily change the wallpaper to match the seasons or my evolving taste. I could even create a feature wall with a large-scale mural that could be swapped out for something new whenever I desired.",
    "**Interactive Art Installations**: I would transform my walls into interactive art spaces. This could involve using chalkboard or whiteboard surfaces, allowing family members and guests to draw or write messages. I could also incorporate magnetic paint on a small section of the wall, where I could attach various art pieces or photographs using magnets. This dynamic approach would encourage creativity and engagement, making the space feel alive and personal."
