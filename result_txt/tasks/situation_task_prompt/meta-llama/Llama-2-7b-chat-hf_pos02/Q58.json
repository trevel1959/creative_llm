    "Genetically Engineered Insect Predators: One solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to genetically engineer microorganisms that can serve as natural predators of these pests. For example, scientists could create bacteria that produce toxins that specifically target insects, or create fungi that infect and kill insect eggs and larvae. This approach would be a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly solution than using chemical pesticides, which can harm non-target species and contribute to the development of pesticide-resistant pests.",
    "Insect-Repelling Plants: Another solution to deal with pests like insects is to develop plants that repel or kill these pests. Scientists could genetically modify crops to produce chemicals that repel insects or create plants that produce volatile organic compounds that are toxic to insects. This approach would not only reduce the need for pesticides but also provide a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly solution to pest management.",
    "Insect-Trapping Technology: Another option to deal with pests like insects is to develop advanced trapping technology that can efficiently and humanely capture these pests. For example, scientists could create sticky traps that use a combination of chemicals and UV light to attract and trap insects, or create traps that use air currents and heat to trap insects. This approach would reduce the need for pesticides and provide a more humane solution to pest management.",
    "Insect-Controlling Drones: Another creative solution to deal with pests like insects is to develop drones that can detect and control these pests. Scientists could create drones that use advanced sensors and cameras to detect insect populations and deploy chemicals or other control methods to eliminate them. This approach would be more efficient and targeted than traditional pesticide spraying methods and could help reduce the need for pesticides.",
    "Insect-Friendly Architecture: Finally, to deal with pests like insects, scientists could develop buildings and infrastructure that are designed to be insect-friendly. For example, they could create buildings with specialized ventilation systems that allow insects to enter but cannot escape, or create walls and roofs that are impermeable"
