    "AI-Powered Smart Cane: Develop an AI-powered smart cane that can detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback to the visually impaired individual. The cane would be equipped with sensors and a microprocessor that can detect objects and distances, allowing the user to navigate through their environment with greater ease and safety. The AI can also provide audio cues to alert the user of potential hazards, such as stairs or uneven surfaces.",
    "Braille Display Watch: Design a watch that can display Braille text for the visually impaired. The watch would be equipped with a series of raised dots that can be raised and lowered using a small motor, allowing the user to read time, messages, and other information in Braille. The watch could also include features such as a built-in OCR scanner to convert printed text to Braille, and a GPS tracker to help the user navigate their surroundings.",
    "Virtual Reality Training Simulator: Develop a virtual reality training simulator that can help the visually impaired learn new skills and adapt to their environment. The simulator would use VR technology to create a realistic and immersive environment, allowing the user to practice tasks such as navigating a room, using public transportation, or shopping in a store. The simulator could also be used to provide training for specific tasks, such as using a white cane or navigating stairs.",
    "Smart Glasses with Object Recognition: Design smart glasses that can recognize objects and provide audio or tactile feedback to the visually impaired user. The glasses would be equipped with a camera and machine learning algorithms that can identify objects and provide information about their location, size, shape, and color. The user could use the glasses to identify objects in their surroundings, such as street signs, products in a store, or faces of people they meet.",
    "Smart Home Automation System: Develop a smart home automation system that can be controlled by voice commands or other assistive technologies. The system could include features such as smart lighting, temperature control, and security systems, which can be controlled using voice commands or a smartphone app. The system could also be integrated with other assistive technologies, such as a smart cane or Braille display watch, to provide a"
