    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Develop a paintbrush with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out different brush heads. This would enable artists to quickly change between various styles and sizes without needing multiple brushes. The heads could come in a variety of shapes (flat, round, filbert) and materials (synthetic, natural) to cater to different painting techniques.",
    "**Integrated Paint Reservoir**: Introduce a paintbrush that includes a built-in reservoir for paint. This reservoir could be refillable and designed to dispense paint through the brush tip as the artist paints, reducing the need for constant dipping and allowing for smoother, uninterrupted strokes. A small valve could control the flow of paint to prevent leaks and drips.",
    "**Smart Brush Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the paintbrush that connects to a mobile app. This app could provide real-time feedback on brush strokes, suggest color palettes based on the user’s previous work, and even track the amount of paint used. It could also include tutorials and tips tailored to the user’s skill level, helping them improve their technique.",
    "**Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a paintbrush with an integrated self-cleaning mechanism. This could involve a small compartment that uses a gentle cleaning solution and a rotating brush system to clean the bristles after use. Artists could simply press a button, and the brush would clean itself, making maintenance easier and prolonging the life of the brush.",
    "**Customizable Brush Width**: Create a paintbrush with an adjustable width feature, allowing artists to change the size of the brush head with a simple twist or slide mechanism. This would enable artists to switch between fine detail work and broader strokes without needing multiple brushes, making it more versatile and convenient for various painting styles."
