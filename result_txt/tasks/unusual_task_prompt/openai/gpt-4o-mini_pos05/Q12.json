    "**Watering Device for Plants**: Fill a balloon with water and poke small holes in it. Bury it upside down in the soil of a potted plant. The balloon will slowly release water into the soil, acting as a slow-release watering system that keeps the plant hydrated without overwatering.",
    "**Custom Ice Packs**: Fill a balloon with water and freeze it to create a custom ice pack. The balloon's flexible material allows it to contour to the shape of your body, making it ideal for applying to sore muscles or injuries. You can also add a few drops of essential oils for a soothing aroma.",
    "**Balloon-Powered Car**: Create a simple toy car using a balloon as the power source. Attach a deflated balloon to a lightweight car frame (like a small cardboard box) with straws as axles. When you inflate the balloon and release it, the air escaping will propel the car forward, teaching basic principles of physics and engineering.",
    "**Floating Lanterns**: Fill balloons with helium and attach a small LED light inside before sealing them. These can be released into the sky for a beautiful display during events like weddings or parties. Alternatively, you can use them as temporary floating lanterns for nighttime garden parties, creating a whimsical atmosphere.",
    "**Balloon Art for Events**: Use balloons to create temporary sculptures or decorations for parties and events. Instead of traditional balloon animals, think larger installations, such as balloon arches, flowers, or themed characters that can be the centerpiece of your event, adding a fun and colorful touch."
