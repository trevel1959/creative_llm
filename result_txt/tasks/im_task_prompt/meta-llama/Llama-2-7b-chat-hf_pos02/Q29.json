    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that runs on solar energy, eliminating the need for gasoline and reducing carbon emissions. The mower could have a sleek and modern design, with a large solar panel on top that charges during the day and powers the mower at night or on cloudy days. This would not only be good for the environment but also save homeowners money on their energy bills.",
    "Autonomous Lawn Mower: Develop a self-driving lawn mower that can navigate around obstacles and trim the lawn without human intervention. The mower could use sensors and GPS to create a map of the lawn and adjust its cutting path accordingly. This would save time and effort for homeowners and could be especially useful for larger properties or those with mobility issues.",
    "Smart Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that can detect and adjust its cutting height based on the type of grass it is cutting. This would ensure that the lawn is always cut to the optimal height for healthy growth and appearance. The mower could also have built-in sensors to detect weeds and adjust its cutting path accordingly, eliminating the need for separate weeding tools.",
    "Vertical Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that can cut grass on vertical surfaces, such as walls and fences. This would be especially useful for homeowners with small yards or those who want to maximize their outdoor space. The mower could have adjustable blades and a flexible frame to accommodate different types of surfaces.",
    "Robot Lawn Mower: Develop a robotic lawn mower that can navigate around obstacles and trim the lawn on its own. The mower could have a sleek and compact design, with a powerful battery that allows it to cover larger areas without needing to recharge. It could also have sensors and navigation systems to avoid obstacles and adjust its cutting path as needed. This would be a game-changer for homeowners who want a perfectly manicured lawn without the effort."
