Different modules could include various key types (weighted, unweighted, etc.), sound engines (acoustic, electric, synthesizer), and even customizable finishes. This would cater to a wide range of players, from beginners to professionals, and encourage personal expression.",
    "**Piano with Built-in Composition Tools**: Incorporate a digital composition interface directly into the piano, allowing users to compose music as they play. This feature could include a sequencer, a variety of virtual instruments, and an easy-to-use interface for recording and arranging music. This would not only enhance creativity but also encourage players to explore songwriting.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Piano Materials**: Innovate the construction of pianos by using sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled metals, and eco-friendly finishes. This approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the music industry. Additionally, an eco-friendly piano could be marketed as a premium product that contributes to reducing carbon footprints."
