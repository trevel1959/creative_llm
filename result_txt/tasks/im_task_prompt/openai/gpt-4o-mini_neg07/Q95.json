    "**Integrated Scale and Timer**: Create a laundry basket that features an integrated scale to weigh the contents. This could help users gauge how much detergent to use based on the load size. Additionally, it could include a timer that reminds users when to start the washing cycle, ensuring that clothes don’t sit in the basket for too long, which can lead to odors or mildew.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**: Innovate a laundry basket that can easily fold flat when not in use, making it perfect for small living spaces. This basket could also have built-in wheels and a telescoping handle, allowing it to be easily transported to and from the laundry room or laundromat, reducing strain on the user.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Develop a laundry basket with built-in odor neutralizing technology. This could involve using activated charcoal or a UV light system that activates when the lid is closed, eliminating bacteria and odors from dirty clothes. This feature would be especially beneficial for households with pets or children, where smells can accumulate quickly.",
    "**Laundry Companion App**: Create a companion app that syncs with the laundry basket. The app could track the laundry cycle, provide reminders for washing and drying times, and even suggest optimal washing settings based on the contents of the basket. Users could scan the barcode of their laundry detergent to receive personalized washing tips and alerts when it’s time to restock.",
    "**Multi-Functional Compartments**: Design a laundry basket with multi-functional compartments that serve different purposes. For instance, one section could be used for sorting dirty clothes, while another could have a removable liner for storing clean, folded clothes. This would streamline the process of doing laundry by keeping everything organized in one place."
