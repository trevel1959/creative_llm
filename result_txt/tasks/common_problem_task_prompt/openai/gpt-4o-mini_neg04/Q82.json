    "**Sustainability Concerns**: Many tiny house enthusiasts prioritize eco-friendliness, which can lead to issues with sourcing sustainable materials. The challenge lies in balancing style and functionality with environmental impact. Designers could explore using reclaimed wood, recycled materials, and energy-efficient appliances, ensuring the house is both stylish and sustainable.",
    "**Zoning and Building Code Compliance**: Tiny houses often face regulatory hurdles, as zoning laws may not accommodate their size or intended use (like being a primary residence). To tackle this, designers should conduct thorough research on local regulations and potentially collaborate with local authorities to advocate for tiny house-friendly policies.",
    "**Insulation and Climate Control**: Given the small size, maintaining a comfortable temperature can be tricky. A tiny house might overheat in the summer or become too cold in the winter. Designers could integrate advanced insulation materials, consider passive solar design (like strategically placed windows for natural heating), and incorporate energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Aesthetic Cohesion**: With limited space, it can be challenging to create a cohesive aesthetic that feels stylish and inviting. Mixing too many design styles can lead to a cluttered look. To resolve this, designers should establish a clear design theme (such as minimalist, rustic, or modern) and stick to a consistent color palette and material choices throughout the house.",
    "**Functional Layout Design**: Ensuring that the layout is both functional and stylish can be a delicate balance. Poorly planned layouts can lead to awkward living conditions. Designers should focus on creating an open floor plan that allows for flow while strategically placing essential areas (like the kitchen and bathroom) to maximize efficiency and comfort."
