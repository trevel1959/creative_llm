    "Teleportation Network: A network of teleportation stations could be built across the globe, allowing people and goods to be instantly transported from one location to another. This would bypass the need for roads entirely, and teleportation could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.",
    "Water-Based Transportation: In areas where road infrastructure is not feasible or practical, water-based transportation could be the answer. This could include boats, barges, and even hydrofoils that could travel along rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. This would provide an alternative means of travel and commerce for those areas.",
    "Walking or Hiking: In areas where roads are impassable, people could opt to walk or hike to their destinations. This could be a healthier and more environmentally friendly mode of transportation, as well as a way to connect with nature and enjoy the outdoors.",
    "Animal Transportation: In regions where roads are impassable, animals such as horses, camels, or even elephants could be used as a means of transportation. These animals could be trained to carry passengers and goods across difficult terrain, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to motorized vehicles.",
    "Hover Transportation: In the future, hover technology could be developed to the point where it is feasible for vehicles to travel above the ground. This would bypass the need for roads entirely and provide a faster and more efficient means of transportation."
