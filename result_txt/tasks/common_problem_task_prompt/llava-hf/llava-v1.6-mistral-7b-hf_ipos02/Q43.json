    "**Different Musical Tastes**: If the two people have different musical tastes, they may have difficulty agreeing on the direction of the song. This could lead to disagreements and delays in the writing process. To address this, they could set aside specific times for each person to work on their own ideas, then come together to discuss and merge the best elements from each.",
    "**Technical Issues**: The two people are sitting in front of a computer, which may be used for recording or composing the song. Technical issues, such as computer crashes or software problems, could disrupt their workflow and hinder their progress. To minimize this risk, they could back up their work regularly and ensure they have the latest versions of their software.",
    "**Time Constraints**: The two people may have busy schedules, which could limit the time they have to work on the song. This could lead to rushed decisions and a subpar final product. To overcome this, they could set clear deadlines and prioritize their time effectively, perhaps working on the song during weekends or after work hours.",
    "**Lack of Collaboration**: The two people may not be able to work together effectively, which could slow down the writing process. They may need to establish a clear division of labor and set expectations for their roles in the project.",
    "**Legal Issues**: If they plan to release the song commercially, they may need to consider copyright and licensing issues. They should ensure they have the necessary permissions for any samples or covers they use, and they should consider hiring a lawyer to review their contract and ensure they are protected."
