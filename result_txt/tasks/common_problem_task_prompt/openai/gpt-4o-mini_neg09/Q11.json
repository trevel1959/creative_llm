    "**Sponsorship and Funding Challenges**: Securing sponsors and funding can be a daunting task. Potential problems include reaching out to businesses that may not align with the charity's values, sponsors backing out last minute, or insufficient funding to cover event costs. This could lead to reduced quality of the event or even cancellation if funds do not meet the minimum requirements.",
    "**Volunteer Coordination and Management**: Recruiting and managing volunteers can be tricky. Problems may arise from a lack of commitment, miscommunication regarding roles and responsibilities, or scheduling conflicts. Ensuring volunteers are well-trained and motivated is essential for the event's success, and any failure in this area could lead to operational hiccups on the day of the event.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Issues**: Effectively promoting the event to attract attendees is crucial. Potential issues include inadequate marketing strategies, limited reach due to budget constraints, or competing events on the same date that could divert attention. If the event is not well-promoted, it may not achieve its fundraising goals or create the desired awareness for the cause.",
    "**Logistical Complications**: Various logistical challenges can arise, such as catering issues (e.g., dietary restrictions, food quantity), sound system malfunctions, or transportation problems for attendees and VIP guests. Poor logistical planning can lead to a disorganized event, frustrating both attendees and organizers.",
    "**Engagement and Program Content**: Ensuring that the program is engaging and resonates with the audience is essential for the success of the event. Problems may arise if speakers or performers are not compelling, if the schedule runs too long or short, or if the content fails to connect with the audience. This can result in disengagement and lower fundraising outcomes."
