    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Integrate a self-cleaning feature using ultrasonic waves or steam cleaning technology. This would help remove mineral buildup and bacteria without requiring manual scrubbing. Users would simply need to fill the kettle with water and activate the cleaning mode, which would also notify them when the cleaning cycle is complete.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Mode**: Introduce an eco-mode that utilizes solar power or incorporates a built-in rechargeable battery. This would allow the kettle to be powered by solar energy during the day, reducing electricity consumption. Users could charge the kettle using a solar panel attachment, making it a sustainable choice for environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Functional Base with Induction Heating**: Design a kettle with a multi-functional base that allows it to double as an induction cooktop. This would enable users to not only boil water but also cook food in compatible pots and pans. The kettle could have different settings for boiling, simmering, and even saut√©ing, making it a versatile kitchen appliance.",
    "**Built-In Infuser for Tea and Herbs**: Incorporate a removable infuser basket within the kettle that allows users to steep loose-leaf tea or herbs directly in the boiling water. The infuser could have adjustable steeping times and a timer that alerts users when their brew is ready, ensuring perfect flavor extraction without the need for separate brewing equipment.",
    "**Color-Changing Temperature Indicator**: Add a color-changing feature to the kettle's exterior or water level indicator that visually represents the temperature of the water inside. For example, the kettle could glow blue when the water is cold, green when it's warm, and red when it's boiling. This would provide a quick visual cue for users, enhancing safety and convenience."
