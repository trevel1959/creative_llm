    "**Inverted Wheelchair Design**: This idea involves designing a wheelchair with wheels at the back instead of the front. The person would sit on the chair facing forward and control the movement by pushing off surfaces behind them. This design allows for smooth, efficient backward movement while still maintaining stability and safety features found in traditional wheelchairs.",
    "**Backward-Propelled Hoverboard**: By modifying an existing hoverboard, you can create a device that propels the user backward. This could be achieved by using a motorized system that generates force in the opposite direction to the rider's motion. The hoverboard would have a seat or platform for the rider, with controls for speed, direction, and balance.",
    "**Reversed-Pedal Bicycle**: Design a bicycle where the pedals are mounted on the rear wheel hub, allowing the rider to pedal backwards to propel themselves forward. This would require innovative gearing and braking systems to ensure safe and efficient operation. The frame would need to be re-engineered to accommodate this unique setup, potentially leading to a more ergonomic and potentially more stable ride.",
    "**Backward-Thrust Jetpack**: A jetpack that fires its engines in reverse, propelling the user backward into forward motion. This concept would require advanced propulsion technology, including lightweight yet powerful engines and precise control mechanisms. It would also necessitate a complex life support system, as well as safety features such as parachutes or emergency deployment systems.",
    "**Water Reversal Board**: Imagine a board similar to a wakeboard or waterski, but designed for backward movement. This board would use hydrodynamic principles to glide across water in reverse, powered by the rider's movements and perhaps assisted by a small outboard motor. Special fins and a streamlined shape would help the rider maintain balance and maneuverability while moving backward through the water."
