Support groups and therapy could evolve to focus on the unique challenges faced by those who have had their loved ones returned, creating a new industry centered around resurrection-related mental health.",
    "**Overpopulation and Resource Management**: Bringing back the deceased could exacerbate existing issues related to overpopulation and resource allocation. With the revival of individuals, the demand for food, water, and living space would increase significantly. This could lead to innovative solutions for sustainable living, such as vertical farming and advanced recycling technologies. Alternatively, it might ignite conflicts over resources, necessitating international agreements on how to manage the growing population of resurrected individuals.",

However, this could also lead to job displacement in traditional sectors as society adjusts to the new norm."
