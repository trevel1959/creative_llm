    "**Home Security Enhancement**: I would use this power to develop advanced home security systems. By seeing through walls, I could monitor any unusual activity in the vicinity of a home without intruding on privacy. This technology could integrate with existing security systems, providing real-time alerts if someone attempts to breach a property, thus enhancing the safety of neighborhoods.",
    "**Urban Exploration**: I would create a series of urban exploration tours that allow people to experience the hidden histories of cities. Using my ability, I could guide participants through historical buildings and underground tunnels that are typically off-limits, sharing stories and facts that would otherwise remain unseen. This would provide a unique educational experience, merging history with adventure.",
    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: In emergency situations, such as fires or natural disasters, I could assist first responders by providing them with a clear view of what lies beyond walls. This would allow them to navigate through buildings more effectively, identify victims, and assess structural damage, ultimately saving lives and reducing response times.",
    "**Social Experimentation**: I would conduct social experiments to understand human behavior in different settings. By observing interactions in various environments—like homes, workplaces, or public spaces—I could gather insights into social dynamics, privacy, and how environments influence relationships. This data could inform psychologists and sociologists about the nuances of human behavior in different contexts.",
    "**Artistic Exploration**: I would collaborate with artists to create immersive installations that incorporate the concept of seeing through walls. By designing spaces where viewers can experience multiple layers of reality, we could challenge perceptions of privacy and space. This could manifest as an interactive art exhibit where participants walk through walls that reveal hidden narratives, merging visual art with storytelling."
