    "**Candle-Powered Light Shows**: Create a series of candles with embedded LED lights that can be controlled by a smartphone app or remote control. Each candle could have a different color or pattern of light, allowing for customizable and interactive light shows. For example, one candle could create a \"rainbow\" effect while another could mimic fire crackling sounds, enhancing the ambiance.",
    "**Scented Candle and Essential Oil Diffuser**: Combine scented candles with a diffuser to release essential oils into the air as the candle burns. This would provide a dual sensory experience, offering not only visual beauty but also therapeutic aromatherapy benefits. Users could choose from a variety of essential oil blends, each associated with specific benefits like relaxation, focus, or energy.",
    "**Candle-Making Workshops**: Host workshops where participants learn how to make their own candles using natural waxes and eco-friendly dyes. This could include workshops on creating candles with unique shapes, such as seashells, leaves, or even personalized designs. Participants could use herbs, spices, or other natural materials to infuse their candles with custom scents.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling with Candles**: Develop an interactive storybook that pairs with a series of specially designed scented candles. Each candle burns in a different room, and its scent triggers a specific scene or chapter in the story. The book could be enhanced with augmented reality elements, such as QR codes linking to additional content or hidden messages, making it a multi-sensory storytelling experience.",
    "**Customizable Candle Subscription Service**: Offer a subscription service where customers receive a monthly box containing a new scented candle, a selection of matches, and a surprise item (such as a book, a piece of art, or a small snack) inspired by the scent. This service could include a monthly newsletter with tips on candle care, scent pairing suggestions, and ideas for creating a themed ambiance in different rooms of the home."
