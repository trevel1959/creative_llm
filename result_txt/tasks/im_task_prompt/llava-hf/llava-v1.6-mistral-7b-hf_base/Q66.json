    "Magnetic Strips and Hooks: Another idea could be to attach magnetic strips and hooks inside the basket to hold utensils and cutlery securely during transportation. This would save space in the picnic basket and prevent items from moving during travel.",
    "Insulated Lining: A lining made of insulating material can be inside the basket, providing an easy and convenient way to keep the perishable food items cool and fresh during picnics. This prevents the food from getting spoiled and keeps the picnic basket smelling fresh.",
    "Light and Music: To enhance the ambience during a picnic, an LED light and a compact speaker could be embedded within the lid of the picnic basket. This would make the picnic experience more memorable as ambient lighting and background music could be customized according to the preferences of the picnickers.",
    "Solar-powered Charging Dock: The picnic basket could be transformed into a solar-powered charging dock, allowing devices like smartphones, tablets, and portable speakers to be charged anywhere. This provides a convenient and eco-friendly way to keep devices charged during outdoor adventures.",
    "Modular Design: To cater to different needs, the picnic basket could be designed with a modular layout. For example, the basket could separate into two parts, one for food and the other for drinks. This would allow the picnickers to carry different types of food and drinks securely and separate them during the picnic."
