    "Echelon Energy: This new type of energy would be based on the concept of vibrational frequencies. It would be generated by harnessing the natural vibrations of the earth, air, water, and fire. Echelon energy would be a zero-emission energy source that could be transmitted wirelessly through the air, making it an ideal solution for remote areas with limited access to traditional energy sources.",
    "Lumina Energy: This energy source would be based on the properties of light. It would be generated by manipulating light waves to create a sustainable and efficient energy source. Lumina energy would be clean, renewable, and could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, vehicles, and electronic devices.",
    "AquaEnergy: This new type of energy would be harnessed from the movement of water. It would be generated by using advanced technology to convert the kinetic energy of ocean waves, river currents, and even the tides into usable electricity. AquaEnergy would be a sustainable and renewable source of energy that could help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "TerraEnergy: This energy source would be based on the earth's natural magnetic field. It would be generated by using advanced technology to harness the energy of the earth's magnetic field and convert it into usable electricity. TerraEnergy would be a clean and sustainable source of energy that could be used to power homes, businesses, and transportation.",
    "SolarSonic Energy: This new type of energy would be based on the properties of sound. It would be generated by using advanced technology to convert sound waves into usable electricity. SolarSonic energy would be a clean, renewable, and efficient source of energy that could be used for a variety of applications, including powering homes, vehicles, and electronic devices."
