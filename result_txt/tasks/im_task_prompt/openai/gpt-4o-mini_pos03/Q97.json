    "**Adjustable Length Mechanism**: Design a leash that can adjust its length automatically based on the environment. For example, when in a crowded area, the leash could shorten to keep the dog close, while in open spaces, it could extend for more freedom. This could be achieved using a retractable mechanism that senses the proximity of other people or obstacles.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Built-in Accessories**: Create a leash that incorporates various accessories, such as a collapsible water bowl, treat dispenser, and waste bag holder. This would make walks more convenient, allowing owners to carry everything they need in one compact leash without the need for additional bags or containers.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Develop a leash with built-in LED lights and reflective materials to enhance visibility during nighttime walks. The lights could have different settings (steady, blinking, etc.) to increase safety. This feature would be especially useful for early morning or late evening walks, ensuring that both the dog and owner are seen by drivers and other pedestrians.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Grip Technology**: Design an ergonomic handle that provides a comfortable grip and reduces strain on the hand. The handle could be made from a material that absorbs shock, providing extra comfort for owners who may have larger or stronger dogs that pull. Additionally, the handle could include a built-in shock absorber to reduce the impact on the ownerâ€™s wrist.",
    "**Training Mode with Feedback Mechanism**: Introduce a leash that includes a training mode with a feedback mechanism. This could involve gentle vibrations or sounds that alert the dog when they are pulling too hard or straying too far. This feature could help reinforce training commands and encourage better behavior during walks."
