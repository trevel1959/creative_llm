    "Solar panel installation incentives: The government could offer incentives for homeowners to install solar panels, such as tax credits or rebates. This would help offset the initial cost of installation and make it more affordable for people to switch to renewable energy.",
    "Community solar programs: The city could establish a community solar program, where a centralized solar panel array is installed and homeowners can purchase a share of the panels. This would allow people who cannot install solar panels on their own homes to still benefit from the renewable energy they produce.",
    "Solar panel sharing networks: The city could create a sharing network for solar panels, where homeowners can rent out their excess energy to their neighbors. This would allow people to earn money from their solar panels while also reducing their own energy consumption.",
    "Solar panel-equipped public transportation: The city could incorporate solar panels into public transportation vehicles, such as buses and trains, to reduce their carbon footprint. This would not only reduce the energy consumption of the vehicles but also provide a visible example of the benefits of renewable energy.",
    "Solar panel-covered buildings: The city could encourage building owners to cover their rooftops with solar panels. This would not only provide a source of renewable energy but also help reduce the urban heat island effect by providing shade and cooling the surrounding area. Additionally, the panels could be designed to double as a skylight or green roof, providing additional benefits to the building and its occupants."
