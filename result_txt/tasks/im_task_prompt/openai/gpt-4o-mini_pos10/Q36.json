    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**:    Introduce a knife with a self-sharpening mechanism. This knife would have a small, retractable ceramic sharpening rod embedded in the handle. When the knife is sheathed in its holder, the blade would slide against the rod, sharpening itself automatically. This feature would ensure that the knife maintains its edge without the need for manual sharpening, making it ideal for busy kitchens or outdoor adventures.",
    "**Modular Knife System**:    Create a modular knife that allows users to easily swap out blades for different purposes. The handle would feature a secure locking mechanism, allowing users to switch between a chef’s knife, paring knife, fillet knife, and more with ease. This design would reduce the need for multiple knives and save space in kitchens or toolkits while still providing versatility.",
    "**Ergonomic, Adaptive Handle**:    Design a knife with an ergonomic handle that adapts to the user’s grip. The handle could feature a flexible material that molds to the shape of the user’s hand, providing a custom fit for comfort and reducing fatigue during prolonged use. Additionally, the handle could include textured grips for better control and a thumb rest for added stability.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Safety Features**:    Introduce a knife that includes safety features like a retractable blade guard that activates when the knife is not in use, preventing accidental cuts. It could also have a pressure-sensitive handle that only allows the blade to deploy when held with the correct grip pressure, minimizing the risk of injury. This knife would be particularly useful for novice cooks or in households with children.",
    "**Multi-functional Knife with Embedded Tools**:    Develop a knife that integrates multiple kitchen tools within the handle, such as a bottle opener, a can opener, and a small cutting board. The handle could have a slide-out mechanism that reveals these tools when needed, making it a compact and efficient solution for cooking, picnicking, or camping. This design would cater to those who appreciate versatility in their kitchen tools."
