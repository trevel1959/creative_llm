    "**Eco-Friendly Venue**: Choose a venue that is already eco-friendly, such as a farm, a park, or a historic building that has been restored using sustainable materials. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint of the wedding but also provide a unique and memorable backdrop for the celebration.",
    "**Zero-Waste Decor**: Opt for decorations that are biodegradable, reusable, or repurposed. Use natural elements like flowers, branches, and leaves to create beautiful centerpieces and decorations. You can also repurpose old items like lanterns, vases, and bottles to add a personal touch to the decor.",
    "**Sustainable Food**: Choose a catering service that offers locally sourced, organic, and seasonal food options. Consider a food truck or a buffet-style service to reduce food waste. You can also have a \"food sharing\" station where guests can share food and reduce packaging waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Arrange for eco-friendly transportation options for guests, such as carpooling, shuttle services, or even a horse-drawn carriage. You can also encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation to reduce carbon emissions.",
    "**Donation Station**: Set up a donation station where guests can bring donations of items like clothing, books, or household goods. Partner with a local charity or organization to collect and distribute the donations. This will not only reduce waste but also give back to the community."
