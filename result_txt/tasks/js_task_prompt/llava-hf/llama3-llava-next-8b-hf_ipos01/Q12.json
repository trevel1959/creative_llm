    "Submarine Transportation: The primary mode of transportation would be submarines. They would be used for both personal and public transportation, allowing people to travel quickly and efficiently through the water. The subways and trains would be replaced with underwater tubes, eliminating the need for surface-level transportation.",
    "Aquatic Agriculture: Agriculture would be revolutionized by using underwater farms. These would be large, transparent domes that would allow for sunlight to penetrate and support photosynthesis. Aquatic plants and animals would be raised in these underwater greenhouses, providing a sustainable and efficient food source.",
    "Underwater Energy Generation: Energy would be generated through the use of underwater wind farms and hydroelectric power plants. The ocean currents would be harnessed to generate electricity, providing a clean and renewable energy source.",
    "Marine Biotechnology: The underwater environment would be a hub for biotechnology research. Scientists would study the unique properties of marine organisms and use this knowledge to develop new technologies and treatments for various diseases and conditions.",
    "Aquatic Education: Schools would be built underwater, providing a unique and immersive learning environment. Students would study marine biology, oceanography, and other related fields in a hands-on and experiential way."
