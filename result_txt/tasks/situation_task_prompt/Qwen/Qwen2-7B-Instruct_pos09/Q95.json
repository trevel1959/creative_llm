    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be filled with air or water to provide support for the head and neck. This can be inflated before bed and deflated during the day for easy storage. It would be adjustable in size and firmness, allowing for a comfortable fit for any individual.",
    "**Foam Rollers**: Use foam rollers as a substitute for traditional pillows. These are long, cylindrical pieces of foam that can be placed under the head or along the sides of the body to provide support. They offer excellent support for different sleeping positions and can be customized by adding a layer of soft fabric or memory foam on top for added comfort.",
    "**Balloon Pillows**: Inflated balloons can be used as makeshift pillows by attaching them securely with a balloon tie or a small piece of fabric. The balloons can be made from eco-friendly materials, such as biodegradable plastic, to minimize environmental impact. This idea is whimsical and could add a fun element to one's bedroom decor.",
    "**Gravity Blankets**: A gravity blanket is a weighted blanket designed to apply gentle pressure across the body, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety. Instead of using traditional pillows, a gravity blanket can be placed under the head for a unique and soothing sleep experience. This option might be particularly appealing to individuals who prefer a deep-pressure touch sensation.",
    "**Water-filled Pillows**: Create a pillow that is partially filled with water, which can be adjusted to provide varying levels of support and comfort. The water can be heated or cooled to suit the sleeper's preferences, offering temperature regulation and customizable firmness. This type of pillow would require a waterproof liner and a secure closure mechanism to prevent leaks."
