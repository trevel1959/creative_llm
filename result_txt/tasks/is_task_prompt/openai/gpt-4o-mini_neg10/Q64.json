    "On the Planet of Ice Cream, everything was sweet and colorful. The trees were made of waffle cones, and rivers flowed with rich chocolate syrup. Each day, the inhabitants, the Gelato Gnomes, would gather to harvest the fluffy marshmallow clouds that rained down sugary sprinkles. One day, a curious Gnome named Scoop discovered a hidden cave filled with a rare flavor: rainbow sherbet. Excited, he shared it with his friends, and together they created the Festival of Flavors. The entire planet came alive with laughter and joy, uniting everyone in a delicious celebration that would be remembered for eons.",
