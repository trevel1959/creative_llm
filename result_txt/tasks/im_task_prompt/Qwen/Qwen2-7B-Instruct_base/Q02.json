    "**Electric Bicycle with Solar Panels**: Develop an electric bicycle that is equipped with solar panels on its top or sides. This would allow the bike to recharge while being ridden, reducing reliance on a power outlet for charging. The solar energy would be stored in batteries integrated into the bike's frame. Ideal for users who spend long hours outdoors or those living in remote areas without easy access to electricity.",
    "**Portable Bicycle Workstation**: Design a bicycle that includes a foldable table and storage compartments on the frame. The rider can attach tools, snacks, or even a small computer for tracking fitness data or navigation. It's perfect for delivery workers, cyclists commuting to work, or outdoor enthusiasts needing a mobile workspace.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Water Purification System**: Create a bike with a built-in water filter system. As the cyclist pedals, the motion powers the filtration process, turning dirty water into clean drinking water. This concept could be especially useful for disaster relief efforts or in developing countries where access to clean water is limited.",
    "**Bike as a Personal Air Quality Monitor**: Integrate sensors into the bicycle that monitor air quality in real-time. The data could be displayed on a screen attached to the handlebars or sent to a smartphone app. Cyclists could use this information to choose the best routes based on air quality, promoting healthier outdoor activities.",
    "**Bicycle-as-a-Service (BaaS) Subscription Model**: Launch a subscription service where customers pay a monthly fee to access a variety of bicycles (e.g., mountain bikes, city cruisers, e-bikes). The service would include maintenance, upgrades, and even replacement if needed. This model addresses the issue of initial investment and the need for versatility among cyclists. "
