    "**Innovative Baking Tool:** Design a multi-functional spatula specifically for baking. This spatula would come with detachable silicone and metal edges to accommodate different tasks. The silicone edge can be used for spreading frosting smoothly or basting, while the metal edge can help in flipping delicate items like pancakes or crepes without tearing them. Additionally, it could have a small, integrated whisk at the top for whipping egg whites or cream.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Food Storage Solution:** Develop a spatula that doubles as an airtight lid for food storage containers. The spatula would feature a silicone base that adheres to the container's rim, creating an airtight seal when pressed down. This eliminates the need for separate lids and reduces kitchen clutter. The handle could also be designed to be dishwasher-safe, ensuring easy cleaning.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Education Tool:** Create an educational spatula that teaches users about cooking techniques. The spatula could have a digital display on its handle, showing tips and tricks related to the food being prepared. For example, if you're stirring a sauce, the spatula might display how to achieve the perfect consistency. It could also suggest recipes based on ingredients present in your kitchen, making cooking more personalized and less intimidating.",
    "**Healthier Cooking Helper:** Invent a spatula with a built-in scale that tracks the amount of oil or other ingredients added to a dish. This tool would be especially useful for those trying to monitor their calorie intake or cook healthier meals. By inputting the type of ingredient, the spatula would automatically adjust the measurement, reducing the need for additional kitchen gadgets and saving time.",
    "**Smart Spatula for Smart Home Integration:** Design a spatula that connects to your home's Wi-Fi network, allowing it to integrate with smart home devices. For instance, it could sync with your oven to preheat when you start cooking, or alert your smart speaker to play music when you begin a new recipe. The spatula could also log cooking times and temperatures, providing insights into cooking habits or helping in creating personalized meal plans. "
