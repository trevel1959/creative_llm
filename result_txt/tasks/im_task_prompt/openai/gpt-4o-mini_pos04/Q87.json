The float could include a detachable mesh netting to hold drinks securely and a built-in bottle opener. This would be perfect for pool parties, allowing users to stay refreshed without having to leave the water.",
    "**Interactive LED Light Float**: Create a pool float embedded with LED lights that change colors based on the temperature of the water or the time of day. The float could have a setting for different moods or themes, like a party mode that flashes to the beat of music or a calming mode with soft, soothing colors for nighttime relaxation.",
    "**Floating Game Board**: Develop a pool float that features a built-in game board, such as a giant chess or checkers set. The pieces could be secured with Velcro to prevent them from floating away. This would encourage social interaction and provide entertainment for both kids and adults while enjoying the water.",
    "**Adjustable Sunshade Float**: Innovate a pool float that comes with an adjustable sunshade. The shade could be retractable and customizable, allowing users to position it according to the sun's angle.
