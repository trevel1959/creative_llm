    "**Building a Shelter**: The first priority is to create a shelter that can protect you from the elements. Using available materials like driftwood, vines, and leaves, you could construct a sturdy lean-to or even a more complex structure using branches and a tarp if you find one. This shelter should be elevated off the ground to avoid water accumulation and keep you dry.",
    "**Creating a Water Filtration System**: Freshwater is crucial for survival. You can collect rainwater in large containers, but purifying it is essential before drinking. A simple method involves using sand and charcoal. Dig a hole and place layers of sand, then add charcoal (if available), and cover it with more sand. Pour your collected rainwater through this makeshift filter to remove impurities.",
    "**Making Tools and Equipment**: Tools are vital for survival, especially if you have to start a fire or hunt for food. You can use rocks and sticks to make a bow and arrow, which might be necessary for hunting small animals. Additionally, creating a knife from a sharpened stick or bone can help in various tasks like cutting, scraping, and preparing food.",
    "**Cultivating Wild Plants and Foraging**: Learn to identify edible plants and fruits that grow naturally on the island. Some common examples include coconut palms, which provide both water and food, and various berries that might be safe to eat. Always be cautious about eating unknown plants to avoid poisoning.",
    "**Catching Fish and Other Aquatic Life**: If the island has a beach or lagoon, fishing can be a reliable source of protein. Use natural materials to create a fishing line and hook, such as a piece of string and a sharpened stick. Fishing can be done either by casting into the water or by setting up traps. Also, consider exploring for other aquatic resources like crabs, clams, and seaweed, which can supplement your diet. "
