    "Infrastructure challenges: Developing water infrastructure in areas with limited resources may be challenging. Establishing pipelines, water filtration systems, and other necessary infrastructure may take time and require advanced technical expertise.",
    "Lack of access to resources: In a developing country, access to resources such as construction materials, power, and spare parts may be limited, making it difficult to maintain and operate the infrastructure.",
    "Natural disasters: The need for a clean water initiative may be particularly urgent in areas prone to natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, and drought. The initiative must be able to withstand and respond to these disasters.",
    "Political instability: A government may change before or during the implementation of the water initiative, leading to a loss of funding and difficulty in maintaining the infrastructure.",
    "Cultural barriers: The lack of education regarding the importance of clean water or cultural beliefs may result in resistance or lack of willingness to adopt the initiative. It may be necessary to engage with the community to understand their concerns and address them."
