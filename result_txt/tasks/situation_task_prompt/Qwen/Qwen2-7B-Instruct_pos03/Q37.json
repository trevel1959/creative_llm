    "**Rolling Wheelchair**: In this scenario, a specially designed wheelchair is equipped with wheels that roll in reverse. This device allows the user to navigate backward by simply applying force in the desired direction. The design can include features like adjustable speed, automatic braking for safety, and possibly even sensors to detect obstacles.",
    "**Backward-Walking Canes**: These canes are not just simple walking aids; they're equipped with motors and wheels that propel the user backward when activated. They come with a control panel on the handle for adjusting speed, direction, and other settings. Users might need to learn a different set of walking techniques to effectively use these canes.",
    "**Reversing Exoskeleton**: An exoskeleton is a wearable mechanical suit that enhances human physical abilities. A version that can move backward would have motors integrated into the joints and legs that enable the user to walk or run in reverse. This idea would require significant engineering, but it could offer unparalleled mobility for tasks requiring backward movement.",
    "**Reverse-Direction Bikes**: Similar to traditional bicycles, but with the gears and pedals adjusted so that pedaling backward propels the bike forward. The rider would need to learn a new technique involving counterintuitive movements. The design could also incorporate additional features like a reverse steering mechanism.",
    "**Glideboard**: This could be a board similar to a skateboard or longboard, but designed specifically for backward movement. It might feature a motor, battery, and controls that allow the rider to choose between different speeds. Glideboards could be used for commuting, recreational activities, or even competitive sports, focusing on backward motion."
