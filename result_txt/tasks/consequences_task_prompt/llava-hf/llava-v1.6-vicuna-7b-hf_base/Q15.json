    "A global energy transition: The shortage of oil would trigger a rapid transition to alternative fuels, such as natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. However, this might also lead to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions, which could exacerbate climate change and have detrimental effects on the environment and human health.",
    "Dependence on imported oil: Without oil, many countries would be dependent on imported energy, which could strain their balance of payments and affect economic growth. In addition, this would create political tensions between oil-producing and consuming countries.",
    "Increased investment in electric vehicles: With limited availability of oil, demand for electric vehicles would skyrocket, leading automakers to invest heavily in the development and production of these vehicles, with a focus on batteries and charging infrastructure.",
    "Encouragement of public transportation and cycling: The shortage of oil would compel governments to promote public transportation and cycling as more sustainable and efficient modes of transportation. This would require investment in public transit infrastructure and education programs to encourage people to switch from private cars to public transportation.",
    "Increased focus on oil substitution: Industries would look for alternatives to oil in the production of various goods and services, such as plastics, chemicals, and lubricants. This would require significant investments in research and development and might lead to the discovery of new materials with unique properties that could have unforeseen benefits."
