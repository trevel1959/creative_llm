    "Economic boom: With increased access to freshwater, the cost of water for industries would decrease, making it more affordable for businesses. This would lead to a potential economic boom as industries that heavily rely on water, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy production, would benefit from the lower costs.",
    "Environment improvement: The oceans would be less salty, potentially leading to improved water quality in coastal areas. Increased freshwater flow into the atmosphere could also lead to increased humidity, making it easier for air conditioning to work more efficiently, which would help combat rising temperatures in some regions.",
    "Marine life disruption: As salt levels decrease in the oceans, marine life would be drastically affected. Coastal ecosystems and marine organisms that rely on salt for survival would struggle to adapt to the change. Moreover, the increase in freshwater flow could lead to flooding in coastal areas, which may have a wide range of consequences, including damage to infrastructure, human settlements, and ecosystems.",
    "Water purification: The process of desalination, which is often used to convert salty seawater into freshwater, would become obsolete. This would have a huge impact on industries, like the massive desalination plants present in coastal regions, as well as the industries that rely on them for employment.",
    "New forms of hydroelectricity: The increased availability of freshwater resources could lead to the development of new forms of hydroelectricity. With more accessible freshwater for generating power, it would be possible to harness the energy from river currents and waterfalls to produce clean, renewable energy."
