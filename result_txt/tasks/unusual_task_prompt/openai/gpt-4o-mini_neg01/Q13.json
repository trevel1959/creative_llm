    "**Floating Bath Time Buddy for Pets**: Rubber ducks can be introduced to pets during bath time. They can help alleviate fear of water for dogs and cats by providing a fun distraction. The bright color and buoyancy can make bath time feel more like playtime, encouraging pets to enjoy the process.",
    "**Themed Party Decorations**: Use rubber ducks as unique decorations for themed parties. For instance, at a beach or pool party, float them in bowls of water or place them around the venue. You can even paint them in different colors or dress them up in costumes to match the theme, making them a fun and interactive decoration.",
    "**Educational Tool for Children**: Incorporate rubber ducks into educational activities for young children. Use them to teach counting, colors, or even basic physics concepts like buoyancy. For example, set up a mini-experiment to see how many rubber ducks can float in a tub of water versus how many sink when weighted down.",
    "**DIY Bath Bomb Molds**: Use rubber ducks as molds for creating fun bath bombs. Fill the duck with a mixture of baking soda, citric acid, and essential oils, then let it dry. Once set, you can pop the duck out and have a whimsical bath bomb that can float in the tub while releasing delightful scents.",
    "**Unique Gift Wrapping**: Instead of traditional gift wrap, use a rubber duck as part of the gift itself. Attach a small gift to the duck (like a necklace or a gift card) and present it in a playful manner. This not only serves as a fun packaging method but also gives the recipient a cute keepsake."
