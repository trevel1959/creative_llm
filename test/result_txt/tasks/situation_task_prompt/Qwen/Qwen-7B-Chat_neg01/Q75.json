    "Solar-powered vehicles: With the increasing availability of solar panels, it is possible to power vehicles using renewable energy sources. This can be achieved by installing solar panels on the roof of the vehicle or by using solar-powered batteries that can store energy for later use.",
    "Electric cars: Electric cars are already available in the market and are powered by electricity. However, there is a need to improve the range and charging infrastructure for electric cars to make them more viable as a replacement for gasoline-powered vehicles.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are another alternative to traditional gasoline engines. They produce electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, producing water as a byproduct. While hydrogen fuel cell technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our vehicles.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are derived from organic matter such as corn, soybeans, and algae. They can be used to power vehicles just like gasoline, but they are produced from renewable resources and emit fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels.",
    "Flywheel energy storage: Flywheel energy storage systems use spinning flywheels to store energy generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar. When needed, the stored energy can be released to power vehicles. Although flywheel energy storage systems are currently expensive, their efficiency and durability make them an attractive option for future power generation and transportation systems."
