    "Pedal-powered transportation hubs: Imagine a network of community-run transportation hubs where people can rent or borrow pedal-powered vehicles, such as pedal-powered cars, bikes, or even recumbent tricycles. These hubs could be located in convenient locations throughout cities and towns, making it easy for people to get around without relying on cars.",
    "Personal mobility devices: With bicycles gone, people could turn to other personal mobility devices, such as skateboards, longboards, or even rollerblades. These devices could be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than cars, and could provide a fun and exciting way to get around.",
    "Carpooling and ride-sharing: In the absence of bicycles, people could turn to carpooling and ride-sharing as a way to get around. This could involve grouping together with neighbors or coworkers to share rides, or using ride-sharing apps to connect with others who are traveling in the same direction.",
    "Electric scooters and mopeds: With bicycles gone, electric scooters and mopeds could become a popular alternative for short-distance transportation. These devices are already gaining popularity in many cities, and could provide a convenient and efficient way to get around without relying on cars.",
    "Hyperloop networks: In a more futuristic scenario, the disappearance of bicycles could lead to the development of hyperloop networks, which are high-speed transportation systems that use vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers in pods at speeds of up to 700 mph. This could revolutionize transportation and make it possible to travel long distances without relying on cars or other polluting modes of transportation."
