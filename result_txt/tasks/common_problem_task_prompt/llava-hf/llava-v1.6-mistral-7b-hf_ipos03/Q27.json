    "Production and Distribution: Another potential problem is the production and distribution of the vaccine. This includes ensuring that there is sufficient capacity to manufacture the vaccine, that it is distributed equitably to those who need it, and that it is stored and transported safely and efficiently to prevent spoilage and ensure the integrity of the vaccine.",
    "Cost: A third potential problem is the cost of developing and producing the vaccine. This includes the costs of research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and distribution, as well as the costs of administering the vaccine to the public. These costs may be prohibitive for some individuals or countries, leading to unequal access to the vaccine.",
    "Intellectual Property Rights: Another potential problem is the issue of intellectual property rights. The ownership of the vaccine and the technology used to develop it may be subject to patents, which can limit the ability of other researchers and manufacturers to produce the vaccine, potentially leading to delays in the production and distribution of the vaccine.",
    "Vaccine Hesitancy: A potential problem is the issue of vaccine hesitancy. Some people may be hesitant to receive the vaccine due to concerns about its safety, efficacy, or potential side effects. This can lead to a reluctance to get vaccinated, which can hinder the effectiveness of the vaccine in controlling the spread of the disease.",
    "Political and Social Factors: Political and social factors can also impact the development and distribution of the vaccine. This includes issues such as government funding, regulatory approval, and public perception of the vaccine. Political and social factors can influence the speed and efficiency of the vaccine development process, as well as the willingness of people to get vaccinated."
