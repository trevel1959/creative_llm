    "Wheelchair with a twist: Instead of a traditional wheelchair, you could design a chair with a unique mechanism that allows you to move around in any direction, including upside down. This could be achieved through the use of flexible materials and a series of hinges and levers that allow for a full range of motion.",
    "Hoverchair: Imagine a chair that uses magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground, allowing you to move around with minimal effort. This could be powered by a small electric motor and would provide a smooth, gliding motion that would be easy to maneuver.",
    "Exoskeleton suit: For those who are unable to move their limbs, an exoskeleton suit could provide the support and mobility needed to move around. This suit would be designed with a series of motors and sensors that would allow you to control the movement of the suit with your mind, providing a sense of agency and independence.",
    "Magnetic tracking system: A magnetic tracking system could be used to create a pathway of magnets on the floor that would allow you to move around without touching the ground. This would provide a smooth, stable movement that would be easy to navigate, and could be especially useful in areas with slippery or uneven surfaces.",
    "Telepresence robot: For those who are unable to move at all, a telepresence robot could provide a way to explore the world from the comfort of your own home. This robot would be equipped with a camera and speakers, allowing you to see and hear the world around you, and could be controlled using a joystick or other input device. This would provide a sense of presence and connection to the world, even if you are unable to physically move around."
