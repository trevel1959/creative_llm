    "Education and training would become obsolete: With everyone becoming a genius overnight, traditional methods of education and training may become obsolete. People may no longer need to go to school or learn specific skills in order to succeed. Instead, they could focus on their natural talents and abilities.",

If everyone became a genius, we could lose some of the unique perspectives and ideas that come from diverse backgrounds and experiences."
