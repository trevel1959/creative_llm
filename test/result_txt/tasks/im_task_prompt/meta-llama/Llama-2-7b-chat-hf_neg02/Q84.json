    "Smart Coat Rack with AI-Powered Coat Organization: Create a coat rack with an AI-powered system that can recognize and sort coats based on their owner, type, and other factors. The system could use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze the shape, color, and texture of each coat, and then assign it to the appropriate owner or storage location. This would eliminate the need for manual organization and make it easier to find a specific coat in a crowded entryway.",
    "Interactive Coat Rack with Games and Entertainment: Design a coat rack with built-in games and entertainment features, such as a touchscreen display, speakers, and wireless charging for mobile devices.

    "Coat Rack with Integrated Air Purifier and Humidifier: Create a coat rack with built-in air purification and humidification capabilities, providing a clean and comfortable environment for hanging coats.

    "Coat Rack with Smart Lighting and Mood Setting: Design a coat rack with programmable smart lighting and mood-setting capabilities, allowing users to create a personalized atmosphere in their entryway. The lighting could be adjusted to match different times of day or moods, and the mood setting could include features such as aromatherapy or calming music.",
    "Coat Rack with Hidden Storage and Secret Compartments: Create a coat rack with hidden storage compartments and secret drawers, providing a fun and unexpected surprise for users. The coat rack could have a sleek and minimalist design on the outside, but reveal a treasure trove of storage space on the inside, perfect for stashing away small items such as keys, wallets, or jewelry."
