    "**Sleep Pods with Soundscapes**: Create personal sleep pods equipped with immersive soundscapes that can mimic nighttime environments. These pods would feature customizable sounds like gentle rain, ocean waves, or soft rustling leaves. The soundscapes would help induce relaxation and signal to the body that it’s time to sleep, regardless of the external brightness.",
    "**Wearable Sleep Masks**: Design a high-tech sleep mask that not only blocks out light but also uses advanced technology to create a virtual night environment. The mask could project calming visuals, such as starry skies or tranquil landscapes, and play soothing sounds. Additionally, it could track sleep patterns and adjust its features based on the wearer’s needs, promoting deeper and more restorative sleep.",
    "**Biological Sleep Aids**: Research and develop natural supplements that can help regulate sleep cycles in a world without night. These could include plant-based compounds that promote melatonin production or adaptogens that help the body cope with constant light exposure. The idea would be to create a holistic approach to sleep that aligns with the body's natural rhythms.",
    "**Community Sleep Quarters**: Establish community sleep quarters designed for group sleeping experiences. These spaces would feature dimmed lighting, soundproofing, and comfortable bedding. People could come together to create a sense of community and safety while sleeping, reinforcing the idea that rest is a shared experience. Special events could be held, like “Silent Nights,” where everyone engages in quiet activities before entering a communal sleep space.",
    "**Dream-Inducing Aromatherapy**: Create an aromatherapy system that releases calming scents at designated times to signal the body when it’s time to sleep. Scents like lavender, chamomile, or sandalwood could be diffused into the air, encouraging relaxation and signaling the body to transition into sleep mode. This could be integrated into homes, workplaces, or public spaces to help individuals unwind throughout the day."
