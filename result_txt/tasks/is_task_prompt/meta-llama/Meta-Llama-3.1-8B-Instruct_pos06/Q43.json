    "**Self-Lacing System with AI Integration**: Design a shoe with a self-lacing system that uses AI to adjust the tightness and support based on the user's activity level, terrain, and personal preferences. The AI would learn the user's behavior and adapt the lacing system to provide optimal comfort and performance.",
    "**Smart Cushioning with Dynamic Support**: Develop a shoe with smart cushioning that adjusts its firmness and support in real-time based on the user's running or walking style. The cushioning system would use sensors and AI to detect changes in the user's movement and adjust its support to prevent injuries and provide a smoother ride.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with 3D-Printed Components**: Create a shoe with an ergonomic design that uses 3D-printed components to provide a customized fit for each user. The 3D-printed components would be designed to conform to the user's foot shape and provide optimal support and comfort.",
    "**Energy-Harvesting Insoles**: Develop insoles that harness the user's kinetic energy and convert it into electrical energy to power small devices such as fitness trackers, smartphones, or even smart home devices.",
    "**Biomechanical Feedback System**: Design a shoe with a biomechanical feedback system that provides real-time feedback to the user on their running or walking form, helping them to correct any inefficiencies and prevent injuries. The system would use sensors and AI to analyze the user's movement and provide personalized coaching and feedback."
