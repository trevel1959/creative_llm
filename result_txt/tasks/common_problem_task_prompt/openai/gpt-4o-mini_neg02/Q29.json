    "**Communication Barriers**: Deep-sea environments present challenges for communication. The immense pressure and water can interfere with radio signals, making it difficult to maintain contact with surface teams. This can lead to isolation of the crew and hinder real-time decision-making. Implementing robust underwater communication technologies, such as acoustic modems, can help ensure consistent communication.",
    "**Decompression Sickness**: If the crew is diving to significant depths and returning to the surface, there is a risk of decompression sickness (the bends). This occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream due to rapid ascent. Proper training in dive tables and gradual ascent protocols is crucial to minimize this risk, along with ensuring that medical support is available.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Deep-sea exploration can have adverse effects on marine ecosystems. Activities such as sampling, drilling, or even the presence of the submersible can disturb delicate habitats. To address this, missions should incorporate environmental assessments and adhere to guidelines that minimize ecological disruption, such as using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for sampling instead of direct contact.",
    "**Psychological Stress**: The isolation and confinement of deep-sea missions can lead to psychological stress among crew members. Extended periods underwater can affect mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, or interpersonal conflicts. Regular mental health check-ins, recreational activities, and maintaining open lines of communication can help support crew well-being.",
    "**Limited Resources**: Deep-sea missions often have limited resources, including food, oxygen, and power. Running out of supplies can be catastrophic. Careful planning and resource management, along with the potential for on-site resource extraction (like seawater desalination for drinking water), can help ensure the crew has what they need for the duration of the mission."
