    "**Color-Changing Notes**: Introduce Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or UV exposure. This could be a fun way to indicate urgency or importanceâ€”notes that turn red could signal immediate action, while blue might indicate ideas that are still in the brainstorming phase. The color change could also be a visual cue for deadlines or project phases.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Adhesive Notes**: Develop a line of Post-it Notes made from recycled materials and using plant-based adhesives. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, these notes could be designed to decompose after a certain period, reducing waste and promoting sustainability in office supplies.",
    "**Interactive Post-it Notes**: Create Post-it Notes with QR codes printed on them. When scanned, these codes could link to online resources, such as instructional videos, collaborative documents, or even reminders in digital calendars. This would merge the physical and digital worlds, enhancing the utility of a simple sticky note.",
    "**Post-it Note Wall Calendar**: Design a giant wall calendar made entirely of Post-it Notes, where each note represents a day. Users can write their daily tasks or events on the notes, and they can be easily rearranged or removed. This interactive calendar would be visually engaging and perfect for offices or classrooms, encouraging collaboration and organization.",
    "**Post-it Note Stamps**: Introduce a line of Post-it Notes that come with built-in stamps for common phrases or icons (like \"urgent,\" \"idea,\" or \"follow-up\"). Users can simply press the stamp onto the note to quickly categorize or prioritize their messages. This would save time and add a fun, personalized touch to note-taking."
