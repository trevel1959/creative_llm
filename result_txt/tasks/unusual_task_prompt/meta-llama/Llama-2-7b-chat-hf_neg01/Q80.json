    "Glow-in-the-Dark Lampshade: Create a lampshade that emits a soft, eerie glow in the dark. This can be achieved through the use of phosphorescent materials, which absorb light and release it slowly over time. The glow-in-the-dark lampshade can add a unique and mysterious ambiance to any room, perfect for a midnight reading session or a spooky movie night.",
    "Shape-Shifting Lampshade: Design a lampshade that changes shape in response to changes in the lighting environment. For example, the lampshade could be a flat disc when the light is off, but as soon as the light is turned on, it expands into a unique shape, such as a flower or a bird. This can add an element of surprise and playfulness to the room, and can also serve as a functional reminder to turn off the lights when not in use.",
    "Smart Lampshade: Develop a lampshade that can adjust its brightness and color temperature in response to the time of day and the user's preferences. This can be achieved through the use of sensors that detect the light levels in the room and the user's circadian rhythms. The smart lampshade can help promote a healthy sleep-wake cycle and reduce eye strain, making it a practical and innovative addition to any home.",
    "Interactive Lampshade: Create a lampshade that can interact with the user through movement and sound. For example, the lampshade could be designed to change color or pattern in response to the user's movements, or to produce soothing sounds, such as ocean waves or bird chirps, when the user taps or moves it. This can add an element of fun and playfulness to the room, and can also serve as a calming and relaxing addition to the space.",
    "Solar-Powered Lampshade: Design a lampshade that harnesses the power of the sun to provide light. This can be achieved through the use of solar panels integrated into the lampshade, which can capture and convert sunlight into electricity. The solar-powered lampshade can provide a sustainable and eco-friendly"
