    "Toothbrush with a Built-In Toothpaste Dispenser: Create a toothbrush with a built-in toothpaste dispenser that automatically releases the right amount of toothpaste onto the brush head every time you brush. This would eliminate the need for manual toothpaste squeezing, making the brushing process more efficient and convenient.",
    "Toothbrush with a Personalized Brushing Experience: Develop a toothbrush that uses sensors and AI to customize the brushing experience based on an individual's oral health needs. The toothbrush could adjust the brushing speed, pressure, and technique based on real-time feedback from the sensors, providing a personalized cleaning experience.",
    "Toothbrush with a Built-In Water Flosser: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser, allowing users to clean between their teeth and below the gumline with ease. This would eliminate the need for a separate water flosser, making the toothbrush more compact and convenient to use.",
    "Toothbrush with a Gaming Interface: Create a toothbrush that incorporates a gaming interface, such as a small screen or LED lights, that provides a fun and interactive brushing experience for kids. The toothbrush could display a game or animation that encourages kids to brush for the full recommended 2 minutes, making oral hygiene more enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Toothbrush with a Social Impact: Design a toothbrush that has a social impact, such as donating a portion of the proceeds to a charity or providing oral health education in underserved communities. This would not only promote good oral hygiene but also contribute to a larger social cause, making the toothbrush more than just a personal grooming product."
