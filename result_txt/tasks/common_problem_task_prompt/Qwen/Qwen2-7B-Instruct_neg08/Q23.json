    "**Cultural Exchange Program**: Create a program where government employees can swap roles for a certain period of time. This could be done within different departments or across regions to gain a broader perspective on task management. For example, an employee who usually handles paperwork in one department might get to experience project management in another. This would not only help in learning new skills but also reduce feelings of envy by fostering empathy and understanding towards other roles.",
    "**Performance Metrics Transparency**: Develop a system that makes the performance metrics of all government employees transparent. This could involve creating a dashboard that displays each individual's achievements, goals, and progress. By seeing the process and the efforts behind seemingly seamless tasks, it could demystify the perception of effortless success and promote a culture of shared learning and support.",
    "**Mentorship Circles**: Establish mentorship circles within the government where experienced employees can guide newcomers or those facing challenges. This could be structured around specific roles or skill sets. It would not only provide support and guidance to those feeling left behind but also encourage knowledge sharing and personal growth, reducing feelings of jealousy and promoting a sense of community.",
    "**Skill Development Workshops**: Organize regular workshops focusing on various aspects of government operations, from project management to digital literacy. These could be open to all employees and offer certificates upon completion. This proactive approach would empower individuals to develop skills independently, reducing the perception of others' seamless tasks as unattainable.",
    "**Feedback and Recognition System**: Implement a comprehensive feedback and recognition system that acknowledges both the outcomes of tasks and the processes involved. This could include peer reviews, self-assessments, and supervisor evaluations. By valuing the journey and the effort put into tasks, it could shift the focus from羡慕 (envy) to appreciation for diverse contributions and successes. This would also encourage a culture of continuous improvement and learning."
