    "Drowning risk: Even if equipped with life vests, scuba tanks, and rescue equipment, there is still a risk of drowning in extreme settings. It is vital to monitor each diver closely and have a rescue team on standby in case of emergencies.",
    "Pressure sickness: This condition, also known as \"bends\" or \"the compressor sickness,\" occurs when the pressure inside the body changes rapidly. Symptoms include hearing and vision problems, joint pain, fatigue, and even unconsciousness. Proper training and gradual ascent are essential to avoid these symptoms.",
    "Water pressure damage: Prolonged exposure to extreme water pressure can damage equipment and instruments, both on the surface and underwater. Ensuring the equipment is rated for deep-sea exploration and that it is well-maintained, is essential.",
    "Communication challenges: Underwater communication is difficult due to the high water volume and limited ability to transmit sounds. Divers are usually equipped with a communication device, such as a mouthpiece or a full-face mask, to relay their observations or to call for help.",
    "Water temperature: Cold water can lead to hypothermia and frostbite. Dressing in appropriate thermal gear such as a wetsuit and staying active during the dive to maintain circulation can help prevent hypothermia."
