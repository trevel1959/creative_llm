As an added bonus, hot air balloons could also be used for sightseeing tours, offering a bird's-eye view of the world below.",
    "Personal Flight Devices: For those who prefer a more futuristic approach, personal flight devices could become the norm.

This mode of transportation would be ideal for short-distance travel, such as commuting to work or school, and could also be used for recreational purposes.",
    "Underwater Travel: For those who live near the coast or have access to large bodies of water, underwater travel could become a viable option.
