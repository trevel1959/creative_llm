    "**Bioluminescent Bees**: Develop genetically engineered bees that produce a soft, blue-green glow. These \"glow bees\" would pollinate plants at night, using their bioluminescence to attract each other and the plants they pollinate. The glow would also serve as a warning system to alert other bees of potential threats. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Robo-Pollinators**: Design and deploy small, autonomous robots that mimic the flight patterns and behavior of bees. These robo-pollinators would be equipped with tiny sensors to detect the presence of flowers and pollen, and would use advanced algorithms to optimize their pollination routes. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Mimicry Microorganisms**: Engineer microorganisms that can mimic the scent and appearance of flowers, allowing them to attract pollinators. These microorganisms would be designed to break down and recycle organic matter, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional pollination methods. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Attract-and-Collect Systems**: Develop a network of sensors and drones that detect the presence of flowers and pollen, and then dispatch specialized drones to collect and transport pollen between plants. This system would use machine learning to optimize pollination routes and ensure efficient transfer of genetic material. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Edible Pollinators**: Create genetically engineered, edible plants that produce pollen or seeds with built-in pollination capabilities. These \"pollinator plants\" would be designed to attract and attract pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, and would provide a sustainable source of food for these creatures. Confidence: 0.9"
