    "Build a Solar-Powered Haven: Harness the sun's energy to generate electricity using solar panels. Create a self-sustaining ecosystem within a designated area, including plants, animals, and a water collection system. This would provide a reliable source of food, shelter, and water, making it easier to survive without electricity.",
    "Utilize Wind Power: Set up a wind turbine to generate electricity. This would provide a consistent source of energy, especially in areas with strong winds. Consider building a wind turbine that can be easily assembled and disassembled, making it portable and versatile.",
    "Create a Rainwater Collection System: Collect and store rainwater in large containers, such as barrels or tanks. This would provide a reliable source of clean water, which could be used for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. Consider adding a filtration system to ensure the water is safe to consume.",
    "Implement a Composting Toilet System: Use a composting toilet system that converts human waste into fertilizer. This would eliminate the need for water for flushing and reduce the amount of waste generated. Consider adding a solar-powered fan to maintain proper airflow and temperature within the composting system.",
    "Build a Fire Pit: Create a fire pit using local materials, such as rocks and twigs. Use this as a source of warmth, light, and cooking fuel. Consider adding a chimney or vent to improve airflow and reduce smoke buildup. This would provide a reliable source of heat and light, making it easier to survive without electricity."
