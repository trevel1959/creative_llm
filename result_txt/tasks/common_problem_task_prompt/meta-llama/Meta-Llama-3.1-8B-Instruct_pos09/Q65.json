    "**Aurora Phone**: The Aurora Phone features a dynamic, holographic display that shimmers and changes colors based on the user's surroundings. This is achieved through a patented technology that incorporates micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology. The phone's AI-powered ambient awareness system uses environmental sensors to detect the user's location, time of day, and weather conditions, adjusting the display's colors and patterns accordingly. For example, during a sunset, the phone's display could shift to warm, golden hues, while in a bright, sunny environment, it could switch to a calming, sky-blue color. This technology not only enhances the user experience but also serves as a conversation starter.",
