    "Floating Parks: With mountains gone, the world would have an abundance of water, and it could be harnessed to create man-made floating islands for outdoor activities. These islands could be designed to resemble mountains, complete with trees, rocks, and even artificial waterfalls. People could kayak, paddleboard, or even bungee jump between the islands, creating a thrilling and unique outdoor experience.",
    "Cloud Parks: Instead of mountains, clouds could be harnessed to create floating parks that provide a new platform for outdoor activities. These parks could be designed to mimic the shapes and textures of clouds, complete with soft, fluffy surfaces and wispy tendrils for climbing and sliding. People could play games like \"cloud tag\" or \"cloud soccer\" while taking in breathtaking views of the sky.",
    "Underwater Oases: With the absence of mountains, the oceans would have more space to accommodate new landmasses. These underwater oases could be created by sinking artificial islands or constructing massive underwater domes. These spaces would provide a unique opportunity for scuba diving, snorkeling, and other water sports, as well as offering a chance to explore new marine life and ecosystems.",
    "Gravity-Defying Cities: Without mountains, cities could be built to defy gravity, floating high above the ground on a network of interconnected platforms. These cities could be designed with cantilevered walkways, vertical parks, and even zero-gravity sports arenas. People could live, work, and play in a weightless environment, offering a completely new perspective on urban living.",
    "Airborne Communities: With mountains gone, the skies would be filled with floating communities, each one a self-sustaining ecosystem. These communities could be built using a combination of aerodynamic shapes and advanced materials, providing a stable and comfortable living environment for its inhabitants. People could live and work in these communities, enjoying the freedom of floating above the ground while still having access to all the necessities of life."
