Implementing strategies to mitigate these risks, such as strategic partnerships with reliable suppliers, improving warehouse management, and creating a well-organized transportation network, is essential to ensuring the successful operation of the winery.",
    "Staffing and Management Challenges: Attracting and retaining skilled employees is a key challenge for a winery. Some potential issues include low wages, lack of training opportunities, and high turnover rates for staff members.
