    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Catering is often a significant contributor to a wedding's carbon footprint. Couples may struggle to find caterers who offer organic, locally-sourced, and seasonal menu options. This can lead to dilemmas over food waste and the environmental impact of transporting ingredients. A solution is to collaborate with caterers who specialize in farm-to-table dining and to consider smaller, more intimate meals that reduce leftovers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples may face challenges in finding eco-friendly alternatives that still convey the desired aesthetic and feel. To overcome this, they can opt for digital invitations or use recycled paper, plantable invitations (which can be planted to grow flowers), or biodegradable materials to create a unique, sustainable invitation experience.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Coordinating transportation for guests can be a logistical nightmare, especially if the venue is far from the majority of attendees. This can lead to increased carbon emissions from individual travel. Couples can address this by organizing group transportation, such as shuttle buses, or encouraging carpooling to minimize the number of vehicles used and reduce their overall carbon footprint.",
    "**Floral Arrangements**: The floral industry can have a significant environmental impact due to the use of pesticides, non-native species, and long-distance shipping. Couples might struggle to find local florists who offer sustainable options. To solve this, they can consider using seasonal, locally-sourced flowers, or even opting for potted plants that guests can take home after the wedding, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Eco-Conscious Attire**: Finding wedding attire that is both stylish and eco-friendly can be a challenge. Many traditional wedding dresses and suits are made from non-sustainable materials and may involve unethical labor practices. Couples can explore options such as renting attire, purchasing from sustainable designers, or even wearing vintage clothing, which can add a unique touch while supporting sustainable practices."
