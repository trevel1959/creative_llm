    "**Temperature-Regulating Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush that incorporates temperature control technology. The bristles could be made from a material that can heat up or cool down depending on the user's preference. For example, heated bristles could help with styling by providing gentle heat for curls or waves, while cool bristles could help soothe the scalp and reduce frizz. This dual functionality would cater to different styling needs in one tool.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush with App Integration**: Develop a hairbrush that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could track hair health by analyzing the condition of the hair during brushing (e.g., split ends, dryness) and provide personalized care recommendations. Additionally, it could include features like a timer for optimal brushing duration, reminders for hair treatments, and tutorials for different styling techniques.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hairbrush**: Design a hairbrush that combines several tools into one. For instance, it could feature a detachable section that transforms into a comb, a small mirror for touch-ups, and even a small compartment for hair ties or clips. This would be perfect for on-the-go styling, allowing users to carry fewer items while still having everything they need at their fingertips.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Create a sustainable hairbrush made from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. The brush could feature replaceable bristle heads, allowing users to switch out worn bristles without needing to replace the entire brush. This would reduce waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers who want to minimize their carbon footprint.",
    "**Massage-Infused Hairbrush**: Innovate a hairbrush that incorporates a gentle massage feature. The bristles could be designed with soft rubber tips that stimulate the scalp while brushing, promoting blood circulation and relaxation. This would not only make brushing a more enjoyable experience but could also contribute to healthier hair growth and a soothing self-care routine."
