    "**Global Economic Shift**: With the sudden cessation of wars, the massive amounts of resources previously allocated to military spending would be redirected towards economic development, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. This could lead to a significant boost in global economic growth, as nations would focus on investing in their citizens' well-being and education, rather than on war machinery.
