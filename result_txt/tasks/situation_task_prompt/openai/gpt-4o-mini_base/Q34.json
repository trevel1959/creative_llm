    "**Solar-Powered Desalination**: Create a solar-powered desalination unit that can convert seawater into fresh water for irrigation. This system would harness solar energy to evaporate seawater, leaving salt behind, and then condense the vapor into fresh water. This approach not only provides a sustainable water source but also addresses water scarcity in coastal areas where saltwater is abundant.",
    "**Self-Watering Planters**: Design innovative self-watering planters equipped with a moisture sensor and a water reservoir. These planters would automatically release water to the plants when the soil moisture drops below a certain level. The reservoir could be filled using collected rainwater or alternative sources, ensuring that plants receive a consistent supply of water even in the absence of rainfall.",
    "**Aquaponics System**: Implement an aquaponics system that combines aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics (growing plants in water). The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, while the plants filter and clean the water for the fish. This closed-loop system requires minimal water input, as it recycles water continuously. Even without rain, the system can thrive, and it produces both plants and fish for consumption.",
    "**Greywater Recycling**: Establish a greywater recycling system that collects and treats wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This treated greywater can then be used to irrigate plants. By repurposing water that would otherwise go to waste, gardeners can maintain healthy plants while promoting sustainability and reducing overall water consumption.",
    "**Plant-Centric Fog Nets**: Create specialized fog nets designed to capture fog and dew, particularly in coastal or mountainous regions where fog is prevalent. These nets would be placed strategically around plants to collect moisture from the air as fog passes through. The collected water would drip down into a trough or reservoir, providing a steady supply of water to the plants below."
