When the candle is burned down to a certain level, it signals that the task is complete.",
    "Candle-Timed Tasks: Develop a candle with a built-in timer that burns for a set amount of time, such as 10 or 30 minutes. When the timer goes off, it signals the user to move on to the next task. This can help users stay focused and avoid getting bogged down in one task for too long.",
