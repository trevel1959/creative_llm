    "Use the power of nature: Imagine harnessing the natural light of the sun, moon, or stars to light up a room at night. You could use large windows or skylights to let in as much natural light as possible. For areas that don't have access to natural light, you could use mirrors to reflect the light from nearby sources or create a light tunnel using a long, narrow space with mirrors on both sides to bounce light around.",
    "Utilize alternative light sources: Without traditional lamps and lighting fixtures, you could use alternative light sources like candles, lanterns, or even glow sticks to light up a room. You could create a warm and cozy atmosphere by using different colored candles or lanterns to create a festive ambiance. Glow sticks could also be used to create a fun and playful lighting effect.",
    "Employ creative lighting techniques: Instead of relying on traditional light sources, you could use creative lighting techniques to light up a room. For example, you could use shadows to create interesting patterns on walls or use light-colored furniture or decor to reflect light around the room. You could also use LED lights or glow-in-the-dark paint to create unique and eye-catching lighting effects.",
    "Develop a light-harvesting system: Imagine creating a system that harnesses the energy of the sun or other natural sources to light up a room. You could use solar panels or wind turbines to generate electricity, which could then be stored in batteries or used to power lighting devices like LED lights or glowing objects. This would not only provide light but also reduce your reliance on traditional energy sources.",
    "Incorporate light-emitting materials: You could use materials that emit light naturally, like phosphorescent materials, to light up a room. These materials absorb light and then emit it back out over time, providing a soft and consistent glow. You could incorporate these materials into furniture, walls, or decor to create a unique and sustainable lighting effect."
