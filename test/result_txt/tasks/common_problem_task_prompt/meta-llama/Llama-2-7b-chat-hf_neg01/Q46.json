    "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS): Implement an integrated transportation management system that utilizes real-time data and artificial intelligence to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. This system would use sensors, cameras, and machine learning algorithms to detect and respond to traffic patterns, accidents, and other disruptions in real-time.",
    "Autonomous Vehicles: Invest in the development and implementation of autonomous vehicles that can navigate through the city's streets safely and efficiently. These vehicles would reduce the number of private cars on the road, decrease traffic congestion, and provide a more comfortable and convenient transportation option for commuters.",
    "Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Network: Establish a network of VTOL vehicles that can take off and land vertically, eliminating the need for traditional runways and improving transportation times and efficiency. These VTOL vehicles could be electric or hybrid, reducing emissions and noise pollution.",
    "Hyperloop System: Invest in the development of a hyperloop system that can transport passengers and cargo at high speeds through a network of vacuum-sealed tubes. This system would reduce travel times between the city and other nearby locations, making it a more efficient and convenient option for long-distance commutes.",
    "Personalized Mobility Services: Offer personalized mobility services that use data analytics and machine learning to optimize transportation routes and schedules based on individual user preferences and needs. This could include on-demand transportation services, carpooling, and bike-sharing programs, all integrated into a single platform for easy use."
