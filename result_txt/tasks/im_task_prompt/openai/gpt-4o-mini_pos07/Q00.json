    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Pencil**:    Instead of disposable wooden pencils, this design would use a refillable mechanism where the outer casing is made from biodegradable materials. Users could replace the graphite cores when they run out, reducing waste. The casing could come in various designs and colors, allowing for personalization while promoting sustainability.",
    "**Multi-Function Pencil**:    This pencil would combine multiple writing tools into one. It could have interchangeable leads (graphite, colored, or even erasable) and additional features like a built-in eraser, sharpener, and ruler. The design could incorporate a twist mechanism to switch between leads, making it an all-in-one tool for artists, students, and professionals alike.",
    "**Ergonomic Pencil with Adjustable Grip**:    A pencil designed with an adjustable grip that can be customized to fit the user’s hand size and writing style. The grip could be made from a soft, flexible material that molds to the user’s fingers, providing comfort during long writing sessions. This would be especially beneficial for children or individuals with hand disabilities.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in LED Light**:    This pencil would feature a small LED light at the tip that illuminates the writing surface. Ideal for low-light conditions, this design would help users see what they’re writing without needing an external light source. The LED could be powered by a small, rechargeable battery, making it a practical tool for students studying in dimly lit environments.",
    "**Mood Color-Changing Pencil**:    This innovative pencil would change color based on the pressure applied or the temperature of the user’s hand. For instance, it could shift from blue to red when writing hard or from green to yellow when warm. This could add a fun and engaging element to writing, especially for children, and could also serve as a visual cue for stress or excitement during creative processes."
