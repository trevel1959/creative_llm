    "**Eco-Conscious Catering**: Selecting a caterer who uses locally sourced, organic ingredients can be difficult. Some caterers may not have experience with sustainable practices, leading to potential waste from non-biodegradable packaging or excessive food waste. Couples should discuss menu options that minimize waste, such as buffet-style service or plant-based dishes, and ensure that leftovers are donated to local shelters or composted.",
    "**Green Invitations**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Digital invitations are a great alternative, but not all guests may be tech-savvy, which could lead to miscommunication or exclusion. To address this, couples can offer a hybrid approach, sending digital invites to the majority while providing a small number of beautifully designed, recycled paper invitations for those who prefer them.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Finding wedding attire that is both stylish and sustainable can be a challenge. Many bridal shops carry dresses made from synthetic materials, which are not environmentally friendly. Couples can explore options like renting dresses, buying second-hand, or supporting designers who use sustainable fabrics. However, this may require more time for research and fittings, which can add stress to the planning process.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Ensuring that guests can travel to the venue in an eco-friendly manner can be complicated. Relying on individual cars can lead to increased carbon emissions. Couples can coordinate group transportation options, such as shuttles or carpooling, but this requires clear communication and planning to ensure guests feel comfortable and informed about the arrangements.",
    "**Zero-Waste Decor**: Creating beautiful wedding decor while minimizing waste is a significant challenge. Many decorations are often single-use and end up in landfills. Couples can opt for biodegradable or reusable decor items, such as potted plants that guests can take home. However, sourcing these items can be time-consuming and may require creativity to ensure the decor still meets their aesthetic vision."
