    "In a treehouse: If all beds disappeared, I would build a treehouse in a sturdy tree with a comfortable mattress and blankets. I would use the branches for support and the trunk for a solid foundation.",
    "On a boat: I would rent a boat and sleep on the water. The gentle rocking of the boat would provide a peaceful and soothing sleep experience.",
    "In a hammock: I would hang a hammock in a quiet and comfortable spot. The soft fabric and gentle sway would provide a relaxing sleep experience.",
    "In a tent: I would set up a tent in a safe and secure location. The warmth and protection of the tent would provide a comfortable sleep experience.",
    "In a park: I would find a quiet spot in a park and sleep on a bench or grass. The fresh air and natural surroundings would provide a peaceful and restful sleep experience."
