    "Smart Contacts: Special contact lenses could be developed that contain a small computer chip and a tiny display. These \"smart contacts\" could display prices and allow users to make payments by blinking or tilting their head. This technology is still in its infancy, but it could revolutionize the way we pay for things.",
    "Holographic Displays: In a world without physical money, holographic displays could be used to project images of products or services, allowing customers to \"try before they buy.\" This technology would require advanced holographic projectors and sophisticated software, but it could create a more immersive and engaging shopping experience."
