    "**Film Selection and Curation**: Selecting films that resonate with the target audience while also meeting quality standards can be a daunting task. There may be disagreements among the selection committee about which films to include, and the risk of not securing rights for certain films could lead to last-minute changes in the lineup. Additionally, there may be a lack of diversity in the films selected, which could alienate certain audience demographics.",
    "**Sponsorship and Funding Issues**: Securing funding and sponsorships is vital for the festival's success. Problems can arise if potential sponsors back out at the last minute or if the budget falls short, leading to cutbacks in marketing, venue quality, or other essential aspects of the festival. Additionally, there may be difficulties in aligning the festival's values with sponsors, leading to potential conflicts of interest.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Challenges**: Effectively promoting the festival to attract attendees is essential but can be challenging. There may be difficulties in reaching the target audience, particularly if the marketing strategy is not well-defined. Additionally, competing events or festivals may overshadow the promotion efforts, leading to lower attendance than expected.",
    "**Logistical Coordination**: Organizing the various logistical aspects of the festival, such as scheduling screenings, managing ticket sales, and coordinating volunteers, can lead to potential issues. For example, technical glitches could disrupt screenings, or miscommunication with volunteers could result in a lack of support during critical moments, impacting the overall experience for attendees.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Ensuring that attendees have a memorable and engaging experience is vital. Potential problems include inadequate Q&A sessions with filmmakers, poorly organized networking events, or a lack of interactive activities that could enhance audience involvement. If attendees feel disconnected from the festival, they may not return in future years."
