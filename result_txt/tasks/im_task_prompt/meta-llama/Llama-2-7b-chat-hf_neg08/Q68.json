    "Develop a smart calculator that can detect and recognize handwriting input, allowing users to solve math problems by writing them down directly on the calculator's touchscreen. This would make calculations more intuitive and efficient, especially for complex calculations that require multiple steps.",
    "Create a calculator with a built-in augmented reality (AR) display, which would allow users to visualize mathematical concepts and problems in 3D space. This would make learning math more engaging and interactive, especially for students who struggle with visualizing complex concepts.",
    "Design a calculator with a voice-controlled interface, allowing users to perform calculations and access functions using voice commands. This would be especially useful for individuals with disabilities or mobility issues, as it would provide an alternative to typing or tapping on the calculator's buttons.",
    "Develop a calculator that can learn and adapt to a user's preferences and habits over time, providing personalized calculations and recommendations based on their usage patterns. This would make the calculator more user-friendly and efficient, as users would no longer have to navigate through menus or remember complex keyboard shortcuts.",
    "Create a calculator with a built-in AI assistant that can help users solve complex math problems by providing step-by-step explanations and visual aids. This would make learning and understanding math more accessible and engaging, especially for students who struggle with math."
