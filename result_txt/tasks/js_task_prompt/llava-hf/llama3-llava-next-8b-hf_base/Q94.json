    "Bio-Energetic Resonance: This new energy would exploit the natural resonance and electromagnetic signals emitted by all living organisms. By tapping into and amplifying these signals, it can create clean, sustainable, and self-renewing energy.",
    "Gravitational Capacitor: This energy source would utilize the gravitational effect of massive objects in space to generate electricity, harnessing the gravitational pull and converting it into a usable energy form. This would provide a zero-carbon, self-sustaining, and perpetual energy source with virtually no environmental impact.",
    "Time Dilation Reactor: This energy system would create an environment where time slows down and speeds up, allowing the efficient extraction of energy from matter and accelerating the reaction rates within a contained space. The resulting energy output could power various operations without the environmental consequences typically associated with combustion-based systems.",
    "Photonic Crystal Matrix: By precisely arranging photonic crystals, it's possible to create an artificial crystal with an extremely high refractive index, which can trap and convert light into usable energy. This photonic crystal matrix would efficiently absorb and convert sunlight, and could serve as a clean and sustainable energy source.",
    "Helical Fusion Reactor: This reactor utilizes the unique properties of helical magnetic fields to create a stable and safe fusion reaction, mimicking the action of the sun and stars. Helical fusion allows for a more reliable, efficient, and cleaner energy source compared to traditional fusion reactors."
