    "Sound-Activated Bell: This bicycle bell would emit a sound only when the rider pedals. It would use sensors to detect the motion of the pedals and trigger the bell to ring. This would make it more efficient and effective for the rider to only ring the bell when necessary.",
    "Smartphone-Controlled Bell: This bicycle bell would be controlled through a smartphone app. The rider could set the bell to ring at a specific time or distance, and the app would automatically ring the bell. This would make it more effective for the rider to ring the bell at the appropriate time and distance.",
    "Multi-Functional Bell: This bicycle bell would have multiple functions. It could ring a standard bell sound, a loud horn, or even a chime. It could also have a flashing light that would alert other riders or pedestrians of the rider's presence. This would make it more efficient and effective for the rider to communicate their presence and intentions.",
    "Voice-Activated Bell: This bicycle bell would be activated by the rider's voice. The rider could say a specific phrase, such as \"bell\" or \"alert,\" and the bell would ring. This would make it more efficient and effective for the rider to communicate their presence and intentions without having to take their hands off the handlebars.",
    "Self-Charging Bell: This bicycle bell would be equipped with a solar panel that would charge the bell's battery as the rider pedals. This would make it more efficient and effective for the rider to keep the bell charged without having to carry extra batteries or stop to charge the bell."
