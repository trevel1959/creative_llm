    "**Reflection on Water**: If all mirrors vanished, people could still see their reflections on calm bodies of water like lakes, rivers, or ponds. The ripples on the water's surface would create a distorted but recognizable image of oneself. This would be a temporary solution, as the reflection would disappear as soon as the water becomes turbulent.",
    "**Smart Windows**: Buildings and homes could be equipped with advanced smart windows that can display a person's reflection. These windows would use advanced nanotechnology or artificial intelligence to project a virtual mirror-like image, allowing people to see themselves even without traditional mirrors.",
    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses**: People could wear augmented reality (AR) contact lenses that use AI-powered vision to project a virtual mirror image. These lenses would use the user's surroundings to create a realistic reflection, even in the absence of physical mirrors.",
    "**Biometric Displays**: Biometric displays could be integrated into clothing, jewelry, or wearable devices, allowing people to see their reflection on a small, wearable screen. These displays would use advanced sensors and AI to create a personalized, accurate reflection.",
    "**Holographic Displays**: In a more futuristic scenario, holographic displays could be used to project a 3D image of oneself. These displays would use lasers and AI to create a realistic, interactive hologram that can be viewed from multiple angles, allowing people to see themselves from any perspective. [/INST] "
