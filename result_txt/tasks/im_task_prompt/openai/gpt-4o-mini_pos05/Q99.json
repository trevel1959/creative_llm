    "**Multi-Tape Dispenser**: Design a tape dispenser that can hold multiple rolls of different types of tape (e.g., masking tape, washi tape, double-sided tape). Users can switch between tapes easily by turning a dial or pressing a button, making it a versatile tool for various projects without needing to change dispensers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dispenser**: Create a tape dispenser made entirely from biodegradable or recycled materials. Additionally, the tape itself could be made from plant-based materials, ensuring that both the dispenser and the tape are environmentally friendly. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Tape Dispenser with Built-in Cutter**: Develop a dispenser that features a built-in rotary cutter. Instead of using a blade that can dull over time, a rotary cutter would allow for smoother and safer cutting of tape. This could also be designed to retract when not in use for added safety.",
    "**Adjustable Tape Width Dispenser**: Design a tape dispenser that can accommodate different widths of tape. Users can adjust the width setting to fit the tape roll they are using. This would eliminate the need for multiple dispensers and make it easier for users to switch between tape sizes.",
    "**Magnetic Tape Dispenser**: Incorporate a magnetic base into the design, allowing the tape dispenser to stick to metal surfaces such as filing cabinets or desks. This would prevent the dispenser from sliding around during use and keep it accessible without taking up additional space."
