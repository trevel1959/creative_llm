    "Create a makeshift toolkit: Use materials found on the island to create tools for survival, such as a knife made from a coconut shell, a bow and arrow made from bamboo and rocks, or a fishing net made from vines and rocks. Use these tools to build a shelter, hunt for food, and signal for help.",
    "Explore the island: Use the island's resources to create a makeshift raft or boat, and explore the surrounding waters to see if there are any other islands or signs of civilization nearby. Use the island's natural resources to navigate, such as the sun, stars, and wind. Explore the island's ecosystem and learn about the unique plants and animals that inhabit the island, potentially discovering new species or resources."
