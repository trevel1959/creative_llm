    "**Microgreens Revolution**: With the disappearance of fruits and vegetables, microgreens become the primary source of essential vitamins and minerals. These young, nutrient-dense greens are harvested within 1-3 weeks of germination and are packed with vitamins A, C, and K, as well as minerals like calcium and iron. People would cultivate microgreens in indoor vertical farms or urban gardens, using hydroponics or aeroponics to optimize growth. Microgreens would be a key component of a balanced diet, with various species offering different nutritional profiles. For example, pea shoots would provide high levels of vitamin K, while radish greens would offer a boost of vitamin C.",
    "**Insect-Based Nutrition**: Insects become a primary source of protein and essential vitamins and minerals. Companies would develop insect farms to produce crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers, which are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and calcium. Insect-based foods would be fortified with vitamins and minerals to ensure a balanced diet. Insect-based nutrition would be particularly beneficial for individuals with dietary restrictions or preferences, such as vegans and vegetarians.",
    "**Seaweed-Based Supplements**: Seaweed becomes the primary source of essential vitamins and minerals, particularly iodine, vitamin B12, and iron. Seaweed-based supplements would be developed to provide a concentrated dose of these nutrients. People would consume seaweed-based foods, such as seaweed snacks, smoothies, or capsules, to ensure they meet their daily nutritional needs. The use of seaweed-based supplements would be particularly beneficial for individuals with iodine deficiency or those living in areas with limited access to iodized salt.",
    "**Fermented Food Renaissance**: Fermented foods become a primary source of essential vitamins and minerals. Fermentation increases the bioavailability of nutrients in foods, making them more easily absorbed by the body. People would consume fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir, and kombucha, which are rich in vitamins and minerals like vitamin K, vitamin C, and probiotics. Fermented foods would be a key component of a balanced diet, providing a range of health benefits and essential nutrients.",
    "**Lab-Grown Foods**: Lab-grown foods become a primary source of essential vitamins and minerals. Companies would develop lab-grown meat,"
