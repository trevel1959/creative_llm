    "**Aurora**: A spaceship that can travel through the cosmos while generating a breathtaking light show. The ship's hull is covered in a thin layer of luminescent material that reacts to the surrounding environment, creating an ever-changing display of colors and patterns. As the ship approaches a planet, it can alter its luminescence to blend in with the planet's atmosphere, allowing it to remain stealthy. The ship's AI can also manipulate the light show to communicate with other spaceships or even with alien lifeforms. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Nexus**: A modular spaceship that can reconfigure its shape and structure to adapt to different missions. The ship's hull is composed of interchangeable modules, each with its own unique function, such as propulsion, life support, or cargo storage. The modules can be easily swapped out or added to the ship as needed, allowing the Nexus to evolve and improve over time. The ship's AI can also optimize the module configuration for specific missions, ensuring the most efficient use of resources. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Aerius**: A spaceship that can transform into a winged glider, allowing it to soar through the upper atmosphere of a planet and explore its upper reaches. The ship's wings are made of a lightweight, yet incredibly strong material that can withstand the stresses of flight. The ship's AI can also control the wing's angle and curvature to optimize lift and maneuverability. As the ship descends back to the surface, it can convert back into its traditional spaceship form. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Luminari**: A spaceship that can harness the energy of nearby stars to power its propulsion systems. The ship is equipped with a network of solar sails that can capture and focus the energy of nearby stars, allowing it to travel vast distances without the need for traditional propulsion systems. The ship's AI can also optimize the sail's angle and position to maximize energy capture and minimize the risk of overheating. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Chrysalis**: A spaceship that can transform into a self-sustaining ecosystem, allowing it to support a diverse array of plant and animal life. The ship's hull is lined with a network of hydroponic gardens and air recycling systems, creating a miniature ecosystem that can thrive in even the most hostile environments. The ship's AI can also monitor and adjust the ecosystem's conditions to ensure the health and well-being of"
