    "Weather Conditions: The weather on Mount Everest can change rapidly, making it difficult for climbers to predict what conditions they will face. Climbers must be prepared for extreme cold, snow, and wind, which can increase the risk of frostbite, hypothermia, and other cold-related injuries.",
    "Avalanches: Climbing Mount Everest puts the climber at risk of avalanches, which can be triggered by natural events or human activities. Avalanches can be deadly and can cause significant damage to the environment.",
    "Limited Oxygen Supply: Climbers on Mount Everest require supplemental oxygen to breathe, as the air is too thin at high altitudes. Climbers must carry enough oxygen to last the duration of their climb, which can be challenging given the high demand for oxygen and the limited space on their equipment.",
    "Physical Fitness: Climbing Mount Everest requires a high level of physical fitness and endurance. Climbers must be able to carry heavy loads, navigate difficult terrain, and cope with the physical stress of the climb.",
    "Equipment Failure: Climbers on Mount Everest must carry all of their equipment, including tents, sleeping bags, and clothing, up the mountain. Equipment failure can be dangerous, as climbers may not have access to replacement parts or assistance in case of an emergency."
