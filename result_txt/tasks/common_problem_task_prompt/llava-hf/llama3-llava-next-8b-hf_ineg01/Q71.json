    "Creative Differences: Another common problem in producing a Broadway musical is the possibility of creative differences between the writers, directors, and performers. The collaboration process can be challenging, and disagreements may arise about the vision for the show, the script, or the performances. Resolving these differences is crucial to maintaining a cohesive and successful production.",
    "Cast and Crew Availability: The availability of talented actors, musicians, and production staff can be a significant issue. Scheduling conflicts, last-minute absences, or other commitments can make it difficult to assemble a consistent cast and crew for the entire run of the show.",
    "Technical Challenges: Broadway musicals often require complex sets, lighting, and sound systems. Any technical issues or malfunctions during a performance can be disastrous, causing delays, disruptions, or even safety hazards. The production team must be prepared to troubleshoot and resolve any technical problems quickly and efficiently.",
    "Audience Attendance: A hit Broadway musical relies on strong audience attendance. If a show is not selling well, it may struggle to break even, let alone turn a profit. The marketing and promotion of the show are critical to ensuring a strong audience base and generating revenue.",
    "Critical Reception: The success of a Broadway musical is often measured by its critical reception. A negative review from a major publication can have a significant impact on the show's box office sales and overall success. The production team must be prepared to handle both positive and negative reviews and adjust their strategy accordingly."
