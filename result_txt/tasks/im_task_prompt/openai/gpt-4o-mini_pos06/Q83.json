    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handles**: Redesign shopping carts to include adjustable handles that can accommodate users of different heights. The handles could be telescopic or have a simple locking mechanism to ensure comfort during use. Additionally, the cart could feature a lightweight design with a balanced weight distribution, making it easier to maneuver, especially for elderly or disabled shoppers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Built-in Recycling Compartments**: Construct shopping carts using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, integrate separate compartments within the cart for recycling items like plastic bottles or aluminum cans. This would encourage eco-conscious shopping habits and make it easier for consumers to dispose of recyclables properly.",
    "**Mobile App Integration with Location Tracking**: Develop a mobile app that pairs with the shopping cart, allowing users to locate their cart in large stores through GPS tracking. The app could also provide a virtual shopping list that syncs with the cart, guiding users through the store to find items efficiently while also notifying them of discounts or promotions on items in their list.",
    "**Child-Friendly Features**: Design shopping carts with built-in entertainment systems for children, such as a small touchscreen with games or educational content. This would keep children occupied during shopping trips, reducing stress for parents and enhancing the overall shopping experience. Additionally, the cart could have secure harnesses and adjustable seating to ensure safety.",
    "**Self-Balancing Technology**: Incorporate self-balancing technology similar to that used in electric scooters. This feature would allow the cart to remain upright even on uneven surfaces, preventing spills or tipping. It could also assist users in navigating tight spaces by providing gentle steering assistance, making it easier to maneuver in crowded aisles."
