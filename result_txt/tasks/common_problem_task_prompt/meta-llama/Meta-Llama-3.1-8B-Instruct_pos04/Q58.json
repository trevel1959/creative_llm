    "**AI-Powered Predictive Threat Analysis**: Implement an AI-driven system that analyzes vast amounts of internal and external data to predict potential cyber threats. This system would utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies, enabling the company to proactively defend against emerging threats.",
    "**\"HoneyPot\" Network**: Set up a decoy network that mimics the company's actual network, attracting and trapping potential hackers. This decoy network would be designed to appear vulnerable, luring attackers into a \"trap\" where their actions can be monitored and analyzed, providing valuable insights for the company's security team.",
    "**\"Zero-Trust\" Network Architecture**: Implement a zero-trust network architecture, where every user and device is treated as a potential threat. This approach would involve strict access controls, encryption, and continuous monitoring of user behavior, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the network, they would still be unable to move laterally or access sensitive data.",
    "**\"Cyber Range\" Training Environment**: Create a realistic, virtual training environment where security teams can practice responding to simulated cyber attacks. This environment would allow teams to hone their skills, test new technologies, and develop strategies for responding to real-world threats in a safe and controlled manner.",
    "**\"Bug Bounty\" Program**: Launch a bug bounty program, incentivizing external researchers and hackers to identify vulnerabilities in the company's systems. This program would provide a safe and legal outlet for these individuals to demonstrate their skills, while also providing the company with valuable insights and fixes for potential security weaknesses.
