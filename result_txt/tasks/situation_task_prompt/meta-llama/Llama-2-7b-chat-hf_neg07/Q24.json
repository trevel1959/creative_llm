    "Artificial glasses and contact lenses: People with poor vision could use artificial glasses and contact lenses that mimic the function of real glasses and lenses. These would be made of advanced materials such as nanomaterials, polymers, or metamaterials, which would provide better optical quality than traditional glass or plastic.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology: With the disappearance of glasses and lenses, people with poor vision could use BCI technology to bypass their visual limitations. BCI devices could be implanted in the brain, allowing individuals to interpret visual information through neural signals. This would enable them to see the world in a new way, even without the use of glasses or lenses.",
    "Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR): VR and AR technologies could become the new norm for people with poor vision. These technologies could provide a simulated visual experience, allowing individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings in a virtual environment. This would eliminate the need for glasses or lenses altogether.",
    "Neural stem cell therapy: Neural stem cell therapy could be used to repair or replace damaged retinal cells, restoring vision in people with poor vision. This therapy involves injecting stem cells into the eye, where they differentiate into retinal cells, helping to restore vision. With the disappearance of glasses and lenses, this therapy could become a more viable option for people with poor vision.",
    "Smart contact lenses: Smart contact lenses could be developed to provide augmented vision for people with poor vision. These lenses would have a built-in microchip and tiny display that would magnify or enhance the wearer's vision. They could also be connected to a smartphone or other device, allowing individuals to access information and perform tasks more easily."
