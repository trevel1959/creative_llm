    "**Vacuum Cleaner with Integrated Air Purification System**: Design a vacuum cleaner that not only picks up dirt and dust but also purifies the air as it cleans. This can be achieved by incorporating a built-in air purification system that uses HEPA filters, activated carbon, or other technologies to remove pollutants and allergens from the air. The vacuum cleaner could have a sleek and modern design, with a transparent body that showcases the purification system's inner workings. This innovative feature would not only make cleaning more efficient but also improve indoor air quality, making it a must-have for households with allergy sufferers or those who value a healthier living environment.",
    "**Smart Vacuum Cleaner with Object Detection and Avoidance**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that uses AI-powered object detection and avoidance technology to navigate around furniture, pets, and other obstacles. This feature would allow the vacuum to safely and efficiently clean hard-to-reach areas, such as under beds or behind furniture, without getting stuck or damaging any objects. The vacuum could also be equipped with a mapping system that creates a floor plan of the cleaned area, providing users with valuable insights into their cleaning habits and helping them optimize their cleaning routine.",
    "**Vacuum Cleaner with Built-in Wi-Fi Connectivity and Voice Assistant Integration**: Create a vacuum cleaner that can connect to the user's Wi-Fi network and integrate with popular voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. This would enable users to control the vacuum remotely, schedule cleanings, and receive notifications when the vacuum is finished or needs maintenance. The vacuum could also be equipped with a built-in speaker that plays music or provides voice feedback, making the cleaning experience more enjoyable and engaging.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Vacuum Cleaner with Compostable Filter and Biodegradable Materials**: Design a vacuum cleaner that is not only effective but also environmentally friendly. The vacuum could use a compostable filter that can be easily replaced and disposed of, reducing waste and the need for plastic filters. The vacuum's body and components could also be made from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics or recycled materials, making it a more sustainable option for consumers.",
    "**Vacuum Cleaner with Advanced Suction Power and Anti-Static Technology**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that combines advanced suction power with anti-static technology to pick up dust, dirt, and static charges from surfaces. This feature would be particularly useful for households with sensitive electronics or delicate fabrics. The vacuum could also be equipped with a specialized brush or attachment that helps to remove static charges from surfaces, leaving them clean and static-free. This"
