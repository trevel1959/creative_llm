    "**Braille-to-Speech Wearable Technology**: Create a wearable device that can be worn around the neck or wrist, which can translate Braille into spoken language in real-time. The device will have a small sensor that reads the Braille on surfaces or in books, and a built-in speaker to deliver the audio translation. This would help the visually impaired interact with their environment more easily, such as reading signs or navigating public spaces.",
    "**Interactive Audio Maps**: Develop an app that uses GPS and auditory cues to create interactive audio maps for the visually impaired. Users could \"listen\" to a map of their surroundings, with different sounds representing different types of landmarks (e.g., parks, schools, shops). They could also receive spoken directions to specific locations within these environments, making navigation easier and more intuitive.",
    "**AI-Enhanced Virtual Reality Experiences**: Create a virtual reality platform that uses AI to generate personalized experiences based on the user's preferences and needs. For instance, a user who enjoys nature might be presented with a VR experience that combines soothing sounds of nature with guided meditation exercises. This would provide a relaxing and engaging way for visually impaired individuals to connect with the world around them.",
    "**Tactile Feedback for Text Input**: Design a keyboard or tablet interface that incorporates haptic feedback to help users type without visual cues. Each key press could provide a distinct vibration pattern that corresponds to a specific character or function. This would enable the visually impaired to type efficiently and accurately, even in low-light conditions.",
    "**Adaptive Smart Home System**: Build a smart home system that learns the routines and preferences of its users through machine learning algorithms. This system would automatically adjust lights, temperature, and other devices based on the user's needs, reducing the need for visual input. For example, it could gently wake a person up by gradually increasing the room's light and adjusting the temperature to their comfort level. This system would enhance independence and quality of life for those who are visually impaired."
