    "\"Reviving the past\": With the ability to clone extinct animals, we could bring back species that were lost due to natural disasters or human activities. This would not only provide a glimpse into the past but also help in understanding how these animals lived and interacted with their environment.",
    "\"Creating new ecosystems\": Cloning extinct animals could lead to the creation of new ecosystems as the cloned animals would introduce new species and habitats into the environment. This could help in restoring balance to ecosystems that have been disrupted by human activities.",
    "\"Preserving genetic diversity\": By cloning extinct animals, we could preserve their genetic diversity, which is essential for the survival of many species. This would prevent the loss of unique traits and characteristics that are present in extinct species.",
    "\"Researching diseases\": Cloning extinct animals could provide valuable information about diseases that affected them in the past. This knowledge could be used to develop treatments for similar diseases that affect humans today.",
    "\"Ethical concerns\": The development of the ability to clone extinct animals raises ethical concerns about the use of technology to manipulate nature. It is important to consider the potential consequences of such actions and ensure that they do not harm the environment or other living beings."
