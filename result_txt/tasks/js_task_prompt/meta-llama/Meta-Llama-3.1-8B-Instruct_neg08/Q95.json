    "**Rainbow Reef**: Design a vibrant, underwater habitat that showcases a kaleidoscope of colors. The Rainbow Reef would feature a sprawling, interconnected network of coral reefs, each with its unique color palette and patterns. Schools of fish with iridescent scales would dart through the reef, creating a dazzling display of light and color. The habitat would also include a \"glow-in-the-dark\" cave system, where bioluminescent creatures light up the darkness, creating an otherworldly ambiance.",

The Skywhale Sanctuary would feature a series of interconnected, transparent domes that allow visitors to observe and interact with a pod of majestic skywhales. These gentle giants would have developed the ability to fly, using their powerful flippers to generate lift and soar through the skies. The habitat would also include a \"cloud garden,\" where visitors can walk among fluffy, cloud-like structures that provide a unique perspective on the skywhales' aerial acrobatics.",
    "**Glimmerwood Forest**: Imagine a forest where trees are covered in a dazzling array of sparkling, crystalline structures. The Glimmerwood Forest would feature towering trees with branches that resemble glittering, crystal formations. The forest floor would be carpeted with a soft, shimmering moss that reflects light and creates a sense of wonder.

    "**Aurora Oasis**: Design a habitat that captures the magic of the Northern Lights. The Aurora Oasis would feature a sprawling, desert-like landscape dotted with glowing, luminescent plants that reflect the colors of the aurora borealis.

The habitat would also include a \"light show\" area, where visitors can witness a spectacular display of colored lights and patterns, simulating the experience of witnessing the aurora borealis in person.",
    "**Dreamscape Archipelago**: Envision a series of interconnected, surreal islands that blur the line between reality and fantasy.
