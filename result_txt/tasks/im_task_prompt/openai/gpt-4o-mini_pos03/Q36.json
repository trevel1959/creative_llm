    "**Multi-Functional Blade with Modular Attachments**: Design a knife with a detachable blade system that allows users to switch between different types of blades (e.g., serrated, straight, or specialized shapes for specific tasks like filleting or peeling). The handle could feature a secure locking mechanism for easy attachment and detachment, making it a versatile tool for various culinary tasks.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Create a knife with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted to fit the user's hand size and grip style. The handle could feature a memory foam material that molds to the user's grip over time, providing comfort during prolonged use. Additionally, it could have interchangeable grips for left-handed and right-handed users.",
    "**Integrated Cutting Board with Knife Storage**: Design a knife that comes with a built-in cutting board that has designated slots for the knife when not in use. This would not only keep the knife safe and sharp but also provide a stable surface for cutting. The cutting board could be made of antimicrobial materials to ensure hygiene and feature measurement markings for precise cutting.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**: Develop a knife with a self-sharpening mechanism that uses a micro-abrasive surface integrated into the sheath or the handle. When the knife is inserted or removed from its sheath, the blade is automatically sharpened, ensuring that it maintains its edge without the need for manual sharpening tools.",
    "**Color-Changing Blade for Safety**: Introduce a knife with a color-changing blade that indicates when the knife is too hot or has been exposed to certain food allergens. The blade could change color based on temperature or contact with specific substances, providing a visual cue to prevent burns or cross-contamination in the kitchen."
