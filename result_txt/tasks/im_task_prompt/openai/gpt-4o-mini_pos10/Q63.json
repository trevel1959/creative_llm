    "**Adjustable Frame for Custom Fit**: Design roller skates with an adjustable frame that allows users to modify the width and length of the skates for a perfect fit. This could be achieved through a simple mechanism, such as a dial or lever, that expands or contracts the skate’s base. This feature would cater to various foot shapes and sizes, enhancing comfort and performance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create roller skates using sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastics or natural fibers. This eco-conscious design could attract environmentally aware consumers and reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional skate manufacturing. The packaging could also be minimal and made from recycled materials, further promoting sustainability.",
    "**Built-in LED Lights and Sound System**: Incorporate LED lights along the sides and wheels of the roller skates that can change colors and patterns based on the skater’s movements or music rhythm. Additionally, integrate a small Bluetooth speaker that syncs with a smartphone, allowing skaters to listen to their favorite tunes while skating, creating a fun and engaging atmosphere.",
    "**Interchangeable Wheel System**: Design a roller skate with an interchangeable wheel system that allows users to easily swap out wheels for different surfaces (indoor vs. outdoor) or performance levels (speed vs. stability). This could include a quick-release mechanism that enables users to change wheels without tools, promoting versatility and adaptability to various skating environments.",
    "**Enhanced Ankle Support with Smart Fabric**: Develop a roller skate with an ankle support system made from a smart fabric that adapts to the skater’s movements. This material could provide firm support when needed (like during sharp turns) and allow for flexibility when the skater is in a more relaxed position. The design could include adjustable straps that offer customizable support levels."
