    "Integrate a toaster oven: Combine toaster oven functionality with the sandwich toaster. This will allow users to cook bread, pastries, and even whole meals like pizzas or casseroles, using the same appliance. This would increase the versatility of the sandwich toaster and make it a more popular kitchen gadget.",
    "Add a timer and temperature control: Incorporate a timer and temperature control feature to precisely cook different types of toast, from crispy to lightly toasted. This would enhance precision and allow personalized preferences for each user. Additionally, a digital display can also be added to show the progress and estimated cooking time.",
    "Develop a healthier cooking option: Offer an option with a grill for baking and grilling sandwiches. This will reduce the number of fats and reduce the cooking time. Users can add different toppings, vegetables, turkey, chicken, and other ingredients, and cook them on both sides, resulting in a healthier and tastier meal.",
    "Implement a customizable menu: Allow users to select their preferred toppings, styles, bread type and levels of cooking, to create their ideal sandwich. This can be achieved through a mobile app that syncs with the toaster using Bluetooth connectivity. Users can save their favorite recipes, change preferences and adjust the cooking settings.",
    "Upgrade with AI technology: Introduce an AI-powered feature where the sandwich toaster learns your preferences over time. It can suggest or even auto-select sandwiches based on your buying patterns and recipe history, simplifying the cooking process and saving time."
