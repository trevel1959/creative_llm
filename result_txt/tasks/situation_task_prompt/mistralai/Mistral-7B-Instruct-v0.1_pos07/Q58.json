    "Use natural predators: If all animals disappeared, insects would still exist, but without their natural predators. In this case, we could introduce new species of insects that feed on other insects. For example, we could release ladybugs, which feed on aphids, a common pest in gardens. This would help to control the population of insects.",
    "Use traps: We could set up traps around the house or garden to catch insects. There are many types of traps available, such as sticky traps, funnel traps, and pit traps. We could also use insecticides in these traps to kill the insects.",
    "Use insect repellents: We could use insect repellents to keep insects away from us. There are many types of insect repellents available, such as sprays, lotions, and candles. We could also use natural repellents like citronella or lavender.",
    "Use heat: We could use heat to kill insects. For example, we could use a heat lamp to the area where the insects are located. This would the insects and kill them.",
    "Use light: We could use light to attract insects and then trap them. For example, we could use a black light to attract moths and other insects. We could then set up a trap nearby to catch the insects. This would be an effective way to control the population of insects in the area."
