    "**Island Exploration and Resource Identification**: Upon waking up, I would assess my surroundings to identify potential resources such as food, water, shelter, and tools. I would explore the island to find a source of fresh water, possibly a stream or a spring, and identify edible plants and fruits. I would also look for materials to create a shelter, such as palm trees, branches, and leaves. This initial exploration would help me understand the island's ecosystem and identify potential dangers.

    "**Signal Fire and Communication**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire using dry leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials. I would also create a smoke signal during the day to attract the attention of any passing aircraft or boats.

This would help me convey my location and situation to potential rescuers. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Tool Creation and Fishing**: To sustain myself, I would create tools such as a fishing spear or a hook using materials found on the island.
