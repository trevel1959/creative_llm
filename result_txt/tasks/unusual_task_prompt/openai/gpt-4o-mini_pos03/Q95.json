    "**Dusting Cloth**: Instead of using traditional dusting cloths, use coffee filters to clean surfaces. They are lint-free, which means they won’t leave behind any residue on furniture or screens. Their soft texture makes them ideal for dusting delicate items like electronics or glass.",
    "**Snack Holder**: Coffee filters can serve as eco-friendly snack holders for parties or picnics. Simply fold them into a cone shape to hold popcorn, chips, or other finger foods. This not only keeps snacks contained but also adds a rustic touch to your gathering.",
    "**Fragrance Sachets**: Fill coffee filters with dried herbs, lavender, or potpourri, and tie them up with string to create homemade fragrance sachets. Place them in drawers, closets, or your car to impart a fresh scent, while the filter allows the fragrance to diffuse gently.",
    "**Pet Training Pads**: For pet owners, coffee filters can be used as a makeshift training pad for small accidents. Their absorbent nature can help contain spills and odors, providing a temporary solution while training a puppy or kitten.",
    "**Candle Wick Holder**: If you’re making homemade candles, coffee filters can be used to hold the wick in place while the wax sets. Simply poke a small hole in the center of the filter, insert the wick, and pour the melted wax around it. This keeps the wick centered for an even burn."
