    "The world could transition to alternative energy sources: If the world were to run out of oil, it would be a pressing issue that would require immediate attention. One possible solution would be to transition to alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power. This would involve investing in renewable energy infrastructure and technology, which could create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.",
    "Increased use of electric vehicles: As oil becomes scarce, the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) would increase, leading to more investment in EV technology and infrastructure. This could result in the development of more efficient and affordable EVs, which could help reduce carbon emissions and decrease reliance on oil.",
    "Biofuels and other alternative energy sources: Another option would be to explore alternative energy sources such as biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, and other non-petroleum-based energy sources. This could involve investing in research and development to find new and innovative ways to generate energy.",
    "Changes in transportation: With the scarcity of oil, there could be a shift towards more sustainable transportation options such as biking, walking, and public transportation. This could lead to a healthier and more environmentally-friendly transportation system, which could also reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.",
    "Increased focus on energy efficiency: As oil becomes more scarce, there could be a greater focus on energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption. This could involve implementing energy-efficient technologies in buildings, homes, and industries, as well as promoting sustainable practices such as turning off lights and appliances when not in use."
