    "**Hydration Tracking App**: Develop a water bottle that syncs with a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app could track the amount of water consumed throughout the day and send reminders to drink more water. Users could set personalized hydration goals, and the app could offer tips and recipes for flavored water to keep hydration interesting.",
    "**Built-in Filtration System**: Create a water bottle that includes a high-quality filtration system, allowing users to fill it from any freshwater source, such as rivers or lakes. The filter would remove contaminants and impurities, making it safe to drink. This would be especially beneficial for hikers, campers, and travelers in areas where clean drinking water is scarce.",
    "**Modular Design**: Introduce a modular water bottle that can be customized according to user needs. The base could hold the main water compartment, while additional attachments could include a protein shaker, a fruit infuser, or a compartment for supplements. This would allow users to carry everything they need for hydration and nutrition in one compact unit.",
    "**Temperature Control**: Design a water bottle with advanced insulation technology that not only keeps drinks cold or hot for extended periods but also features a temperature display on the side. Users could check the temperature of their beverage at a glance and adjust their drinking habits accordingly, ensuring optimal enjoyment of hot teas or cold waters.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate a water bottle made from biodegradable materials or recycled plastics that break down over time without harming the environment. The bottle could also feature a program where users can send back their old bottles for recycling, earning points toward discounts on future purchases. This would promote sustainability and encourage responsible consumption."
