    "Solar-Powered Umbrellas: In a world without trees, people could use solar-powered umbrellas to provide shade. These umbrellas could be equipped with solar panels on their canopies, which would absorb sunlight during the day and convert it into electricity. The electricity could then be stored in batteries, providing power for the umbrella's motor and lighting. This would allow people to enjoy shade and protection from the sun even on the hottest days.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Drones: Another solution to provide shade on hot days would be to use cloud-seeding drones. These drones could be equipped with special materials that would seed clouds with water droplets, causing them to grow and produce shade. The drones could be launched from tall buildings or aircraft, and could be programmed to fly over areas with high temperatures, providing natural shade.",
    "Urban Greenhouses: In the absence of trees, urban greenhouses could become the next best thing. These greenhouses could be built in cities and would provide a controlled environment for plants to grow, including those that produce shade. The greenhouses could be designed to maximize natural light and temperature, creating a comfortable and shaded environment for people to relax in.",
    "Solar-Powered Tents: For those who prefer to be outdoors, solar-powered tents could provide a solution for shade. These tents could be equipped with solar panels on their canopies, which would generate electricity as they are moved or exposed to sunlight. The electricity could power lights, fans, and other devices, creating a comfortable and shaded space for outdoor activities.",
    "Smart Window Coatings: Finally, smart window coatings could be developed to provide shade on hot days. These coatings could be applied to windows and would change their tint depending on the temperature outside. When the temperature rises, the coating would darken, providing more shade and reducing the amount of heat that enters the building. This would not only provide shade but also help reduce energy consumption and cooling costs."
