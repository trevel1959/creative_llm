    "Fairness: Critics argue that a universal basic income is unfair, as it would disproportionately benefit some individuals who may not need the financial support, while others who are struggling financially would not receive a sufficient amount to meet their basic needs.",
    "Incentive: A universal basic income could potentially reduce the incentive for individuals to work or pursue higher-paying jobs, as they would already receive a guaranteed income. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth.",
    "Administering: The implementation of a universal basic income would require a robust administrative system to distribute funds to recipients. This could be a challenge in terms of infrastructure, logistics, and cost.",
    "Effectiveness: Some argue that a universal basic income would not effectively address the root causes of poverty and inequality, as it would not differentiate between those who are genuinely in need of assistance and those who could be better served through other means.",
    "International coordination: A universal basic income would need to be coordinated with other countries to avoid potential issues with trade, migration, and international relations."
