    "**Innovative Design Hotel**: Create a hotel that integrates futuristic or unconventional design elements into its architecture and interior. This could include incorporating sustainable materials, using advanced technology for guest experiences (like AI assistants in rooms), or designing rooms that transform into different functions based on guest needs (e.g., from bedroom to office space). The goal is to offer guests a one-of-a-kind, immersive experience that feels both cutting-edge and luxurious.",
    "**Themed Immersive Hotel**: Develop a hotel around a specific theme that fully immerses guests in that world. This could be anything from a medieval castle, a futuristic city, a tropical island, or even a fantasy realm like Hogwarts from Harry Potter. Each room would be designed to reflect this theme, with decorations, furniture, and even staff uniforms matching the theme. Activities within the hotel would also align with the theme, enhancing the overall experience.",
    "**Sensory-Enhancing Hotel**: Focus on creating a hotel that enhances guests' senses. For example, rooms could be designed to provide calming or energizing aromatherapy through scent diffusers, soothing soundscapes through high-quality audio systems, or visually stunning light shows. The hotel could also offer sensory activities like guided meditation, yoga, or even virtual reality experiences that stimulate various senses.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Adventure Hotel**: Design a hotel that not only operates sustainably but also provides guests with opportunities to engage in eco-friendly activities. This could involve building the hotel in an environmentally sensitive area, using renewable energy sources, and offering activities like tree planting, wildlife conservation tours, or educational workshops about sustainability. Guests can learn about and contribute to environmental conservation while enjoying their stay.",
    "**Multisensory Wellness Retreat**: Create a hotel that focuses on holistic wellness, catering to guests seeking physical, mental, and emotional rejuvenation. Incorporate elements such as aromatherapy, sound baths, art therapy, and mindful movement classes. The hotel could also feature a range of treatments like massages, acupuncture, and yoga sessions, along with gourmet, health-conscious dining options. The atmosphere should promote relaxation and healing, making it perfect for those looking to disconnect from daily life and recharge."
