    "Sun-harvesting drones: Develop a fleet of autonomous drones that can fly above the clouds and collect sunlight using solar panels or mirrors. These drones could be deployed in areas where sunlight is scarce, providing a reliable source of energy.",
    "Cloud-piercing towers: Create towering structures that can pierce through the clouds, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. These towers could be equipped with solar panels or mirrors to maximize energy collection.",
    "Artificial sunlight generators: Develop a device that can create artificial sunlight using advanced LED technology. This device could be used to supplement natural sunlight during cloudy periods, providing a reliable source of light for homes, businesses, and communities.",
    "Cloud-busting balloons: Inflate large balloons with a special gas that can break through clouds, creating a temporary opening for sunlight to shine through. These balloons could be deployed in areas where sunlight is limited, providing a quick and easy solution for capturing sunlight.",
    "Sunlight-collecting clothing: Develop clothing that can absorb and store sunlight, allowing people to wear it during cloudy periods and release the stored energy when needed. This clothing could be made using advanced materials and technologies, such as nanotechnology or flexible solar panels."
