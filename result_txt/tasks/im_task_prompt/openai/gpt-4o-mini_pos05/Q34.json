    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Mirror**: Design a mirror with built-in LED lights that can change color based on the user's mood or time of day. Using sensors to detect ambient light and the user's emotional state (potentially through voice analysis), the mirror can adjust its lighting to create a calming atmosphere in the morning or energizing vibes in the evening.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Mirror**: Develop a mirror that uses AR technology to overlay virtual images onto the user's reflection. This could allow users to try on different hairstyles, makeup looks, or even clothing patterns in real-time without physically changing. The mirror could connect to a mobile app that offers suggestions based on the user's preferences and past choices.",
    "**Fitness Coach Mirror**: Create a mirror that doubles as a personal fitness coach. Equipped with a camera and AI technology, it can analyze the user's movements during workouts, provide real-time feedback on form, and suggest modifications to enhance performance. The mirror could also display workout routines and track progress over time, making it a versatile home gym accessory.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Self-Cleaning Mirror**: Innovate a mirror with a self-cleaning surface made from hydrophobic and oleophobic materials that repel water, dust, and smudges. This would reduce the need for chemical cleaners and make maintenance easier. The mirror could also feature a built-in UV light that sanitizes the surface, ensuring it remains hygienic.",
    "**Soundwave Reflector Mirror**: Design a mirror that incorporates sound technology, where the frame acts as a speaker system. This mirror could play music or podcasts while the user is getting ready, enhancing the morning routine experience. It could also have a noise-cancellation feature, allowing for a serene environment even in busy households."
