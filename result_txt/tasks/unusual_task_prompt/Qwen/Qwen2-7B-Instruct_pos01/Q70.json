    "**Smart Mirror Coating Rack**: This idea involves creating a coat rack that doubles as a smart mirror. The rack is designed with a built-in LCD screen which can display various information such as weather updates, reminders, or even social media notifications. The mirror itself can be touch-sensitive, allowing users to control the displayed content directly through their fingers. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Garden-Inspired Coating Rack**: This creative idea is focused on integrating natural elements into the design of a coat rack. The rack could feature branches, leaves, or other organic shapes made from metal or wood, mimicking the look of a tree or a bush. The base could be made from recycled materials like reclaimed wood or old bicycle parts, adding an eco-friendly touch. This idea has a high confidence score of 0.9 because it combines functionality with aesthetics in a unique way.",
    "**Light-Up Coating Rack**: A coat rack that incorporates LED lights could be both decorative and practical. The lights could be strategically placed along the arms or at the base, providing ambient lighting in a hallway or entryway. Different colors or patterns of light could be programmed to create different moods or atmospheres, enhancing the user experience. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7 because while innovative, it requires more technical expertise for implementation.",
    "**DIY Modular Coating Rack**: This idea promotes flexibility and personalization by allowing users to assemble the coat rack using modular components. Each component could have standardized mounting points, enabling people to add or remove hooks, shelves, or decorative pieces as they see fit. This concept would appeal to those who enjoy customizing their spaces and could be marketed as a do-it-yourself project kit. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6, considering its reliance on user assembly and potential complexity.",
    "**Thermal Sensing Coating Rack**: This innovative idea involves integrating temperature sensors into the coat rack to detect the presence of coats. When a coat is hung, the sensor triggers a small heater to warm up the area around the coat, preventing it from getting cold. This feature could be particularly appealing during colder months. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8, as it addresses a practical concern with a novel solution. "
