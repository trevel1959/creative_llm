    "**Eco-Friendly Grass Mulching System**: Develop a lawn mower with a built-in mulching system that efficiently shreds grass clippings and redistributes them back onto the lawn. This feature would enrich the soil with nutrients and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers. Additionally, the mower could have a compartment for collecting larger debris like leaves and twigs, which can be composted.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular lawn mower where users can easily swap out components based on their needs. For example, attachments could include a weed whacker, leaf blower, or even a small tiller. This versatility would allow users to save space and money by using one machine for multiple gardening tasks.",
    "**Noise-Cancellation Technology**: Implement noise-cancellation technology in lawn mowers to significantly reduce the sound produced while mowing. This could be achieved through advanced muffling materials and design, making mowing less disruptive to neighbors and more pleasant for the user, especially in residential areas.",
    "**Solar-Powered Mower**: Design a lawn mower that operates primarily on solar power. Equipped with solar panels on its body, this mower would recharge during the day and provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional gas or electric mowers. It could also feature a battery backup for cloudy days or longer mowing sessions.",
    "**User-Friendly App Integration**: Develop a companion app that connects to the lawn mower via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The app could allow users to schedule mowing times, track battery life, and receive maintenance reminders. Additionally, it could provide tips on lawn care based on local weather patterns and grass types, enhancing the overall lawn maintenance experience."
