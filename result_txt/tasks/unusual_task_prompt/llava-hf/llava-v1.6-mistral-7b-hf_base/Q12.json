    "Balloon-Powered Cars: Balloons can be used to create lightweight and fuel-efficient cars by filling them with helium and attaching them to a frame. The helium can lift the car, allowing it to move across flat surfaces.",
    "Balloon-Powered Lamps: Balloons can be filled with a gas like hydrogen and used to create a balloon-powered lamp. The gas can be ignited, and the heat generated can be used to light a wick.",
    "Balloon-Powered Airplanes: Balloons can be filled with hot air and used to create balloon-powered airplanes. The hot air can be generated by burning a fuel like alcohol or methane, which can lift the balloon and create lift for the airplane.",
    "Balloon-Powered Generators: Balloons can be used to generate electricity by using the movement of air to turn a turbine, which can then be connected to a generator.",
    "Balloon-Powered Music Instruments: Balloons can be filled with air and used to create unique musical instruments, such as balloon-powered drums or balloon-powered wind instruments."
