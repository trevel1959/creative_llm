    "**Floating Solar Farms on Lakes and Reservoirs**: Develop a floating solar farm system that can be installed on lakes and reservoirs, generating electricity while also providing a unique recreational space for tourists. The floating panels would be designed to be buoyant and anchored to the water's surface, allowing for easy installation and maintenance. This innovative approach would increase energy production while minimizing land use and preserving natural habitats.",
    "**Geothermal Power Plant with Integrated Carbon Capture**: Design a geothermal power plant that incorporates a carbon capture system, utilizing the heat from the earth to generate electricity while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plant would harness the natural heat from underground reservoirs to produce steam, which would drive turbines and generate electricity. The carbon capture system would then extract CO2 from the flue gas, reducing emissions and creating a valuable byproduct for industrial applications.",
    "**Tidal Power Plant with Advanced Turbines**: Develop a tidal power plant that utilizes advanced turbine designs to harness the energy of ocean tides. The plant would consist of a series of underwater turbines that would capture the kinetic energy of the tides, generating electricity as the water flows through the turbines. The advanced turbine design would optimize energy production while minimizing environmental impacts, such as noise pollution and marine life disruption.",
    "**Biomass Power Plant with Integrated Waste-to-Energy**: Design a biomass power plant that converts waste materials into energy, reducing waste disposal costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The plant would utilize advanced gasification technology to convert organic waste into a synthetic gas, which would then be used to generate electricity. The waste-to-energy approach would provide a sustainable solution for waste management while producing clean energy.",
    "**Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Plant with Thermal Energy Storage**: Develop a CSP plant that utilizes molten salt as a thermal energy storage medium, allowing for efficient energy production and dispatch. The plant would concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, heating a molten salt mixture to produce steam, which would drive a turbine to generate electricity. The thermal energy storage system would enable the plant to store excess energy during the day for use during periods of low sunlight, providing a reliable and dispatchable energy source. </s>[/INST] "
