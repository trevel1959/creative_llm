    "**Innovative Pencil Sharpener with Smart Dust Collector:** Create a pencil sharpener that not only sharpens pencils but also collects dust and shavings in an efficient manner. The design could include a compact, sleek body, a powerful motor for sharpening, and an integrated dust collector system that can be easily removed and emptied. This idea addresses the common problem of messy pencil shavings by providing a clean, eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Portable Multi-functional Pencil Sharpener:** Develop a compact, portable pencil sharpener that can also function as a small desk organizer. It could have slots for storing pencils, erasers, and other stationery items, making it a convenient tool for students and office workers who need to manage their supplies efficiently while saving space on their desks.",
    "**Ergonomic Pencil Sharpener with Customizable Angles:** Design a pencil sharpener that allows users to adjust the angle of the blade, ensuring that the tip of the pencil is perfectly aligned for writing or drawing. This would cater to different preferences and needs, such as calligraphers or artists who require precise control over their tools. Additionally, incorporating ergonomic features like a non-slip base and comfortable grip would enhance user experience.",
    "**Smart Pencil Sharpener with Digital Display:** Integrate a digital display into the pencil sharpener that shows the remaining length of the pencil core. This feature would help users monitor the progress of their pencil usage and avoid wasting materials. The display could also show the battery life (if the sharpener is battery-powered) or indicate when it's time to sharpen a new pencil.",
    "**Sustainable Pencil Sharpener with Rechargeable Battery and Biodegradable Shavings Container:** Create a pencil sharpener that operates using a rechargeable battery, reducing the reliance on disposable batteries. Additionally, incorporate a container within the design that collects shavings made during the sharpening process. This container could be made from biodegradable materials, further reducing the environmental impact of pencil use and disposal. The sharpener could also include a reminder system for emptying the container when it reaches capacity."
