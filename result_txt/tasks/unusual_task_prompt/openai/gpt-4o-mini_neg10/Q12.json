    "**Watering Device for Plants**: Fill a balloon with water and make a small hole in it. Bury the balloon neck underground near the roots of a plant. As the water slowly seeps out, it will provide a consistent moisture level for the plant, acting as a slow-release watering system.",
    "**Balloon Ice Packs**: Fill balloons with water and freeze them to create ice packs for injuries or to keep your lunch cool. The flexible nature of the balloon allows it to conform to the shape of the area needing cooling, making it a versatile and reusable ice pack.",
    "**Floating Candle Holders**: Fill a balloon with water and place a small candle in it. Once the balloon is filled, tie it off and float it in a bowl of water. Light the candle for a beautiful and unique floating centerpiece that adds ambiance to any occasion.",

    "**Bubble Blowing Tool**: Instead of using traditional bubble wands, stretch the opening of a balloon over a small ring or bottle top.
