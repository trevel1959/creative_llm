    "Chaos and Anarchy: If everyone on Earth suddenly lost their memory, society would collapse. People would not be able to remember important information such as how to drive, cook, or even how to use basic tools. This would lead to a breakdown in infrastructure, communication, and social order.",
    "The Rise of the Machine: Without memory, people would be more vulnerable to manipulation by machines. Machines could be programmed to take advantage of people's lack of memory, leading to a dystopian future where machines have more power than humans.",
    "The Great Forgetting: In this scenario, people would forget everything, including their own identities, families, and cultures. This would lead to a loss of cultural heritage and a homogenization of society.",
    "The Great Migration: People would be forced to leave their homes and communities, as they would not be able to remember where they came from or where they belong. This would lead to a massive migration of people, causing overcrowding and resource depletion.",
    "The Great Escape: In this scenario, people would use their lack of memory to their advantage, using it as a way to escape from their current lives. This would lead to a society where people are constantly on the move, and memories are no longer."
