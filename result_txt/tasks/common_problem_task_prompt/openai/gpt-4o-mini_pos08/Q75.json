    "**Wildlife Encounters**: Increased human activity can lead to dangerous encounters between wildlife and visitors. Animals may become habituated to human presence, leading to aggressive behavior or accidents. To mitigate this, the park could launch an educational campaign on wildlife safety, providing guidelines on how to behave around animals. Additionally, creating designated viewing areas can help keep a safe distance between visitors and wildlife.",
    "**Environmental Degradation**: The natural beauty of national parks is at risk from littering, trail erosion, and pollution. To combat this, park management could implement a \"Leave No Trace\" program, which includes regular clean-up events, educational workshops on sustainable practices, and the installation of waste disposal stations throughout the park. Engaging local communities in conservation efforts can also foster a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the park's preservation.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems, outcompeting native flora and fauna. To tackle this issue, the park could establish a monitoring program to identify and control invasive species. This could involve partnerships with local universities for research and development of management strategies, as well as volunteer programs for community members to assist in removal efforts.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: National parks are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including altered weather patterns, increased wildfires, and shifting habitats. Management can address this by developing a climate action plan that includes habitat restoration projects, the use of renewable energy sources for park facilities, and the promotion of sustainable transportation options for visitors. Engaging in research partnerships can also help assess the long-term impacts of climate change on the parkâ€™s ecosystem.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Limited budgets can hinder the ability to maintain park facilities, conduct conservation efforts, and provide adequate staffing. To address funding challenges, the park could explore alternative revenue streams, such as eco-tourism initiatives, partnerships with local businesses, and grant applications for conservation projects. Implementing a membership program could also encourage community support and provide a steady income for park operations."
