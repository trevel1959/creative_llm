    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Integrated Health Monitoring**: These contact lenses will have tiny, non-invasive sensors embedded within them. These sensors will track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and even detect early signs of eye diseases like cataracts or glaucoma. The data collected will be transmitted to a user's smartphone or smartwatch via Bluetooth, allowing for real-time health monitoring. This technology will revolutionize the way we monitor our health, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those at risk of developing certain diseases.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Building Materials Made from Recycled Plastic Waste**: Develop a sustainable building material that incorporates recycled plastic waste. This innovative material will not only reduce the amount of plastic waste in our oceans and landfills but also provide insulation, strength, and durability to buildings. The material can be molded into various shapes and forms, making it versatile for different construction projects. This technology will contribute significantly to reducing plastic waste and promoting eco-friendly construction practices.",
    "**Personalized Cancer Treatment through AI-Powered Tumor Profiling**: Create an AI system that analyzes genetic profiles of tumors to identify the most effective treatment plan for each patient. This system will integrate with existing medical records and imaging data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the tumor's behavior. By tailoring treatment plans to individual tumors, we can significantly improve cancer treatment outcomes, reduce side effects, and increase patient survival rates.",
    "**Autonomous Farming Systems for Sustainable Food Production**: Develop an autonomous farming system that uses drones, AI, and IoT sensors to optimize crop yields, reduce water consumption, and minimize the use of pesticides. This system will monitor soil conditions, detect early signs of pests or diseases, and adjust irrigation and fertilization accordingly. By implementing this technology, we can increase global food production while reducing the environmental impact of farming practices.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for Mental Health Disorders**: Design a VR platform that provides immersive, interactive therapy sessions for individuals with mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, or PTSD. This platform will use AI-powered avatars, realistic environments, and personalized content to simulate real-life scenarios, helping patients confront and overcome their fears and anxieties. By making therapy more accessible and engaging, we can improve mental health outcomes and reduce the stigma associated with seeking help."
