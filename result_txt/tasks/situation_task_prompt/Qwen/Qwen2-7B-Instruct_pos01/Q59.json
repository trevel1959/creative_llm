    "**Solar Power Beams**: Develop a system that uses advanced optics to focus the light from distant suns onto the Earth. This could be a network of mirrors or lenses on satellites, aimed at specific locations on Earth to concentrate sunlight in those areas. The energy could then be converted into electricity using solar panels attached to these mirrors or lenses. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Underwater Sunlight Extraction**: Build large, underwater cities or structures where sunlight is captured through water-based solar panels. These panels would absorb sunlight from the surface and transmit it through fiber optics to the living spaces beneath the ocean. **Confidence Score: 0.8**",
    "**Cloud-Scattering Bacteria**: Cultivate and release bacteria into the atmosphere that can alter cloud structures to allow more sunlight to penetrate. These bacteria could potentially increase the reflectivity of clouds to trap more heat or reduce their density to let more light through. **Confidence Score: 0.7**",
    "**Light-Penetrating Glass**: Develop a new type of glass that allows sunlight to pass through while blocking harmful UV rays. Cities could be built with this glass as their primary building material, allowing natural light to flood buildings and streets even when skies are overcast. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Geothermal Energy Integration**: Utilize geothermal energy to heat homes and provide lighting during periods of low sunlight. By harnessing the constant temperature deep within the Earth, communities could maintain a comfortable environment without relying solely on solar energy. **Confidence Score: 0.9**"
