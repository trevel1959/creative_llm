    "**Aquaponics Revolution**: In a world without farming, I'd focus on establishing an aquaponics system in my backyard. This closed-loop system combines fish farming with hydroponics, allowing me to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and even raise fish for protein. I'd utilize a 10x10 meter space, with a 2-meter deep tank for fish and a separate grow bed for plants. The fish waste would provide nutrients for the plants, which would in turn purify the water for the fish. This system would provide a sustainable and efficient source of food for my family.",
    "**Vertical Farming Oasis**: Given the lack of traditional farming, I'd create a vertical farming oasis in a vacant lot or a rooftop space. Using a combination of hydroponics and aeroponics, I'd cultivate a wide range of leafy greens, herbs, and microgreens. The system would be designed to maximize space, with layers of crops growing upwards, and a climate-controlled environment to optimize growth. This would provide a consistent supply of fresh produce for my family, while also allowing for experimentation with new and exotic crops.",
    "**Urban Beekeeping and Foraging**: In a post-farming world, I'd focus on urban beekeeping and foraging to supplement my family's diet. By keeping a few beehives in my backyard or a nearby rooftop, I'd harvest honey and beeswax, while also cultivating a diverse range of pollinator-friendly plants. I'd also explore foraging for wild edibles, such as berries, mushrooms, and herbs, to add variety to our meals. This approach would not only provide a source of food but also contribute to local pollinator health and biodiversity.",
    "**Community-Supported Mushroom Cultivation**: I'd establish a community-supported mushroom cultivation program, where I'd work with a small group of like-minded individuals to cultivate a variety of mushroom species. Using a combination of indoor and outdoor facilities, we'd grow oyster, shiitake, and other varieties, which would be harvested and distributed among the community. This approach would not only provide a reliable source of protein and nutrition but also foster a sense of community and cooperation.",
    "**Seaweed and Kelp Farming**: Given the abundance of coastal areas, I'd explore seaweed and kelp farming as a sustainable food source. By establishing a small-scale seaweed farm in a shallow, coastal area, I'd cultivate a variety of species, including kelp, dulse, and Irish"
