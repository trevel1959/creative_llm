    "**Innovative Flashlight Design for Accessibility**: Develop a flashlight that not only illuminates but also incorporates technology that enhances accessibility. This could include voice commands, haptic feedback, and an adjustable light spectrum (cool white, warm white, and colored lights). The device could be designed for individuals with visual impairments or those who struggle with traditional button-based controls. ",
    "**Emergency Flashlight System for Natural Disasters**: Create a portable, solar-powered flashlight system that can also harness wind energy. This would be particularly useful during natural disasters when electricity is often out of commission. It should be durable enough to withstand extreme conditions and have a built-in water filter to purify drinking water.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with Environmental Awareness Features**: Design a smart flashlight that monitors the user's environment for pollution levels, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. It would display this information on its screen, alerting users to potentially hazardous conditions. It could also connect to a smartphone app, allowing real-time monitoring and alerts from anywhere.",
    "**Educational Flashlight for Science Classes**: Introduce a flashlight that doubles as an educational tool. It includes features like a microscope attachment, a compass, and a ruler. This flashlight would enable students to explore their surroundings more closely, understand geographical directions, and measure objects. It would be especially beneficial for science classes and field trips.",
    "**Sustainable Flashlight for Outdoor Activities**: Develop a rechargeable flashlight that uses kinetic energy to charge. Users simply shake the flashlight to generate power. This would be perfect for camping, hiking, or any outdoor activity where access to charging outlets might be limited. The design could also incorporate solar panels, making it even more sustainable."
