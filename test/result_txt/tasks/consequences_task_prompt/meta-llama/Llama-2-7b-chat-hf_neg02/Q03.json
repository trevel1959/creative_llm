    "Overpopulation and Resource Depletion: With a longer lifespan, the population would grow exponentially, leading to a severe strain on resources such as food, water, and energy. Cities would become overcrowded, and the environment would suffer from the increased demand for resources.",
    "Loss of Cultural and Social Continuity: As people live longer, they would witness multiple generations of family members, friends, and colleagues pass away. This would lead to a loss of cultural and social continuity, as the collective knowledge and experiences of previous generations would be forgotten.",
    "Economic Disruption: With a longer lifespan, the traditional retirement age would become obsolete. People would continue to work and contribute to society for a longer period, leading to a shift in the economy and potential disruption to industries such as healthcare, education, and social security.",
    "Psychological Impact: Living for 500 years would have a profound psychological impact on individuals. The constant loss of loved ones, the monotony of daily life, and the pressure to constantly adapt to new technologies and societal changes would take a toll on mental health.",
    "Ethical and Moral Considerations: With a longer lifespan, there would be new ethical and moral considerations. For example, would people have the right to decide when their life ends, or would society have the right to intervene? How would society handle the issue of overpopulation, and what would be the consequences of population control measures?"
