    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Spout**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle that can adjust to different angles for better grip and comfort. The spout could be flexible, allowing users to bend it for hard-to-reach plants or to pour water in various directions without straining their wrists.",
    "**Watering Can with Built-in Filter**: Incorporate a filtration system within the watering can that purifies tap water as it fills. This would be particularly beneficial for plants sensitive to chlorine and other chemicals found in municipal water. The filter could be replaceable and designed to last for several months.",
    "**Multi-Function Watering Can with Detachable Spray Nozzle**: Create a watering can that features a detachable spray nozzle that can be used for misting delicate plants or seedlings. The nozzle could have adjustable settings for different spray patterns (fine mist, gentle stream, etc.) and could easily be stored in the can when not in use.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Design a watering can with solar panels that power a small pump inside. This would allow users to collect rainwater in a reservoir and then pump it out using solar energy, making it eco-friendly and reducing reliance on tap water. The can could also have a built-in UV sterilizer to ensure the collected water is safe for plants.",
    "**Color-Changing Watering Can for Overwatering Alerts**: Create a watering can that changes color based on the water level inside. For example, if the can is filled above a certain point, it could turn red, indicating that it may lead to overwatering if used. This visual cue would help gardeners gauge how much water they are using and prevent potential plant damage."
