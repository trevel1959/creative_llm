    "Using only natural materials found in the environment: Gather sticks, stones, leaves, and fruits to create a fire and use it to roast meat or fish. Use rocks to pound flour into dough for bread or flatbreads, and gather edible plants such as berries, mushrooms, and nuts for additional food sources.",
    "Cooking with steam: Create a makeshift sauna by digging a hole in the ground and filling it with hot water from a nearby stream. Place food items inside the sauna and cover them with wet cloth to trap the steam. This method is particularly effective for cooking vegetables and grains.",
    "Creating a DIY oven: Build a simple oven using clay pots and heated coals. Stack the pots on top of each other and place a heat source in the center to heat up the air trapped between the pots. Once the temperature reaches a certain point, place food inside the oven and cook until done.",
    "Using solar energy: Set up a solar panel to charge batteries or power small appliances. Use the electricity generated by the panel to boil water or cook food over a stove or oven.",
    "Building a shelter: Construct a shelter using natural materials such as branches, leaves, and mud. Use the shelter to protect yourself from the elements while cooking food over an open flame or hot rock. This method is particularly useful if you are lost in the wilderness and need to survive for an extended period of time."
