    "**Guest List Dilemmas**: Balancing the guest list can be a challenge. Inviting too many friends may lead to chaos, while inviting too few could hurt feelings. To address this, consider creating a “close friends” list and a “classmates” list, then allow the birthday child to choose a certain number of guests from each category. This way, you maintain a manageable number of attendees while ensuring the child feels included and valued.",
    "**Activity Overload**: Planning too many activities can overwhelm young children, leading to chaos and frustration. To avoid this, select a few key activities that are age-appropriate and engaging, such as a simple craft, a treasure hunt, or a storytelling session. Create a loose schedule to guide the flow of the party without making it feel rigid, allowing for flexibility based on the children’s energy levels.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions**: Children may have allergies or dietary restrictions that need to be considered when planning the menu. Not addressing this could lead to safety issues or hurt feelings. To ensure everyone can enjoy the food, communicate with parents ahead of time to identify any dietary needs and provide a variety of options, including gluten-free, nut-free, and vegetarian choices.",
    "**Weather Woes**: If the party is planned outdoors, unpredictable weather can pose a significant issue. To prepare for this, have a backup plan in place, such as an indoor location or renting a tent. Keep an eye on weather forecasts leading up to the event and communicate any changes to the guests promptly.",
    "**Engaging the Parents**: Sometimes, parents may feel left out or unsure of their role during the party, leading to awkwardness. To foster a welcoming atmosphere, consider planning a small area for parents to relax, with refreshments and seating. You could also involve them in some activities, like a parent-child game or a brief storytelling session, to create a more inclusive environment."
