    "Solar System of Symbiosis: Redesigning the solar system to promote interplanetary cooperation and mutual benefit, rather than competition. Each planet and celestial body would be assigned a specific role in a larger ecosystem, with each contributing to the overall health and well-being of the system. For example, Mercury could act as a communication hub, Venus as a carbon sink, Mars as a habitat for advanced life forms, and Jupiter as a source of energy for the entire system.",
    "Solar System of Evolution: Envision a solar system where planets and celestial bodies are constantly evolving and adapting to changing conditions. This redesign would prioritize resilience and adaptability, with each planetary body undergoing periodic transformations to better suit its environment and the needs of its inhabitants. For instance, Earth could transform into a more hospitable planet through geoengineering, while Saturn could develop a ring system that supports the growth of new life forms.",
    "Solar System of Interconnectedness: A redesign that emphasizes the interconnectedness of the solar system, where each planet and celestial body is connected through a network of energy and information flows. This system would prioritize the sharing of resources and knowledge, with each planet contributing to the overall well-being of the system. For example, Mars could serve as a hub for scientific research and innovation, while Neptune could provide a source of renewable energy through its powerful winds and ocean currents.",
    "Solar System of Diversity: A redesign that celebrates the unique characteristics and diversity of each planet and celestial body in the solar system. This design would prioritize the preservation and appreciation of each planet's distinct features, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Saturn's rings, and Pluto's icy landscape. By valuing diversity, this redesign would promote a sense of wonder and appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the solar system.",
    "Solar System of Artificial Life: A redesign that incorporates artificial life forms and intelligent machines into the solar system. In this vision, the planets and celestial bodies are not just physical bodies but also platforms for advanced artificial intelligence to evolve and thrive. For"
