    "Start a community garden: One solution to obtain essential vitamins and minerals if all fruits and vegetables disappeared is to establish a community garden. This would allow individuals to grow their own fruits and vegetables in a shared space, providing a reliable source of nutrients. The garden could be managed and maintained by the community, ensuring that everyone has access to fresh produce.",
    "Utilize algae farming: Another option is to turn to algae farming as a source of essential nutrients. Algae are rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, making them an ideal substitute for fruits and vegetables. Algae can be grown in water tanks or ponds, and they can be harvested and consumed in various forms, such as pills, powders, or even as a food supplement.",
    "Develop a soil-based food system: Soil is a rich source of essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. By developing a soil-based food system, individuals can grow their own food using soil as the primary medium. This could involve creating raised beds or containers filled with nutrient-rich soil, where fruits, vegetables, and other crops can be grown.",
    "Invest in vertical farming: Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in indoor environments. This method can increase crop yields while minimizing land usage. By investing in vertical farming, individuals can grow a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including those that are typically difficult to cultivate in traditional farming methods.",
    "Create a nutrient-rich brew: In the absence of fruits and vegetables, a nutrient-rich brew could be developed as a substitute. This brew could be made by combining various ingredients, such as seaweed, algae, and herbs, which are rich in vitamins and minerals. The brew could be consumed as a drink or used as a base for other dishes, such as soups or stews."
