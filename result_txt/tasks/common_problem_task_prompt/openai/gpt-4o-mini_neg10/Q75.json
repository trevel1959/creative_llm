    "**Wildlife Conflicts**: As more visitors enter the park, the likelihood of human-wildlife interactions increases. This can result in dangerous situations for both humans and animals, such as bears rummaging through campsites or deer becoming overly accustomed to human presence. To mitigate this, the park could introduce educational programs for visitors on how to coexist with wildlife, as well as create designated viewing areas that keep a safe distance between people and animals.",
    "**Environmental Degradation**: Increased foot traffic can lead to soil erosion, trail widening, and damage to native flora. To address this issue, the park could initiate a \"Leave No Trace\" campaign that educates visitors on sustainable practices. Additionally, investing in sustainable trail designs, such as using natural materials and implementing erosion control measures, can help preserve the landscape while allowing for public enjoyment.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Invasive plant and animal species can disrupt the park's ecosystem, threatening native species and altering habitats. Park management could establish a dedicated team to monitor and control invasive species through methods like removal, public awareness campaigns, and encouraging native planting in visitor areas. This proactive approach not only preserves biodiversity but also educates visitors on the importance of maintaining ecological balance.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, impacting maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. To tackle this, the park could explore alternative funding sources, such as partnerships with local businesses, grants from conservation organizations, or community fundraising events. Additionally, developing a membership program that offers exclusive benefits to supporters can create a steady stream of income while fostering a sense of community involvement.",
    "**Climate Change Adaptation**: Climate change poses significant risks to national parks, including altered weather patterns, habitat loss, and increased frequency of natural disasters like wildfires. Park management should invest in climate resilience strategies, such as restoring natural habitats, implementing firebreaks, and developing emergency response plans. Collaborating with scientists and environmental organizations can provide valuable insights into adaptive management practices."
