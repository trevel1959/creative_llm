    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of large, specially designed mesh panels that can be installed in urban areas. These panels would capture water vapor from the air, condense it, and collect it in a centralized system. The water would then be filtered and treated to make it safe for drinking. This method would be especially effective in coastal cities, where the air is more humid.",
    "**Underground Aquifer Purification**: Design a system to pump water from underground aquifers, which are often naturally filtered and clean. The water would then be treated using advanced technologies like nanofiltration or reverse osmosis to remove any remaining impurities. This method would be more sustainable and energy-efficient than traditional desalination methods.",
    "**Floating Wetlands**: Create artificial wetlands on large bodies of water, such as lakes or reservoirs. These wetlands would be designed to mimic the natural water-cleansing processes of plants and microorganisms. The water would be pumped through the wetlands, where it would be filtered and treated, and then returned to the water source. This method would also provide a habitat for aquatic life.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification**: Develop a portable, solar-powered water purification system that can be deployed in remote areas. This system would use advanced technologies like UV light or membrane filtration to remove impurities from the water. The system would be powered by solar panels and would be capable of producing clean drinking water for a small community.",
    "**Vertical Farming and Water Recycling**: Design a vertical farm that incorporates a closed-loop water recycling system. The farm would use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow crops, and the wastewater would be collected and treated using advanced technologies like membrane bioreactors or advanced oxidation processes. The treated water would then be reused for irrigation, reducing the farm's water footprint and providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water."
