    "\"Mystery Planet\": Create a planet that is shrouded in mystery and has never been explored before. The planet has a unique atmosphere that prevents any spacecraft from landing or studying it directly. However, scientists can observe the planet's gravitational pull and radiation levels to gather information about its composition. The planet's surface is covered in a thick layer of clouds that obscure its true features, making it impossible to determine if it has oceans, mountains, or any other geological features. The planet's atmosphere is filled with gases that are unknown to science, and its magnetic field is unlike anything ever seen before.",
    "\"Life-sustaining Planet\": Create a planet that is capable of supporting life. The planet has a breathable atmosphere, with a mix of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases that are essential for human survival. The planet's surface is covered in vast oceans, forests, and mountains that provide a diverse range of habitats for life. The planet's atmosphere is rich in nutrients and minerals that are necessary for plant growth, and the planet has a stable climate that allows for the development of a diverse range of ecosystems.",
    "\"Ice Planet\": Create a planet that is entirely covered in ice. The planet's surface is covered in a thick layer of ice that is so dense that it is almost impossible to break through. However, beneath the ice, there are hidden oceans and underground caves that are filled with strange and exotic creatures. The planet's atmosphere is filled with gases that are toxic to humans, but they are essential for the survival of the creatures that live on the planet.",
    "\"Gas Giant Planet\": Create a planet that is a gas giant. The planet is so massive that it is almost entirely composed of gas, with no solid surface to stand on. The planet's atmosphere is filled with gases that are so dense that they create a thick fog that obscures the planet's true features. The planet's gravity is so strong that it would be impossible for humans to survive on its surface, but it could be used as a base for space exploration.",
    "\"Black Hole Planet\": Create a planet that is a black hole. The planet is so massive that it has collapsed into a singularity, a point of infinite density and space-time curvature. The planet's gravitational pull is so"
