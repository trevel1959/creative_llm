    "**Mirror Messaging**: Develop a system where individuals can use mirrors to send messages to each other. This could be achieved by using a specialized mirror that can display text or images, and then using a combination of laser pointers and reflective surfaces to transmit the message to a distant mirror. The receiving end would then use a decoding system to interpret the message. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Scent Messaging**: Create a network of scent-emitting devices that can transmit messages through the air. Each device would have a unique scent associated with it, and individuals could use a special device to \"send\" a message by releasing a specific scent into the air. The receiving end would then use a device to detect the scent and interpret the message. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Mathematical Morse Code**: Develop a system where individuals can communicate long distance using a combination of mathematical concepts and Morse code. This could be achieved by using a device that can generate complex mathematical equations, and then using a system of dots and dashes to represent the equations. The receiving end would then use a device to solve the equations and interpret the message. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Light Language**: Create a system where individuals can communicate long distance using a combination of light and color. This could be achieved by using a device that can generate a specific sequence of colors, and then using a system of lenses and mirrors to transmit the message to a distant location. The receiving end would then use a device to interpret the colors and decode the message. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Tactile Telepathy**: Develop a system where individuals can communicate long distance using a combination of touch and vibrations. This could be achieved by using a device that can generate specific vibrations, and then using a system of electrodes to transmit the vibrations to a distant location. The receiving end would then use a device to interpret the vibrations and decode the message. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
