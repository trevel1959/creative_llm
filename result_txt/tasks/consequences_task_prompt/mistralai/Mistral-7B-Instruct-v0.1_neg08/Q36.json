    "The ability to regenerate limbs like starfish could have significant implications for human medicine. Scientists could potentially use this technology to develop treatments for limb loss and regenerative medicine.",
    "If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, it could also have social implications. People who have lost limbs due to accidents or disease may feel more confident and self-assured if they could regrow their limbs.",
    "The ability to regenerate limbs could also have ethical implications. If humans were able to regenerate limbs, it could lead to a greater understanding of the human body and our ability to adapt to different environments.",
    "The technology required to regenerate limbs like starfish may be expensive and only available to a select few. This could lead to a greater divide between those who have access to the technology and those who do not.",
    "If humans were able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could also have a significant impact on our understanding of evolution and our place in the natural world. Scientists could potentially use this technology to study the evolution of other species and how they adapt to different environments."
