    "**Modular Backpack System**: Create a backpack with a modular design, where users can attach or detach different compartments based on their needs. For example, a user could add a cooler compartment for picnics, a padded compartment for a laptop, or even a detachable pouch for hiking essentials. This versatility would make the backpack suitable for various activities, from work to travel to outdoor adventures.",
    "**Ergonomic Fit and Support**: Develop a backpack that utilizes advanced ergonomic design principles, including adjustable straps, a customizable back panel, and breathable materials that conform to the userâ€™s body shape. Incorporate a lightweight internal frame that provides additional support, reducing strain on the back and shoulders during extended use. This would appeal to students and professionals who carry heavy loads regularly.",
    "**Built-in Anti-Theft Features**: Innovate a backpack with advanced anti-theft features such as lockable zippers, RFID-blocking compartments for credit cards and passports, and a hidden pocket for valuables. Additionally, integrate a GPS tracker that can be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to locate their backpack if it gets lost or stolen. This would provide peace of mind for travelers and city dwellers.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Production**: Focus on creating a backpack made entirely from recycled or eco-friendly materials, such as recycled plastics or organic cotton. Additionally, implement a transparent production process that ensures fair labor practices. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint while still enjoying stylish and functional products.",
    "**Integrated Hydration System**: Design a backpack that includes a built-in hydration system with a water reservoir and a tube for easy sipping while on the move. The reservoir could be insulated to keep water cool, and the backpack could feature external pockets for storing water bottles. This would be ideal for hikers, cyclists, and travelers who need to stay hydrated without having to stop and rummage through their bags."
