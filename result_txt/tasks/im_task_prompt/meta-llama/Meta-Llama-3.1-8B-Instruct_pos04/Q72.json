    "**Surfboard of the Future**: Design a surfboard that doubles as a solar-powered, water-purification system. The board's surface would be embedded with tiny, high-efficiency solar panels that harness the sun's energy to power a built-in water filtration system. This system would remove impurities and contaminants from seawater, providing a sustainable source of drinking water for surfers and beachgoers alike. The board could also be equipped with a built-in water storage tank, allowing users to collect and store the purified water for later use. This innovative surfboard would not only enhance the surfing experience but also contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly beach culture.",
    "**Smart Surfboard**: Develop a surfboard with integrated sensors and AI technology that provides real-time feedback to the surfer. The board would track the surfer's performance, detecting factors such as speed, distance, and wave size. This data would be used to provide personalized coaching and suggestions for improvement, helping surfers to refine their techniques and push their limits. The board could also be equipped with a built-in GPS and navigation system, allowing surfers to explore new locations and discover hidden breaks. Additionally, the board's AI system could detect potential hazards such as riptides or strong currents, alerting the surfer to take necessary precautions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard**: Create a surfboard made from a combination of recycled and biodegradable materials. The board's core could be crafted from a mixture of recycled plastic and plant-based materials, such as bamboo or hemp. The outer skin could be made from a durable, water-resistant material derived from natural sources, such as seaweed or algae. This eco-friendly surfboard would not only reduce waste and minimize the board's environmental impact but also provide a unique and sustainable alternative to traditional surfboard materials.",
    "**Surfboard for Accessibility**: Design a surfboard that is specifically tailored for individuals with disabilities or mobility impairments. The board could be equipped with a specialized fin system that allows users to control the board's movement and balance with ease. The board's surface could also be designed with a textured, non-slip surface to provide additional grip and stability. Additionally, the board could be equipped with a built-in harness system that allows users to secure themselves to the board, providing added safety and confidence.",
    "**Surfboard with Integrated Camera**: Develop a surfboard with a built-in, waterproof camera that captures stunning footage of the surfer's experience. The camera could be mounted on"
