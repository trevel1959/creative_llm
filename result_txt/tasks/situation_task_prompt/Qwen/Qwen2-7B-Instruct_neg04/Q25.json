    "**Human-Powered Ladder System**: Design a ladder system that can be manually raised and lowered by teams of people on each floor. Each team would work together to raise the ladder to their desired height. The ladders would be constructed from lightweight yet durable materials such as carbon fiber. This system could also include safety features like harnesses and ropes for securing climbers.",
    "**Balloon-Driven Elevator**: Develop a large, helium-filled balloon attached to a platform that can carry a person or small group up the building. The balloon would have a controlled descent mechanism to ensure safe movement against wind currents. To maintain stability, it could incorporate flaps or wings that allow for directional adjustments.",
    "**Cable-Suspended Human-Aerial-Rope-Walker (HARW)**: Create a HARW that consists of a series of interconnected ropes that can be strung between the ground and the top floors of the building. Climbers would use a combination of climbing shoes and a harness to traverse the ropes safely. The system would include a safety net at the bottom and could have intermediate platforms for rest stops.",
    "**Elevator-Shuttle Drone System**: Utilize drones equipped with a small cabin that can transport one or two people at a time. These drones would fly between designated points, with a landing pad system installed on each floor. The drones would be controlled by an AI or a remote operator to ensure safe navigation through the building's structure.",
    "**Water-Based Submarine Elevator**: For tall buildings near water bodies, design a submarine elevator that can descend into the water and then rise to the top of the building. The elevator would be pressurized to withstand underwater conditions and would be accessible via a watertight door at each floor. This method would require careful planning to ensure safety during emergencies, such as flooding or mechanical failure."
