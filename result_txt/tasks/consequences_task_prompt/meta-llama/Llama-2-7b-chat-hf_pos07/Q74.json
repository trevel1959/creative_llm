    "Efficient Infrastructure: With a single city, infrastructure would be streamlined, and resources would be allocated more efficiently. Transportation systems, energy grids, and communication networks would be interconnected, leading to faster and more reliable services.",
    "Enhanced Sustainability: A single city would have a smaller carbon footprint compared to multiple cities. The reduced land area and resource consumption would result in less pollution, deforestation, and habitat destruction.",
    "Increased Security: A single city would have a centralized security system, making it easier to monitor and control crime. With a smaller area to cover, law enforcement agencies could focus their efforts more effectively, leading to a safer environment.",
    "Unified Culture: With a single city, there would be a shared culture and way of life. Different neighborhoods or districts could still maintain their unique identities, but there would be a common thread that ties everyone together. This could foster a greater sense of community and social cohesion."
