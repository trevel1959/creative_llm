    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a wearable backpack with integrated solar panels, a rechargeable battery, and a power management system. The backpack would be equipped with USB ports and a wireless charging pad to keep your devices charged throughout the day. The solar panels would be made of high-efficiency materials to maximize energy harvesting, and the power management system would optimize energy storage and distribution to ensure reliable power supply.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop a line of shoes with built-in kinetic energy harvesting technology. The shoes would be equipped with piezoelectric sensors that convert the mechanical energy generated by walking or running into electrical energy. This energy would be stored in a rechargeable battery, which would power a wireless charging pad or a small power bank to charge your devices on the go.",
    "**Bioluminescent Power**: Explore the potential of bioluminescent organisms to generate electricity. Develop a system that harnesses the light emitted by bioluminescent bacteria or fungi to generate electricity through photovoltaic cells or piezoelectric sensors. This could be integrated into a wearable device or a portable power source.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Design a device that captures and condenses water vapor from the air, generating electricity through the process. This could be achieved through a combination of advanced materials and technologies, such as nanomaterials, nanotechnology, and electrochemical reactions. The device would produce both clean water and electricity, making it a sustainable solution for powering devices.",
    "**Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting**: Develop a wearable device that harnesses the temperature difference between the body and the environment to generate electricity. This could be achieved through thermoelectric materials that convert heat into electrical energy. The device would be designed to be compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient, making it a viable option for powering small devices. [/INST] [/INST] "
