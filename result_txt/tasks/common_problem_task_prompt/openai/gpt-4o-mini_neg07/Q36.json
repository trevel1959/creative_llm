    "**Aesthetic and Zoning Issues**: The installation of solar panels can significantly alter the appearance of a home. Some neighborhoods may have strict zoning laws or homeowner association (HOA) regulations that restrict the visibility or design of solar panels. This could lead to disputes among residents, as some may feel that the aesthetics of their community are compromised, resulting in resistance to the installation project.",
    "**Interconnection and Grid Compatibility**: Integrating a large number of solar panels into the existing electrical grid poses challenges related to interconnection. The local utility company may need to upgrade infrastructure to handle the influx of solar energy, which could lead to delays and additional costs. Additionally, managing the balance of energy supply and demand becomes more complex, potentially resulting in grid instability.",
    "**Financial Barriers for Homeowners**: While solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial installation costs can be prohibitive for some homeowners. This financial barrier could lead to inequality in access to renewable energy, with only wealthier residents being able to afford the upfront costs, while low-income households may miss out on the benefits of solar energy.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require regular maintenance and occasional repairs. Homeowners may not have the knowledge or resources to properly maintain their systems, leading to inefficiencies and potential breakdowns. Additionally, the demand for qualified technicians to perform maintenance and repairs could outstrip supply, leading to longer wait times and higher costs for service.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Manufacturing and Disposal**: The production of solar panels involves the use of various materials, some of which may have negative environmental impacts during extraction and manufacturing. Additionally, the disposal of old or damaged solar panels poses a challenge, as they contain materials that can be harmful to the environment if not handled properly. This could undermine the sustainability goals of the solar initiative."
