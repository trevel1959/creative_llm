    "centric Planet: If Earth's gravity were halved, the planet would become flatter, similar to a pancake. This is because gravity pulls objects towards the center of the planet, and if the force is reduced, objects will no longer be pulled as strongly towards the center.",
    "Atmospheric Changes: The atmosphere would also be affected, as the gravitational force is what keeps the air in place. If the force were halved, the air would start to escape into space, causing a drastic drop in atmospheric pressure.",
    "Oceans and Landmasses: The oceans would also be affected, as the gravitational force is what keeps the water in place. If the force were halved, the water would start to escape into space, causing a drastic drop in ocean levels.",
    "Human Survival: Humans would not be able to survive on Earth if gravity were halved, as the reduced force would cause the body to lose its shape and structure.",
    "Space Exploration: If Earth's gravity were halved, it would be easier for humans to explore space. The reduced force would make it easier for astronauts to move around in zero gravity, and it would also make it easier for spacecraft to maneuver in space."
