    "**Dumbbells with Interactive LED Displays**: Introduce dumbbells that feature LED displays on the handles, showing real-time stats like weight lifted, time spent working out, and calories burned. The display could also provide motivational quotes or workout tips, keeping users engaged and inspired throughout their training sessions. This tech-savvy approach could appeal to fitness enthusiasts who enjoy data-driven workouts.",
    "**Weighted Dumbbells with Modular Attachments**: Create a set of dumbbells that come with modular attachments, allowing users to convert them into other fitness tools, such as kettlebells or medicine balls.
