    "Eye-Tracking Glasses with AI-Powered Object Recognition: Develop a pair of glasses with an inbuilt eye-tracking system that can recognize objects in the user's surroundings. The technology would use AI algorithms to identify objects and provide audio or haptic feedback to help the visually impaired navigate their environment. For example, the glasses could identify nearby landmarks, such as street signs or buildings, and provide audio directions to help the user navigate.",
    "Smart Cane with Vibration and GPS Navigation: Design a smart cane that not only provides tactile feedback but also includes GPS navigation capabilities. The cane would vibrate when the user is near a specific location, such as a subway station or a landmark, and provide audio directions to help the user navigate. The GPS functionality would also allow the user to track their location and find their way back home.",
    "Braille Display Watch: Create a watch with a braille display that can show the time, date, and other important information in braille. The watch would use a series of raised dots to display the information, allowing the visually impaired to read the time and other important information without needing to glance at a screen.",
    "Mobile App for Object Recognition: Develop a mobile app that uses AI-powered object recognition to identify objects in the user's surroundings. The app could be used to identify everyday objects, such as food, clothing, and household items, and provide audio or haptic feedback to help the user navigate their environment. The app could also be used to identify landmarks and provide audio directions to help the user navigate.",
    "Wearable Device for Visual Assistance: Design a wearable device that can provide visual assistance to the visually impaired. The device could use a combination of sensors and AI algorithms to detect and interpret visual information, such as faces, objects, and text, and provide audio or haptic feedback to help the user understand their surroundings. The device could also be used to magnify objects or text, allowing the user to see them more clearly."
