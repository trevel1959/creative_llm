    "Hydrogen-powered Submersible: Develop a hydrogen-powered submersible that can reach the deepest parts of the ocean. The submarine will be powered by a fuel cell that converts hydrogen into electricity, providing a clean and sustainable source of energy. The submarine will be equipped with advanced sensors and cameras to capture high-quality images and data of the ocean floor. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Ocean Cleanup Array: Design an ocean cleanup array that can collect and break down plastic waste in the ocean. The array will consist of a series of interconnected floating platforms that will collect plastic debris and use it to generate electricity. The electricity will be used to power a series of chemical reactors that will break down the plastic into harmless microbeads. The microbeads can then be used to fertilize coral reefs, providing a sustainable solution for ocean conservation. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Underwater Forest: Create an underwater forest by developing a system for growing kelp and other marine plants in the ocean. The system will consist of a series of underwater modules that provide the necessary conditions for kelp growth, including light, nutrients, and water flow. The kelp will be harvested and used for a variety of purposes, including food, biofuels, and building materials. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Artificial Reef Habitat: Develop an artificial reef habitat that can support a diverse range of marine life. The habitat will be designed to mimic the structure and function of a natural reef, providing a suitable environment for fish, coral, and other marine organisms. The habitat will be made from sustainable materials and will be deployed in a strategic location to maximize its impact on the ocean ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Ocean-based Desalination: Create a system for desalination that uses the ocean as a source of water. The system will consist of a series of underwater pipes that extract seawater and use it to generate fresh water through a process of reverse osmosis. The fresh water will be collected and stored for use in a variety of applications, including drinking water, irrigation, and industrial processes"
