    "There is no water. We have to take all of our water with us. We have to take all of our food with us. We have to take all of our clothing with us.",
    "There is no gravity. People will float around and have to wear belts to keep them from floating away.",
    "There is no sunlight. It is always dark. We have to take solar panels with us to generate power.",
    "There is no air. We have to wear spacesuits to breathe. We have to take oxygen tanks with us.",
    "There is no wind. There is no rain. There is no snow. There are no clouds. There are no storms. There are no hurricanes or tornadoes."
