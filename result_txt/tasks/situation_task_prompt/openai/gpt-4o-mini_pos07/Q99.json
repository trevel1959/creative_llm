    "**Pattern Recognition**: Create a library of patterns that can be printed or etched onto objects. For example, stripes, polka dots, or geometric shapes could be used to differentiate items. Each object could have a specific pattern, allowing individuals to identify them visually based on these unique designs, much like QR codes but in a purely visual format.",
    "**Shadow Play**: Utilize the interplay of light and shadow to differentiate objects. By manipulating lighting conditions, shadows cast by various objects can create distinct shapes or outlines. For instance, a tall plant might cast a different shadow than a flat piece of furniture. This method could lead to artistic expressions where shadows become a focal point in identifying and appreciating objects.",
    "**Sound Signatures**: Develop an auditory identification system where each object produces a unique sound when interacted with. For example, tapping a wooden box might create a dull thud, while a glass bottle would produce a sharper sound. By associating sounds with specific objects, individuals could learn to recognize items through auditory cues, making the environment more engaging.",
    "**Spatial Arrangement**: Designate specific areas for different types of objects based on their function or category. For example, kitchen utensils could be organized in one area, while tools could be stored in another. This spatial differentiation allows individuals to locate items quickly based on their familiarity with the layout, creating a systematic approach to organization.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Utilize reflective materials that can create varying shades of gray based on light exposure and angle. For instance, a shiny metal object might appear brighter than a matte black object, creating a contrast that helps in differentiation. This method could also encourage innovative designs where objects incorporate reflective properties to enhance visibility."
