    "Solar-Powered Flying Saucer: This innovative idea involves creating a solar-powered flying saucer that can harness the energy of the sun to generate electricity. The saucer would be designed to rotate in a specific pattern to maximize energy collection, and the electricity generated would be stored in advanced batteries for use in the power plant. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bio-Dome Power Plant: This idea involves creating a large, enclosed dome that would house a variety of microorganisms that produce biofuels. The dome would be designed to optimize the conditions for these microorganisms, and the biofuels produced would be used to power the power plant. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Plant: This idea involves using the temperature difference between the warm surface waters and cold deep waters of the ocean to generate electricity. The plant would use a heat exchanger to harness the energy from the ocean and convert it into electricity. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Floating Wind Turbine Farm: This idea involves creating a large farm of floating wind turbines that would be placed in the ocean or large bodies of water. The turbines would be designed to rotate in the wind, generating electricity, and the electricity would be transmitted to the power plant for use. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Geothermal Power Plant with Carbon Capture: This idea involves creating a geothermal power plant that would use the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. The plant would also include a carbon capture system to capture the carbon dioxide emissions produced during the generation process, reducing the plant's environmental impact. Confidence Score: 0.9"
