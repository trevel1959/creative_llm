    "**Interchangeable Plates for Diverse Recipes**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to make not only traditional waffles but also unique shapes and styles, such as Belgian, stuffed, or even pancake-style waffles. These plates could be easily swapped out and made from non-stick materials for easy cleaning. Additionally, offer seasonal or themed plates (e.g., hearts for Valentine's Day) to enhance the experience.",
    "**Built-in Mixing and Dispensing System**: Integrate a mixing bowl and dispensing mechanism directly into the waffle iron. Users could add their ingredients to the bowl, and the machine would mix and dispense the batter directly onto the cooking plates. This would streamline the cooking process and reduce cleanup, as there would be no need for additional bowls or measuring cups.",
    "**Customizable Temperature and Time Settings**: Equip the waffle iron with advanced settings that allow users to customize the cooking temperature and time for different types of batters (gluten-free, protein-rich, etc.). This feature would ensure perfect waffles every time, accommodating various dietary preferences and achieving desired crispiness or fluffiness.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Book with Touchscreen Display**: Install a small touchscreen display on the waffle iron that features a built-in recipe book. Users could browse through various recipes, select one, and the machine would automatically adjust the cooking time and temperature. The display could also include instructional videos, tips for perfecting waffles, and maintenance reminders.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Innovate a self-cleaning feature for the waffle iron that uses steam and high heat to sanitize and clean the cooking plates after use. This would not only save time for users but also ensure hygiene and prolong the life of the appliance. The cleaning cycle could be initiated with the press of a button or scheduled through the connected app."
