    "Reintroducing Extinct Species: Cloning extinct animals could allow us to reintroduce species that have been lost to extinction, restoring balance to ecosystems and preserving biodiversity. This could have positive impacts on ecosystem health, as well as the mental and emotional well-being of humans who value these species. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Unforeseen Consequences: Cloning extinct animals could lead to unforeseen consequences, such as genetic mutations or abnormalities in the cloned individuals, which could have negative impacts on their health and survival. Additionally, cloning could also lead to the loss of genetic diversity within the species, as the cloned individuals may not have the same genetic diversity as the original species. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Ethical Concerns: Cloning extinct animals raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for exploitation and the impact on the original species' ecosystem. For example, if we clone a species that is no longer extinct, it could lead to a surplus of individuals in the ecosystem, causing competition for resources and potentially disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Conservation Efforts: Cloning extinct animals could be a valuable tool for conservation efforts, as it could allow us to preserve genetic material from endangered species and potentially even bring back extinct species. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of cloning, such as the impact on the ecosystem and the ethical concerns. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Genetic Manipulation: Cloning extinct animals could also lead to genetic manipulation, as scientists may try to manipulate the genetic material of the cloned individuals to enhance certain traits or characteristics. This could have unintended consequences, such as introducing new diseases or disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.6"
