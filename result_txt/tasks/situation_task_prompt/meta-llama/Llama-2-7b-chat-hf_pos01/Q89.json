    "Natural fibers such as bamboo, cotton, and hemp could be used as a sustainable alternative to plastic for packaging materials like boxes, bags, and wrap. These materials are biodegradable, renewable, and have a lower carbon footprint than traditional plastics. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Recycled materials like old plastic bottles, containers, and other recyclables could be collected, cleaned, and melted down to create new products like furniture, building materials, and even clothing. This would not only reduce waste but also create a new market for recycled materials. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Bioplastics made from renewable resources like corn starch, sugarcane, or potato starch could be used as a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics. These bioplastics are biodegradable and can be composted at the end of their life cycle, reducing the amount of waste in landfills. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Cellulose-based materials like paper pulp or cellulose nanocrystals could be used as a sustainable alternative to plastic for packaging materials like boxes, bags, and wrap. These materials are biodegradable, renewable, and have a lower carbon footprint than traditional plastics. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Advanced materials like graphene or nanocellulose could be used to create new products that are stronger, lighter, and more durable than traditional plastics. These materials have the potential to replace plastic in many applications, from packaging to construction materials. Confidence score: 0.95"
