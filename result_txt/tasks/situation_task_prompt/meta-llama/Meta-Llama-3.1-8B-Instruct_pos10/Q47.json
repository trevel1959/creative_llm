    "**Solar Shield Helmet**: Design a sleek, futuristic helmet with built-in solar protection. The helmet would have a lightweight, aerodynamic design, with a UV-blocking visor that adjusts to changing sun conditions. The visor could be made of a thin, flexible material that provides 100% protection against UVA and UVB rays. The helmet would also have a built-in cooling system, utilizing evaporative cooling technology to keep the head cool and comfortable.",
    "**Reflective Headband**: Develop a high-tech headband that reflects UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin. The headband would be made of a thin, flexible material with microscopic particles that reflect UV radiation. The headband could be worn under a hat or as a standalone accessory, providing an additional layer of protection against sunburn.",
    "**Sunscreen-infused Hair Replacement**: Create a hair replacement system that incorporates sunscreen into the fibers of the replacement hair. This would provide a built-in layer of protection against sunburn, eliminating the need for separate sunscreen applications. The hair replacement system could be designed to mimic the natural texture and color of human hair, making it a discreet and effective solution.",
    "**Personal Sun Umbrella**: Design a portable, wearable sun umbrella that provides shade for the head and neck. The umbrella would be compact and lightweight, with a retractable design that allows for easy storage. The umbrella could be made of a durable, water-resistant material with a UV-blocking canopy that provides 100% protection against sunburn.",
    "**Smart Scalp Sunscreen**: Develop a wearable device that applies sunscreen to the scalp, providing a continuous layer of protection against sunburn. The device would be a small, adhesive patch that contains a reservoir of sunscreen, which would be released as needed. The patch could be programmed to adjust the amount of sunscreen released based on the individual's skin type, sun exposure, and other factors.
