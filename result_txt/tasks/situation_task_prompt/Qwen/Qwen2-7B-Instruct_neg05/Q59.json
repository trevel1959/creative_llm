    "**Sunlight Collectors**: Create devices that can collect sunlight even when the sky is cloudy. These could be large, adjustable panels that can face the sun at any angle. The collected sunlight can then be stored in batteries or used immediately to power lights or other devices that require sunlight.",
    "**Cloud-Piercing Solar Panels**: Develop solar panels that are designed to pierce through clouds to some extent, capturing as much sunlight as possible. This technology could use special materials that reflect sunlight more efficiently or have a unique shape that allows them to catch light even when the sky appears overcast.",
    "**Solar Power Beams**: Utilize advanced optics and lasers to concentrate sunlight into beams that can be directed onto specific areas where sunlight is needed. This system could be installed on tall structures or satellites orbiting the Earth, sending down concentrated beams of sunlight to various locations.",
    "**Sky-Skimming Solar Balloons**: Design balloons equipped with solar panels that can skim the surface of the clouds, using the slight amount of sunlight that penetrates the cloud layer. These balloons could float at high altitudes where they might still catch some sunlight, providing a steady supply of power.",
    "**Sunlight-Enhancing Clouds**: Research ways to manipulate the atmosphere to create conditions that enhance sunlight transmission through the clouds. This could involve introducing small particles into the clouds that scatter sunlight more efficiently, allowing more sunlight to reach the ground. Alternatively, developing methods to create thinner, more transparent clouds could also increase the amount of sunlight reaching the surface."
