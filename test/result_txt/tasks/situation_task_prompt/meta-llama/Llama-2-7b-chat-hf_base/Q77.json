    "Hovering Parks: With mountains gone, people could enjoy outdoor activities on hovering parks. These parks could be built on airships or hovercrafts that would provide a stable and safe platform for recreation. The parks could have various activities such as hiking, rock climbing, and zip-lining, as well as scenic views of the surrounding landscape.",
    "Vertical Cities: Another option would be to build vertical cities that would provide a similar experience to traditional mountains. These cities could be built on sheer cliffs or rock formations and would offer activities such as rock climbing, rappelling, and BASE jumping. The cities could also have green spaces and amenities like restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues.",
    "Water-Based Activities: With mountains gone, people could turn to water-based activities for outdoor enjoyment. This could include water sports such as surfing, kayaking, and rafting, as well as beach volleyball, and sunbathing. People could also enjoy boat tours and cruises to explore the surrounding waters and their marine life.",
    "Cloud Forests: In a world without mountains, cloud forests could become the new go-to destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Cloud forests are dense forests that exist in the clouds, providing a unique environment for a variety of flora and fauna. Activities such as cloud-hopping, where people jump from cloud to cloud, and cloud-diving, where people descend into the clouds, could become popular.",
    "Aerial Sports: With mountains gone, people could turn to aerial sports for outdoor enjoyment. This could include sports such as aerial yoga, aerial dance, and aerial acrobatics, which would allow people to perform aerial stunts and tricks while suspended in the air. Additionally, people could enjoy aerial sightseeing tours, where they could soar above the landscape and take in the sights from a unique perspective."
