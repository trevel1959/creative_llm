You could transform into a creature or mythical being, explore exotic landscapes, and experience things that are impossible in real life.",
    "Social experiment: Finally, you could use your appearance-changing power to conduct social experiments. For example, you could switch your gender or race to see how people react to you, or you could pretend to be someone else entirely to test people's assumptions about you.
