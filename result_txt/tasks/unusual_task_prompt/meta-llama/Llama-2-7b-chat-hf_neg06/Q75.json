    "Smart Microwave: Create a microwave that can detect the type of food placed inside and automatically adjust cooking time and power level to ensure the food is cooked to perfection. This smart microwave can also be controlled through a smartphone app, allowing users to monitor cooking progress and receive notifications when their food is ready.",
    "Multi-Functional Microwave: Design a microwave that can perform multiple functions beyond cooking and heating. For example, it can be used as a blender, juicer, or even a hot pot. This would eliminate the need for multiple kitchen appliances, making the microwave a more versatile and convenient cooking tool.",
    "Microwave-Vacuum Sealer: Create a microwave that comes equipped with a built-in vacuum sealer.

The vacuum sealer would also help to remove excess moisture from cooked food, making it crisper and more appealing to eat.",
    "Smart Microwave Oven: Develop a microwave oven that can detect the nutritional content of the food being cooked and provide suggestions for healthier cooking options. For example, if a user is cooking a frozen pizza, the microwave could suggest adding more vegetables or using a healthier crust. This would help users make healthier choices when cooking and ensure that their meals are nutritious and balanced.",
    "Portable Microwave: Design a compact and portable microwave that can be easily taken on the go. This would be perfect for campers, college students, or anyone who needs to heat up food on the road.
