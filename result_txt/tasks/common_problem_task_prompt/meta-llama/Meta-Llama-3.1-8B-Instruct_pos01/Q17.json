    "**Eco-Olympics**: The next Olympics could be held in a city that is already a hub for sustainability and eco-friendliness. The games could incorporate green technologies, such as solar-powered stadiums, and environmentally-friendly transportation systems. The athletes could participate in events that promote eco-awareness, such as a \"Trash-to-Treasure\" marathon, where participants collect and recycle waste along the course. The closing ceremony could feature a massive recycling drive, where attendees bring in their own recyclables and electronics to be properly disposed of. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Underwater Olympics**: Imagine a futuristic underwater city, where the Olympics are held in a massive, state-of-the-art aquatic facility. Athletes would compete in events such as synchronized swimming, underwater hockey, and even underwater parkour. The venue would be designed to resemble a coral reef, complete with artificial marine life and a stunning LED light show. The opening ceremony could feature a spectacular underwater parade, where athletes swim through the facility in elaborate costumes. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Virtual Reality Olympics**: In this concept, athletes would compete in virtual reality environments, pushing the limits of human performance in simulated scenarios. Events could include VR versions of traditional sports, such as virtual track and field, or entirely new experiences, like VR parkour or virtual rock climbing. The venue would be a massive VR dome, where spectators could watch the action unfold in stunning 3D. The closing ceremony could feature a massive VR experience, where attendees wear headsets and participate in a shared, immersive experience. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Olympics in Space**: Why not take the Olympics to the final frontier? A space-based Olympics could feature events such as zero-gravity basketball, spacewalk marathons, and even a \"space jump\" competition, where athletes leap from a space station to a nearby asteroid. The venue would be a massive space station, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and stunning views of the cosmos. The opening ceremony could feature a spectacular spacewalk, where athletes float through the station in specially designed suits. (Confidence: 0.95)",
    "**Olympics for All**: In this concept, the Olympics would be reimagined as a celebration of human diversity and ability. Events would be designed to be inclusive and accessible, with categories for athletes with disabilities, seniors, and even virtual competitors. The venue would be a massive, adaptable facility, with modular design elements"
