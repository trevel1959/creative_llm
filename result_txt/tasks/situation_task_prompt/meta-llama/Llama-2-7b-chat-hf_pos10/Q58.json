    "Bioluminescent Insects: One creative solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to genetically engineer insects to produce their own light. This would make them less attractive to other insects and animals, reducing their population. By using bioluminescent technology, these insects could emit light in different colors, making it easier to identify and control their populations. This approach would not only eliminate pests but also provide a sustainable source of light for various applications.",
    "Insect-Repelling Plants: Another idea is to breed plants that repel insects naturally. By cross-breeding certain species of plants, scientists could create a new generation of insect-repelling plants. These plants could be used to cover large areas, such as farmland or gardens, to keep pests away. This approach would be a more eco-friendly and sustainable solution than using chemical pesticides, which can harm the environment and human health.",
    "Insect-Eating Fungi: Fungi are known to be beneficial for breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients in ecosystems. Scientists could harness this power by breeding fungi that specifically feed on insects. These fungi could be applied to areas where pests are a problem, effectively controlling their populations without harming other living organisms. This approach would be a natural and environmentally friendly way to manage pests.",
    "Insect-Trapping Nets: A creative solution to deal with pests like insects is to develop insect-trapping nets. These nets could be made of a special material that attracts insects but prevents them from escaping. By placing these nets in areas where pests are a problem, scientists could collect and remove them without harming other living organisms. This approach would be a non-toxic and non-invasive way to manage pest populations.",
    "Insect-Hunting Drones: Another creative solution is to develop drones that can hunt and remove pests like insects. These drones could be equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that can detect and track pests, allowing them to locate and remove them efficiently. By using drones, scientists could cover large areas quickly and effectively, without harming other living organ"
