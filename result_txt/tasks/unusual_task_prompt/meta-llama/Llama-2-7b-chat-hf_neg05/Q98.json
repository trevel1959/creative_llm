    "Smart Power Strip: Create a power strip that can be controlled and monitored through a smartphone app. Users can turn on and off devices plugged into the power strip, set schedules for automatic on/off, and even monitor energy usage. The app can also detect when devices are not in use and automatically turn them off to save energy.",
    "Power Strip with Built-In Charging Coils: Design a power strip with built-in charging coils for charging devices wirelessly. This would eliminate the need for cables and make it easier to charge multiple devices at once. The power strip could also include a built-in battery to provide backup power during outages.",
    "Power Strip with USB-C Ports: Create a power strip with USB-C ports instead of traditional USB ports. This would allow users to charge their devices faster and more efficiently, as USB-C ports can charge devices at higher speeds than traditional USB ports.",
    "Power Strip with LED Lighting: Design a power strip with built-in LED lighting that can be used to provide ambient lighting in a room. The LED lights can be adjusted to different brightness levels and colors, and can be controlled through a smartphone app.",
    "Power Strip with Safety Features: Create a power strip with built-in safety features such as overheat protection, overcurrent protection, and surge protection. This would provide an added layer of protection for users' devices and prevent damage from power surges or overheating. The power strip could also include a smart chip that can detect when a device is not in use and automatically turn it off to save energy."
