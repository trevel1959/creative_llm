    "Use Texture: If all colors disappeared, texture would become the primary distinguishing factor between objects. We could feel the roughness of a rock, the smoothness of a ball, or the bumps on a book cover to differentiate between them.",
    "Use Shape: Shapes can also be used to differentiate between objects. We could recognize a circle, a square, a triangle, and so on, even if they were all black and white.",
    "Use Size: Size can also be used to differentiate between objects. We could recognize the size of a car, a house, a tree, and so on, even if they were all black and white.",
    "Use Light and Shadow: Even if colors disappeared, light and shadow would still be present. We could use the position of the sun to differentiate between objects. For example, a tree would cast a shadow in a different location than a house.",
    "Use Sound: We could use sound to differentiate between objects. For example, we could recognize the sound of a car engine or the sound of birds chirping to differentiate between objects."
