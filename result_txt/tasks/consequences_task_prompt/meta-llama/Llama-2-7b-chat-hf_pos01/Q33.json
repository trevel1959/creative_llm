    "The ecosystem would be drastically altered: If animals grew to twice their size, the food chain would be disrupted, and the balance of the ecosystem would be thrown off. Larger animals would require more food and resources, leading to a surge in population growth and competition for resources. This could lead to overgrazing, deforestation, and a decline in biodiversity. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "The built environment would be challenged: With larger animals, buildings and infrastructure would need to be redesigned to accommodate their increased size. This could lead to significant changes in urban planning and architecture, as well as the need for new materials and technologies to support the growth of larger animals. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Human health would be impacted: As animals grew larger, the risk of disease transmission would increase, particularly in urban areas where humans and animals come into close contact. Additionally, larger animals could pose a physical threat to humans, leading to injuries and fatalities. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "The economy would be affected: A world with larger animals would have significant economic implications, particularly in industries such as agriculture and tourism. Larger animals could lead to increased productivity and efficiency, but they could also lead to higher costs and decreased profitability. Confidence score: 0.5",
    "Social dynamics would change: With larger animals, social dynamics and relationships between humans and animals would be altered. Humans may develop new forms of communication and interaction with larger animals, leading to changes in cultural practices and beliefs. Confidence score: 0.4"
