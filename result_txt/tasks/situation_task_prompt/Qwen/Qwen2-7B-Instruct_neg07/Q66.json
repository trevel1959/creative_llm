    "**Biodegradable Building Material Creation**: One creative idea is to develop a material using plant-based fibers and agricultural waste such as rice husks, wheat straw, or coconut coir, which can be bound together using natural adhesives like lime or clay. These materials are renewable, biodegradable, and have excellent thermal insulation properties. The structure of the house could be built using these panels that are prefabricated in factories to reduce on-site labor and time.",
    "**Water-Bound Construction**: Given the scarcity of natural materials, an innovative approach could involve constructing the house using water as the primary medium. This could be done by inflating large air-filled structures made from durable, waterproof fabrics (like neoprene or reinforced plastic) that can hold their shape under pressure. The house would be anchored into the ground with stakes or weights to prevent it from floating away during storms. This design would be particularly useful in coastal regions where natural materials might be scarce.",
    "**Geological Engineering**: In this scenario, one could utilize the earth itself as a building material. By digging tunnels and caverns beneath the surface, the excavated material could be used for various purposes within the house, such as insulation or decorative elements. The house would be built around these structures, using the earth's natural contours for support and protection. This approach would require careful planning and engineering to ensure structural integrity and safety.",
    "**Space-Frame Architecture**: Another creative solution would be to use lightweight but strong materials such as carbon fiber or Kevlar, which are synthetic but highly durable and can be sourced from recycling or repurposed materials. Space frames, consisting of triangular units that provide stability and strength while minimizing material usage, could be employed to construct the skeleton of the house. This would allow for large, open spaces with minimal material input, while still ensuring structural stability.",
    "**Hybrid Solar-Powered Structures**: With the disappearance of natural materials, one could focus on utilizing technology to create sustainable homes powered by renewable energy sources. For instance, a house could be built with large, retractable solar panels integrated into the roof and walls. These panels would be made from lightweight, yet strong materials such as aluminum or fiberglass. Additionally, incorporating green roofs and vertical gardens could help regulate temperature, provide shade, and improve air quality, all while requiring minimal construction of traditional materials."
