    "Develop a new grip system for the bowling ball that provides more control and stability. This could include ergonomic designs or interchangeable grip inserts to suit different hand sizes and preferences.",
    "Create a smart bowling ball that can track and adjust its speed and spin based on the player's skill level and the specific conditions of the lane. This could be achieved through sensors and algorithms that analyze the player's movements and the ball's trajectory to make adjustments in real-time.",
    "Design a bowling ball with a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope that can track the player's performance and provide real-time feedback on their technique and accuracy. This could be especially useful for players looking to improve their skills or for coaches to analyze their students' performance.",
    "Develop a bowling ball with a unique surface texture that allows for more consistent and predictable ball motion. This could be achieved through advanced manufacturing techniques or by using specially formulated materials that create a specific level of friction with the lane surface.",
    "Create a bowling ball with interchangeable coverstock or core materials that allow players to customize their ball for different lane conditions. This could include different surface textures or weights to suit different types of lanes or playing styles."
