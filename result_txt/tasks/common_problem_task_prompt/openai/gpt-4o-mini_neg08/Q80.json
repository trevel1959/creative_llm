    "**Sustainable Catering**: Finding a caterer that sources local, organic ingredients can be difficult, especially if the couple has specific dietary needs or preferences (like vegan or gluten-free). To overcome this, couples can work with caterers who are committed to sustainability, offering a seasonal menu that reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting food.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Traditional wedding dresses and suits often involve materials and processes that are not environmentally friendly. Couples may struggle to find sustainable fashion options. They could explore rental options, vintage shops, or designers who use sustainable fabrics and ethical manufacturing practices to ensure their attire aligns with their eco-conscious values.",
    "**Invitations and Paper Products**: The wedding industry often relies heavily on paper products, which can lead to significant waste. Couples might find it challenging to find eco-friendly alternatives. They could consider digital invitations, or if paper is necessary, use recycled paper or seed paper that guests can plant after the event, thereby turning waste into new life.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Guests traveling from various locations can contribute to a larger carbon footprint. Couples can mitigate this by organizing group transportation options, such as shuttles or carpools, and choosing a venue that is easily accessible by public transportation to encourage eco-friendly travel.",
    "**Decor and Floral Arrangements**: Many floral arrangements use imported flowers that have a high environmental cost. Couples may struggle to find local florists who can provide seasonal blooms. To address this, they can opt for potted plants that guests can take home as favors, or choose flowers that are in season and locally sourced to minimize their environmental impact."
