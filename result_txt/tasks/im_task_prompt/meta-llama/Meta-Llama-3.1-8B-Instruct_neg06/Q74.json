    "**Innovative Irrigation System**: Design a smart watering can that not only waters plants but also monitors soil moisture levels, temperature, and light exposure. This data can be transmitted to a mobile app, allowing users to optimize watering schedules and receive notifications when plants need attention. The can itself could have a built-in sensor that detects when the soil is dry, triggering a gentle vibration or sound cue to remind the user to water.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Watering Can with Built-in Filter**: Create a watering can with a built-in filter that removes impurities and contaminants from the water, making it safe for plants and the environment. This feature could be especially useful for urban gardeners who may not have access to clean water sources. The filter could be designed to be easily replaceable and recyclable.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Develop a watering can that harnesses solar energy to power a built-in pump, allowing users to water plants without the need for electricity. This design could be especially useful for outdoor gardens or for areas with limited access to power. The can could also have a built-in battery that stores excess energy for nighttime watering.",
    "**Watering Can with Integrated Nutrient Delivery System**: Design a watering can that not only waters plants but also delivers essential nutrients directly to the roots. This could be achieved through a built-in system of micro-irrigation tubes or a fertilizer-infused water reservoir. The can could also have a built-in sensor that detects the nutrient levels in the soil and adjusts the fertilizer delivery accordingly.",
    "**Watering Can with Built-in Composting Feature**: Create a watering can that doubles as a composting system, allowing users to turn kitchen scraps and other organic waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer for their plants. The can could have a built-in compartment for storing compostable materials, which would then be broken down by microorganisms and released as a nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer."
