    "Scent-sational Candle Bouquets - Create a line of candles that are shaped like flowers or bouquets. Each candle would be designed to release a unique scent as it burns, such as lavender for relaxation, citrus for invigoration, or floral for a romantic ambiance. The bouquets could be arranged in a vase or jar to create a beautiful centerpiece for any room.",
    "Candle Art - Develop a line of candles that are designed to be used as a canvas for art. Each candle would be created with a unique design, such as a cityscape, a landscape, or an abstract pattern. As the candle burns, the wax would reveal the hidden artwork, creating a unique piece of art for each customer.",
    "Candle Subscription Box - Create a subscription box service that delivers a new, unique candle to customers each month. Each candle would be handcrafted with a different fragrance and design, and the subscription box would include information about the candle's origins and ingredients. Customers could choose from different subscription plans, such as a monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly delivery.",
    "Wick-it App - Develop an app that allows customers to customize their candle-burning experience. The app would allow users to choose from different fragrances, wax colors, and wick sizes, and would provide instructions on how to properly burn their candle for the best results. The app could also include a community feature, where users could share their candle-burning experiences and recommendations with others.",
    "Candle-Making Workshops - Host workshops where customers can learn the art of candle-making. The workshops could include a hands-on experience where customers create their own candles using different fragrances, waxes, and wicks. The workshops could also cover the history of candle-making and the different techniques used in different cultures. Customers could take their creations home at the end of the workshop, or they could purchase them in the workshop's store."
