    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: A skateboard that allows users to customize their ride with interchangeable components. The deck, wheels, and trucks could be designed to be easily swapped out, enabling skaters to tailor their setup for different styles, such as cruising, trick riding, or downhill racing. This modular approach would also encourage creativity, as skaters could mix and match colors, materials, and designs to create a unique skateboard that reflects their personality.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard**: A skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. The deck could be designed using a combination of natural fibers and eco-resins, while the wheels could be made from biodegradable rubber. This skateboard would not only reduce environmental impact but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, the company could implement a take-back program where old skateboards are recycled into new products, promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Self-Balancing Electric Skateboard**: An electric skateboard equipped with self-balancing technology to make it easier for beginners to learn how to ride. Using sensors and gyroscopes, the skateboard would automatically adjust its balance to prevent falls, making it accessible to a wider audience. The electric motor would provide assistance for uphill rides or longer distances, and riders could control their speed using a handheld remote or by shifting their weight.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting System**: A skateboard featuring built-in LED lights that enhance visibility and safety during nighttime rides. The lights could be programmed to change colors or patterns based on the rider's speed or tricks performed. Additionally, the skateboard could have customizable light settings controlled via a mobile app, allowing users to create unique light shows while skating. This feature would not only make night riding safer but also add a fun, artistic element to the sport.",
    "**Skateboard with Built-in Storage**: A skateboard designed with hidden compartments for carrying essentials like a phone, wallet, or keys. The deck could feature a removable cover that reveals a secure storage space, making it convenient for riders who want to travel light without carrying a backpack. This skateboard could also include a small, waterproof compartment for electronics, ensuring that valuables stay safe and dry during rides."
