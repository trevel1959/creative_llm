    "**Steering Wheel Fitness Trainer**: This innovative idea involves integrating a steering wheel into a fitness training tool for drivers. The wheel would have adjustable resistance bands that can be adjusted according to the user's strength level. As they steer, they perform various exercises like arm curls, push-ups, or leg lifts, promoting full-body workout while driving. This encourages healthier habits for long-distance drivers.",
    "**Steering Wheel as a Virtual Reality Controller**: By transforming the steering wheel into a VR controller, it could provide an immersive gaming experience in vehicles. The wheel would include touch-sensitive buttons, motion sensors, and haptic feedback. Users could play complex VR games or even participate in virtual meetings while on the road, enhancing entertainment and connectivity during travel.",
    "**Smart Steering Wheel for Autonomous Vehicles**: A smart steering wheel that adapts to different driving styles and conditions. It would have sensors that detect driver engagement levels and adjust the driving assistance accordingly. For example, if the driver is fatigued, the wheel could gently guide the vehicle or suggest taking a break. It also includes an AI assistant capable of providing real-time navigation guidance, weather updates, and traffic information.",
    "**Steering Wheel-based Home Security System**: In the event of a car being parked outside, the steering wheel could serve as a security device. Equipped with motion detectors and a panic button, it could send alerts to the owner's smartphone if any unauthorized movements are detected. Additionally, it could lock the steering wheel remotely, making it extremely difficult for intruders to drive away with the vehicle.",
    "**Steering Wheel for Sign Language Translation**: This concept involves integrating a steering wheel with AI technology to translate sign language into spoken words. When a deaf driver communicates using sign language, the system translates their gestures into audible commands that can control the vehicle's functions such as turning on the lights, adjusting the radio, or opening windows. This promotes inclusivity and enhances the driving experience for the deaf community."
