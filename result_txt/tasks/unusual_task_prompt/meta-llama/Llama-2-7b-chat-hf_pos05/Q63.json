    "Artistic Candle Holders: Create a line of candle holders that double as works of art. Each piece could be made from a unique material, such as recycled glass, metal, or wood, and feature intricate designs or patterns. The candles could be customized to match the holder's theme, adding an extra touch of elegance to any room.",
    "Interactive Candle Experience: Develop a candle that responds to sound or movement. The candle could change color or scent based on the user's interactions, creating a multi-sensory experience. For example, a soft, calming scent could be released when the user is in a relaxed state, while a more invigorating scent could be triggered by a lively atmosphere.",
    "Customizable Candle Scent: Offer a line of candles with customizable scents, allowing customers to create their perfect blend. The candles could come in a variety of fragrances, such as floral, citrus, or spicy, and customers could mix and match different scents to create a unique scent. This would allow customers to personalize their candles and make them truly special.",
    "Candle Subscription Service: Create a subscription service that delivers a new, unique candle to customers each month. The candles could be made in collaboration with local artists or artisans, featuring unique designs and fragrances. This would provide customers with a constant stream of new and exciting candles to enjoy, while also supporting local creatives.",
    "Candle-Making Workshops: Host workshops where customers can learn the art of candle-making. Participants could learn various techniques, such as pouring, dipping, and layering, and create their own unique candles to take home. This would provide a fun and interactive experience for customers, while also fostering a sense of community and creativity."
