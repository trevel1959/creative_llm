    "Imagination and Creativity: Without the confines of a toy, kids would rely more on their imaginations and creativity. They would create their own games using their surroundings, like making sandcastles or snowmen.",
    "Social Skills: Children would develop better social skills as they would have to interact with their peers to make up new games or activities. This would help them learn communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.",
    "Storytelling: Children might resort to telling stories or engaging in make-believe play, which would help in developing their language and imagination.",
    "Nature Exploration: Without toys, kids would spend more time outdoors, exploring their surroundings and interacting with nature, which would foster a sense of curiosity and appreciation for the environment.",
    "Sensory Play: Children could use everyday objects, like objects found in the kitchen or garden, to create a play area. For example, they could use cups and bowls to create a small world or build a castle using cardboard boxes."
