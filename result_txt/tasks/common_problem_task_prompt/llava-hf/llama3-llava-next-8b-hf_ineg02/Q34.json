    "Ensuring the robot's safety is another crucial issue. Robots may be designed to perform tasks that could put them and others at risk, such as handling hazardous materials or working in high-traffic areas. Therefore, safety features must be incorporated into the design to prevent accidents or harm.",
    "The cost of creating a robot can be prohibitively expensive, especially for small businesses or individuals. The high cost of materials, programming, and development can make it difficult for these groups to afford a robot, limiting their ability to utilize the technology.",
    "Maintenance and repair of robots can be a challenge, as they are often complex machines with many moving parts. Ensuring that the robot can be easily serviced and repaired can be a major concern for those who invest in them.",
    "Ethical considerations must be taken into account when creating a robot. The use of robots for surveillance, control, or manipulation raises questions about the impact on human rights and privacy. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential consequences of using robots for these purposes.",
    "The integration of robots into society can also raise concerns about the impact on employment. As robots become more advanced and capable, they may be able to perform tasks that were previously the domain of humans, potentially leading to job loss and economic disruption."
