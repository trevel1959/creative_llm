    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular shoe system where different parts of the shoe can be swapped out or upgraded. This could include interchangeable soles for various activities (running, hiking, casual wear), removable insoles for different levels of cushioning, and customizable uppers that can be changed based on style or function. This would allow consumers to personalize their shoes and extend their lifespan by replacing only worn-out parts.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Design shoes with built-in sensors that track health metrics such as steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, and even foot pressure distribution. This data could sync with a smartphone app, providing users with insights into their physical activity, posture, and potential foot health issues. The app could also offer personalized workout suggestions or alert users if they are developing bad habits that could lead to injury.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop shoes made entirely from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics, organic cotton, and biodegradable components. Additionally, implement a take-back program where consumers can return their old shoes for recycling or repurposing, encouraging a circular economy and reducing waste. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the fashion industry.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature using nanotechnology that repels dirt and stains. The shoe's surface could be treated with a special coating that breaks down dirt and grime upon exposure to sunlight or through contact with water, keeping the shoes looking fresh and clean without the need for harsh chemicals or frequent washing.",
    "**Adaptive Fit System**: Create a shoe with an adaptive fit system that automatically adjusts to the wearerâ€™s foot shape and size. Using smart materials and micro-adjustment mechanisms, the shoes could tighten or loosen based on activity levels or foot swelling throughout the day. This would enhance comfort and support, making them ideal for various activities, from running to standing for long periods."
