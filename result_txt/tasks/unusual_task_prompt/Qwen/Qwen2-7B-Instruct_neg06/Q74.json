    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design**: You can create a unique wheelchair design that incorporates a steering wheel for better control and maneuverability. This idea is particularly useful for individuals who might have difficulty using traditional joystick controls. The steering wheel could be equipped with sensors that detect hand movements and provide feedback to the motorized wheelchair's movement system. This could offer a more intuitive and natural way of controlling the wheelchair, making it easier to navigate through various environments.",
    "**Steering Wheel Control for Home Appliances**: Integrate a steering wheel into home appliances like dishwashers or vacuum cleaners. This would allow for a more dynamic control experience, enabling users to steer these devices around obstacles or direct them towards specific areas in a room. For instance, a user could easily navigate a dishwasher to clean pots and pans of different sizes without having to physically push it manually.",
    "**Steering Wheel as a Gaming Controller**: Develop a gaming controller that uses a steering wheel instead of a traditional gamepad. This could offer a more immersive gaming experience, especially for racing games or simulators where precise control is essential. The wheel could include additional buttons and features like paddle shifters for more advanced gameplay, catering to both casual gamers and serious players.",
    "**Adaptable Steering Wheel for Outdoor Furniture**: Create a versatile outdoor furniture piece that includes a steering wheel mechanism. This could serve as a unique seating option in parks, gardens, or outdoor cafes. Users could use the steering wheel to adjust the angle of their seat, allowing them to customize their comfort level or even interact with nearby features, such as a small table or lighting fixtures.",
    "**Steering Wheel for Educational Toys**: Design educational toys for children that incorporate a steering wheel component. These toys could teach basic concepts like physics, engineering, and problem-solving through interactive play. For example, a toy car with a steering wheel could have challenges set up by parents or teachers that involve navigating the car through obstacles or completing tasks, thereby encouraging creativity and critical thinking skills."
