    "Education System Overhaul: The traditional education system would become obsolete, as it would no longer be necessary for individuals to spend years learning and honing their skills. Instead, education would focus on nurturing creativity and innovation, as well as teaching ethical and social values.",
    "Technological Advancements: With a large number of geniuses, there would be rapid advancements in technology, medicine, and science. This would lead to the development of new technologies and innovations that would revolutionize the world, solving some of the most pressing problems facing humanity.",
    "Cultural Shift: The values and norms of society would change as well. Geniuses would be highly respected and celebrated, and those who were not as intelligent would be marginalized. This could lead to a new form of social hierarchy, with geniuses at the top and everyone else striving to be like them.",
    "Overwhelmed Governments: Governments would struggle to keep up with the demands of a society full of geniuses. The old systems of governance would become outdated, and new forms of governance would need to be developed to accommodate the needs of a highly intelligent population.",
    "Ethical and Moral Dilemmas: The existence of a large number of geniuses would raise ethical and moral questions about the distribution of resources and opportunities. For example, should everyone have equal access to resources and opportunities, or should those who are more intelligent be given more opportunities?"
