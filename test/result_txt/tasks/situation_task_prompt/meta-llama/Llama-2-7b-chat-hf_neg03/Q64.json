    "Memory Jars: Create a series of jars, each representing a different time period. Fill each jar with memories, emotions, and sensory experiences from that time. For instance, a jar for a wedding might contain a wedding dress, a piece of wedding cake, and a few rose petals. When people want to remember a particular event or person, they can pick a jar that feels most relevant and open it to relive the memories within.",
    "Memory Books: Create a collection of books that represent different eras and events. Each book would be filled with images, stories, and ephemera from that time period. For example, a book for a childhood might include illustrations of favorite toys, stories of family vacations, and ticket stubs from amusement parks. People could flip through the books to recall memories and experiences from different periods of their lives.",
    "Time Capsules: Bury time capsules at different locations around the world, each containing objects and artifacts that represent the current time period. The capsules could be opened at specific intervals, such as every decade or century, to reveal what life was like during those times. People could participate by contributing items they think will be representative of their current era, such as a smartphone or a political pamphlet.",
    "Memory Clouds: Create a network of virtual clouds that represent different memories and experiences. People could upload their memories to the clouds, which would take the form of wispy, shimmering clouds that can be accessed through virtual reality or augmented reality technology. As people interact with the clouds, they could unlock more memories and experiences, creating a constantly evolving network of shared memories.",
    "Memory Mirrors: Develop a series of mirrors that display memories and events from the past. Each mirror would be connected to a different time period, and when people look into the mirror, they would see images and scenes from that time period. For instance, a mirror for a childhood might display images of a person's favorite toys and games, while a mirror for a historical event might display images of people and places from that time. The mirrors could be interactive, allowing people to zoom in and out, or change the angle of the mirror to view different aspects of the past."
