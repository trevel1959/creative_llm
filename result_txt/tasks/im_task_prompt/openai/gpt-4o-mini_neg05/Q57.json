    "**Multi-Function Button Customization**: Design a mouse with customizable buttons that can change functions based on the application in use. For example, when using a graphic design program, the side buttons could be programmed for quick access to tools like the brush or eraser, while in a web browser, they could switch to navigation functions like back and forward. This would streamline workflows and enhance productivity, making the mouse an indispensable tool for various tasks.",
    "**Built-in AI Assistant**: Incorporate a voice-activated AI assistant directly into the mouse. This assistant could help users with tasks such as setting reminders, searching for information, or controlling smart home devices without needing to touch the keyboard or screen. A small speaker and microphone would allow for seamless interaction, turning the mouse into a central hub for multitasking.",
    "**Wireless Charging Dock**: Develop a sleek, aesthetically pleasing wireless charging dock that not only charges the mouse but also serves as a stylish desk organizer. The dock could include compartments for storing pens, notepads, or other small office supplies, keeping the workspace tidy. Additionally, the dock could feature a built-in USB hub for connecting other peripherals, providing an all-in-one solution for a clutter-free desk.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Feedback**: Equip the mouse with customizable RGB lighting that changes based on user activity or mood. For instance, the lighting could shift to a calming blue when working on tasks, or to a vibrant red during gaming sessions. Furthermore, haptic feedback could be integrated, providing tactile responses when performing certain actions (like clicking or scrolling), enhancing the user experience by adding a sensory layer to interactions.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Cooling Technology**: Innovate an ergonomic mouse design that incorporates cooling technology. This could involve a breathable material that allows air circulation to prevent overheating during prolonged use. Additionally, the mouse could feature temperature sensors that adjust the surface temperature, ensuring that it remains comfortable to the touch, particularly for users who experience hand sweating during intense work or gaming sessions."
