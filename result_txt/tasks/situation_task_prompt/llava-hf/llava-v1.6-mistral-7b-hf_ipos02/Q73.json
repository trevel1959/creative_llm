    "**Shade Pods**: Develop a technology that allows for the creation of temporary shade pods. These pods would be portable, and they could be deployed in areas where trees are scarce. They would be made of lightweight materials and could be powered by solar energy, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for shade.",
    "**Shade Canopies**: Design a network of elevated canopies that can be deployed in areas where trees are missing. These canopies would be made of durable, lightweight materials and could be adjusted to provide shade at different angles. They would be connected to a central control system, allowing for easy deployment and maintenance.",
    "**Shade Drones**: Develop a fleet of drones that can be programmed to fly over areas where trees are missing and provide shade. The drones would be equipped with large, adjustable umbrellas that could be controlled remotely. They would be designed to be energy-efficient and could be powered by a combination of solar and battery power.",
    "**Shade Mesh**: Create a new type of fabric that can be used to create shade. This fabric would be lightweight, breathable, and able to block out sunlight. It could be used to create shade tents or canopies, providing a comfortable and portable solution for shade.",
    "**Shade Gardens**: Design a new type of garden that can be planted in areas where trees are missing. These gardens would be made up of a variety of plants and shrubs that can provide natural shade. The plants would be chosen for their ability to grow quickly and provide dense shade."
