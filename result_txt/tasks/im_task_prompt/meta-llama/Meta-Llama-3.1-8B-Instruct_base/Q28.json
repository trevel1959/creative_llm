    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Safety Features**:    Develop a smart bicycle helmet with integrated safety features such as collision detection, GPS tracking, and real-time weather updates. The helmet could also include a built-in air quality sensor, alerting the rider to poor air quality conditions. Additionally, the helmet could have a built-in phone charger and a small storage compartment for small items like keys or snacks. The helmet's design could be sleek and aerodynamic, with a focus on comfort and visibility.",
    "**Modular Helmet System**:    Design a modular helmet system that allows riders to customize and upgrade their helmet as needed. The system could consist of interchangeable components such as different shell materials, visors, and padding systems. This would enable riders to choose the perfect combination of features for their specific riding style and preferences. The modular design would also make it easier to repair and replace individual components, reducing waste and extending the life of the helmet.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Helmet Made from Recycled Materials**:    Create a bicycle helmet made from 100% recycled materials, reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impact of traditional helmet production. The helmet could be made from a combination of recycled plastics, bioplastics, and natural fibers. The design could incorporate a unique texture and pattern that showcases the recycled materials, making the helmet a statement piece for environmentally conscious riders.",
    "**Helmets with Integrated Communication Systems**:    Develop helmets with integrated communication systems, allowing riders to stay connected with friends, family, and emergency services while on the go. The system could include features such as voice assistants, Bluetooth connectivity, and GPS tracking. The helmets could also have a built-in speaker and microphone, enabling riders to take hands-free calls and listen to music or podcasts.",
    "**Helmets with Integrated Lighting and Visibility**:    Design helmets with integrated lighting and visibility features, making riders more visible to other road users, especially in low-light conditions. The helmet could include LED lights, reflective strips, or even a built-in headlamp. The design could also incorporate a unique pattern or texture that enhances visibility, making the rider more noticeable to drivers and pedestrians. The helmet could also have a built-in sensor that detects approaching vehicles and alerts the rider to potential hazards.
