    "Fashion designer: I would become a fashion designer who creates one-of-a-kind, color-changing garments that transform to match the wearer's mood or the environment. For example, a dress could transition between different hues or patterns throughout the day, based on the light or the wearer's emotions.",
    "Mood-controlled color therapist: I would develop a system or app that uses my color-changing ability to help people manage their emotions or stress.

    "Inspirational artist performance: I would become a live performance artist, using my color-changing abilities to create an evocative and interactive visual experience for audiences. My performance would incorporate choreography, music, and my color-changing abilities to captivate the senses and inspire emotions.",
    "Environmental awareness campaigner: Utilizing my color-changing abilities, I would create a series of performances or installations that represent different aspects of the environment and its climate. These installations would aim to raise awareness and inspire action for environmental conservation.",
    "Accessible art form: I would develop a new accessible art form, using my color-changing abilities to create three-dimensional, ever-changing sculptures that anyone could touch or interact with. This would create a more inclusive and dynamic art experience for all."
