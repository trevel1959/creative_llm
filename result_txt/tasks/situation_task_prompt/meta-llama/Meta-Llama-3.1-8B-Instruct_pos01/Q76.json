    "**Optical Signaling**: Develop a system where people use mirrors and flashlights to send Morse code messages through the air. This method is reminiscent of old-timey communication methods and would require a combination of physical effort and attention to detail. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Kite-Based Communication**: Design a network of kites equipped with tiny speakers and microphones that can transmit audio messages over long distances. This method would rely on wind patterns and kite design to ensure reliable communication. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Chemical Signaling**: Create a system where people use colored powders or chemicals to send encoded messages through the air. This method would require a standardized color code and a way to detect the chemicals. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Whistle Network**: Develop a system where people use different whistle patterns to communicate over long distances. This method would rely on a standardized whistle code and a way to detect the whistles. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Bird-Based Messaging**: Train a network of carrier birds to carry small notes or messages between people. This method would require a system of bird training and a way to ensure the messages are delivered accurately. (Confidence score: 0.9) [/INST] "
