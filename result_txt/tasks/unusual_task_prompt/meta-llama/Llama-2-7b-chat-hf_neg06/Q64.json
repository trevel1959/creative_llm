    "Smart Thermos: Develop a thermos that can monitor and adjust its temperature in real-time to keep the contents at the desired temperature. This thermos can be controlled through an app on your smartphone, allowing you to adjust the temperature from anywhere. It can also detect when the temperature of the contents has deviated from the set point and automatically adjust to maintain the desired temperature.",
    "Thermos with Built-In Coffee Grinder: Incorporate a built-in coffee grinder into the thermos to allow users to grind their coffee beans directly inside the thermos. This would eliminate the need for a separate coffee grinder and make the process of preparing coffee more convenient. The grinder could be powered by a small motor or through manual operation.",
    "Thermos with a Built-In Warming Tray: Develop a thermos with a built-in warming tray that can keep hot liquids at the desired temperature for a longer period. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy hot beverages but don't have access to a microwave or stove. The warming tray could be powered by a small heating element or through the use of a thermoelectric material.",
    "Thermos with a Smart Lid: Design a thermos with a smart lid that can detect when the contents have been exposed to extreme temperatures, such as freezing or overheating. The lid could be equipped with sensors that can detect changes in temperature and automatically adjust the thermos's insulation to maintain the desired temperature.",
    "Thermos with a Built-In Water Filter: Incorporate a built-in water filter into the thermos to purify water on the go. This would be particularly useful for people who enjoy hiking or traveling in areas where access to clean water is limited. The filter could be made of a special material that can remove impurities and bacteria from water, making it safe to drink."
