    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a juicer with a built-in self-cleaning feature. After juicing, users can simply add water and a cleaning solution, press a button, and the juicer will automatically clean itself using high-pressure jets and spinning brushes. This would save time and effort, making juicing a more appealing daily habit.",
    "**Modular Design for Easy Storage**: Develop a juicer with a modular design that allows users to easily detach and store different parts. This could include collapsible components or sections that snap together to create a compact form for easy storage. The modular parts could also be interchangeable, allowing users to customize their juicing experience based on their needs (e.g., citrus juicing, smoothie blending).",
    "**Juice Preservation System**: Introduce a vacuum-sealing feature that allows users to store freshly made juice for longer periods without losing nutrients. After juicing, the machine could automatically seal the juice in a special container, removing air to prevent oxidation. This would be ideal for people who want to make juice in bulk for the week.",
    "**Personalized Juicing Profiles**: Implement a feature that allows users to create personalized profiles based on their health goals, dietary restrictions, and taste preferences. The juicer could then suggest recipes tailored to their profiles, track their juicing habits, and even recommend supplements or additional ingredients to enhance their juice.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Upgrade the juicer with an interactive touchscreen that displays step-by-step instructions for different juicing processes. The interface could include videos, tips for selecting ripe produce, and even a fun game to encourage kids to get involved in juicing. The touchscreen could also feature a calendar for meal prep planning."
