Studies suggest that sleep plays a crucial role in mental health, cognitive function, and physical recovery. Thus, a society without sleep could face increased rates of mental disorders, cognitive decline, and physical health issues. There would be a need for medical research and interventions to address these challenges.",
    "**Revolution in Technology**: The absence of sleep might spur technological advancements aimed at maintaining human performance levels without rest. This could include the development of artificial sleep substitutes, bioengineering enhancements to improve human endurance, or advanced automation to manage tasks that currently require human oversight. Such innovations could redefine what it means to be human in a post-sleep world."
