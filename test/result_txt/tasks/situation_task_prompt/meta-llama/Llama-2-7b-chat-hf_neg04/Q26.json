    "Create a Suunto: A Suunto is a traditional navigation tool used by sailors and travelers. Create a wearable device that combines the functions of a compass, barometer, and altimeter with GPS technology. The Suunto would provide users with real-time weather forecasts, altitude readings, and directional information, even without a map or navigation system.",
    "Build a Solar-Powered Drone: Develop a solar-powered drone equipped with GPS and imaging technology. The drone could fly over an area, gathering data on terrain features and mapping the environment. Users could then use the drone's data to navigate without relying on maps or navigation systems.",
    "Develop a Bio-Inspired Navigation System: Study the navigation systems of animals, such as ants, bees, and birds, to develop a bio-inspired navigation system. This system would use a combination of chemical signals, magnetic fields, and visual cues to help users navigate without relying on maps or navigation systems.",
    "Create a Low-Tech Navigation App: Develop an app that uses the user's smartphone's sensors and algorithms to create a low-tech navigation system. The app could use the phone's GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope to determine the user's location and orientation, even without a map or navigation system.",
    "Design a Geometric Navigation System: Develop a navigation system based on geometric shapes and patterns. Users could use a series of interconnected triangles, circles, or other shapes to navigate through unfamiliar terrain. The system could be used in conjunction with a map or without one, providing a simple and intuitive way to navigate."
