    "Use a drone: If all roads become impassable, I would use a drone to fly over the obstacles and find an alternate route. The drone could be equipped with a camera, GPS, and other sensors to help navigate through the terrain.",
    "Build a raft: If the roads are flooded or submerged, I would build a raft using available materials such as branches, leaves, and other natural materials. This would allow me to travel over water and avoid the impassable roads.",
    "Use a helicopter: If the roads are too dangerous or impassable, I would use a helicopter to fly over the obstacles and reach my destination. The helicopter could be equipped with a searchlight and other safety features to ensure a safe flight.",
    "Hike: If the roads are closed or impassable, I would hike to my destination. This would allow me to explore alternative routes and enjoy the beauty of nature along the way.",
    "Use a bicycle: If the roads are too narrow or winding, I would use a bicycle to travel. This would allow me to navigate through the terrain more easily and avoid the obstacles on the road."
