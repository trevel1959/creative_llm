    "**Eco-Driving Mode with Feedback**: Implement an advanced eco-driving mode that not only encourages fuel-efficient driving habits but also provides real-time feedback to the driver. This system could analyze driving patterns and offer tips through a mobile app or the car's display, rewarding drivers with points for eco-friendly driving that can be redeemed for discounts on fuel or car maintenance services.",
    "**Augmented Reality Heads-Up Display (AR HUD)**: Upgrade the traditional heads-up display with augmented reality features that project navigation instructions, speed limits, and hazard alerts directly onto the windshield. This would allow drivers to keep their eyes on the road while receiving critical information, improving safety and enhancing the driving experience.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Develop a car that includes an integrated health monitoring system that tracks the driver’s vital signs, such as heart rate and stress levels. If the system detects signs of fatigue or distress, it could suggest taking a break or automatically guide the vehicle to the nearest rest area or hospital. This feature would prioritize driver safety and promote overall well-being.",
    "**Biodegradable Interior Materials**: Replace traditional interior materials with biodegradable alternatives that reduce the car’s environmental footprint. For instance, using plant-based plastics and natural fibers for seats and dashboard components would not only make the car more sustainable but also provide a unique aesthetic and feel. This innovation could appeal to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Dynamic Soundscaping**: Introduce a dynamic sound system that creates a personalized audio environment within the car. By using sound waves to create a calming or invigorating atmosphere, the system could help reduce road rage and enhance the driving experience. For example, it could play soothing sounds during traffic jams and energizing music on open highways."
