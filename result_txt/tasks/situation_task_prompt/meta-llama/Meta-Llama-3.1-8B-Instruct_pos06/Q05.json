    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns with Advanced Battery Life**: Develop a line of solar-powered lanterns with long-lasting batteries that can store energy for up to 72 hours. These lanterns would be designed to provide a reliable and sustainable source of light during the day, even if the sun doesn't rise. The lanterns could be equipped with advanced features such as adjustable brightness, color temperature, and a built-in USB port for charging small devices.",
    "**Light-Emitting Window Films**: Create a line of light-emitting window films that can be applied to windows to provide a soft, ambient glow during the day. These films would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery pack that can be charged during the night or through a USB connection. The films would be designed to mimic the natural light of the sun, providing a calming and energizing effect.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Develop a line of bioluminescent plants that can absorb and store energy from the sun during the day, releasing a soft, ethereal glow during the night. These plants would be designed to thrive in a variety of environments and could be used to create a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "**Holographic Light Projectors**: Create a line of holographic light projectors that can project a realistic and immersive image of the sun onto the environment, providing a sense of daylight even if the sun doesn't rise. These projectors would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery pack and could be controlled remotely using a smartphone app.",
    "**Self-Sustaining LED Light Panels**: Develop a line of self-sustaining LED light panels that can harness energy from the environment, such as kinetic energy from wind or vibrations, to power a reliable and efficient light source. These panels would be designed to be durable and long-lasting, providing a sustainable solution for lighting needs during the day."
