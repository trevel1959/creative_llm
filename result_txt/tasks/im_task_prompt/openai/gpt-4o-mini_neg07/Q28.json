    "**Modular Helmet Design**: Create a helmet with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize the look and functionality. For instance, riders could switch out the outer shell for different colors or patterns, or add features like built-in lights, visors, or even a detachable sunshade. This would not only appeal to personal style but also make the helmet more versatile for various riding conditions.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Develop a helmet that features built-in Bluetooth connectivity and speakers, allowing riders to take calls, listen to music, or communicate with fellow cyclists. This could also include a voice-activated assistant that helps with navigation and safety alerts, making it easier to stay connected while riding.",
    "**Adaptive Impact Technology**: Incorporate materials that adapt to the level of impact. For instance, a helmet could feature a smart foam that becomes more rigid upon impact but remains soft during regular use. This would enhance safety without compromising comfort, as the helmet would adjust its protective capabilities based on the situation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning and Anti-Microbial Interior**: Use advanced materials that resist dirt and bacteria, making the interior of the helmet self-cleaning. This could involve a special coating that breaks down grime and odors, ensuring that the helmet remains hygienic and pleasant to wear, especially for those who use it frequently.",
    "**Weather-Responsive Features**: Design a helmet that adjusts its ventilation based on the weather conditions. For example, it could have vents that automatically close in rainy or cold weather to keep the rider warm and dry, while opening up during hot weather to enhance airflow. This would improve comfort and safety in varying climates."
