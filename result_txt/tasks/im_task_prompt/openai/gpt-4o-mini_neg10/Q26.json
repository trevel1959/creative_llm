    "**Compacting Trash Can**: Design a trash can that has a built-in compactor. This would allow users to compress their trash, maximizing space and reducing the frequency of emptying the can. It could have a foot pedal for easy operation, and an indicator light to signal when the trash is compacted to its maximum capacity.",
    "**Odor-Controlled Trash Can**: Create a trash can that utilizes a combination of charcoal filters and essential oil diffusers to combat unpleasant odors. The can could have a compartment for placing the filters and essential oils, ensuring that even the smelliest of waste can be contained without stinking up the kitchen or living area.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can**: Develop a trash can that interacts with users through a mobile app. The app could provide reminders for trash collection days, offer tips on reducing waste, and even gamify recycling by allowing users to earn points for correctly sorting their trash. This could encourage more environmentally friendly habits and make waste management more engaging.",
    "**Multi-Functional Trash Can**: Design a trash can that doubles as a storage unit for cleaning supplies or gardening tools. It could feature compartments for holding items like trash bags, gloves, and other cleaning essentials, keeping everything organized and in one place. This would make cleaning and waste disposal more efficient and reduce clutter.",
    "**Artistic Trash Can**: Collaborate with local artists to create a series of aesthetically pleasing trash cans that can be installed in public spaces. Each can could feature unique artwork, transforming a mundane object into a piece of art. This would not only beautify the environment but also encourage people to use them more, reducing littering."
