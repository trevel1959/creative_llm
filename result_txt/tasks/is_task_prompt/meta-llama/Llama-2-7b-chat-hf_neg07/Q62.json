    "\"Sea-Legs\" - A Starfish-Inspired Exoskeleton for Amputees: Inspired by the starfish's ability to move on land, imagine a revolutionary exoskeleton designed for individuals with lower-limb amputations. The \"Sea-Legs\" device would provide support and mobility for those who have lost their legs, allowing them to walk, run, and engage in activities they thought were impossible. The exoskeleton would be lightweight, flexible, and designed to mimic the natural movement of the human leg, providing a more natural gait and greater independence for amputees.",
    "Land-Dwelling Starfish Farms: Take the starfish's ability to move on land to the next level by creating large-scale farms where these creatures can be raised and harvested for their meat, which is high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. The farms could be built on land reclaimed from the sea, providing a sustainable source of food while also helping to restore damaged ecosystems. The starfish could be raised in specially designed tanks or enclosures, allowing for maximum growth and efficiency.",
    "Starfish-Inspired Robotics: The starfish's ability to move and maneuver in complex environments could inspire the development of new robotics technology. By studying the starfish's body structure and movement patterns, engineers could create robots that can navigate through tight spaces, climb walls and ceilings, and perform complex tasks with ease. This technology could have applications in search and rescue missions, environmental monitoring, and even space exploration.",
    "Underwater Hotels Inspired by Starfish: Imagine a luxury hotel that is completely submerged in the ocean, with rooms and suites designed to resemble the starfish's radially symmetrical body. The hotel could be built using sustainable materials and energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, to minimize its impact on the marine environment. Guests could enjoy a range of activities, including scuba diving, snorkeling, and simply observing the vibrant marine life that surrounds the hotel.",
