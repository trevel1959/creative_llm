    "**Ethical Concerns:** The experiment might involve animals or human subjects, and if not conducted ethically, it could result in harm to the subjects or violate guidelines set by research institutions or regulatory bodies. Ensuring proper experimental design, animal welfare standards, and informed consent are met is crucial to maintain the credibility and integrity of the research.",
    "**Environmental Impact:** Large-scale scientific experiments can have a substantial impact on the environment. It might lead to pollution, contamination of water or soil, or damage to ecosystems. Implementing sustainable practices to minimize the environmental impact is essential to avoid irreparable harm to the environment.",
    "**Safety Issues:** Handling various chemicals, equipment, and materials in a large-scale experiment can pose risk to the safety of researchers and the general public. Ensuring proper safety protocols are followed, such as the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and adherence to standard operating procedures, can prevent accidents and injuries.",
    "**Data Integrity:** The reliability and validity of the research data are essential for scientific experiments. Any errors, manipulation, or data fabrication can lead to false conclusions and discredit the research. Maintaining airtight data management protocols, such as double-blinding and data sharing, can help to ensure data integrity.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance:** Large-scale scientific experiments are often subject to regulatory oversight by agencies such as the FDA, EPA, or Institutional Review Boards. Compliance with these regulations is mandatory to avoid legal consequences, reputational damage, and delays in the research timeline."
