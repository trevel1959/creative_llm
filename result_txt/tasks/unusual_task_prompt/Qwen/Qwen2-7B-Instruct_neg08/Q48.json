    "**DIY Sunglasses**: Cut out the center of a CD and attach it to a pair of sunglasses frames. The CD acts as an adjustable lens that can block out sunlight, offering a fun, homemade solution for sun protection.",
    "**Rainbow Maker**: Attach multiple CDs around a light source (like a string of Christmas lights) so that light passes through them and creates a rainbow effect. This can be used as a decorative item during parties or events.",
    "**Sound Amplifier**: Place a small speaker inside an old CD holder and use it to amplify sound from your phone or MP3 player. The reflective properties of the CD can help focus and project sound outward, making it louder than without the CD.",
    "**Emergency Solar Charger**: Drill small holes in the CD and fill them with conductive material like copper tape. Attach solar cells or batteries to the back and use the holes to connect them. The CD can then act as a makeshift solar panel, providing power to small electronic devices.",
    "**Crafting Medium**: Crush CDs into fine powder and mix them with glue to create a strong adhesive for crafting projects. This can be used to add texture to jewelry, mixed media art, or even as a base for creating custom embellishments."
