    "**Gravitational Energy**: This type of energy would be harnessed from the gravitational pull between celestial bodies, such as planets and stars. By building gravitational power plants on the outskirts of our solar system, we could tap into this vast, untapped energy source. Gravitational Energy would provide a reliable, low-impact form of energy that would not interfere with our planet's natural rotation.",
    "**Neuro Energy**: This energy would be generated by the human brain's electrical activity. Neuro Energy would involve the development of technology to capture and convert the brain's neural signals into usable power. This would create a new, human-centered energy source that could be used for medical treatments, personal devices, and even space exploration.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Energy**: This energy would be produced by genetically engineered organisms that emit light. Bio-Luminescent Energy could be used to power homes, cities, and even vehicles, eliminating the need for traditional lighting and reducing our carbon footprint.",
    "**Quantum Flux Energy**: This energy would be derived from the inherent randomness of quantum systems. By tapping into the quantum flux, we could generate power without the need for energy-intensive cooling systems, making it a more efficient and eco-friendly option.",
    "**Magnetic Resonance Energy**: This energy would be generated by the resonance of magnetic fields in superconducting materials. Magnetic Resonance Energy would have the advantage of being highly efficient, clean, and capable of being stored and transmitted over long distances."
