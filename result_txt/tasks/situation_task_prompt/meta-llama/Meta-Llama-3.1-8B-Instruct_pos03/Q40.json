    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a backpack with built-in solar panels that can harness energy from the sun. The backpack would have a rechargeable battery pack that can store excess energy for nighttime use or during periods of low sunlight. The backpack would also have a built-in USB port and a power bank to charge devices on the go. This innovative solution would allow people to stay connected and powered up even when batteries are no longer an option.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop shoes with built-in kinetic energy harvesting technology that captures the energy generated by every step taken. This energy would be stored in a rechargeable battery pack, which could power small devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, or even smartphones. The shoes would have a sleek and stylish design, making them a fashionable and functional solution for everyday use.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Create a device that can extract water from the air, even in arid environments, and use it to generate electricity through a process called electrochemical water splitting. This device would be powered by a small wind turbine or a solar panel, and would provide a sustainable source of energy and water for communities in need.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Lighting**: Develop a bio-luminescent lighting system that uses genetically engineered microorganisms to produce light. These microorganisms would be placed in a specially designed container, and would be powered by a small amount of nutrients and water. The bio-luminescent light would be a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional lighting sources, and could be used to power devices such as flashlights or lanterns.",
    "**Vibration-Based Energy Harvesting**: Design a device that can harness energy from vibrations in the environment, such as those generated by traffic or industrial machinery. This energy would be stored in a rechargeable battery pack, which could power small devices such as sensors, alarms, or even smartphones. The device would be compact and easy to install, making it a practical solution for a wide range of applications.
