    "**Eco-Wedding Reuse and Repurpose**: Design a wedding that incorporates reused and repurposed materials to minimize waste. For example, use old pallets to create the aisle runner, repurpose glass bottles as vases, and turn old t-shirts into decorative banners. This theme can be carried throughout the wedding, from the invitations to the decorations, and even the wedding attire.",
    "**Zero-Waste Wedding**: Plan a zero-waste wedding by implementing sustainable practices throughout the event. This can include composting food waste, using biodegradable plates and cutlery, and encouraging guests to bring reusable containers for take-home leftovers. The wedding party can also wear attire made from sustainable materials, such as recycled fabrics or organic cotton.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Plan a wedding that minimizes carbon footprint by encouraging sustainable transportation methods. This can include renting electric or hybrid vehicles for the wedding party, offering carpooling incentives to guests, and providing a shuttle service for those who need it. The wedding party can also consider walking or biking to the ceremony.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Food and Beverages**: Focus on serving locally sourced, organic, and seasonal food and beverages to reduce the carbon footprint of the wedding. Consider hiring a catering service that uses compostable or biodegradable packaging, and offer plant-based options to reduce food waste. The wedding party can also consider a \"bring your own\" (BYO) policy for wine and other beverages.",
    "**Green Wedding Venue**: Choose a wedding venue that is already eco-friendly, such as a park or a community garden. Consider renting a venue that has implemented sustainable practices, such as solar panels or rainwater harvesting systems. The wedding party can also consider hosting a morning or brunch wedding to reduce energy consumption and waste."
