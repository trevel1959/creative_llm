    "A virtual reality headset that uses AI to simulate a world where users can interact with mathematical concepts in a tangible way. For example, users can manipulate 3D shapes to understand geometric transformations, or practice solving equations by navigating through a virtual maze. The headset could also include interactive lessons and games to make learning math more engaging and fun. Confidence: 0.9",
    "A social platform where users can share and discuss their math problems and solutions with others. The platform could include features such as a \"math community\" where users can ask questions and get feedback from peers, a \"math library\" where users can share and download solved problems, and a \"math tournament\" where users can compete to solve math problems quickly and accurately. Confidence: 0.8",
    "A mobile app that uses augmented reality to visualize mathematical concepts in the real world. For example, users can point their camera at a building and see its geometric shapes and dimensions overlaid on top of the real image, or use the app to measure distances and angles in their surroundings. Confidence: 0.9",
    "A board game that teaches mathematical concepts through interactive gameplay. For example, players could roll dice to generate math problems, and then use game pieces to solve them on a game board. The game could also include different levels of difficulty and themes, such as algebra or geometry. Confidence: 0.8",
    "A chatbot that uses natural language processing to help users understand and solve math problems. The chatbot could be integrated into a website or mobile app, and could provide step-by-step solutions to math problems, as well as explanations and examples to help users understand the underlying concepts. Confidence: 0.9"
