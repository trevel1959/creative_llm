    "**Solar Window Panels**: Install transparent solar panels on windows that convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity can be used to power a thermoelectric generator, which in turn can heat or cool the interior of the house. The thermoelectric generator would work by converting the temperature difference between the interior and exterior of the house into electricity. This electricity can then be used to power a heat pump or an air conditioner, thus maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling System**: Develop an evaporative cooling system that utilizes a combination of ventilation and evaporation to cool the interior of the house. This system would work by drawing in hot air from the exterior and passing it through a wet membrane. As the hot air passes through the membrane, the water would evaporate, cooling the air in the process. The cooled air would then be circulated throughout the house, providing a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: Use phase change materials (PCMs) to regulate indoor temperature. PCMs are materials that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. These materials can be integrated into building insulation, walls, or even clothing to absorb excess heat during the day and release it at night, maintaining a stable indoor temperature.",
    "**Green Roof**: Implement a green roof on the house that incorporates plants, soil, and other vegetation. The plants would absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, while the soil would help to insulate the house. The vegetation would also provide shade, reducing the amount of direct sunlight that enters the house, thus reducing the need for heating and cooling.",
    "**Passive House Design**: Design the house as a passive house, which is a building that is designed to be energy-efficient and self-sustaining. A passive house would be built with materials that provide excellent insulation, and the design would incorporate features such as large windows, overhangs, and a well-insulated roof to minimize heat gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter. The house would also be designed to maximize natural ventilation, using cross-ventilation and other techniques to cool the interior during the summer and warm it during the winter."
