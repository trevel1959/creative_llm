    "Environmental Impact: The formation of a new continent could have a profound impact on the global climate. The landmass would absorb and reflect sunlight differently, potentially altering weather patterns and ocean currents. This could lead to changes in global temperature, precipitation, and ocean levels, affecting ecosystems and agriculture worldwide.",
    "Biodiversity: The new continent could become a haven for new species to evolve, leading to increased biodiversity. This could also lead to the spread of existing species across the globe, potentially causing invasive species to become even more widespread.",
    "Economic Boom: The new continent could become a hotspot for economic activity, attracting businesses and investors looking to exploit its resources. This could lead to a boom in trade, commerce, and economic development, creating new opportunities for growth and prosperity.",
    "Cultural Exchange: The new continent could become a hub for cultural exchange, as people from different countries and cultures migrate to the new land. This could lead to the formation of new languages, religions, and artistic expressions, enriching global culture.",
    "Infrastructure Development: The new continent would require significant infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, ports, and utilities. This could create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth, but it could also have negative environmental impacts."
