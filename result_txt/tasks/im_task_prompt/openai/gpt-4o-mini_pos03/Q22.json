    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight with Power Bank Functionality**: Design a flashlight that features a solar panel on its surface, allowing it to recharge during the day. Additionally, this flashlight would have a built-in power bank capability, enabling users to charge their smartphones or other devices in emergencies. This dual-function design would be particularly beneficial for campers, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Modular Flashlight with Interchangeable Heads**: Develop a flashlight with a modular design that allows users to swap out different heads for various lighting needs. Options could include a spotlight for long-distance visibility, a wide-angle head for illuminating larger areas, or even a strobe head for signaling emergencies. This versatility would cater to different activities, from camping to search-and-rescue operations.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in Bluetooth Speaker**: Combine a flashlight with a portable Bluetooth speaker, enabling users to enjoy music or podcasts while they illuminate their surroundings. This could be particularly appealing for outdoor gatherings or camping trips, where users can enjoy both light and sound without needing to carry multiple devices.",
    "**Personal Safety Flashlight with SOS Features**: Create a flashlight designed specifically for personal safety, featuring a built-in alarm and an SOS signaling mode. When activated, the flashlight would emit a loud siren and flash an SOS pattern (three short flashes, three long flashes, three short flashes) to alert nearby individuals in case of emergencies. This feature would provide an added layer of security for users walking alone at night.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Flashlight with Grip Enhancements**: Focus on improving the physical design of the flashlight to enhance user comfort and grip. This could include a rubberized, non-slip surface, a contoured shape that fits comfortably in the hand, and a weight distribution that reduces fatigue during extended use. An ergonomic design would make the flashlight more user-friendly, especially for those using it for long periods."
