    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification**: To address the issue of drinking water, I would construct a solar still using clear plastic sheets and shallow containers. By digging a small hole in the sand, placing a container in the center, and covering it with the plastic sheet, I could create a condensation effect. As the sun heats the water, it would evaporate, condense on the plastic, and drip into the container, providing fresh drinking water. This method is sustainable and requires minimal resources.",
    "**Fishing with a Twist**: Instead of traditional fishing methods, I would create a \"fish trap\" using bamboo and coconut fibers. By constructing a funnel-shaped trap that leads fish into a narrow exit, I could effectively catch fish without the need for bait or hooks. I would also explore the idea of using bioluminescent algae (if available) to attract fish at night, creating a glowing underwater lure that would increase my chances of a successful catch.",
    "**Foraging with a Twist**: I would develop a \"foraging map\" of the island, documenting edible plants, fruits, and potential hazards. To do this, I would use natural pigments from berries and plants to create a visual guide on large leaves. This would not only help me identify safe food sources but also serve as a teaching tool if I encountered other survivors. Additionally, I would experiment with cooking methods, such as using hot stones to bake root vegetables, maximizing the nutritional benefits of my foraged finds.",
    "**Signal Fire Innovations**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire that incorporates reflective materials. I would gather shiny objects like shells, glass, or aluminum from any washed-up debris to create a large SOS sign on the beach. I would also design a fire pit that allows for smoke signals, ensuring that the smoke rises high enough to be seen from a distance. Using a combination of green leaves and dry wood, I could create a smoke signal that alternates between thick plumes and short bursts.",
    "**Coconut Battery Creation**: If I found some coconuts, I would experiment with creating a simple battery using coconut water, copper, and zinc. By inserting a copper wire and a zinc nail into the coconut, I could create a basic galvanic cell. This would allow me to power small devices or create a spark for fire-starting, providing an innovative solution to energy needs on the island."
