    "**Modular Shopping Cart**: Create a modular shopping cart that can be customized based on the shopper's needs. Shoppers could add or remove compartments for different types of items (e.g., groceries, fragile items, or bulk goods). This would allow for a more organized shopping experience and reduce the risk of items getting damaged or crushed.",
    "**Self-Driving Shopping Cart**: Develop a self-driving shopping cart equipped with sensors and navigation technology. Shoppers could input their shopping list into a mobile app, and the cart would autonomously navigate the store, guiding the shopper to each item. This would streamline the shopping process and enhance accessibility for those with mobility issues.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cart with Reusable Bags**: Introduce a shopping cart made from sustainable materials that includes built-in, reusable bags. Shoppers could simply pull out the bags as needed, reducing the reliance on single-use plastic bags. The cart could also feature a compartment for storing these bags when not in use, encouraging environmentally friendly practices.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping Cart**: Equip shopping carts with an AR interface that displays information about products as shoppers approach them. This could include nutritional information, price comparisons, and recipe suggestions based on items in the cart. Shoppers could use a handheld device or smart glasses to interact with the AR system, enhancing their shopping experience with valuable insights.",
    "**Health Monitoring Shopping Cart**: Integrate health monitoring technology into the shopping cart, such as a built-in heart rate monitor or a step tracker. Shoppers could track their physical activity while shopping, encouraging a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, the cart could suggest healthier food options based on the shopper's preferences and health goals, creating a personalized shopping experience."
