    "**Personal Solar Drones**: Develop small, portable drones equipped with solar panels that can fly outdoors to capture sunlight and then project it indoors. These drones would be programmed to navigate through openings like windows and can adjust their position based on the sun’s angle. They would create a direct beam of sunlight in specific areas of a home or office, providing natural light wherever it’s needed.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Engineer genetically modified plants that glow with bioluminescence during the day and emit soft light at night. These plants would not only serve as a beautiful indoor decoration but also produce light similar to sunlight. They could be placed in homes and offices, creating a calming atmosphere while providing a unique source of illumination that mimics natural light.",
    "**Holographic Sun Projectors**: Invent holographic projectors that create a 3D image of the sun in a room. These projectors would simulate sunlight, including warmth and color variations throughout the day. They could be controlled via an app, allowing users to adjust the intensity and angle of the light, simulating sunrises and sunsets even on the cloudiest of days.",
    "**Sunlight Harvesting Windows**: Design innovative windows with a special coating that captures and filters ambient light, converting it into a spectrum similar to sunlight. These windows would be made from a translucent material embedded with solar cells that can harvest energy while allowing natural light to brighten interiors, creating a sunlit effect even when the sky is overcast.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Therapy Stations**: Set up public or community stations that offer light therapy treatments. These stations would feature specialized lamps that emit bright, full-spectrum light designed to combat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and boost mood. People could visit these stations during their daily routines to receive a dose of \"sunlight,\" promoting mental health and well-being."
