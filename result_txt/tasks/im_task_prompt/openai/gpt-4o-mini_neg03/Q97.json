    "**Self-Winding Leash**: Design a leash that automatically retracts when the dog is close to the owner, similar to a tape measure. This would eliminate the hassle of winding up the leash after each walk. The self-winding mechanism could be activated by a button on the handle, allowing the owner to easily control the length of the leash depending on the environment (e.g., longer in open spaces, shorter in crowded areas).",
    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-In Storage**: Create a dog leash that features built-in storage compartments for essentials such as waste bags, treats, and even a small water bottle. This would make walks more convenient, as pet owners wouldn't need to carry additional bags or pouches. The storage could be designed to be waterproof and easy to access, ensuring that everything needed for a walk is right at hand.",
    "**Adjustable Length and Tension Control**: Develop a leash that allows for adjustable length and tension based on the dog's behavior and the walking environment. This could include a mechanism to set the leash length (shorter for busy streets, longer for parks) and a tension control that allows the owner to have a looser grip when the dog is calm and a tighter grip when the dog is excited or reactive.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Features**: Enhance safety during nighttime walks by incorporating reflective materials and LED lights into the leash. This would ensure that both the dog and owner are visible to passing vehicles and pedestrians. The lights could be set to flash or remain steady, and the reflective material could catch light from street lamps or car headlights, making evening walks safer.",
    "**Comfort Grip Handle with Vibration Feedback**: Design a leash with an ergonomic handle that provides vibration feedback to the owner when the dog pulls excessively. This would help reinforce training, as the owner would receive a gentle reminder to correct their dogâ€™s behavior without having to constantly look down or adjust their grip. The handle could also be made from soft, non-slip materials for comfort during long walks."
