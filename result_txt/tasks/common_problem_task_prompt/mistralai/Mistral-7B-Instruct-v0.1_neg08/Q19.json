    "One way to overcome jealousy when seeing others succeed is to focus on your own strengths and talents. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to identify what sets you apart and use those qualities to your advantage. For example, if you have a unique design sense or a talent for creating garments that are comfortable and functional, use those strengths to create a fashion line that stands out from the rest.",
    "Another way to combat jealousy is to shift your focus from what others are doing to what you can do. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on the progress you're making and the steps you're taking towards creating your own fashion line. This can help you stay motivated and focused on your own goals.",
    "It can also be helpful to surround yourself with supportive people who encourage and uplift you. Seek out mentors, peers, and friends who can provide constructive feedback and advice, and who will celebrate your successes with you.",
    "Another way to overcome jealousy is to practice gratitude. Instead of focusing on what others have achieved, try to focus on what you're grateful for in your own life. This can help you shift your perspective and appreciate the good things in your own life.",
    "Finally, it can be helpful to take a step back and remind yourself that everyone's journey is unique. Just because someone else finished their task seamlessly doesn't mean that you can't achieve the same level of success. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress and stay motivated towards your goals."
