    "**Floating Relaxation Platforms**: With no sand, we could replace it with a series of interconnected floating platforms made from sustainable materials. These platforms could have comfortable seating, hammocks, and shaded areas, allowing people to lounge on the water. They could also feature glass-bottom sections to observe marine life below, creating a unique experience of being on the water while still enjoying the beach atmosphere.",
    "**Beachside Eco-Farmers Market**: Without sand, the beach could be reimagined as a vibrant eco-farmers market, showcasing local produce and crafts. Stalls could be set up on wooden decks or platforms, offering fresh fruits, vegetables, and artisanal goods. Visitors could enjoy cooking demonstrations, sample local delicacies, and participate in farm-to-table events, all while enjoying the sea breeze and ocean views.",
    "**Marine Adventure Park**: The absence of sand could lead to the development of a marine adventure park that offers activities like snorkeling, kayaking, and paddleboarding. Instead of lounging on the beach, visitors could engage in water sports and explore underwater ecosystems. The park could include guided tours with marine biologists, allowing participants to learn about ocean conservation while having fun.",
    "**Seaside Wellness Retreat**: Beaches could be converted into wellness retreats focusing on mental and physical health. Yoga classes, meditation sessions, and wellness workshops could take place on wooden decks or grassy areas. The soothing sound of waves and fresh ocean air would create a tranquil environment for relaxation and rejuvenation, promoting mindfulness and connection with nature.",
    "**Artistic Ocean Walks**: Without sand, the beach could be lined with artistic installations, sculptures, and murals created by local artists. Visitors could enjoy a scenic ocean walk along pathways made of recycled materials or natural stone, turning the beach into an outdoor gallery. Interactive art pieces could encourage engagement, and guided tours could provide insights into the artists' inspirations and techniques."
