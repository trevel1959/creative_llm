    "**Innovative Carpet Cleaning System:** Develop a self-cleaning carpet system that uses ultrasonic waves to break down dirt and stains, then vacuum them out automatically. The carpet would have embedded sensors that detect when cleaning is needed and trigger the cleaning process. This could be especially useful in high-traffic areas like commercial spaces or busy households.",
    "**Interactive Learning Carpet:** Create an educational carpet designed for children's playrooms or classrooms. Each square of the carpet could contain a different question or puzzle, encouraging kids to move around and learn while playing. This could also incorporate technology, such as QR codes linking to educational videos or interactive games on tablets.",
    "**Smart Heating and Cooling Carpet:** Implement a carpet that can regulate temperature based on the room's needs. It could use heat sensors to detect when the floor feels too cold and heat up accordingly, or cool down during hot weather by using a built-in cooling mechanism. This could help save energy and provide a more comfortable living environment.",
    "**Sustainable Recycled Carpet Tiles:** Design a line of carpet tiles made from recycled materials such as plastic bottles, old tires, or even coffee grounds. These tiles not only reduce waste but also offer unique textures and colors, making them appealing for both commercial and residential use. The tiles could be easily replaced or recycled at the end of their life cycle.",
    "**Health Monitoring Carpet:** Develop a carpet that can monitor the health of its occupants through sensors embedded within it. It could detect air quality, track footstep patterns to identify physical activity levels, and even monitor heart rate or stress levels. The data collected could be sent to a mobile app, providing users with insights into their lifestyle and health habits, potentially leading to healthier living choices."
