    "**Smart Cane**: Design a smart cane with built-in sensors that detect obstacles, stairs, and uneven terrain. The cane would vibrate or emit a gentle beep to alert the user, providing a sense of spatial awareness. The sensor data could also be transmitted to a companion app, allowing friends and family to track the user's location and provide real-time assistance.",
    "**Eyes-on-Me**: Create a wearable device that uses AI-powered computer vision to recognize and identify objects, people, and text in the user's surroundings. The device would provide a real-time audio description, allowing the visually impaired to navigate their environment with greater confidence. The device could also learn the user's preferences and provide personalized recommendations.",
    "**SoundScout**: Develop a smart, wearable device that uses 3D audio to create a sonic map of the user's surroundings. The device would emit a unique sound signature for each object or feature, allowing the user to build a mental map of their environment. This would enable the user to navigate complex spaces with greater ease and independence.",
    "**Tactile Atlas**: Design a 3D-printed, tactile map that uses raised lines and textures to represent geographical features, such as roads, rivers, and buildings. The map would be customizable to the user's specific needs and preferences, allowing them to explore new areas with greater confidence. The map could also be updated in real-time using a companion app.",
    "**Echolocation Assistant**: Develop a wearable device that uses ultrasound technology to create a 3D map of the user's surroundings. The device would emit a high-frequency sound wave and measure the time it takes for the sound to bounce back, allowing the user to build a mental map of their environment. This would enable the user to navigate complex spaces with greater ease and independence. [/INST] "
