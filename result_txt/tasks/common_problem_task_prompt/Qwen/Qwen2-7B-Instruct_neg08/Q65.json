    "**Emotional AI Integration:** Create a feature that uses advanced AI to understand your emotions and behavior patterns. This could detect when you're feeling jealous or frustrated due to the success of others, and automatically suggest productivity techniques or mindfulness exercises tailored to your current emotional state. The phone could also provide personalized suggestions for improving your own task completion rates.",
    "**Collaborative Task Management:** Develop a social feature where users can share their progress on specific tasks and projects. Users can set goals, share updates, and even offer support and encouragement to each other. This fosters a sense of community and reduces feelings of jealousy by shifting focus from individual achievements to collective progress.",
    "**Progress Visualization Tools:** Implement interactive visualizations like timelines, graphs, or progress bars that allow you to track your own progress over time. Comparing this data with that of your peers in a safe, anonymous environment could help you appreciate your own growth rather than focusing on others' achievements. The phone could also suggest ways to improve based on the trends it detects in your progress.",
    "**Task Inspiration and Motivation Apps:** Integrate an app store within the smartphone that offers a variety of motivational content, including stories, quotes, podcasts, and guided meditations related to overcoming envy and fostering a growth mindset.

    "**Virtual Mentorship and Coaching Platform:** Partner with industry experts and successful professionals to create a platform where users can access virtual mentorship sessions.
