    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Hydrogen fuel cells could be used to power vehicles in the absence of oil. These cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water as a byproduct. The hydrogen could be extracted from water, biomass, or even industrial waste.",
    "Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) could be charged using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydro power. This would eliminate the need for oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Battery-powered vehicles: Battery-powered vehicles could be charged using renewable energy sources. This would eliminate the need for oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Fuel-efficient vehicles: Fuel-efficient vehicles could be designed to run on less oil, such as hybrid vehicles that use both gasoline and electricity.",
    "Alternative fuels: Alternative fuels such as biodiesel or ethanol could be used to power vehicles in the absence of oil. These fuels can be produced from biomass, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels."
