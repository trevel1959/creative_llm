    "My new planet would have a massive, single continent surrounded by a shallow sea. The land would be lush and green, covered in forests and grasslands. There would be many large plains and mountains, and a few small rivers would wind their way through the landscape.",
    "My new planet would have a rocky, red surface, with a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. It would be mostly covered by mountains, volcanoes, and deserts, with few bodies of water. It would be home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including many ancient and extinct species.",
    "My new planet would have a dense atmosphere of helium and hydrogen, with a slight mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The surface would be a lush, tropical paradise, with rainforests, coral reefs, and warm, sunny beaches. There would be many unique animals and plants that have never been seen before on Earth, and the planet would host a variety of advanced civilizations.",
    "My new planet would have a slightly larger mass than the Earth and would be composed of rock, water, and gases. The atmosphere would be dominated by oxygen and nitrogen, with an ammonia-driven climate. The surface would be mostly water, with islands composed of continental crust above thick crustal layers. The land masses would be arranged in continents separated by seas and oceans.",
    "My new planet would be rocky, with a thin, nitrogen-rich atmosphere. The surface would be covered in lush rain forests and deserts, with a few small mountains and active volcanoes. The planet would have an active geological cycle and a small moon. There would be a wide range of life, from fish to birds and mammals."
