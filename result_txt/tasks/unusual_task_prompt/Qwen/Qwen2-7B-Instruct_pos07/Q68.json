    "**Smart Soap Dispenser with Temperature Control:** Create a soap dispenser that can adjust its dispensing amount based on the temperature of the water. This feature would be especially useful in cold climates or during winter months when hands tend to get drier. The dispenser could detect the temperature of the incoming water and dispense just enough soap to ensure that the hands are clean but not overly soapy. This not only saves soap but also helps maintain skin moisture.",
    "**Customizable Scented Soap Dispenser:** Develop a soap dispenser that allows users to add their own essential oils or scents. Users could mix different scents to create unique, personalized soap dispensers. This would appeal to those who want to customize their bathroom experience and might be particularly attractive to those with allergies or sensitivities to certain fragrances.",
    "**Interactive Soap Dispenser with Health Tips:** Incorporate a digital display into the soap dispenser that provides health tips or reminders, such as \"Remember to wash your hands for 20 seconds\" or \"Did you know washing your hands regularly can reduce the risk of catching colds?\" This feature could educate users about proper hygiene practices and motivate them to wash their hands more frequently.",
    "**Recycling-Integrated Soap Dispenser:** Design a soap dispenser that doubles as a recycling bin. After using the soap dispenser, users could dispose of small items like hair ties, lip balm wrappers, or even used cotton balls directly into the dispenser. The dispenser could have compartments or bags inside to separate different types of waste, promoting eco-friendly habits and reducing clutter in the bathroom.",
    "**Wearable Soap Dispenser:** Create a wearable device that dispenses soap when it detects skin contact with water. This could be particularly useful for busy individuals or those with mobility issues who may struggle to reach a traditional soap dispenser. The device could be worn on the wrist or ankle and use sensors to automatically release soap when it senses the user's skin entering the water. This would streamline the handwashing process and enhance accessibility for everyone."
