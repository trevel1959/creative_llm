    "**Personal Flying Pods**: A network of personal flying pods that are designed for one or two passengers. These pods would be equipped with a personal flight control system and could be used for both short and long distances. They would be environmentally friendly, powered by a combination of electric and solar energy. The pods would be easy to navigate, with a simple control interface and automatic landing capabilities.",
    "**Magnetic Submarine**: A high-speed submarine that uses magnetic propulsion to travel through water at supersonic speeds. It would be capable of carrying a large number of passengers and would be powered by a nuclear reactor. The submarine would have advanced safety features, including an automatic escape system and a self-sustaining life support system.",
    "**Teleportation Pods**: A network of teleportation pods that would instantly transport passengers from one location to another. The pods would be small and comfortable, with a personal entertainment system and a virtual reality interface for passengers to use during the journey. The teleportation technology would be based on quantum entanglement and would be fast and efficient.",
    "**Modular Spacecraft**: A modular spacecraft that can be customized to suit the needs of different missions. The spacecraft would be designed to be self-sustaining, with solar panels for power and a life support system for long-duration missions. It would be equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems, as well as a range of scientific and exploration equipment.",
    "**Hyperloop Transportation System**: A high-speed transportation system that uses a network of tubes to transport passengers at speeds of up to 760 miles per hour. The system would be powered by a combination of electric and magnetic propulsion, and would be designed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The tubes would be made of a lightweight, durable material and would be spaced at regular intervals to allow for efficient airflow."
