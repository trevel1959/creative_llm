    "**Smart Glasses with Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Design a pair of glasses with a built-in display that overlays digital information onto the real world. This could include virtual try-on for clothes, directions, translations, or even interactive games. The glasses could be controlled using voice commands, hand gestures, or a small remote control.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring Glasses**: Create a pair of glasses with built-in sensors that track air quality, temperature, and humidity levels. This could be especially useful for people with respiratory issues or those who work outdoors. The glasses could provide real-time feedback and alerts when conditions become hazardous.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Glasses with Emotive Feedback**: Develop a pair of glasses that not only provide an immersive VR experience but also track the user's emotional state. Using EEG sensors or facial recognition technology, the glasses could detect the user's emotions and respond accordingly, creating a more empathetic and engaging experience.",
    "**Glasses with Integrated Projector**: Design a pair of glasses with a built-in projector that can display information onto any surface. This could be useful for presentations, education, or even entertainment. The projector could be controlled using a small remote or voice commands.",
    "**Prescription Glasses with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Create a pair of prescription glasses with built-in sensors that track the user's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. This could be especially useful for people with chronic conditions or those who need to monitor their health closely. The glasses could provide real-time feedback and alerts when conditions become hazardous."
