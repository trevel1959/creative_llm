    "Immersive Pop-Up Theatres: Create portable, immersive theatres that can be set up in unexpected locations such as abandoned buildings, rooftops, or even in the middle of a park. These pop-up theatres could be equipped with state-of-the-art projectors and sound systems, allowing for a truly immersive experience.",
    "Virtual Reality Cinemas: Develop virtual reality headsets that allow viewers to watch movies in a fully immersive environment. This could include the ability to choose their seat in the virtual theatre, interact with other viewers, and even influence the plot of the movie.",
    "Mobile Movie Theatres: Create a fleet of mobile movie theatres that can travel to different locations, bringing the cinematic experience to people who may not have access to a traditional theatre. These mobile theatres could be equipped with solar panels or other sustainable energy sources, making them environmentally friendly.",
    "Community-Led Film Projects: Create a platform that allows communities to come together and create their own films. This could include workshops on filmmaking, scriptwriting, and editing, as well as access to equipment and resources. The resulting films could be screened at local events, festivals, or even in a dedicated community cinema.",
    "Interactive Movie Experiences: Develop interactive movie experiences that allow viewers to influence the plot of the film. This could be achieved through the use of special glasses or headsets that track the viewer's reactions and adjust the movie accordingly.
