    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and increased tourism can lead to environmental degradation. This could include deforestation, increased waste, and pollution. To address this, organizers could commit to sustainability by using eco-friendly materials for construction, implementing strict waste management protocols, and promoting green initiatives, such as planting trees for every ticket sold.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events like the Olympics can attract security threats, ranging from terrorism to protests. To ensure safety, organizers could create a comprehensive security plan that includes collaboration with local law enforcement, the installation of surveillance technology, and community engagement programs to foster a sense of security among citizens.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can boost the local economy, it can also exacerbate economic inequalities. The influx of tourists may lead to rising prices in accommodations and services, making it difficult for locals to afford basic needs. To counter this, organizers could establish a pricing regulation system for local businesses and offer incentives for affordable housing and services during the games.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The global spotlight can lead to cultural misunderstandings or misrepresentations. This can offend local communities and detract from the spirit of the games. To promote cultural sensitivity, organizers could involve local communities in the planning process, ensuring their traditions and values are represented in ceremonies and events, and providing cultural training for international visitors.",
    "**Athlete Well-being**: The pressure to perform can lead to mental health issues among athletes. To support their well-being, organizers could implement mental health resources, including counseling services and workshops on stress management. Additionally, providing a platform for athletes to share their experiences could help normalize discussions around mental health in sports."
