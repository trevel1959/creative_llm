    "**Self-Cleaning Filter Technology**: Integrate a self-cleaning filter system that uses vibrations or a small motor to shake out dust and debris from the filter after each cleaning cycle. This would maintain optimal suction power without the need for users to frequently replace or clean the filter, thereby improving efficiency and reducing maintenance efforts.",
    "**Modular Attachments**: Create a line of modular attachments that can be easily swapped out depending on the cleaning task at hand. For instance, attachments could include a pet hair remover, a specialized tool for cleaning blinds, or a small handheld vacuum for tight spaces. This would make the vacuum cleaner more versatile and tailored to specific cleaning needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solutions**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a built-in compartment for eco-friendly cleaning solutions. This could be used for cleaning carpets and upholstery, allowing users to dispense a safe, biodegradable cleaning solution directly onto surfaces while vacuuming. This would enhance cleaning effectiveness while promoting sustainable practices.",
    "**Interactive App Integration**: Launch a companion app that connects to the vacuum cleaner via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The app could provide users with cleaning schedules, track cleaning history, offer maintenance reminders, and allow for remote control. Users could also customize cleaning modes based on their preferences or specific needs, such as “pet mode” for homes with animals.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-cancellation technology within the vacuum cleaner. This could involve sound-dampening materials and specialized motor designs that significantly reduce the operational noise. Users would appreciate a quieter cleaning experience, making it possible to vacuum at any time without disturbing others in the home."
