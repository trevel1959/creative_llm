    "**Adaptive Soundproofing**: Incorporate advanced materials into door design that can adapt to the noise levels of the environment. For example, a door could have an embedded sound-dampening technology that activates when it detects loud noises outside, creating a quieter indoor atmosphere. This could be particularly beneficial in urban settings or for home offices.",
    "**Mood Lighting Integration**: Design doors with built-in LED mood lighting that can change colors based on the time of day or the homeowner's preferences. This could enhance the entrance aesthetic and provide a welcoming ambiance. Additionally, the lighting could be programmed to act as a night light or security feature, illuminating when someone approaches the door.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create doors from sustainable, eco-friendly materials such as recycled composites or bamboo. This would not only reduce the environmental impact but could also include features like insulation to improve energy efficiency. Additionally, these doors could be treated with natural finishes that are safe for both people and the planet.",
    "**Integrated Digital Assistant**: Develop doors with a built-in digital assistant that can respond to voice commands. Homeowners could use this feature to check the status of the door, unlock it, or even receive updates about who is at the door. This could be paired with a camera for added security and convenience, allowing for video calls with visitors.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Introduce a modular door system where homeowners can customize the look and function of their door. This could include interchangeable panels, colors, and hardware, allowing for personalization that matches the homeâ€™s aesthetic. Additionally, modular components could include built-in planters or shelves for added functionality."
