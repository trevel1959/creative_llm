    "Pollination and seed dispersal would be significantly impacted, as many insects play a crucial role in these processes. This could lead to a decrease in plant reproduction and a decline in biodiversity.",
    "The food chain would be severely impacted, as insects are a crucial source of food for many other animals, including birds, bats, and larger insects. This could lead to a decrease in the populations of these animals and a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem.",
    "Insect-based industries, such as honey production and silk farming, would be severely impacted and potentially cease to exist.",
