    "**Smart Coat Rack with AI-Powered Hanger Management**: Design a coat rack that incorporates AI technology to optimize hanger usage and minimize clutter. The rack would have sensors that detect the type and size of garments hung on it, and adjust the hanger spacing accordingly. For example, it would use more space for larger coats and less for smaller items like scarves. The AI system would also learn the user's preferences and adjust the hanger arrangement over time. This smart coat rack would not only save space but also reduce the time spent searching for a specific hanger.",

This would allow users to charge their devices as they hang up their coats, keeping them powered up and ready to go. The charging station could also include features like power banks or cable organizers to keep cords tidy.",
