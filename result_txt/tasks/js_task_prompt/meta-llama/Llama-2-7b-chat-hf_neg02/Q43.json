    "Home Security System: With the ability to see through walls, you could create a home security system that alerts you of any potential threats or intruders before they enter your home. You could install sensors on the walls of your home that detect movement and send signals to a central hub, where an AI system could analyze the data and alert you of any suspicious activity.",
    "Search and Rescue: In the event of a natural disaster or building collapse, being able to see through walls could help emergency responders locate survivors more quickly and efficiently. You could use this power to pinpoint the location of trapped individuals and guide rescuers to them, potentially saving precious time and lives.",
    "Architectural Design: With the ability to see through walls, you could gain valuable insights into the structural integrity of buildings and identify potential design flaws before they become major problems.
