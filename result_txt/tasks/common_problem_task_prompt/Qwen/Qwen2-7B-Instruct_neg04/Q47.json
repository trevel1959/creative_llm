    "**DIY Modular Computer System**: Design a modular computer system that allows users to easily upgrade components such as the CPU, RAM, and storage. The modules can snap together in various configurations to suit different needs. This idea promotes sustainability by reducing the need for frequent complete replacements of the computer system. It also encourages customization, allowing users to tailor their computers precisely to their computing needs.",
    "**Sustainable Computer Build**: Develop a computer build using only eco-friendly materials and components. This could include using biodegradable plastics for casing, energy-efficient hardware, and components sourced from sustainable practices. Additionally, consider designing the computer to be disassembled and recycled at end-of-life, ensuring that all parts are easily recyclable or reusable. This concept aims to reduce the environmental impact of technology waste.",
    "**Inclusive Accessibility Computer Kit**: Create a kit that focuses on accessibility features, designed to help people with disabilities use computers more effectively. This might include options like voice control, haptic feedback, customizable keyboard layouts, and large display options. By focusing on inclusivity, this build not only helps those who face barriers to computing but also encourages a culture of empathy and innovation in technology design.",
    "**Ergonomic Workstation**: Develop a computer setup that prioritizes ergonomics and user health. This could involve creating a desk and chair specifically designed to support good posture while working long hours in front of a screen. The workstation could also incorporate smart features like automatic height adjustments, ambient light sensors, and reminders to stand up and stretch. This idea addresses the growing concerns around the negative effects of sedentary lifestyles associated with prolonged computer use.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Smart Desktop**: Design a desktop computer that utilizes smart power management techniques to reduce its energy consumption. This could include components that automatically adjust their power usage based on the tasks being performed, as well as features like ambient light sensing to dim the screen when the room becomes bright. By making energy efficiency a priority, this build not only saves on electricity costs but also reduces its carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future."
