    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**: A knife that utilizes a patented mechanism to sharpen itself during use. As the knife is pulled out of its sheath, a small grinding stone rotates into place, honing the edge as it is drawn. This would ensure that the knife remains sharp without the need for manual sharpening, making it ideal for busy kitchens.",
    "**Multi-Functional Knife with Interchangeable Blades**: This knife could feature a modular design where users can easily swap out different blades for various purposes (e.g., chefâ€™s knife, paring knife, serrated knife). The handle could also have attachments for a peeler or zester, making it a versatile tool for all types of cooking.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Pressure Sensors**: A knife designed with an ergonomic handle that includes pressure sensors to gauge how much force is being applied while cutting. This feedback could help users improve their cutting technique, prevent accidents, and reduce hand fatigue. The handle could also vibrate to alert the user when too much pressure is being applied, minimizing the risk of injury.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Storage Compartment**: This innovative knife could feature a hollow handle that can store small items like herbs, spices, or even a small sharpening stone. The compartment could be sealed to keep contents fresh, allowing chefs to have essential ingredients at their fingertips while preparing meals.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Knife with Biodegradable Materials**: A knife made from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, that does not compromise on quality or sharpness. The blade could be designed to be easily removable and replaceable, allowing users to recycle the handle while only replacing the blade when needed."
