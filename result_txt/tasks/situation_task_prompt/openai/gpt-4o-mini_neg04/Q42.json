    "**Water Collection System**: Freshwater is essential for survival. I would create a rainwater collection system using large leaves or hollowed-out bamboo to funnel rain into containers. If no containers are available, I would dig a shallow pit and line it with leaves to collect rainwater. I would also look for freshwater sources like streams or springs, if available, and use a filtration method with sand and charcoal to purify the water.",
    "**Food Foraging and Fishing**: I would start foraging for edible plants, fruits, and nuts native to the island. I would familiarize myself with the local flora to avoid poisonous plants. For protein, I would fashion simple fishing tools using sharp stones or bamboo spears to catch fish. I could also create fish traps using woven reeds or construct a net if I found sufficient materials.",
    "**Fire Creation**: To cook food, purify water, and provide warmth, I would need to start a fire. I would gather dry leaves, twigs, and larger logs to create a fire pit. Using a friction method like a bow drill or hand drill, I would create an ember from dry wood. Alternatively, I could use a magnifying glass (if available) or striking stones to create sparks. Once I had an ember, I would carefully nurture it with dry tinder until it ignited.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create signals visible from the air or sea. This could include arranging large rocks or logs in a clear SOS pattern on the beach or creating a large fire pit that I could ignite during the day with smoke signals. I would also consider creating reflective surfaces using shiny objects or pieces of glass to catch the attention of passing ships or planes.",
    "**Navigating the Island**: To explore the island safely and identify potential resources, I would create a basic map using sand or large leaves to mark areas I’ve explored, food sources, and water supplies. This would help me avoid getting lost and ensure I could return to my shelter easily. I would also look for high ground to gain a better vantage point of the island’s layout and any potential rescue routes."
