    "**Solar Still**: I would use my creativity to create a solar still, a device that uses the sun's heat to evaporate water from the sand or plants, and then condenses it back into liquid water. This would provide me with a reliable source of fresh water. To build it, I would dig a shallow hole and place a container in the center. I would then weigh down a piece of plastic or a leaf with rocks, creating a slope. As the sun heats the plastic or leaf, water would evaporate and rise, condensing on the underside of the plastic or leaf. I would then collect the condensed water in the container.",
    "**Fish Trap**: To catch fish, I would create a simple fish trap using natural materials found on the island. I would gather sticks, vines, and leaves to build a trap that funnels fish into a small enclosure. I would place the trap in a shallow area of the ocean, where fish are more likely to congregate. The trap would be designed to allow fish to enter but not escape, allowing me to catch them for food.",
    "**Palm Tree Shelter**: To protect myself from the elements, I would create a shelter using palm trees. I would gather palm fronds and tie them together with vines to create a sturdy roof. I would then place the roof over a series of poles, creating a simple hut. The palm fronds would provide excellent insulation and protection from the rain.",
    "**Coconut Oil Lamp**: To light my way at night, I would create a coconut oil lamp. I would drill a hole in a coconut shell and place a wick made from a piece of cloth or a leaf inside. I would then pour coconut oil into the shell, creating a makeshift lamp. The oil would burn slowly, providing a reliable source of light.",
    "**Signal Fire**: To signal for help, I would create a signal fire using dry leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials. I would build a fire pit using rocks and place the flammable materials inside. I would then use a piece of bamboo or a stick to create a makeshift torch, allowing me to control the size and intensity of the fire. I would build the fire in a visible location, such as a hilltop or a clearing, to increase the chances of being seen by potential rescuers."
