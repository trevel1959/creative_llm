    "**Bioluminescent Contact Lenses**: Humans could wear special contact lenses that harness the power of bioluminescent organisms to illuminate their surroundings in low-light conditions. These lenses would contain microscopic algae or bacteria that produce light when exposed to oxygen, allowing wearers to see in complete darkness. The lenses would be powered by a small, wearable device that maintains a stable oxygen supply, ensuring a constant light output.",
    "**Optical Illusions for Safety**: In a world where humans can see in the dark, the concept of optical illusions would take on a new dimension. Buildings and streets could be designed with cleverly crafted optical illusions that make it seem like there's more light than there actually is. For example, a street could be painted with a pattern of tiny, glowing dots that create the illusion of a brighter, more well-lit area. This would reduce the need for actual lighting, making cities more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Dark-Sight Art**: The ability to see in the dark would revolutionize the art world. Artists could create immersive, 3D installations that respond to sound, movement, or even the viewer's emotions. These installations would be designed to be experienced in complete darkness, using a combination of light, sound, and scent to create a multisensory experience. The art world would see a surge in innovative, experiential pieces that push the boundaries of human perception.",
    "**Nighttime Agriculture**: With the ability to see in the dark, farmers could cultivate crops in areas that were previously too dark for efficient farming. This would lead to increased food production, reduced transportation costs, and a more stable food supply. Farmers could use specialized equipment that utilizes advanced sensors and LED lighting to optimize crop growth and minimize waste. This would also enable the growth of rare, high-value crops that require specific light conditions.",
    "**Dark-Sight Exploration**: The ability to see in the dark would open up new frontiers for exploration and discovery. Scientists could venture into the depths of caves, the darkest parts of the ocean, or even the surface of other planets without the need for cumbersome lighting equipment. This would allow for a deeper understanding of the natural world, the discovery of new species, and a greater appreciation for the mysteries of the universe. Dark-sight exploration would also enable the creation of new technologies and materials inspired by the unique properties of dark environments.
