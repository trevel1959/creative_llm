    "**UV Sanitizing Case**: Create a travel case for the electric toothbrush that includes built-in UV-C light sanitization. This feature would eliminate bacteria and viruses on the brush head while stored, ensuring that users maintain optimal hygiene even when on the go. The case could also have a charging feature, allowing the toothbrush to charge while being sanitized.",
    "**Customizable Brush Heads**: Design interchangeable brush heads with various bristle types, sizes, and shapes tailored to different dental needs (e.g., sensitive teeth, braces, whitening). Users could easily switch between heads based on their current oral health requirements, and a built-in sensor could recommend the best brush head based on the user's brushing style and pressure.",
    "**Voice Assistant Integration**: Incorporate voice assistant technology into the electric toothbrush. Users could ask for brushing tips, receive reminders for brushing intervals, or even play music or podcasts during their brushing routine. This feature would help create a more enjoyable and interactive experience while ensuring that users adhere to their oral hygiene routine.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop an electric toothbrush using sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the ecological footprint of dental care products. Additionally, the toothbrush could come with a recycling program for used brush heads, promoting responsible disposal.",
    "**Built-in Pressure Sensor and Feedback**: Enhance the toothbrush with an advanced pressure sensor that provides real-time feedback on brushing pressure. If users are brushing too hard, the toothbrush could vibrate or change speed to prevent gum damage. The accompanying app could track pressure over time, helping users adjust their technique for healthier gums."
