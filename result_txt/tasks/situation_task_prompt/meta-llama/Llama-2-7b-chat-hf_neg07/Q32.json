    "Dental Hygiene Apprenticeships: Create a peer-to-peer apprenticeship program where individuals can learn and teach each other proper oral hygiene techniques, such as brushing and flossing, through video tutorials, online forums, and in-person workshops. This would allow for a decentralized and community-driven approach to dental care, without relying on traditional dental professionals.",
    "DIY Dental Implants: Develop a 3D printing technology that allows individuals to create their own custom dental implants using a digital scanner and a 3D printer. This would eliminate the need for expensive and time-consuming dental implant procedures, while also providing a more personalized and cost-effective solution.",
    "Chewing Sticks: Revive the ancient practice of using chewing sticks, also known as miswak or siwak, to clean teeth. Chewing sticks are natural toothbrushes that have been used for centuries in many cultures and can be found in most supermarkets. They are effective at removing plaque and reducing gingivitis, and can be used in combination with other natural ingredients like salt and baking soda for added benefits.",
    "Toothpaste Tablets: Develop a toothpaste tablet that can be easily made at home using natural ingredients like baking soda, coconut oil, and essential oils. These tablets can be customized to address specific oral health issues, such as sensitivity or gum health, and can be more cost-effective and convenient than traditional toothpaste.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: Establish a cooperative model for dental care, where individuals pool their resources to create a shared dental clinic or mobile dental unit. This would provide affordable and accessible dental care to underserved communities, while also fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility for oral health."
