    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Hydrogen fuel cells are an alternative source of energy that could be used to power vehicles. These fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water as a byproduct. They could be used to power electric vehicles, which would eliminate the need for oil-based fuels.",
    "Solar Power: Solar power could be used to charge electric vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on the roofs of vehicles, allowing them to generate their own electricity. This would eliminate the need for oil-based fuels and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "Battery-Powered Electric Vehicles: Battery-powered electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. These vehicles use lithium-ion batteries to store energy, which is then used to power the electric motor. They produce no emissions and can be charged from an external power source.",
    "Ethanol: Ethanol is a type of biofuel that can be produced from plants such as corn and sugarcane. It can be used as a replacement for gasoline in vehicles. While it is not a perfect solution, it is a cleaner alternative to oil-based fuels.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power could be used to generate electricity, which could then be used to power electric vehicles. Nuclear power plants generate a lot of electricity and produce very little emissions. However, there are concerns about the safety and security of nuclear power."
