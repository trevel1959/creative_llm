    "Air-powered vehicles: In a world where all roads are impassable, air-powered vehicles could become the primary mode of transportation. These vehicles could be powered by compressed air, hydrogen, or helium, and would be able to traverse through the air without any obstacles. They could be designed in various shapes and sizes, from small, personal aircraft to large, commercial airships.",
    "Maglev trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, could be used to transport people and goods over long distances. These trains would use magnetic fields to lift and propel the train, allowing it to move smoothly and efficiently over any surface. Maglev trains could be powered by electricity or other energy sources, and could reach high speeds without the need for roads.",
    "Underwater travel: With all roads impassable, underwater travel could become a viable option. Submarines and other underwater vehicles could be used to transport people and goods through the ocean. These vehicles could be powered by electricity or other energy sources, and could travel at slow or fast speeds depending on the needs of the passengers.",
    "Personal flying devices: Personal flying devices, such as jetpacks or hoverboards, could become the primary mode of transportation in a world where all roads are impassable. These devices would allow individuals to travel short distances without the need for roads or other infrastructure. They could be powered by electricity or other energy sources, and could be used for both personal and commercial transportation.",
    "Teleportation: In a world where all roads are impassable, teleportation could become a viable mode of transportation. This technology would allow individuals to instantly transport themselves from one location to another, without the need for any infrastructure. Teleportation could be powered by advanced technology, such as quantum entanglement or other exotic matter, and could revolutionize the way people travel."
