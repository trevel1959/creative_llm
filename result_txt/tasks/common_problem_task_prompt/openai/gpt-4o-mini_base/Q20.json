    "**Legal Liability**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can become complicated. Questions arise regarding whether the manufacturer, software developer, or car owner is responsible. This ambiguity could lead to lengthy legal battles and insurance complications, necessitating new laws and regulations to clarify liability in autonomous vehicle incidents.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make split-second decisions that involve moral choices, such as choosing between the safety of the passengers or pedestrians. Developing algorithms that can make these ethical decisions poses significant challenges and could lead to public backlash if the decisions are perceived as unjust or harmful.",
    "**Dependence on Technology**: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, there may be a growing dependence on technology for navigation and driving tasks. This could lead to a decline in driving skills among the general population, making individuals less capable of handling traditional vehicles in emergencies or when technology fails.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could threaten jobs in the transportation sector, including taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery personnel. This could lead to significant economic disruption and require large-scale retraining programs to help displaced workers transition to new roles in an evolving job market.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Self-driving cars may require specific infrastructure, such as smart traffic signals and dedicated lanes, to operate safely and efficiently. Many cities may not be equipped to support this technology, leading to uneven adoption rates and potential safety issues in areas lacking the necessary infrastructure upgrades."
