    "Candle Art: Create a series of candlesticks with intricate designs carved into the wax. Each candle can be a unique piece of art, with patterns, shapes, and colors that complement each other. The designs can be inspired by nature, such as flowers, leaves, or trees, or they can be abstract and modern.",
    "Wax Wrappings: Create candlesticks with the wax itself being the wrapping material. Instead of using traditional wax or paper wrappings, create a mold of the candlestick and pour melted wax into it. Once the wax is set, remove the mold and reveal a unique and creative candlestick design.",
    "LED Lighting: Create candlesticks with built-in LED lights. The lights can be hidden within the candlestick or placed on the base, providing a soft and subtle glow. This can be especially useful for outdoor events or for people who want to add a touch of modernity to their decor.",
    "Scented Candles: Create candlesticks with built-in scent diffusers. Instead of using traditional wax, create a mold of the candlestick and fill it with a fragrance oil. As the candle melts, the fragrance is released, providing a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.",
    "Interactive Candlesticks: Create candlesticks that respond to touch or sound. Use sensors or motors to create a unique and interactive experience, such as a candlestick that lights up or changes color when touched or a candlestick that plays music when a specific sound is made. This can add an element of fun and surprise to any room."
