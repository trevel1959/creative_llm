    "A smart stapler that uses AI to optimize stapling for different materials: The smart stapler could be equipped with sensors to detect the type of material being stapled, such as paper, cardboard, or fabric. Based on this information, the stapler could adjust the stapling pressure, length, and angle to ensure the most efficient and effective stapling possible. For example, the stapler could use more pressure for thick materials or adjust the stapling angle for curved surfaces.",
    "A stapler with a built-in staple remover: This stapler could be designed with a small motor and a set of tweezers or a small vacuum to remove staples from the stapled material. This feature would be particularly useful for stapling large volumes of materials, such as packaging boxes, where it can be difficult to remove staples manually.",
    "A stapler that doubles as a paper punch: This stapler could be designed with a built-in paper punch that can be used to create holes for stapling. This would eliminate the need for a separate paper punch and save space on the desk. The stapler could also be designed with different size paper punches to accommodate different paper sizes.",
    "A stapler with a magnetic base: This stapler could be designed with a magnetic base that allows it to stick to metal surfaces, such as filing cabinets or desks. This would make it easier to staple materials without having to hold the stapler in place. The magnetic base could also be used to store the stapler when it's not in use.",
    "A stapler that uses air pressure to staple: This stapler could be designed with a small air compressor that generates air pressure to drive the staple through the material. This would eliminate the need for a traditional stapling mechanism and make the stapler more compact and lightweight. The air pressure could also be adjusted to accommodate different materials and staple sizes."
