    "**Self-Cleaning Materials**: Develop a new type of fabric or material that is inherently self-cleaning. This could be achieved through the use of nanotechnology to coat the material with microscopic beads or fibers that trap and neutralize bacteria, dirt, and other contaminants. These materials can be used for clothing, beddings, kitchenware, and even furniture. ",
    "**Bacterial-Fighting Food Wraps**: Create food wraps infused with natural antibacterial agents such as tea tree oil, oregano oil, or essential oils derived from plants like thyme. These wraps would be an eco-friendly alternative to plastic wrap, and they'd also help prevent the spread of germs during food storage.",
