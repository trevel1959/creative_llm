    "\"Energy of the Cosmos\": This new form of energy would be harnessed from the cosmic rays that bombard the Earth. It would have a mesmerizing blue-green glow, similar to the color of the stars in the night sky. When consumed, it would give the user a sense of connection to the universe and a feeling of infinite possibilities.",
    "\"Nexus Energy\": This energy source would be created by harnessing the power of quantum entanglement, the phenomenon where particles become connected across vast distances. It would have a shimmering, iridescent quality, and would allow users to tap into the collective knowledge and experiences of all the entangled particles.",
    "\"Energy of the Elements\": This form of energy would be drawn from the natural elements of the earth - earth, air, water, and fire. Each element would have its own unique properties and effects, such as earth energy granting strength and stability, air energy boosting creativity and mental clarity, water energy enhancing emotional balance and intuition, and fire energy providing passion and drive.",
    "\"Auric Energy\": This energy source would be derived from the human body's own biofield, or aura. It would be harnessed through meditation and visualization techniques, and would allow users to tap into their own inner power and potential. The energy would have a warm, golden glow and would promote feelings of well-being, balance, and harmony.",
    "\"Quantum Flux Energy\": This new form of energy would be generated by manipulating the quantum field that underlies all matter. It would have a shifting, fluid quality, and would allow users to tap into the underlying patterns and structures of the universe. It would be particularly useful for manipulating matter and energy at the quantum level, and could potentially be used to create new technologies and materials."
