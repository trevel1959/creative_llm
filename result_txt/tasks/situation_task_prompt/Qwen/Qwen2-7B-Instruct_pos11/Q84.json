    "**Wheeled Mobility Device**: If you can't stand up, consider using a wheeled mobility device like a manual or electric wheelchair. These devices are designed to help individuals with mobility issues navigate their environment. They can be maneuvered easily, providing freedom of movement in both indoor and outdoor settings. You can customize your wheelchair with various accessories such as headrests, armrests, and seat cushions for added comfort.",
    "**Crawling Technique**: Adopting a crawling technique might not be the most comfortable option, but it's an effective way to move around if standing is impossible. You can use your hands and knees to propel yourself forward, similar to a baby learning to crawl. This method can be used on any surface, whether it's carpet, hardwood floors, or even grass. To make it easier, consider using knee pads and non-slip gloves to protect your skin and improve grip.",
    "**Inverted Walking Sticks**: Develop a pair of walking sticks that have an inverted design, allowing them to act as crutches when held in the crook of your arm. These sticks would have a larger base to provide stability and support while moving. The inverted design ensures they don't interfere with your feet when you need to place them down, making it easier to navigate different terrains.",
    "**Glide Board**: Create a personalized glide board that fits comfortably under your armpits. It has a flat surface that you can slide on using your arms. The board can be made from lightweight materials like aluminum or plastic, ensuring it's easy to maneuver. To prevent slipping, add a textured surface or rubber strips along the edges. This tool allows you to glide smoothly across surfaces, reducing the effort required to move around.",
    "**Water-Based Mobility Aid**: Design a water-propelled personal flotation device that enables you to glide through water using your arms. This invention can be particularly useful for those who can't walk or stand and live near a body of water. The device could have paddles or propellers powered by your arms, allowing you to navigate lakes, pools, or oceans independently. Additionally, it would provide buoyancy, ensuring safety in case of unexpected situations."
