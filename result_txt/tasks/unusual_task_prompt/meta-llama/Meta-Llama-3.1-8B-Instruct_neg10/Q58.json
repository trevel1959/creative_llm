    "**Post-it Note Rebellion**: Imagine a world where post-it notes are not just for jotting down reminders, but also for sparking creativity. Create a system where people can leave notes with art, poetry, or even a simple doodle that sparks conversation and inspires others. These notes can be placed in public spaces, such as coffee shops, libraries, or even on street lamps. As people interact with these notes, they can start a chain reaction of creativity, leading to a city-wide art installation or even a community event.",
