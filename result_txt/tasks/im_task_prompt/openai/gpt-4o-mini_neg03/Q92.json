    "**Multi-Function Wine Opener with Built-in Aerator**: Create a wine opener that not only uncorks bottles but also includes a built-in aerator. As the cork is removed, the wine is automatically aerated and poured through a spout that enhances its flavors. This would eliminate the need for a separate aeration process and provide a seamless experience from opening to pouring.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Grip**: Design a wine opener with an ergonomic handle that adapts to the user’s grip, making it easier for individuals with limited hand strength or dexterity to open bottles. This could include a soft-touch surface, adjustable grip size, and a lever mechanism that requires minimal effort, making it accessible for everyone.",
    "**Electric Wine Opener with Rechargeable Battery**: Introduce a sleek electric wine opener that operates with the push of a button. It could come with a rechargeable battery and a USB-C charging port for convenience. This design would appeal to users who prefer a hassle-free experience, especially in social settings where multiple bottles may be opened in a short time.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Wine Opener**: Innovate a wine opener that features a self-cleaning mechanism. After opening a bottle, the device could automatically clean the corkscrew and surrounding areas using a UV light or a steam function. This would not only maintain hygiene but also prevent the transfer of flavors between different wines.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: Create a wine opener that includes a temperature sensor to measure the wine’s temperature as the cork is removed. This could provide users with real-time feedback on whether the wine is at the optimal serving temperature. The opener could alert users if the wine needs to be chilled or warmed, enhancing the overall tasting experience."
