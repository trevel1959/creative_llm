    "**Global Congestion and Overcrowding**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the population would skyrocket, leading to unimaginable congestion and overcrowding. The city would become a massive, sprawling metropolis with towering skyscrapers and endless streets. People would be packed tightly together, with limited personal space and a constant sense of claustrophobia. This would lead to a decrease in quality of life, increased stress levels, and a rise in mental health issues.",
    "**Environmental Disaster**: A single city would require an enormous amount of resources to sustain itself, leading to an unsustainable strain on the environment. The city would be a massive consumer of energy, water, and food, causing widespread pollution and environmental degradation. The city's infrastructure would be overwhelmed, leading to the collapse of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity.",
    "**Social Stratification and Inequality**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, social stratification and inequality would reach new heights. The wealthy and powerful would dominate the city's elite neighborhoods, while the poor and marginalized would be relegated to the outskirts. This would lead to a rigid caste system, with limited social mobility and a perpetuation of systemic injustices.",
    "**Loss of Cultural Identity and Diversity**: A single city would erase cultural identities and diversity, as people from different backgrounds would be forced to live and interact with one another in a homogenized environment. The city would become a melting pot, but one that would lead to the loss of unique cultural traditions and practices. This would result in a loss of community and a sense of belonging.",
    "**Psychological Trauma and Disorientation**: Living in a single city would be disorienting and traumatic for many people. The constant exposure to unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells would be overwhelming, leading to feelings of anxiety, disorientation, and even PTSD. The loss of personal space and the constant pressure to conform would also lead to a sense of existential dread and hopelessness."
