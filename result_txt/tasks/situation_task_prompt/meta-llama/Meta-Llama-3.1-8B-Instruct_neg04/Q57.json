    "**Aquatic Habitat Expansion**: Design a futuristic underwater city that utilizes advanced materials and sustainable energy sources to thrive in the new ocean environment. The city would be a self-sustaining ecosystem, harnessing the power of ocean currents, thermal vents, and marine life to create a unique and thriving community. The city's architecture would be a blend of organic and synthetic elements, with towering kelp forests, iridescent domes, and glowing jellyfish-inspired streetlights.",
    "**Floating Archipelagos**: Envision a series of interconnected, modular floating islands that would serve as a new home for humanity. These islands would be designed to be highly adaptable, with adjustable buoyancy and solar-powered propulsion systems. They would be arranged in a constellation pattern to maximize space and create a sense of community, with lush gardens, innovative waste management systems, and cutting-edge renewable energy sources.",
    "**Subterranean Cities**: Imagine a network of interconnected underground cities that would provide a safe and stable environment for human habitation. These cities would be built into the sides of mountains or beneath the ocean floor, utilizing advanced geothermal energy and cutting-edge materials to create a comfortable and sustainable living space. The cities would be designed to be highly resilient, with built-in emergency systems and advanced life support systems.",
    "**Aerial Cities**: Picture a series of towering, aerodynamic cities that would be suspended high above the rising ocean levels. These cities would be designed to harness the power of wind and solar energy, with advanced aerodynamic systems and lightweight materials. They would be equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, including air recycling and water purification, to create a self-sustaining ecosystem.",
    "**Bio-Dome Cities**: Envision a series of massive, self-contained bio-domes that would be designed to mimic the conditions of a pre-ocean-rise world. These domes would be filled with a controlled atmosphere, complete with lush forests, sparkling waterfalls, and diverse wildlife. They would be powered by advanced renewable energy sources and would serve as a safe haven for humanity, providing a stable and sustainable environment for generations to come.
