    "**Invitations and Paper Products**: Traditional wedding invitations often contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples might struggle to find sustainable alternatives, such as recycled paper or digital invitations. Additionally, they may face pressure from family or friends to stick with traditional methods, leading to conflicts over eco-conscious choices versus conventional expectations.",
    "**Catering and Food Sourcing**: Finding caterers who prioritize local, organic, and seasonal ingredients can be difficult. Many caterers may not have experience with sustainable practices, which could lead to food waste or reliance on imported products. Couples must also consider dietary restrictions and preferences, making it essential to communicate clearly with caterers about their eco-friendly vision.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Coordinating transportation for guests while minimizing carbon footprints poses a challenge. Couples may need to arrange shuttles or carpooling options to reduce the number of individual cars traveling to the venue. This requires careful planning and communication with guests to ensure everyone can arrive sustainably, which can be complicated and may lead to logistical issues on the day of the event.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Sourcing wedding attire that is both stylish and sustainable can be difficult. Many couples may struggle to find dresses and suits made from organic or recycled materials, and there may be limited options for rentals. Additionally, the desire to have unique, personalized attire may lead to purchasing new items, which can contradict eco-friendly principles.",
    "**Decor and Floral Arrangements**: Selecting decorations and flowers that are sustainable can be a daunting task. Couples may find it challenging to locate local florists who source flowers sustainably or who can create arrangements from seasonal blooms. Moreover, they must consider how to repurpose or compost decorations after the event, which requires additional planning and creativity."
