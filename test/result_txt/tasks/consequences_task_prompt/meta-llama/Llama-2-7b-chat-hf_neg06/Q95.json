This could lead to a more just and equitable society, where the needs of all individuals are taken into account.",
    "Increased focus on diplomacy and negotiation: With the removal of violence as a means of resolving conflicts, there would be a greater emphasis on diplomacy and negotiation. This could lead to more effective and sustainable solutions to conflicts, as people would be forced to find creative and peaceful ways to resolve disputes.",
    "New forms of conflict resolution: As people become more skilled in non-violent conflict resolution, new forms of conflict resolution would emerge. This could include mediation, arbitration, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. These new methods would allow for more efficient and effective conflict resolution, leading to a more peaceful and harmonious world."
