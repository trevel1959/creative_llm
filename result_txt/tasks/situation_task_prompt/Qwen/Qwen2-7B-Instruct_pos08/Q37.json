    "**Inverted Wheelchair**: Design an innovative wheelchair that allows users to move backwards effortlessly. This device can have a unique steering mechanism that enables the user to control the direction of movement by using their arms or legs. The wheels would be designed to rotate in reverse when commanded, allowing the user to navigate through spaces or terrain in a backward direction. The design could also incorporate sensors to detect obstacles and adjust accordingly, ensuring safety.",
    "**Backward-Facing Bicycle with Reverse Pedals**: Create a bicycle where the pedals are positioned at the rear, allowing the rider to pedal backwards. This bike would require a unique gear system that reverses the motion of the chain, converting backward pedaling into forward movement. To enhance maneuverability, the bike could have adjustable handlebars that pivot, enabling the rider to control the direction easily.",
    "**Reverse-Direction Scooter**: Develop a scooter with a motorized system that allows the user to steer and accelerate while moving backwards. The scooter could have two sets of wheels, one for forward movement and another for backward movement, connected by a flexible linkage. The rider would control the scooter's direction by adjusting the linkage, and the motors would provide power to either set of wheels based on the desired direction.",
    "**Backward-Driven Unicycle**: Design a unicycle that can move in both directions by reversing the rotation of its wheel. This would involve a sophisticated mechanical system that changes the direction of the wheel's rotation based on the rider's input. The unicycle could feature a joystick or lever to control the direction, offering a fun and challenging way to explore new environments.",
    "**Reversing Robotic Exoskeleton**: Create a wearable robotic exoskeleton that can assist individuals in moving backwards by applying force to their legs or feet. This exoskeleton would be equipped with advanced sensors and actuators that monitor the user's movements and apply the necessary force to enable backward motion. The design could include features like knee and hip joint extensions specifically tailored for backward walking, making it easier for the user to navigate in reverse. This could be particularly useful for individuals with mobility issues who want to explore their surroundings from a different perspective."
