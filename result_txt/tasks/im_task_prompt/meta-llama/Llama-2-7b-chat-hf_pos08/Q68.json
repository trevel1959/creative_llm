    "Create a smart calculator that can recognize handwritten math symbols and equations. This calculator would use AI algorithms to recognize the handwriting and convert it into digital format, making it easy for users to solve complex math problems without needing to type them in.",
    "Develop a calculator app that can generate music based on mathematical formulas. Users can input a math problem, and the app will generate a unique musical composition based on the solution. This app would appeal to those interested in both math and music, and could be a fun way to teach mathematical concepts.",
    "Create a wearable calculator that can be worn as a wristband or pendant. This calculator would be equipped with sensors and AI algorithms that can perform complex calculations based on the user's body movements. For example, a user could use their hand gestures to input numbers, or their foot movements to perform multiplication and division.",
    "Develop a virtual reality math game that allows players to solve math problems in a virtual world. Players could explore a virtual environment and complete math challenges to progress through levels. This game would make learning math more engaging and interactive, and could be a fun way to motivate students to learn.",
    "Create a calculator that can generate 3D printed objects based on mathematical equations. Users can input a math problem, and the calculator will generate a 3D model of the solution. This could be a fun and creative way for students to visualize and understand complex math concepts, and could also be useful for architects and engineers."
