    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology within the cap of the water bottle that activates when the bottle is closed. This would sanitize the interior surfaces and eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring that the water remains clean and safe to drink without the need for regular washing.",
    "**Temperature Control System**: Develop a water bottle with built-in temperature regulation technology. Using thermoelectric materials, the bottle could maintain beverages at a desired temperature for extended periods. Users could set the temperature through an app, ensuring that their drinks are always at the perfect chill or warmth.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular water bottle that can be customized with interchangeable parts. Users could add or remove components such as a filter for infusing fruits, a compartment for snacks, or even a collapsible cup. This versatility would cater to various lifestyles, whether for outdoor adventures, gym sessions, or everyday use.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the water bottle using biodegradable or recycled materials that decompose naturally after disposal. Additionally, the design could incorporate a reward system for returning used bottles to a designated recycling point, promoting sustainability and reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) Experience**: Design the water bottle with an AR feature that can be accessed through a smartphone camera. When scanned, the bottle could display hydration tips, interactive games to encourage drinking water, or educational content about the importance of hydration and environmental conservation."
