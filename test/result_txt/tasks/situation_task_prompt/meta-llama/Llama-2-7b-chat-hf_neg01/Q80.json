    "Bartering System: In a world without paper money or coins, people could resort to a bartering system. This means exchanging goods or services directly without using money. For example, a farmer could exchange fresh produce for a haircut or a carpenter could exchange wooden furniture for a painting. This system would promote a more personal and local economy, where people rely on each other for goods and services.",
    "Digital Wallets: With the rise of digital payments, people could use digital wallets to store and transfer value. These wallets could be linked to a person's bank account or cryptocurrency, allowing them to make purchases online or in-person. Digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, or cryptocurrency wallets like Bitcoin could become the new standard for transactions.",
    "Smart Tattoos: A new technology could emerge where people can have a small tattoo-like device implanted under their skin that stores their payment information. This device, called a \"smart tattoo,\" could be scanned at checkout counters to make purchases. The tattoo could also be used for identity verification and security purposes, making it a more secure alternative to cash.",
    "Holographic Displays: Advanced holographic displays could become the new way to display prices and make purchases. Instead of paper money or coins, holographic displays could project 3D images of products, allowing customers to see the product from all angles and interact with it virtually. This technology could also allow for more detailed product information, such as reviews or product descriptions, to be displayed alongside the holographic image.",
    "Community Currencies: In a world without traditional currency, communities could create their own local currencies. These currencies could be based on the value of goods and services within the community, such as time, skills, or resources. For example, a community could create a \"time dollar\" that is equivalent to one hour of work, and people could exchange time for goods and services. This system would promote a more collaborative and mutually supportive economy, where people rely on each other for survival."
