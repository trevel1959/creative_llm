    "**Financial Infeasibility**: The construction of a sustainable living community could be economically unviable due to high upfront costs, maintenance expenses, or the need for expensive technology to support sustainable practices. This could lead to financial strain on residents, making it difficult for them to afford living in the community.",
    "**Social Isolation**: A sustainable living community might inadvertently create social isolation among its residents. For example, if the community is designed to be self-sufficient and isolated from the outside world, residents might struggle to maintain relationships with people outside the community, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.",
    "**Inequitable Access**: The sustainable living community might not be accessible to all, potentially exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities. For instance, the high upfront costs or limited availability of the community could make it inaccessible to low-income individuals or marginalized groups.",
    "**Technological Dependence**: A sustainable living community might rely too heavily on technology to support its sustainable practices, making it vulnerable to technological failures or cyber attacks. This could compromise the community's ability to maintain a sustainable lifestyle.",
    "**Community Conflicts**: The construction of a sustainable living community could lead to conflicts among its residents. For example, disagreements over resource allocation, decision-making processes, or differing values and beliefs could arise, potentially threatening the community's cohesion and stability."
