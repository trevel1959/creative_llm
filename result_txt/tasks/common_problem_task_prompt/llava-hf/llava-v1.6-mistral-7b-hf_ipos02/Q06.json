    "**Radiation Exposure**: Mars is bombarded with high levels of radiation from the sun and cosmic rays. This can lead to a higher risk of radiation sickness and cancer for those living on the planet.",
    "**Temperature Extremes**: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with temperatures reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius during the day and dropping to -100 degrees Celsius at night. This would require effective thermal control systems to maintain a comfortable living environment.",
    "**Scarce Resources**: Mars has very limited natural resources, which would make it difficult to sustain a human colony. This includes a scarcity of water, which would need to be extracted from the Martian soil or imported from Earth.",
    "**Gravity and Musculoskeletal Issues**: Mars has only about 38% of Earth's gravity, which could lead to muscle atrophy and bone density loss over time. This would require regular exercise and bone strengthening measures to maintain health.",
    "**Psychological Isolation**: The isolation from Earth and the small size of any potential Mars colony could lead to psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. This would require effective mental health support and strategies to maintain the well-being of the inhabitants."
