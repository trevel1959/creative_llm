    "Pedal-Powered Public Transportation: In a world without bicycles, people could rely on pedal-powered public transportation, such as pedal-powered buses or trains. These vehicles would be powered by individuals pedaling in tandem, using specialized pedals connected to a central hub. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation, while also promoting exercise and community building.",
    "Personal Flight Devices: Without bicycles, individuals could use personal flight devices, such as jetpacks or hoverboards, to get around. These devices would use electric or gasoline-powered propulsion systems, allowing people to travel short to medium distances quickly and efficiently. Additionally, these devices could be designed with safety features, such as stability sensors and emergency parachutes, to ensure safe and reliable transportation.",
    "Electric Skateboards: Electric skateboards could become a popular mode of transportation in a world without bicycles. These boards would use electric motors to propel riders, allowing them to travel quickly and efficiently over short distances. They could be powered by rechargeable batteries, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option. Additionally, electric skateboards could be designed with advanced safety features, such as automatic braking systems, to ensure safe and reliable transportation.",
    "Water-Based Transportation: In a world without bicycles, people could turn to water-based transportation, such as boats or personal watercraft, to get around. These vessels could be powered by electric motors or human-powered paddles, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation. Additionally, water-based transportation could be designed with advanced safety features, such as collision avoidance systems, to ensure safe and reliable transportation.",
    "Hyperloop Systems: In a world without bicycles, hyperloop systems could become a popular mode of transportation. Hyperloops are vacuum-sealed tubes that use magnetic levitation technology to propel vehicles at high speeds. These systems could be powered by electricity, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option. Additionally, hyperloop systems could be designed with advanced safety features, such as emergency braking systems, to ensure"
