    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Replaceable Heads**: Create a toothbrush made from biodegradable materials, with a design that allows users to replace only the brush head instead of the entire toothbrush. This would significantly reduce plastic waste while maintaining a sustainable approach. The replaceable heads could come in various bristle types and colors, allowing for customization and personalization.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**: Innovate a toothbrush that integrates a small, rechargeable water flosser within its design. Users could switch between brushing and flossing modes, allowing for a more comprehensive oral care routine in one device. This would save time and encourage individuals to floss regularly, which is often overlooked in daily dental hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with UV Sanitizer**: Introduce a toothbrush that features a built-in UV-C light sanitizer within the base. After brushing, users can place the toothbrush back in its holder, which activates the UV light to kill bacteria and viruses on the bristles. This added feature would ensure a cleaner brushing experience and promote better oral health by reducing the risk of reinfection or gum disease.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**: Design a toothbrush specifically for children that incorporates interactive elements, such as a built-in timer that plays fun music or stories while they brush. The toothbrush could light up or vibrate to signal when to switch areas in the mouth, making brushing a more engaging and enjoyable experience for kids, ultimately fostering good dental habits from a young age.",
    "**Toothbrush with Aroma Therapy**: Create a toothbrush that releases a pleasant aroma during brushing. The handle could contain small capsules of essential oils that, when pressed, release a soothing scent like peppermint or eucalyptus. This would enhance the brushing experience by making it more enjoyable and refreshing, potentially encouraging longer brushing sessions."
