    "One possible solution is to use technology to enable the starfish to move on land. This could involve the development of specialized wheels or tracks that can be attached to the starfish's body, allowing it to move around more easily.",
    "Another idea is to use technology to enhance the starfish's natural abilities. For example, it may be possible to develop a device that can help the starfish sense its surroundings and navigate more effectively.",
    "A third idea is to use ruler technology to help the starfish move on land. This could involve the development of a device that can help the starfish sense the ground beneath its body and use that information to guide its movements.",
