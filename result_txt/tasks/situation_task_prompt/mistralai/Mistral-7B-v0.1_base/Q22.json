    "With all roads, it probably wouldn't be too difficult for me to move around my city. If I have to move around it, I will use a car or I can walk. If I want to move my bikes, I can use the bike too, but I will probably walk because it would be faster. If I want to move my motorcycle, I will use the car or I can walk.",
    "I can either walk or bike. If I bike, I have to be careful in the morning because the streets can be very busy at that time. If I walk, I need to be sure the sidewalk is clear of obstacles like cars, or trees fallen from storms or other large objects that could cause accidents to pedestrians like me.",
    "I could try to move around my city by using bicycle. However, it wont be easy. I could ride it to the nearest highway and use it from there. Alternatively, I could use a car and drive from house-to-house. But, I guess bicycle would be the safest transportation option.",
    "Well, there are many roads in the city. So, it would be very difficult to move around in the city. However, there may be some roads that I can use. For example, there are some roads that I can access from my house with the bicycle. Or I can take a public bus, which would be slower but less expensive. However, these roads are not very useful for moving around. So, the most effective way to do so is to walk in these roads.",
    "There are many ways to move around a city. I could walk, bike, drive a car, ride the train, take the subway or bus. I also can use the airplane if I need to travel far."
