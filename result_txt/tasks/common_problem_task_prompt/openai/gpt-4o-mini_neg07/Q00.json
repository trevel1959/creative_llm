    "**Guest List Overwhelm**: Parents often struggle with deciding whom to invite. Inviting too many children can lead to chaos, while inviting too few might hurt feelings. To tackle this, create a list of close friends and family, and consider the child’s social circle at preschool or playgroups. Also, limit the number to a manageable size based on the venue space and activities planned.",
    "**Age-Appropriate Activities**: Planning activities that are engaging and suitable for a 5-year-old can be challenging. Activities that are too complex may frustrate the children, while those that are too simple might bore them. A solution is to include a mix of structured games (like a treasure hunt) and free play areas with toys or crafts, ensuring there’s something for every child’s interest level.",
    "**Food Preferences and Allergies**: Children can be picky eaters, and dietary restrictions (like allergies) can complicate food choices. To avoid this issue, send out a simple RSVP that includes a question about food allergies and preferences. Offer a variety of options, including healthy snacks, sweets, and alternatives for common allergens, ensuring there’s something for everyone.",
    "**Weather Contingencies**: If the party is planned outdoors, bad weather can disrupt the event. To mitigate this risk, have a backup plan ready, such as an indoor location or renting a tent. Keep an eye on the weather forecast leading up to the party, and communicate with guests about any changes to the venue or schedule.",
    "**Engagement of Parents**: Often, parents stay at the party with their children, which can lead to a mix of engagement and distraction. Some parents may feel left out if they’re not involved in activities. To address this, plan a few parent-friendly activities or provide a comfortable space for them to socialize while still keeping an eye on their kids. This ensures that everyone feels included."
