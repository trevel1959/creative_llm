    "**Multi-Function Tape Dispenser**: Design a tape dispenser that can hold various types of tape (e.g., masking tape, duct tape, washi tape) in interchangeable cartridges. Users can easily switch between tapes without needing multiple dispensers. Each cartridge would have a built-in cutter designed specifically for the tape type, ensuring clean cuts every time.",
    "**Ergonomic Tape Dispenser**: Create a tape dispenser with an ergonomic design that fits comfortably in the hand, featuring a rubberized grip and a pivoting arm for easy tape application at various angles. This would reduce strain during prolonged use, making it ideal for artists, crafters, and office workers.",
    "**Magnetic Tape Dispenser**: Incorporate a magnetic base into the tape dispenser, allowing it to stick to metal surfaces like filing cabinets, desks, or workbenches. This would keep the dispenser within easy reach and reduce clutter on the workspace, especially in busy environments.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Tape Dispenser**: Develop a tape dispenser made from biodegradable or recycled materials. Additionally, offer refillable tape options that use sustainable materials, such as paper or plant-based adhesives. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers looking to reduce their plastic waste.",
    "**Interactive Tape Dispenser**: Introduce a tape dispenser that features a small built-in projector or LED screen displaying tutorials, tips, or creative ideas for using tape in various projects. This could inspire users to explore new crafting techniques or ways to organize their space with tape."
