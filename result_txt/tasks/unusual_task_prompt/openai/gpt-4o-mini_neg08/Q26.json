    "**Pet Toy**: Create a fun and engaging toy for your pets by cutting a small hole in the tennis ball and inserting treats inside. This will encourage your dog or cat to play and work for their rewards. You can also attach a rope to the ball for a tug-of-war game or throw it for fetch.",
    "**Wall Protector**: Cut a tennis ball in half and use the two halves to protect the walls from damage caused by doorknobs. Simply attach the halves to the wall at the height of the doorknob using adhesive or screws. This will absorb the impact and prevent unsightly dents or scratches.",
    "**Planter Drainage**: Use tennis balls as a drainage layer in potted plants. Place a few tennis balls at the bottom of a pot before adding soil. They will allow excess water to drain while also providing aeration to the roots. This is especially useful for plants that require well-draining soil.",
    "**DIY Key Holder**: Cut a small slit in a tennis ball and mount it on a wall or near your door. Use it as a quirky key holder by inserting your keys into the slit. This will not only keep your keys organized but also add a fun decorative element to your entryway.",
    "**Shoe Freshener**: Place a tennis ball in each shoe when you're not wearing them to help absorb moisture and odors. The felt material can wick away some moisture, and the ball's shape will help maintain the shoe's structure. This is especially helpful for athletic shoes that are prone to dampness."
