    "Tape measure with a built-in level: A tape measure with a built-in level feature would allow users to measure and ensure that surfaces are perfectly level and plumb. This would be especially useful for tasks such as hanging pictures, installing shelves, or laying out a floor plan.",
    "Tape measure with a built-in ruler: A tape measure with a built-in ruler would provide users with both measurement units in one convenient tool. This would eliminate the need to switch between a tape measure and a ruler, making it easier and faster to measure distances and objects.",
    "Tape measure with a magnetic tip: A tape measure with a magnetic tip would allow users to measure and mark distances on metal surfaces without leaving marks or residue. This would be useful for tasks such as hanging metal signs, installing pipes, or measuring the distance between metal studs.",
    "Tape measure with a retractable hook: A tape measure with a retractable hook would allow users to easily measure around corners or in tight spaces without having to coil the tape measure. This would be especially useful for tasks such as measuring the circumference of a pipe or measuring the distance around a corner in a wall.",
    "Tape measure with a built-in laser distance sensor: A tape measure with a built-in laser distance sensor would allow users to measure distances quickly and accurately without having to physically extend the tape measure. This would be useful for tasks such as measuring the distance between two points, measuring the height of a room, or measuring the size of an object from a distance."
