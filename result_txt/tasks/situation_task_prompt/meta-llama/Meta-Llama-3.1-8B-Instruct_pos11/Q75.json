    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Implement a network of hydrogen fueling stations across the globe, allowing vehicles to switch to a clean-burning, zero-emission fuel source. This would involve a massive infrastructure overhaul, but the benefits to the environment and public health would be significant.",
    "**Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries**: Develop and deploy advanced battery technologies that enable electric vehicles to travel longer distances without recharging. This could involve the use of solid-state batteries, graphene-based batteries, or other innovative materials. As the battery technology improves, electric vehicles would become a more viable option for widespread adoption.",
    "**Solar-Powered Vehicles**: Design and manufacture vehicles with integrated solar panels that generate electricity to power the vehicle. This could be achieved through the use of advanced solar panels, lightweight materials, and optimized vehicle design. Solar-powered vehicles would be ideal for short-distance travel, reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) Transportation**: Develop a global network of Maglev transportation systems, which use magnetic levitation to propel vehicles at high speeds while reducing energy consumption. This technology has the potential to revolutionize public transportation, making it faster, cleaner, and more efficient.",
    "**Bio-Based Fuels**: Investigate and develop bio-based fuels derived from renewable sources such as algae, agricultural waste, or municipal waste. These fuels could be used in existing internal combustion engines with minimal modifications, providing a transitional solution until more advanced technologies become widespread."
