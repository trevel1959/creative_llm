    "**Integrated Technology Hub**: Transform the chair into a multifunctional tech hub by integrating wireless charging pads, Bluetooth speakers, and USB ports. The armrests could feature touch controls for adjusting sound levels or connecting to devices. This would create a seamless experience for users who often work or relax with their devices, minimizing clutter and enhancing convenience.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Lighting**: Incorporate ambient LED lighting into the chair’s design. Users could customize the color and intensity of the lights to match their mood or activity—soft blues for relaxation, vibrant reds for energy, or warm whites for focus. The lighting could also change based on the time of day or the user’s preferences, promoting a calming environment or stimulating productivity.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular chair that can be easily transformed for different uses. For instance, the chair could be adjusted to become a lounge chair, a desk chair, or even a recliner. By allowing users to swap out components (like armrests, backrests, or cushions), the chair could cater to various activities and personal preferences, making it versatile for different settings.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Innovate the chair’s construction by using sustainable, biodegradable materials that not only provide comfort but also reduce environmental impact. For example, a chair made from mycelium (fungus) or recycled ocean plastics could appeal to eco-conscious consumers. This approach could also include a take-back program for recycling worn-out chairs into new products.",
    "**Built-in Massage Functionality**: Integrate a gentle massage feature into the chair, using vibrating motors strategically placed in the backrest and seat. Users could choose different settings (e.g., shiatsu, rolling, or tapping) to help relieve tension during long hours of sitting. This could enhance relaxation and improve circulation, making it ideal for both home and office environments."
