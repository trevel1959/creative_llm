    "**Overheating**: When assembling a computer, overheating can become a significant issue, especially if the cooling system is inadequate or improperly installed. High temperatures can lead to hardware failure or reduced performance. To address this, builders should invest in quality cooling solutions, such as aftermarket CPU coolers or additional case fans, and ensure proper airflow within the case. Thermal paste application on the CPU should also be done carefully to optimize heat dissipation.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Static electricity can easily damage sensitive computer components, such as the CPU or RAM, during assembly. If not handled correctly, a simple static discharge can render parts inoperable. To prevent this, builders should use anti-static wrist straps, work on non-static surfaces, and handle components by their edges rather than touching the circuitry.",
    "**Incorrect Wiring**: Wiring errors can lead to a host of problems, from failure to power on to short circuits. Builders may misconnect the power supply cables, especially the motherboard power connectors, or fail to connect front panel connectors (like power switch, reset switch, etc.) correctly. To avoid this, it's crucial to follow the motherboard manual closely and double-check connections before powering on the system.",
    "**Software Installation Hurdles**: After hardware assembly, software installation can pose its own set of challenges. Issues such as incorrect BIOS settings, driver incompatibilities, or failure to recognize the operating system can arise. Builders should ensure that they have the latest drivers and a compatible operating system ready to install. Additionally, it may be helpful to update the BIOS before installing the OS to ensure the best compatibility with new hardware.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Building a computer can quickly become expensive, especially if the builder is not mindful of their budget. Unplanned purchases, like additional cooling systems or upgraded components, can lead to financial strain. To avoid this, it's essential to create a detailed budget before starting the build and stick to it. Researching and comparing prices across different retailers can also help in staying within budget."
