    "Insufficient Funding: Another potential problem is insufficient funding. Charity events require a significant amount of money to cover expenses such as venue rental, catering, and marketing. If the budget is not sufficient, it may be challenging to provide the necessary resources for the event. To address this issue, consider reaching out to local businesses or organizations for sponsorships or donations.",
    "Conflicting Schedules: Organizing a charity event can be challenging due to conflicting schedules of volunteers and participants. It may be difficult to find a date and time that works for everyone, which can lead to delays or cancellations. To address this issue, consider using online scheduling tools or holding virtual events to accommodate different schedules.",
    "Lack of Promotion: A lack of promotion can lead to low attendance at the charity event, which can result in lower fundraising amounts. To address this issue, consider using social media platforms, email marketing, or local advertising to promote the event.",
    "Unforeseen Circumstances: Unforeseen circumstances such as inclement weather or last-minute cancellations can cause disruptions to the event. To address this issue, consider having a backup plan or contingency measures in place to ensure the event can continue as scheduled.",
    "Logistical Challenges: Organizing a charity event can be logistically challenging, especially when it comes to coordinating the transportation and accommodation of participants. To address this issue, consider partnering with local hotels or transportation companies to provide discounted rates for participants."
