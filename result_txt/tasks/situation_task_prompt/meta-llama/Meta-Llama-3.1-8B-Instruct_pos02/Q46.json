    "**Trash Can Substitution with Biodegradable Bags**: In the absence of traditional trash cans, people could use biodegradable bags to collect their waste. These bags would be made from natural materials like cornstarch or sugarcane and could be easily composted, reducing the need for landfills. The bags could be placed in designated areas, such as street corners or community centers, where they would be collected regularly.",
    "**Community Composting Centers**: Neighborhoods could establish community composting centers where residents could bring their organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings. These centers would use advanced composting technology to break down the waste into nutrient-rich soil, which could then be used in local gardens and parks.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Systems**: With the absence of traditional trash cans, people could focus on implementing waste-to-energy systems that convert organic waste into electricity or heat. This could be achieved through anaerobic digestion or gasification processes, providing a sustainable source of energy.",
    "**Zero-Waste Shopping**: Retailers could adopt zero-waste shopping practices by providing customers with reusable containers and bags for their purchases. This would eliminate the need for single-use packaging and reduce waste generation.",
    "**Urban Agriculture**: Without trash cans, cities could focus on urban agriculture, using vacant lots and rooftops to grow food and reduce waste. This would not only provide fresh produce to local communities but also create green spaces and improve air quality."
