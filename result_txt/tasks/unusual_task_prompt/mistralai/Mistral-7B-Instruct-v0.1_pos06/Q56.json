    "Create a smart camera assistant that uses AI and machine learning to help users take better photos. The assistant can analyze the scene and suggest the best settings for the camera, such as exposure, focus, and composition. It can also offer tips and suggestions on how to improve photography skills.",
    "Develop a camera that can capture 3D images. The camera would use a combination of sensors and software to create a 3D image of the scene. This could be useful for architectural photography, product photography, and other applications where a 3D image is needed.",
    "Create a camera that can capture slow-motion video. The camera would use advanced image processing algorithms to slow down the video in real-time, allowing users to see action in slow motion. This could be useful for sports photography, action movies, and other applications where slow-motion video is needed.",
    "Develop a camera that can capture infrared images. The camera would use a special sensor to capture light in the infrared spectrum, allowing users to see objects that are not visible to the naked eye. This could be useful for medical imaging, security surveillance, and other applications where infrared imaging is needed.",
    "Create a camera that can capture images in extreme environments. The camera would be designed to withstand harsh conditions, such as extreme temperatures, high radiation levels, and high pressure. This could be useful for scientific research, space exploration, and other applications where cameras need to be able to function in extreme environments."
