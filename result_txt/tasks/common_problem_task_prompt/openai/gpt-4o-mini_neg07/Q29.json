    "**Environmental Hazards**: The deep sea is home to unpredictable environmental conditions, such as sudden currents, underwater volcanic activity, or encounters with marine life. A sudden change in water pressure or temperature could damage equipment or put the crew in danger. To address this, the mission should include thorough environmental assessments and contingency plans for extreme conditions.",
    "**Limited Visibility**: Deep-sea environments often have very low light levels, which can hinder visibility and navigation. Relying solely on artificial lights can create shadows and distort the perception of distance. To counter this, the exploration team should incorporate advanced imaging technologies like sonar mapping and infrared cameras to improve navigation and situational awareness.",
    "**Crew Fatigue and Psychological Stress**: Long-duration missions can lead to crew fatigue and psychological stress due to confinement, isolation, and the pressure of deep-sea conditions. This can affect decision-making and teamwork. Implementing a structured schedule with regular breaks, mental health support, and recreational activities can help maintain morale and focus among the crew.",
    "**Data Collection and Analysis Challenges**: Gathering data in the deep sea involves complex procedures, and analyzing that data in real-time can be challenging. There may be issues with data integrity, storage, or transmission to the surface. To enhance data management, the team should utilize robust data logging systems and ensure that data is backed up both on the submersible and at the surface station.",
    "**Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Deep-sea exploration may raise legal and ethical issues regarding territorial waters, environmental protection, and the preservation of marine ecosystems. Activities such as sample collection or mining could lead to disputes or harm to fragile habitats. To address these concerns, the mission should adhere to international regulations and collaborate with marine conservation organizations to ensure responsible exploration practices."
