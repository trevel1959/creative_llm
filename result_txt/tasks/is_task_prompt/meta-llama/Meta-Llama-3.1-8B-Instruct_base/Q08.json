    "**Cloudhopper Academy**: A school that exists within a constantly shifting, puffy cloud. The students, known as Cloudhoppers, learn to navigate and adapt to the ever-changing environment. The cloud is divided into different levels, each representing a different subject or discipline. Students can \"hop\" between levels to learn new skills, and the cloud's malleability allows for immersive, hands-on experiences. For example, in the \"Weather Wizardry\" level, students can manipulate the cloud's temperature and humidity to create realistic simulations of various weather conditions.",
    "**Cirrostratus University**: A school that exists within the cirrostratus clouds, a type of high-level cloud that often forms a uniform veil. The university is a massive, sprawling complex of interconnected clouds, with different departments and faculties housed within separate cloud formations. Students can move between departments using specialized, cloud-hopping technology that allows them to traverse the vast, cloudy expanse. The cirrostratus clouds provide a unique backdrop for learning, with the ever-changing light and shadow creating an otherworldly atmosphere.",
    "**Stratocumulus School of the Arts**: A school that exists within the stratocumulus clouds, a type of cloud that forms a layered, rolled mass. The school is a vibrant, creative community that celebrates the intersection of art and science. Students can learn a wide range of skills, from painting and sculpture to engineering and physics, all within the context of the dynamic, ever-changing cloud environment. The stratocumulus clouds provide a rich source of inspiration for artistic expression, with their rolling waves and layered formations creating a constantly shifting palette of colors and textures.",
    "**Cumulonimbus Creative Lab**: A school that exists within the cumulonimbus clouds, a type of cloud that can reach heights of over 10,000 meters. The lab is a cutting-edge research facility that brings together students and faculty from a wide range of disciplines to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. The cumulonimbus clouds provide a unique environment for experimentation and innovation, with their towering vertical development and intense updrafts creating a dynamic, high-energy atmosphere. Students can learn from the latest research and technologies, and work on real-world projects that address issues such as climate change, sustainable energy, and disaster relief.",
    "**Altocumulus Academy of Exploration**: A school that exists within the altocumulus clouds, a type of cloud that forms a series of rounded, lumpy masses. The academy"
