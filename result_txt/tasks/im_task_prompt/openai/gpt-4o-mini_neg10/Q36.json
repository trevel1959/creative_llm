    "**Self-Sharpening Knife**: Design a knife that has a built-in sharpening mechanism. This could work using a small grinding wheel that activates every time the knife is sheathed. The grinding wheel would sharpen the blade just enough to maintain its edge without excessive wear, ensuring that the knife is always ready for use and reducing the need for manual sharpening.",
    "**Ergonomic Adaptive Handle**: Create a knife with an adjustable handle that molds to the user's grip. Using a memory foam-like material that conforms to the user's hand, this knife would provide optimal comfort and control, reducing strain during prolonged use. Additionally, it could have interchangeable grips for different tasks, such as a thicker grip for chopping or a thinner grip for precision slicing.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Knife**: Develop a knife that integrates with a mobile app to offer guided cooking experiences. The knife could have a built-in microphone and speaker, allowing it to provide verbal instructions for recipes as you chop, dice, or slice. This would help novice cooks learn techniques while they cook, making the process more engaging and less intimidating.",
    "**Color-Coded Safety Knife**: Introduce a knife with interchangeable color-coded blades that correspond to different types of food (e.g., red for meat, green for vegetables, blue for fish). This would help prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen and promote food safety. The handle could also have a locking mechanism to ensure that only the appropriate blade can be used for each type of food.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Scale**: Design a knife that has a small digital scale integrated into the blade or handle. This would allow users to weigh ingredients as they chop, providing precise measurements for recipes. The scale could sync with a mobile app to keep track of ingredient amounts and help users adjust their recipes on the fly."
