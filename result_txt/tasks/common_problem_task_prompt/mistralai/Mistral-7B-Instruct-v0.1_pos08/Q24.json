    "Organize cultural activities: Hosting a foreign exchange student is a great opportunity to share your culture with someone from a different country. You could organize cultural activities such as visiting museums, trying out new foods, and attending local festivals. This will help the student understand and appreciate your culture, and also give you a chance to learn more about theirs.",
    "Create a language exchange program: Since the student is coming from a different country, they may not speak your native language. You could create a language exchange program where you and the student practice speaking each other's languages. This will not only help the student improve their language skills, but also give you a chance to practice your own language skills.",
    "Plan a homestay experience: Hosting a foreign exchange student is a great opportunity to provide them with a homestay experience. You could plan out activities such as cooking together, watching movies, and going on outings. This will help the student feel more comfortable in their new environment and also give you a chance to bond with them.",
    "Teach life skills: Hosting a foreign exchange student can be a great opportunity to teach them life skills. You could teach them how to do household chores, how to use public transportation, and how to navigate their new community. This will not only help the student feel more independent, but also give you a chance to share your knowledge and experience with them.",
    "Arrange a mentorship program: Hosting a foreign exchange student can also be a great opportunity to arrange a mentorship program. You could pair the student with a mentor in your community who can help guide them through their new experience. This will not only help the student feel more supported, but also give you a chance to give back to your community by mentoring someone else."
