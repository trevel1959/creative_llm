    "Universal Gratitude Day: Establish a day where everyone in the world has to practice gratitude. This could be achieved by encouraging people to share three things they are thankful for each day, whether it's on social media, in a journal, or during a family dinner. This rule would foster a culture of positivity and appreciation, helping to combat negativity and cynicism.",
    "Time Limit on Social Media: Introduce a time limit on social media usage to prevent excessive screen time and its associated negative effects on mental health. For example, users could be limited to one hour of social media use per day, or they could be required to take a break from social media for a set period each week. This rule would encourage people to find healthier ways to spend their time and reduce the impact of social media on their lives.",
    "Free Education for All: Make education accessible and free for everyone in the world.

By investing in education, individuals and societies as a whole can benefit from increased knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.",
    "Mandatory Vacation Time: Require employers to provide a certain number of paid vacation days per year. This rule would help to combat burnout and improve work-life balance.
