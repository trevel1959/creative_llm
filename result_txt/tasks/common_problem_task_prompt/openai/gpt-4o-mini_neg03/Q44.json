    "**Location Challenges**: Choosing the right location is critical for a food truck's success. High foot traffic areas may require permits or fees, and finding a spot that isn't already saturated with competitors can be difficult. Additionally, certain locations may have restrictions on food trucks operating at certain times, which can limit business hours and customer reach.",
    "**Equipment and Maintenance Costs**: Food trucks require specialized equipment, such as grills, fryers, refrigerators, and generators. The initial investment can be substantial, and ongoing maintenance costs can add up. If equipment fails, it can lead to downtime and lost revenue, as well as potential health code violations if food storage is compromised.",
    "**Menu Development and Supply Chain Issues**: Crafting a unique and appealing menu is essential for attracting customers, but it also requires careful planning. Sourcing high-quality ingredients consistently can be challenging, especially if the food truck focuses on seasonal or local produce. Disruptions in the supply chain can lead to menu changes, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses.",
    "**Staffing and Labor Management**: Finding reliable staff who are skilled in food preparation and customer service can be difficult, especially in a competitive job market. Additionally, managing a small team in a confined space can lead to interpersonal conflicts and issues with communication. High turnover rates can also affect the quality of service and overall customer experience.",
    "**Weather Dependence**: Food trucks are particularly vulnerable to weather conditions. Rain, snow, or extreme heat can deter customers and reduce foot traffic, leading to inconsistent sales. This reliance on weather can make it difficult to predict income and manage cash flow, especially during seasonal changes."
