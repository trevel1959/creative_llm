    "Social Isolation: In a single city, people would be forced to interact with each other more often due to limited space. This could lead to social isolation as individuals may not have the freedom to choose who they want to spend time with or how much time they want to spend with them.",
    "Traffic Congestion: With all of the people living in one city, traffic congestion would become an even bigger problem than it is now. People would need to find new ways to get around, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation, which could take longer and be less convenient.",
    "Environmental Impact: A single city would have a significant impact on the environment, both positive and negative. On one hand, there would be fewer cars on the road, leading to reduced air pollution and noise pollution. On the other hand, the demand for resources such as water and energy would increase, leading to potential environmental degradation.",
    "Political Instability: In a single city, power would be concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or groups. This could lead to political instability as those in power may become corrupt or oppressive, leading to protests and uprisings.",
    "Economic Disruption: The transition from a collection of cities to a single city would cause economic disruption. Businesses would need to adapt to the new market conditions, and workers would need to retrain for new jobs. Additionally, the cost of living in the city would likely increase due to the concentration of resources and services."
