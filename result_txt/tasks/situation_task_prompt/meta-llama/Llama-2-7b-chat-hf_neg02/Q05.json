    "Solar-Powered Lamp Posts: Set up solar-powered lamp posts in strategic locations around the city to provide a reliable source of light during the day. These lamp posts could be equipped with high-efficiency solar panels and energy-storing batteries to ensure a consistent light supply.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting System: Develop a mirror-based lighting system that uses mirrors to reflect sunlight indoors during the day. This system could involve installing mirrors on the exterior walls of buildings to reflect sunlight into the interior spaces, providing natural light without the need for artificial sources.",
    "Light-Emitting Building Materials: Develop light-emitting building materials that can absorb sunlight during the day and emit light at night. These materials could be applied to various building components such as walls, roofs, and floors, providing a consistent and sustainable source of light.",
    "Urban Greenhouses: Establish urban greenhouses that can capture and store sunlight during the day for use at night. These greenhouses could be designed to maximize natural light absorption and energy storage, providing a reliable source of light for the surrounding areas.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Technology: Implement cloud-seeding technology to induce artificial sunlight during the day. This technology involves injecting saltwater particles into clouds to stimulate the formation of artificial sunlight, which could be harnessed and stored for use during the night."
