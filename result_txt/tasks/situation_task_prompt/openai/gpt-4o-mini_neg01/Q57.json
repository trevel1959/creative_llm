    "**Vertical Ocean Cities**: Skyscrapers designed to rise above the ocean, with the base submerged or partially submerged. These structures would be built using buoyant materials and advanced engineering techniques to withstand storms and flooding. Each level could serve different purposes, such as residential areas, offices, parks, and recreation spaces, with the top levels offering panoramic views of the ocean. These cities would be equipped with desalination plants and vertical farms to ensure a sustainable lifestyle.",
    "**Land-Reclamation Islands**: Create new islands through land reclamation, using materials from urban demolition and natural debris. These islands would be designed to house communities displaced by rising sea levels, featuring parks, homes, and infrastructure built to withstand flooding. The islands could also serve as biodiversity reserves, with native plants and wildlife encouraged to thrive, thus creating a harmonious balance between urban living and nature.",
    "**Submerged Habitats**: Living spaces designed to be partially or fully submerged underwater, allowing residents to experience marine life up close. These habitats would be constructed using transparent, pressure-resistant materials, providing stunning views of the ocean while maintaining a comfortable living environment. Each unit would be equipped with air filtration systems and renewable energy sources, creating a unique underwater community that blends modern living with ocean exploration.",
    "**Mountain Retreats**: Relocating to higher elevations, particularly in mountainous regions that are less affected by rising sea levels. These retreats would be designed as eco-friendly cabins or homes, incorporating renewable energy sources and sustainable building practices. Residents could cultivate gardens and orchards, harnessing rainwater for irrigation, and creating a self-sustaining lifestyle away from the coast. This shift would also promote a connection with nature and a simpler way of living.",
    "**Mobile Housing Units**: Develop modular, mobile homes that can be relocated as needed. These units would be built on floating platforms or trailers, allowing families to move to safer areas as sea levels rise. Equipped with solar panels, water purification systems, and small gardens, these homes would provide flexibility and adaptability in an uncertain future. Communities could form temporary networks, sharing resources and support as they navigate the challenges of rising ocean levels."
