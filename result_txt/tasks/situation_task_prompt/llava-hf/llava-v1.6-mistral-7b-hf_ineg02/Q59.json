    "**Indoor Gardens**: Indoor gardens could be a solution to bring natural light and a touch of nature indoors. These gardens would be designed to absorb and reflect sunlight, creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere.",
    "**Cloud-Harvesting Technology**: Cloud-harvesting technology could be used to capture and store water from clouds, providing a sustainable water source in regions with scarce rainfall. This technology could also be used to generate electricity by harnessing the energy from falling droplets.",
    "**Smart Window Coatings**: Smart window coatings that can change color and opacity in response to light conditions could help optimize the amount of sunlight entering a building. These coatings could be designed to let in more light on cloudy days and reduce glare on sunny days.",
    "**Urban Forests**: Urban forests could be planted in cities to help improve air quality, reduce the heat island effect, and provide shade. These forests would absorb sunlight and release oxygen, improving the overall environment.",
    "**Light-Harvesting Architecture**: Architects could design buildings with light-harvesting materials and structures that can capture and store sunlight. These buildings could be equipped with solar panels, mirrors, and other devices to maximize the amount of light they collect and distribute."
