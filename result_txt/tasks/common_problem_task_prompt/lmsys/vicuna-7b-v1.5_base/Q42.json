    "Data accuracy: Another potential problem with conducting a large-scale scientific experiment is ensuring the accuracy of the data collected. This is especially important when dealing with sensitive or potentially misleading data. To address this issue, it is important to have a clear protocol in place for data collection, analysis, and interpretation, as well as multiple layers of quality control to ensure the integrity of the data.",
    "Ethical considerations: When conducting a large-scale scientific experiment, there may be ethical considerations that need to be taken into account. This includes ensuring that the experiment is conducted in an ethical manner, with informed consent from all participants and proper protection of their rights and privacy. To address this issue, it is important to have a clear ethical framework in place and to have a dedicated ethics committee to oversee the experiment.",
    "Funding and resources: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment can be expensive and may require significant funding and resources. This can be a potential problem, especially if funding is not secured in advance or if resources are not available when needed. To mitigate this risk, it is important to have a detailed budget and funding plan in place, as well as contingency plans for when resources are scarce.",
    "Equipment and technology: Another potential problem with conducting a large-scale scientific experiment is ensuring that the necessary equipment and technology are available and functioning properly. This can be especially challenging when working with complex or specialized equipment. To address this issue, it is important to have a detailed plan for equipment acquisition and maintenance, as well as backup systems in place in case of equipment failure.",
    "Communication and collaboration: When conducting a large-scale scientific experiment, effective communication and collaboration among the research team is crucial. This includes not only communication within the team but also with external stakeholders, such as funders and regulatory agencies. To address this issue, it is important to have clear lines of communication in place, as well as a dedicated project manager to oversee communication and collaboration."
