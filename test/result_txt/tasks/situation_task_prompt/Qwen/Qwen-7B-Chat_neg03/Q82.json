    "Non-verbal Communication: In a world without language, we would have to rely on non-verbal communication methods such as sign language, facial expressions, body language, and gestures. We could also use physical objects or symbols to convey messages.",
    "Sound-based Communication: If there were no words to speak, we could still use sound-based communication techniques like whistling, humming, chirping, and drumming to convey information. This could be particularly useful in situations where we need to communicate over long distances or through barriers.",
    "Visual Art: Artistic expression could become an important form of communication in a world without language. Paintings, drawings, sculptures, and other visual art forms could be used to convey emotions, ideas, and stories.",
    "Physical Gestures: We could use physical gestures to communicate complex ideas or emotions that are difficult to express using words alone. For example, handshakes, hugs, and other physical touch points could be used to show support, empathy, and love.",
    "Written Language: While written language may not exist in a world without language, it's possible that we could develop new ways to write and read using alternative methods. For example, we could use braille, sign language, or even drawings to represent letters and words. Alternatively, we could develop a completely new system of writing and reading that doesn't rely on language at all."
