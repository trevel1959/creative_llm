    "Build floating islands: Create artificial islands using advanced materials and technologies that can sustain human life. These islands could be designed to provide shelter, food, and energy sources, allowing people to live and travel on them without the need for traditional boats or ships. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop underwater vehicles: Create submersibles or other underwater vehicles that can transport people and goods across large bodies of water. These vehicles could be powered by electricity or other sustainable energy sources, reducing the environmental impact of traditional boats and ships. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Utilize air-cushion technology: Develop air-cushion vehicles that can travel across large bodies of water without making contact with the water's surface. These vehicles could be powered by wind, solar, or other renewable energy sources, providing a sustainable and efficient means of transportation. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Create a network of underwater tunnels: Build a network of underwater tunnels that connect different landmasses, allowing people to travel across large bodies of water without the need for boats or ships. These tunnels could be powered by renewable energy sources and designed to accommodate various modes of transportation, including trains, cars, and bicycles. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Develop bio-inspired vessels: Draw inspiration from nature to design vessels that can travel across large bodies of water using minimal energy. For example, develop boats that mimic the movement of fish or jellyfish, using their natural movements to propel the vessel forward. Confidence Score: 0.85"
