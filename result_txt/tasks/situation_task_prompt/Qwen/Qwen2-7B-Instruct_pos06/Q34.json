    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: You could set up a system where rainwater is collected from rooftops or any elevated surfaces and stored in large tanks. The water can then be pumped through an irrigation system designed specifically for plants. This method mimics nature's rainwater distribution but ensures a consistent supply of water, even during dry spells. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Watering Ball System**: These are small, spherical devices filled with a water-absorbing gel that can hold up to 100 times its weight in water. They can be buried near plant roots, slowly releasing water as it evaporates from the soil. This method conserves water while ensuring that plants receive a steady supply. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Drip Irrigation**: By using a network of drip lines placed directly under plants, water is delivered directly to the root zone with minimal evaporation. This method uses less water than traditional sprinklers because it targets the plants' immediate needs without wasting water on leaves or paths. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Aquaponics**: This innovative method combines hydroponics (growing plants in water) with aquaculture (raising fish). Fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, which in turn filter the water for the fish. This closed-loop system can significantly reduce water usage compared to traditional gardening methods. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Evaporation Shield**: Create a simple structure made of transparent plastic sheets or a greenhouse-like setup that covers the soil around your plants. This reduces the amount of water lost to evaporation by trapping moisture close to the ground, allowing plants to use more of the water they receive. Confidence Score: 0.8"
