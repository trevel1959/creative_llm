    "Install a multi-purpose holder: Add a tray or compartment on top of the bread box to store other baking supplies, such as flour, sugar, or baking soda. This would allow for efficient use of limited kitchen space.",
    "Improve insulation: Make the bread box out of a better material, such as insulated foam or cork, to keep the bread fresher for longer periods of time. This will be especially beneficial for those who bake bread regularly and want to keep it fresh between bake times.",
    "Add a sliding tray: Incorporate a sliding tray inside the bread box to prevent uneven baking. This will allow for easy placement of loaves and ensure they are toasted evenly on all sides.",
    "Switch to an electronic design: Instead of using traditional cardboard or plastic, create the bread box out of recycled materials like bamboo or even recycled plastic bottles. This would reduce the box's environmental impact and make it more eco-friendly.",
    "Add built-in lighting: Install a small LED light inside the bread box to make it easier to find bread or baking supplies at night. This will be especially helpful for people who may not have sufficient lighting in their kitchen or who prefer to bake late at night or early in the morning."
