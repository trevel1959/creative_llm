    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning mechanism where users can simply add water and a drop of soap to the blender, select the self-cleaning mode, and the blender will agitate the mixture to clean itself. This feature could include a drying cycle that uses UV light to eliminate bacteria, making the blender hygienic and hassle-free.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular blender system where users can swap out components based on their needs. For example, different blades for smoothies, soups, or nut butters; containers of varying sizes; and even attachments for food processing. This would allow users to customize their blender experience and reduce waste by not having to buy multiple appliances.",
    "**Integrated Scale**: Add a built-in digital scale to the base of the blender. Users could weigh ingredients directly in the blender jar for precise measurements, eliminating the need for separate measuring cups. The scale could also have a tare function to subtract the weight of the container, making it easier to measure multiple ingredients.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign the blender using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, implement energy-efficient motors and energy-saving modes to reduce power consumption. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a greener lifestyle.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Introduce advanced noise-canceling technology that minimizes the sound produced during blending. This could involve acoustic insulation within the blenderâ€™s housing or a sound-dampening cover that users can place over the blender while in use. This feature would be particularly appealing for users in shared living spaces or those who blend early in the morning or late at night."
