    "Self-Watering Can: Create a watering can with an internal reservoir that maintains a constant water level. When the reservoir reaches a certain point, it triggers a pump or mechanism that dispenses water through a series of small holes at the bottom of the can. This ensures plants receive consistent moisture without the need for frequent refilling.",
    "Adjustable Flow Control: Design a watering can with a variety of nozzles and flow settings. Users can choose from different nozzle types (spray, jet, mist) and flow rates (low, medium, high) to suit specific plant needs and environments. This flexibility allows for more precise watering and better plant health.",
    "Integrated Plant Food Dispenser: Incorporate a small compartment into the watering can that holds plant food granules or liquid nutrients. A simple mechanism can release the nutrients into the water when the can is filled, providing plants with essential nutrients during watering. This eliminates the need for separate plant food application and ensures consistent nutrient delivery.",
    "Solar-Powered Pump: Introduce a solar-powered pump that can be attached to the watering can. The pump draws water from a reservoir, such as a rainwater harvesting system or a nearby pond, and delivers it to the plants. This eco-friendly solution reduces reliance on electricity and promotes sustainable gardening practices.",
    "Insect Repellent Infused Watering Can: Add a natural insect repellent, such as neem oil or citronella, to the water in the can. As the water is dispensed, it releases the repellent, protecting plants from pests. This can help maintain healthier plants and reduce the need for chemical pesticides."
