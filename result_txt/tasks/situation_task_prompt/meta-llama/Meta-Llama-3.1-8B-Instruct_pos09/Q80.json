    "**Bartering System 2.0**: With the disappearance of physical currency, people would rely on a modernized bartering system. This would involve using digital platforms and apps to exchange goods and services directly. For example, a person could offer a service like house cleaning in exchange for a meal at a local restaurant. The digital platform would facilitate the exchange, ensuring that both parties are satisfied with the transaction.",
    "**Time Banking**: In this system, people would earn and spend \"time credits\" instead of traditional currency. Time credits would be earned by contributing to the community, such as volunteering, helping neighbors, or participating in local events. These credits could then be redeemed for goods and services from other community members. This approach would foster a sense of community and social responsibility.",
    "**Skill-Based Economy**: The disappearance of physical currency would lead to a shift towards a skill-based economy. People would trade their unique skills and expertise for goods and services. For instance, a person with expertise in gardening could exchange their skills for food or other essential items. This system would promote self-sufficiency and encourage people to develop valuable skills.",
    "**Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)**: LETS would become a popular alternative to traditional currency. This system involves creating a local network where people exchange goods and services without using physical currency. Members would earn and spend \"units\" or \"credits\" that are specific to the local community. This approach would help stimulate local economies and foster community engagement.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: In this scenario, resources such as food, water, shelter, and healthcare would become the primary means of exchange. People would contribute to the community by providing these essential resources, and in return, they would receive access to the resources they need. This system would prioritize the well-being of all community members and promote a more equitable distribution of resources."
