    "**Self-Sustaining Ecosystem Greenhouse**: Design a futuristic, closed-loop greenhouse that utilizes a miniature, self-sustaining ecosystem to water plants. This system would mimic the natural water cycle, where condensation from the greenhouse's interior would be collected and reused to water the plants. The greenhouse would be equipped with a thin membrane that allows for gas exchange while preventing water loss, ensuring the plants receive the necessary moisture.",
    "**Water Harvesting System**: Develop a system that captures and stores rainwater from nearby rooftops, using a network of tubes and reservoirs to channel the water to the plants. This system would be powered by a small wind turbine or solar panel, ensuring a continuous supply of water even when rain is scarce.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Generator**: Create an innovative device that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments. This would involve using a membrane or filter that attracts water vapor, which is then condensed and collected. This device could be powered by a small solar panel or wind turbine, providing a sustainable source of water for the plants.",
    "**Hydroponic System with Recirculating Water**: Design a hydroponic system that recirculates water, minimizing waste and maximizing water efficiency. This system would use a nutrient-rich solution that is constantly cycled through the plants, ensuring they receive the necessary nutrients while minimizing water usage.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Water Collection System**: Develop a system that mimics the way certain plants collect water, such as the lotus leaf's ability to repel water. This system would use a specially designed surface that attracts and collects water droplets, which would then be channeled to the plants. This system would be powered by a small solar panel or wind turbine, ensuring a continuous supply of water.
