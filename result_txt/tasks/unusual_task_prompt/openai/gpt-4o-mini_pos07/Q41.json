    "**Herb Chopper**: If you have a manual pencil sharpener with a wider opening, it can be repurposed as a mini herb chopper. Place small sprigs of herbs like basil or parsley in the sharpener and twist to finely chop them. This method is not only fun but also provides a quick way to add fresh herbs to dishes.",
    "**Confetti Maker**: Instead of just sharpening pencils, use a pencil sharpener to create confetti from scrap paper or old greeting cards. By feeding the paper through the sharpener, you can produce colorful, small pieces that are perfect for decorating party invitations, gift wrap, or for use in crafts.",
    "**Scented Wood Chips**: Take your favorite scented wood pencils (like cedar or sandalwood) and sharpen them to create fragrant wood shavings. These can be used as natural air fresheners or potpourri in bowls around the house, adding a lovely aroma to your living space.",
    "**DIY Seed Starter**: Use the pencil sharpener's shavings as a base for seed starting. The wood shavings can be mixed with soil to create a lightweight and nutrient-rich medium for germinating seeds. This eco-friendly method not only recycles the shavings but also supports plant growth.",
    "**Fashionable Hair Accessory**: Get crafty by turning a pencil sharpener into a quirky hair accessory. Decorate it with beads, ribbons, or paint, and attach it to a hair clip or headband.
