    "**Innovative Use of Daily Objects**: Create a symphony using the sounds of daily objects. For instance, pots and pans can produce various tones when struck or shaken, creating a percussive rhythm. Glasses filled with water at different levels can be played like a xylophone. A keyboard could be made from metal pipes of varying lengths, tuned by the thickness of the pipe walls. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9 because it's creative, practical, and utilizes readily available materials.",
    "**Body Music**: Utilize the human body as an instrument. People can hum, sing, clap, stomp, or even make noises by blowing through their mouths or noses. The movements and vibrations of the body can be manipulated to create music. This can be enhanced by wearing specially designed clothing that adds additional sound-making elements, like whistles or bells. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85 due to its innovative nature and the potential for a unique musical experience.",
    "**Tactile Sound Creation**: Develop a system where participants touch specific points on a large, tactile surface to trigger pre-recorded or live-generated sounds. The surface could be covered in sensors that detect pressure, movement, or temperature changes, triggering different audio responses. This creates an interactive and multisensory experience. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8 because it combines technology with creativity to engage multiple senses.",
    "**Light-Based Music**: Design a light show where each color corresponds to a different pitch or instrument. Using LED lights, projectors, or laser beams, viewers could interpret light patterns as music. This could be particularly effective in dark environments or combined with ambient soundscapes. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75 as it leverages existing technology creatively but may require significant investment in equipment.",
    "**Immersive Audio Walks**: Create an audio walking tour where participants follow a path that leads them through a series of soundscapes, each representing a different genre or mood. The sounds are triggered as they pass through specific points, providing an interactive and spatially aware auditory experience. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7 because it requires a well-designed route and potentially complex audio engineering but offers a unique way to experience music."
