    "**Bartering Revolution**: In the absence of currency, people would have to rely on bartering as the primary means of exchange. This would lead to a resurgence of traditional skills and crafts, as people would need to trade goods and services directly. For instance, a baker might trade bread for a tailor's services, or a farmer might exchange vegetables for a musician's performance. This would create a more community-driven economy, where people would have to rely on each other's skills and resources to survive. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: Without currency, people would have to focus on producing and sharing resources directly. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, as people would have access to the resources they need without having to worry about monetary transactions. For example, a community might establish a shared garden, where everyone contributes to the maintenance and harvesting of the crops, and then distributes the produce based on need. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Time-Based Economy**: In a currency-less society, people might start trading time instead of goods and services. This could lead to a more balanced distribution of work and leisure, as people would have to contribute a certain amount of time to the community in exchange for the resources they need. For instance, a person might work for 20 hours a week in exchange for food, shelter, and healthcare. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Gift Economy**: Without currency, people might start relying on gift economies, where goods and services are exchanged without expectation of payment. This could lead to a more altruistic and generous society, where people focus on sharing and giving rather than accumulating wealth. For example, a community might establish a shared library, where people contribute books and other resources without expecting anything in return. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "**Post-Scarcity Economy**: In a world without currency, people might start focusing on abundance rather than scarcity. This could lead to a society where resources are produced and shared without limits, and people have access to everything they need without having to worry about monetary transactions. For instance, a community might establish a shared 3D printing facility, where people can print anything they need without having to pay for it. Confidence score: 0.5"
