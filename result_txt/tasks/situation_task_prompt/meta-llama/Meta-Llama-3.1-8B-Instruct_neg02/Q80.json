    "**Bartering Rebooted**: With the disappearance of physical currency, people would have to rely on bartering again. However, to make it more efficient and convenient, a digital platform could be created where individuals can offer goods and services in exchange for other goods and services. This platform could be linked to a person's social media or email account, allowing them to easily share what they have to offer and what they're looking for.

    "**Experience-Based Economy**: In a world without physical currency, people would have to focus on experiences and relationships rather than material possessions. An experience-based economy could be created where people's experiences and relationships are valued and exchanged for other experiences and relationships.
