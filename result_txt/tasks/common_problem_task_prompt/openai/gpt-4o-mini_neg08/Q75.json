    "**Wildlife Encounters**: With an increase in visitors, the likelihood of human-wildlife interactions rises. This can lead to dangerous situations for both visitors and animals. To address this, the park could introduce educational programs that teach visitors how to behave in wildlife encounters, along with clear signage in high-traffic areas. Additionally, employing trained wildlife rangers to monitor animal behavior and visitor compliance could help ensure safety.",
    "**Environmental Degradation**: Increased foot traffic and recreational activities can lead to soil erosion, damage to flora, and littering. To combat this, park management could establish designated trails and areas for specific activities, such as camping or picnicking. Regular clean-up events could also engage the community and visitors, fostering a sense of stewardship and responsibility towards the park's preservation.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often face budget constraints, which can limit maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. To tackle this, park management could explore partnerships with local businesses and non-profit organizations to secure sponsorships and grants. Implementing a donation system for visitors, where they can contribute towards specific projects or conservation efforts, could also help raise funds.",
    "**Climate Change Impacts**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and weather patterns. To address this issue, park management could develop a comprehensive climate action plan that includes habitat restoration projects, sustainable practices, and research initiatives. Collaborating with scientists and environmental organizations could enhance understanding and adaptation strategies.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Preservation**: Many national parks contain important cultural and historical sites that require protection. As visitor numbers increase, these sites can be at risk of damage or neglect. Park management should prioritize the documentation and preservation of cultural heritage, incorporating local Indigenous knowledge and practices. Regular workshops and guided tours could educate visitors about the significance of these sites, promoting respect and care."
