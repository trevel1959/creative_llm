    "Create a smart bowling ball that tracks the player's progress and provides personalized feedback to help them improve their game. The ball would use sensors to track the player's speed, spin, and trajectory, and provide real-time feedback on areas where they need to improve.",
    "Design a bowling ball that changes color based on the player's performance. For example, if the player is doing well, the ball might turn green, and if they're struggling, it might turn red. This could provide a fun and engaging way to motivate players to perform at their best.",
    "Create a bowling ball that doubles as a personal assistant. The ball could have a built-in speaker and microphone, allowing players to ask questions or set reminders while they play. This could be particularly useful for players who need to keep track of multiple things at once.",
    "Design a bowling ball that's made entirely of recycled materials. This could be a great way to reduce waste and promote sustainability in the sport. The ball could also have a unique design or pattern that reflects its eco-friendly nature.",
    "Create a bowling ball that's designed to be thrown with one hand. This could be a fun and challenging twist on the traditional game, and could be particularly useful for players who have limited mobility or who want to try something new. The ball would need to be designed to roll smoothly and accurately with one hand, and could have a unique shape or weight to make it more challenging."
