    "**Time Zone Coordination for Events**: Hosting live events, webinars, or online auctions can be challenging due to the global nature of the audience. Scheduling these events to accommodate participants from different time zones may lead to some regions being left out or having low participation rates. To address this, consider hosting multiple sessions of the same event at different times or using a staggered approach where events are recorded and available for later viewing.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Compliance**: Fundraising regulations vary widely across countries, with some requiring specific licenses or documentation to collect donations. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in legal issues or the inability to collect funds in certain regions. To mitigate this, conduct thorough research on the legal requirements for each country involved and potentially partner with local organizations that have experience in fundraising.",
    "**Technology and Internet Accessibility**: Not all regions have equal access to technology or reliable internet, which can hinder participation in online fundraising efforts. This disparity can create a divide in engagement levels, particularly between urban and rural populations. To counteract this, consider incorporating offline fundraising methods, such as local events or partnerships with community organizations, to ensure inclusivity.",
    "**Building Trust with Donors**: In a global campaign, establishing credibility and trust can be challenging, especially if the organization is not well-known in certain regions. Donors may be hesitant to contribute without a clear understanding of how their funds will be used. To build trust, provide transparent information about the campaignâ€™s goals, progress updates, and detailed financial reports on how donations are allocated, perhaps even showcasing success stories from previous campaigns.",
    "**Sustainability of Efforts**: A one-time global fundraising campaign may generate initial funds, but ensuring long-term sustainability and continued support for cancer research can be difficult. If the campaign lacks a clear follow-up plan, donor fatigue may set in, leading to decreased future contributions. To maintain momentum, create a strategy for ongoing engagement with donors, such as regular newsletters, updates on research advancements, and opportunities for continued involvement."
