    "**Global Communication Collapse**: With all electronic devices shutting down, global communication networks would be severely impacted. People would be unable to contact each other, and the flow of information would come to a grinding halt. This would lead to widespread panic, confusion, and potentially even chaos. The consequences would be felt across all industries, from finance to healthcare, and would have a devastating impact on the global economy.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would cripple global trade and commerce. Supply chains would be disrupted, and the ability to process transactions would be severely limited. This would lead to a rapid decline in economic activity, and potentially even a global economic collapse. The impact would be felt by businesses, governments, and individuals alike, and would have far-reaching consequences for years to come.",
    "**Medical Crisis**: The loss of electronic devices would have a devastating impact on the medical community. Hospitals and clinics would be unable to access patient records, and medical equipment would be inoperable. This would lead to a significant increase in preventable deaths, and would put a huge strain on medical staff who would be forced to work in difficult conditions. The consequences would be felt across the globe, and would have a lasting impact on the healthcare system.",
    "**Transportation Gridlock**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would bring global transportation to a standstill. Air traffic control systems would be offline, and GPS navigation would be unavailable. This would lead to widespread flight cancellations, and would cause chaos on the roads and railways. The consequences would be felt by travelers, businesses, and governments, and would have a significant impact on the global economy.",
    "**Social Uprising**: The loss of electronic devices would lead to a significant increase in social unrest. People would be unable to access information, and would be forced to rely on word of mouth for news and updates. This would lead to a breakdown in social cohesion, and would potentially even lead to riots and civil unrest. The consequences would be felt across the globe, and would have a lasting impact on society as a whole.
