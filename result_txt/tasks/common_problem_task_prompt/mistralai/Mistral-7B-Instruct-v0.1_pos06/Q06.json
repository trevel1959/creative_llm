    "Developing a sustainable community on Mars that is powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. This would require a significant investment in technology and infrastructure, but it could provide a long-term solution to the energy needs of a Martian colony. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Creating a self-sustaining habitat on Mars that is designed to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation levels. This could involve using advanced materials and engineering techniques to construct a dome or other protective structure that can maintain a habitable environment for humans. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Developing a system of transportation on Mars that is powered by nuclear reactors or other advanced propulsion technologies. This could allow for faster and more efficient travel between different parts of the planet, and could also be used to establish a network of mining and resource extraction operations. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Creating a system of agriculture on Mars that is designed to grow crops using advanced hydroponic or aeroponic techniques. This could provide a sustainable source of food for a Martian colony, and could also be used to produce oxygen and other useful byproducts. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Developing a system of recycling and waste management on Mars that is designed to minimize the amount of waste generated by a Martian colony. This could involve using advanced recycling technologies to convert waste materials into useful resources, and could also include systems for capturing and treating wastewater. Confidence score: 0.9"
