It encourages active participation and personal connection to the subject matter. **Confidence Score:** 0.8",
    "**Collaborative Storytelling**: Collaborate with the subjects of the documentary in its creation process.

The documentary could feature interviews, testimonials, and even participatory segments where viewers contribute their own experiences related to the topic. **Confidence Score:** 0.95",
    "**Artistic Integration**: Combine documentary filmmaking with other art forms such as music, dance, or performance art. For example, creating a documentary about a specific culture that incorporates traditional dances or musical performances as a way to explore and understand the community. This approach adds a layer of artistic expression and cultural richness to the documentary, potentially making it more engaging and memorable. **Confidence Score:** 0.9"
