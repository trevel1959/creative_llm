    "**TeethWhitening Toothbrush:** Create a toothbrush that uses LED lights to whiten teeth. The bristles would have embedded micro-LEDs which emit blue light, activating the hydrogen peroxide gel inside the brush handle. This gel is known for its whitening properties. The user would simply brush their teeth as usual, but instead of using a traditional whitening paste or strip, they'd use this toothbrush for about 30 minutes each day. This method would be gentle on gums and less invasive than traditional whitening treatments.",
    "**HydroMassage Toothbrush:** Design a toothbrush with mini-massage attachments that provide gentle vibrations on the gums while brushing. This could help improve gum health by increasing blood flow, reducing inflammation, and potentially lowering the risk of gum disease. The massage feature could also make brushing more enjoyable and relaxing.",
    "**Smart Oral Health Tracker Toothbrush:** Integrate a smart toothbrush with a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone app. The toothbrush would monitor brushing habits, track plaque buildup, and suggest areas of the mouth that require more attention. The app could also send reminders for dental check-ups, provide personalized brushing techniques, and even offer suggestions for healthier dietary choices based on your brushing data.",
    "**Biodegradable Toothbrushes:** Develop toothbrushes made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, cornstarch, or recycled plastics. These toothbrushes would be fully biodegradable, reducing plastic waste in landfills and oceans. They could also come with compostable packaging and be designed with a sleek, modern look to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Portable Oral Hygiene Station:** Create a compact device that combines a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash into one unit. This portable station would be perfect for travel, work, or any situation where space is limited. It could include features like automatic dispensing of toothpaste and mouthwash, a built-in timer for proper brushing duration, and possibly UV sterilization to keep the device hygienic between uses."
