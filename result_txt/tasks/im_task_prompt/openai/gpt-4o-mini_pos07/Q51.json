    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the table, such as wireless charging pads, Bluetooth speakers, and touch-sensitive controls for ambient lighting. Users could connect their devices seamlessly, listen to music, or adjust the lighting for mood settingsâ€”all from the table itself. An app could also allow for remote control of these features, enhancing convenience and modernity.",
    "**Built-in Storage Solutions**: Design the table with hidden storage compartments that can hold various items like books, games, or dining essentials. For instance, a lift-top feature could reveal a deep storage space underneath, or side drawers could be integrated into the table's legs. This would help keep the area tidy and organized, making it perfect for small living spaces where maximizing space is essential.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Features**: Develop a table using sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood or bamboo, and incorporate features that promote eco-friendliness. For example, the table could include a small herb garden on one side, allowing users to grow their own fresh herbs while dining or cooking. Additionally, the use of non-toxic finishes and adhesives would make it safer for families and environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Adjustable Height Mechanism**: Introduce a height-adjustable mechanism that allows the table to transform from a standard dining height to a coffee table height or even a standing desk. This versatility would cater to different activities and preferences, making it suitable for families, remote workers, or those who enjoy hosting gatherings. The adjustment could be done manually or electronically with a simple push of a button.",
    "**Interactive Projection Surface**: Equip the table with a built-in projector that can display interactive content directly onto its surface. This could include games, educational tools, or even digital art displays. Users could engage with the projected content using gestures or compatible devices, turning the table into an entertainment hub or a collaborative workspace for brainstorming and planning."
