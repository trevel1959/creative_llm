    "Create a \"Mood Lighter\" App: Develop an app that generates fun and interesting tasks to complete during the daily routine. The tasks could range from creative challenges like drawing or writing a short story, to more practical ones like practicing a new skill or learning a new language. This app would help break up the monotony of daily tasks and inject some excitement into one's daily routine.",
    "Customizable Candle Subscription: Offer a subscription service where customers can choose from a variety of unique candle scents and colors. Each candle could have a different task or challenge associated with it, such as a puzzle to solve or a creative prompt to complete. This would provide an added element of excitement and surprise to the daily routine.",
    "\"Mood Boosting\" Candle Holders: Design candle holders that double as creative outlets. For example, a holder with a built-in coloring book or a holder that contains a small notebook and pen. This would allow users to express their creativity and engage in a fun activity while enjoying their candle.",
    "\"Scent-sational\" Storytelling: Develop a line of candles that tell a story through their scent. Each candle could have a unique scent that evokes a different emotion or memory, such as a tropical scent for a \"vacation\" candle or a spicy scent for a \"warm fireplace\" candle. This would add an extra layer of enjoyment to the daily routine, as users could engage their senses and imagination while lighting their candle.",
    "\"Mindfulness\" Candle Set: Create a set of candles that guide users through a series of mindfulness exercises. Each candle could have a different color and scent, and the accompanying booklet could provide instructions for a specific meditation or mindfulness practice. This would help users cultivate a sense of mindfulness and calm in their daily routine, breaking up the monotony of repetitive tasks."
