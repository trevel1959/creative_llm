    "Expand Earth's core to create a hollow mantle of breathable atmosphere, housing an abundant supply of breathable gases. This would reduce air pollution on Earth and provide new possibilities for sustainable cities.",
    "Place a massive mirror around the sun to reflect its light and heat to the planets further away, creating a brighter, more evenly heated solar system.",
    "Construct a gravitational bridge between two suns, allowing for more efficient thermal energy transfer and stable asteroid orbits.",
    "Develop a terraforming algorithm that can transform other planets like Mars to create habitable zones for humans and other species.",
    "Establish a space elevator between Earth and a geosynchronous orbit, allowing for faster transportation, communication, and energy transmission."
