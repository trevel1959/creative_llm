    "**Budget Overruns**: Large-scale events often face the risk of exceeding the planned budget due to unforeseen expenses such as last-minute catering needs, increased vendor fees, or additional equipment rentals. To mitigate this, a detailed budget plan should be created, including a contingency fund for unexpected costs, and regular budget reviews should be scheduled to track spending.",
    "**Vendor Reliability and Coordination**: Coordinating multiple vendors (caterers, AV technicians, decorators, etc.) can lead to miscommunication or delays, especially if they are not well-aligned on the event timeline. To prevent this, a comprehensive event timeline should be established and shared with all vendors, along with regular check-ins leading up to the event to ensure everyone is on the same page.",
    "**Attendee Engagement and Experience**: If the event lacks engaging content or activities, attendees may leave feeling unfulfilled. To enhance engagement, interactive elements such as live polls, Q&A sessions, or networking opportunities can be incorporated. Additionally, gathering feedback from previous events can help identify what attendees value most.",
    "**Technology Failures**: Technical issues, such as malfunctioning audio-visual equipment or poor Wi-Fi connectivity, can disrupt the event and frustrate attendees. To counter this, a reliable tech team should be hired, and all equipment should be tested multiple times before the event. Having backup equipment and a contingency plan for technical failures can also alleviate potential issues.",
    "**Health and Safety Compliance**: With increasing health regulations, ensuring compliance with safety protocols (such as food safety, crowd control, and emergency procedures) is crucial. Failing to adhere to these regulations can lead to legal issues or jeopardize the event. Conducting a thorough risk assessment and working closely with local health authorities can help ensure all necessary measures are in place."
