For example, the energy required to teleport people and goods could contribute to climate change, and the increased demand for transportation could lead to more pollution and congestion in cities.",
    "Ethical considerations: Teleportation could raise ethical questions about privacy, security, and the potential for misuse. For example, could governments use teleportation to spy on citizens or to transport dangerous criminals? Could companies use teleportation to exploit workers in other countries?",
