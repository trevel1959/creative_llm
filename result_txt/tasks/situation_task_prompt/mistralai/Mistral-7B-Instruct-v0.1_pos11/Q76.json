    "Sign Language: If all phones stopped working, we could communicate long distance through sign language. We could use video conferencing software to see each other and sign to each other. This would require us to learn sign language, but it could be a fun and creative way to communicate.",
    "Morse Code: Morse code is a system of using dots and dashes to represent letters of the alphabet. If all phones stopped working, we could use Morse code to communicate long distance through text messages. This would require us to learn Morse code, but it could be a fun and creative way to communicate.",
    "Radio Communication: We could use radio communication to communicate long distance. This would require us to purchase a radio and a license to operate it. We could use a handheld radio or a base station radio to communicate.",
    "Solar-Powered Phones: If all phones stopped working, we could use solar-powered phones to communicate long distance. Solar-powered phones use solar energy to charge the phone, so they don't need to be plugged in. This would require us to purchase solar-powered phones, but it could be a fun and creative way to communicate.",
    "Satellite Communication: We could use satellite communication to communicate long distance. This would require us to purchase a satellite phone or a satellite modem. Satellite communication is slower than traditional phone communication, but it could be a fun and creative way to communicate."
