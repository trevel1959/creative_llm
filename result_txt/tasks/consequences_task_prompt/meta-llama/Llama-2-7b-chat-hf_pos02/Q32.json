    "Impact on religious beliefs: If communication with the dead were possible, it could challenge traditional religious beliefs and practices. Some religions view the afterlife as a place where the deceased reside, and communication with the dead could be seen as a violation of this belief. This could lead to a crisis of faith and a reevaluation of religious beliefs.",
    "New forms of entertainment: Communication with the dead could lead to new forms of entertainment, such as ghost hunting or mediumship shows. This could become a popular form of entertainment, providing a new way for people to engage with the supernatural and the dead.
