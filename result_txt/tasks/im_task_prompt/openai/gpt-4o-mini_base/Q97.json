    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Design a dog leash that incorporates a compartment for waste bags, making it easy for owners to clean up after their pets on the go. The compartment could feature a spring-loaded mechanism for easy access and a refillable slot for waste bags, ensuring that owners are always prepared without the need for additional accessories.",
    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Create a leash that can easily adjust its length with a simple pull or press mechanism. This would allow owners to switch between a long leash for more freedom during walks in open spaces and a shorter length for busy streets or crowded areas. The adjustment could be done quickly and securely, making it versatile for different walking environments.",
    "**Reflective and LED Light Integration**: Enhance the visibility of the dog leash during nighttime walks by incorporating reflective materials and LED lights. The leash could have a strip of LED lights that can be turned on or off, as well as reflective stitching to ensure both the dog and owner are visible to vehicles and other pedestrians, improving safety during low-light conditions.",
    "**Comfort Grip Handle with Vibration Feedback**: Design a leash with an ergonomic handle that includes a vibration feedback system. This could be particularly useful for training purposes, where the handle vibrates gently to signal the dog when they pull too hard or stray from the desired path. This feature would promote better behavior without the need for harsh corrections.",
    "**Interactive Training Leash**: Create a leash that incorporates interactive features, such as a built-in clicker or treat dispenser. This would allow owners to reward their dogs for good behavior during walks, making training more effective and enjoyable. The leash could also connect to an app that tracks training progress and provides tips based on the dog's behavior during walks."
