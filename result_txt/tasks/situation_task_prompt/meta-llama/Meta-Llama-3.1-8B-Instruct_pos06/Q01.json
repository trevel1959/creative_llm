    "**Semaphore Flags**: I would use a network of pre-arranged semaphore flags to communicate with someone in another country. This method would involve a series of flag positions and patterns that would be used to convey messages. The flags would be placed in strategic locations, such as on top of buildings or hills, to ensure maximum visibility. This method would be particularly effective for short-distance communication, but could be used in conjunction with other methods for longer-distance communication. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Morse Code Lanterns**: I would use a system of lanterns with pre-arranged patterns of light to convey messages. This method would be similar to semaphore flags, but would be more effective for communication over longer distances. The lanterns would be placed in visible locations, such as on top of buildings or in public spaces, and would be used to convey messages through a series of flashes and patterns. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Radio Transmission using Mirrors**: I would use a system of mirrors to focus and amplify radio signals, allowing for communication over long distances. This method would involve setting up a series of mirrors in a line, with the sender at one end and the receiver at the other. The mirrors would be angled to focus the signal, allowing it to travel farther and more efficiently. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Carrier Pigeon Network**: I would establish a network of carrier pigeons, trained to carry small messages between locations. This method would be particularly effective for communication over short to medium distances, and could be used in conjunction with other methods for longer-distance communication. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Sun-Dial Communication**: I would use a system of sun dials, with pre-arranged patterns of shadows to convey messages. This method would be similar to semaphore flags, but would be more effective for communication over longer distances. The sun dials would be placed in visible locations, such as on top of buildings or in public spaces, and would be used to convey messages through a series of shadows and patterns. Confidence: 0.8"
