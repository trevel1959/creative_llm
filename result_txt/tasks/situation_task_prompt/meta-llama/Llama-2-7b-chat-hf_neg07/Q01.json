    "Use Carrier Pigeons: In the event of an electronic communication blackout, pigeons could be trained to carry messages between countries. This method would be reliable and slow, but it would allow for communication between two points on the globe.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to the first idea, homing pigeons could be used to send messages between countries. These pigeons would be trained to fly back to their home location, carrying a message attached to their leg.",
    "Balloons with Payload: Hot air balloons could be used to carry a payload of messages between countries. The balloons would be launched from one location and would drift across the globe, dropping off the messages at designated points.",
    "Submarine Messages: In the ocean, submarines could be used to carry messages between countries. The submarines would travel between the two locations, and the messages would be exchanged through a hatch on the submarine.",
    "Mirror Signals: In the event of an electronic communication blackout, mirrors could be used to send signals between countries. A message would be written on a mirror and then reflected towards the sun. The sun would then reflect the message back to Earth, where it could be read."
