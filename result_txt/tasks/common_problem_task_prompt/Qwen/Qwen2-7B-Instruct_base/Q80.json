    "**Eco-Friendly Venue Selection**: Choose a venue that prioritizes sustainability. This could be a location like a botanical garden, a historic building with green initiatives, or a venue that has solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources. The venue should have a strong commitment to reducing waste, conserving water, and using eco-friendly products.",
    "**Sustainable Invitations**: Send digital invitations instead of paper ones to reduce paper waste. If you prefer physical invitations, use recycled or biodegradable paper. Include details about your eco-friendly wedding and encourage guests to carpool or use public transportation.",
    "**Seasonal and Local Food**: Opt for a menu that uses seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients. This reduces carbon emissions from transportation and supports local farmers. Avoid foods that require long-distance transport, such as exotic fruits or imported seafood. Consider having a vegetarian or vegan menu option to further reduce the environmental impact.",
    "**Zero-Waste Wedding**: Implement a zero-waste policy by providing compostable or reusable tableware and encouraging guests to bring their own reusable bottles and cups. Have a recycling station and ensure all waste is sorted properly. You can also provide a donation box for leftover food and flowers to be given to local shelters or charities.",
    "**Sustainable Decorations and Favors**: Use natural, biodegradable, or recyclable decorations like potted plants, fresh flowers in biodegradable vases, or homemade items made from sustainable materials. For favors, consider small, locally-made items like handcrafted soaps, candles, or edible treats. Avoid plastic and non-biodegradable items. "
