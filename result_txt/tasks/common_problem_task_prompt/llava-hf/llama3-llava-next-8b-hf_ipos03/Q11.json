    "Insufficient funds: Charity events often rely on donations and sponsorships to cover their costs. If the event organizers fail to secure enough funding, they may have to cut corners, reduce the scale of the event, or even postpone it.",
    "Limited audience engagement: If the event's target audience is not engaged or interested in the cause or activities, they may not contribute as much as expected, leading to insufficient funds or a lack of support for the charity.",
    "Volunteer burnout: Organizing a charity event requires a significant amount of time, effort, and resources. If volunteers are not adequately supported or are not provided with sufficient breaks or rest, they may become burnt out, leading to decreased productivity and a negative impact on the event.",
    "Inadequate communication: Effective communication is crucial in organizing a charity event. If organizers fail to keep stakeholders informed about the event's progress, they may miss out on valuable feedback, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.",
    "Limited accessibility: Charity events should be accessible to all attendees, regardless of their physical abilities. If organizers fail to provide appropriate accommodations or facilities, they may exclude some attendees, leading to a negative impact on the event's success."
