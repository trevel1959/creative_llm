    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can create significant challenges in communication, leading to frustration for both the host family and the student. The student may struggle to express themselves or understand instructions, while the host family may find it difficult to convey their expectations or provide support. To address this, the host family could provide resources such as language learning apps or classes, and encourage open dialogue about any misunderstandings to build a more supportive environment.",
    "**Homesickness and Emotional Well-being**: Being away from home can be emotionally taxing for a foreign exchange student, leading to feelings of homesickness and loneliness. This can manifest in withdrawal from social interactions or difficulty adjusting to the new environment. To help alleviate these feelings, the host family can create a welcoming atmosphere by incorporating the student’s favorite foods, celebrating their cultural holidays, and encouraging regular communication with their family back home through video calls or letters.",
    "**Integration into Family Dynamics**: The introduction of a foreign exchange student can disrupt existing family dynamics, especially in larger families. There may be competition for attention, resources, or time, which can lead to conflicts or feelings of resentment. To promote harmony, the host family could establish a family meeting routine where everyone, including the student, has the opportunity to voice their feelings and discuss any issues openly, ensuring everyone feels valued and heard.",
    "**Different Academic Expectations**: The academic expectations and grading systems may differ significantly between the host country and the student’s home country. This can lead to confusion regarding assignments, assessments, and classroom behavior. To bridge this gap, the host family can help the student understand the local education system, provide assistance with homework, and encourage open communication with teachers to clarify expectations and seek additional support when needed.",
    "**Social Integration and Friendship Building**: The foreign exchange student may struggle to make friends and integrate into social circles, especially if they are shy or if there are language barriers. This can lead to feelings of isolation. To foster social connections, the host family can encourage the student to participate in local clubs, sports, or community events, and facilitate introductions to peers, helping them build a supportive network of friends."
