    "**Eco-Friendly Urban Farming**: Design a vertically stacked, modular urban farming system that utilizes hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The system would be composed of interlocking modules, each with its own climate control and irrigation system. This would allow for maximum space efficiency in densely populated cities while minimizing water and land usage. The modules could be made from recycled materials and be easily assembled and disassembled for transportation and storage.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop a contact lens with a built-in microchip that monitors glucose levels, tracks eye health, and provides real-time feedback to the wearer. The lens could also include a tiny display that projects information, such as notifications, navigation, or augmented reality experiences. This technology could revolutionize the way people manage their health and interact with the world around them.",
    "**Underwater Exploration Submarines**: Design a compact, affordable, and user-friendly submarine that allows individuals to explore the underwater world without extensive training or equipment. The submarine would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, high-definition cameras, and real-time communication capabilities. This would make underwater exploration accessible to a wider audience, promoting marine conservation and education.",
    "**Personalized 3D-Printed Prosthetics**: Develop a system that uses AI-powered 3D scanning and printing to create customized prosthetic limbs tailored to each individual's unique needs and preferences. The prosthetics would be designed to be durable, lightweight, and aesthetically pleasing, with interchangeable components and modular designs for easy maintenance and upgrade.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for Mental Health**: Create a VR platform that simulates immersive, interactive environments to help individuals overcome anxiety disorders, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. The platform would utilize AI-driven narrative design, biofeedback sensors, and personalized therapy plans to create a tailored experience for each user. This could provide a more effective and engaging alternative to traditional therapy methods."
