    "Budgetary Constraints: Building a high-rise requires significant financial investment, and there may be numerous unexpected costs that can add up quickly. These may include additional construction time, materials, and labor costs. Failure to budget accurately can lead to the project going over budget, making it financially unfeasible or resulting in the need for cost-cutting measures that may compromise the quality of the building.",
    "Noise Pollution: High-rise buildings can generate significant levels of noise from construction activities, machinery, and transportation. This can disrupt the surrounding community, especially if the construction site is located near residential areas. Noise pollution can also impact the well-being of building visitors and residents, leading to complaints to the authorities.",
    "Safety Concerns: High-rise construction poses several safety challenges, such as falls, electrical hazards, and accidents involving heavy machinery. To ensure a safe work environment, construction companies must implement proper safety measures, including fall protection systems, electrical safety protocols, and regular safety training for workers.",
    "Time-Sensitive: Building high-rise structures is a time-consuming process due to various factors such as weather conditions, availability of materials, and regulatory requirements. Delays can result from any of these factors or when problems arise during the construction process. These delays can force developers and builders to either push the completion date or to face additional costs due to rental or leasing agreements.",
    "Environmental Impact: High-rise construction can have a significant impact on the environment through the consumption of resources, such as materials, water, and energy. A detailed environmental assessment must be conducted to minimize the impact of construction on the local environment by using eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technologies."
