    "**Coffee Filter Bird Feeder**: Use a large coffee filter to create an eco-friendly bird feeder. First, cut out small holes around the edges of the filter, leaving enough space in the middle for the string to hang it up. Then, fill the filter with seeds or pieces of fruit. The natural fibers of the coffee filter will attract birds while being completely biodegradable.",
    "**Coffee Filter Paper Flowers**: Create beautiful paper flowers using coffee filters by folding them into different shapes before cutting them into petal-like segments. Dip each segment into a watered-down paint mixture (to prevent the colors from bleeding too much), then allow them to dry. Assemble the petals on a skewer or a small branch to make a stunning flower arrangement.",
    "**Coffee Filter Sun Catchers**: Use coffee filters as a medium for creating colorful sun catchers. Cut the filters into various shapes like hearts, stars, or leaves, then color them using washable markers or paints. Once dry, glue these shapes onto a clear plastic sheet or onto a window to let the sunlight shine through and create a rainbow effect.",
    "**Coffee Filter Mask**: Design a unique face mask using coffee filters as the primary material. First, cut the filters into the desired shape and size for the mask. Use elastic bands or fabric ties to secure it in place. Add decorative elements such as lace, ribbon, or buttons for a personal touch. This mask can be a creative addition to costumes or a fun DIY project.",
    "**Coffee Filter Collage Art**: Collect used coffee filters in various colors and sizes. Cut them into interesting shapes or tear them for a more organic look. Use these pieces to create a collage art piece, either on canvas, cardboard, or any other surface. Experiment with layering, overlapping, and arranging the filters to create a visually appealing artwork that reflects your personal style and creativity."
