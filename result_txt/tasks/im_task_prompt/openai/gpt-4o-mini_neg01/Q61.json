    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Calendar Visualization**: Create an AR feature that allows users to visualize their schedule in a 3D space. Users could point their device at a wall or desk, and their calendar would appear as floating events, color-coded by type (meetings, personal time, deadlines). This immersive experience would help users grasp their schedule at a glance and make it more engaging.",
    "**Gamified Productivity Challenges**: Introduce a gamification element where users can set productivity challenges within their calendar. For example, they could aim to complete a certain number of tasks in a week and earn points or badges for accomplishments. This feature could encourage users to stay on track with their schedules while making the process more fun and motivating.",
    "**Collaborative Event Planning Tool**: Enhance the calendar assistant with a feature that allows users to collaboratively plan events in real-time with friends or colleagues. Users could propose times, vote on options, and even discuss details within the calendar app. This would streamline the often tedious process of scheduling group events and make it more interactive.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Reminders**: Incorporate wellness reminders that suggest breaks, hydration, and mindfulness exercises throughout the day. The assistant could analyze the userâ€™s schedule and recommend specific times to step away from work, do some stretching, or take a moment for deep breathing, promoting a healthier work-life balance.",
    "**Smart Travel Integration**: Develop a feature that integrates travel plans directly into the calendar. The assistant could automatically pull in flight, hotel, and transportation details, adjusting the calendar for time zone changes and travel times. It could also provide reminders for packing and check-in times, making travel planning seamless."
