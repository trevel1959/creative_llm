    "**Solar-Powered Backpacks**: Develop a wearable solar panel backpack that can harness energy from the sun, allowing people to charge their devices on-the-go. The backpack could have a built-in power bank, and its solar panels could be designed to be compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Design a system that captures kinetic energy from everyday activities like walking, running, or cycling. This energy could be harnessed using piezoelectric materials or electromagnetic induction, and stored in a portable power bank. This system could be integrated into shoes, bike pedals, or even clothing.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Create a device that extracts water vapor from the air and converts it into electricity using a process called electrosynthesis. This device could be placed in homes, offices, or public spaces, providing a sustainable source of power while also collecting water for drinking or other uses.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting**: Develop a system that uses bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing bacteria or fungi, to generate light. These organisms could be contained in specialized light bulbs or integrated into wearable devices, providing a sustainable and unique lighting solution.",
    "**Graphene-Based Super-Capacitors**: Design ultra-high-capacity super-capacitors using graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material. These super-capacitors could be used to store energy from various sources, such as solar panels or kinetic energy harvesting systems, and provide a high-power backup when batteries fail. [/INST] "
