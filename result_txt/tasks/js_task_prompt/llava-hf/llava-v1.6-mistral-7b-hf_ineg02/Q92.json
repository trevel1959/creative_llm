    "**Multi-Star System**: In this design, multiple stars could be at the center of the solar system, with planets orbiting around each star. This would create a diverse and dynamic environment, with each star having its own unique characteristics, such as different temperatures, atmospheric compositions, and magnetic fields.",
    "**Habitable Moons**: This design would involve creating habitable moons around the planets, allowing for a greater number of inhabitable worlds. These moons could be artificially terraformed with the necessary resources and technologies to support life, increasing the potential for interplanetary colonization.",
    "**Orbital Stations and Platforms**: Orbiting stations and platforms could be built around the planets, serving as hubs for research, manufacturing, and transportation. These stations could be powered by solar energy, with satellites and other structures orbiting around the planets to collect and distribute energy.",
    "**Interconnected Planetary Network**: The solar system could be connected by a network of advanced technologies, such as wormholes or hyperspace portals. This would allow for instantaneous travel between planets, enabling a greater exchange of resources, knowledge, and culture.",
    "**Distributed Solar System**: In this design, the solar system would be composed of smaller, self-sustaining units that could be deployed throughout space. Each unit would be equipped with solar panels and other necessary technologies to generate energy and support life. These units could be interconnected, forming a larger, distributed solar system."
