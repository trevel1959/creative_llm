    "Oil Oceans: If the Earth's oceans were made of oil, it would create a world with a very different atmosphere and environment. Oil is not a suitable liquid for marine life, and any life that existed in such oceans would have to adapt to the new conditions. The oil would not evaporate as quickly as water, leading to a more stable climate with fewer weather events. However, the oil would also act as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise.",
    "Algae Oceans: If the Earth's oceans were made of algae-infused water, it would create a world with a thriving marine ecosystem. Algae would photosynthesize and release oxygen, leading to a healthier atmosphere and potentially reducing the effects of climate change. The algae would also create a rich source of food for marine life, supporting a diverse and thriving ecosystem.",
    "Ice Oceans: If the Earth's oceans were made of ice, it would create a world with a frozen surface. The increased insulation provided by the ice would cause the Earth's temperature to drop, leading to a colder climate with more extreme weather events. The frozen oceans would also affect the planet's tectonic activity, potentially causing more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",
    "Salty Oceans: If the Earth's oceans were made of salty water, it would create a world with a more stable climate. The increased salinity would lead to a higher boiling point for water, which would reduce the rate of evaporation and increase the Earth's overall temperature. This would create a more stable climate with fewer weather events.",
    "Frozen Oceans: If the Earth's oceans were made of frozen water, it would create a world with a frozen surface. The increased insulation provided by the ice would cause the Earth's temperature to drop, leading to a colder climate with more extreme weather events. The frozen oceans would also affect the planet's tectonic activity, potentially causing more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."
