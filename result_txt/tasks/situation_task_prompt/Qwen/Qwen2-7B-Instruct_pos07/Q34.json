    "**Rainwater Collection System**: Design a system to collect rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces. You can use barrels or large containers to store the collected water. This stored water can then be used for watering your plants during dry spells when natural rainfall is absent.",
    "**Aquaponics Setup**: Set up an aquaponics system where fish are raised in tanks that produce waste which is converted into nutrients by bacteria, then these nutrients are absorbed by hydroponically grown plants. The plants clean the water for the fish, creating a sustainable cycle of water usage.",
    "**Solar-Powered Irrigation System**: Create a solar-powered irrigation system that uses solar panels to power a pump that distributes water to your plants. This ensures that your plants receive consistent watering without relying on rain, while also being environmentally friendly.",
    "**Evaporation-Resistant Soil Cover**: Use materials such as pebbles, gravel, or specially designed mulches that prevent water evaporation from the soil surface. This helps retain moisture in the soil longer, reducing the need for frequent watering.",
    "**Water-Efficient Plants**: Choose plant species that require less water. Some drought-resistant plants like cacti, succulents, and certain varieties of grasses and shrubs can thrive with minimal water supply. Researching and selecting appropriate native plants that are adapted to your local climate can significantly reduce water usage for gardening purposes."
