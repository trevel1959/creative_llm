    "Gravity: If the Earth stopped rotating, gravity would still be, but it would be to calculate and predict. The gravitational pull between objects would still exist, but the way it is experienced would be different.",
    "Weather: The weather patterns on Earth would change drastically. Without the rotation, the Sun's rays would hit the Earth at different angles, causing extreme weather changes.",
    ": The of day and night would disappear. Without the rotation, the Earth would experience perpetual daylight or perpetual darkness.",
    "Tides: The tides on Earth would also be affected. The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun would still cause the tides, but the way they rise and fall would be different.",
    "Communication: Communication across the globe would be affected. Without the rotation, the time zones would shift, making it difficult to coordinate time-sensitive activities."
