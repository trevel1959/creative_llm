As customers browse through the store, they can point their smartphone camera at products and receive real-time information, such as prices, product descriptions, and customer reviews. The AR feature can also provide a virtual try-on option for clothing and accessories, allowing customers to see how they would look without having to physically try them on. This feature can enhance the shopping experience, making it more engaging and interactive.",
