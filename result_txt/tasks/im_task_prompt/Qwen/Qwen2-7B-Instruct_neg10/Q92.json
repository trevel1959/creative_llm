    "**Portable and Eco-Friendly**: Design a wine opener that doubles as a compact, portable charger. It could use solar power or be charged by USB, allowing users to charge their smartphones, tablets, or other devices on the go. Additionally, it could be made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic, making it an eco-friendly choice.",
    "**Customizable Designs**: Offer a range of customizable designs and colors for the wine opener. Users could choose from various patterns, such as floral, geometric, or even personalized engravings. This not only adds a personal touch but also makes it a unique gift idea.",
    "**Sustainable Corkscrew**: Develop a wine opener that includes a replaceable, reusable corkscrew mechanism. This would reduce waste and promote sustainability, as users wouldn't need to throw away the entire opener after one use. The opener could also come with extra corkscrews that can be easily replaced.",
    "**Wine Preservation System**: Create a wine opener that includes a built-in preservation system, extending the shelf life of opened bottles. This could involve a pump that removes air from the bottle or a vacuum seal mechanism, ensuring that the wine remains fresh for several days.",
    "**Integrated Wine Glass Cleaner**: Design a wine opener that combines the functionality of opening a bottle with cleaning a wine glass. After opening the bottle, the user could simply place the glass under the device, which sprays a gentle stream of water to clean the glass while removing any excess bubbles."
