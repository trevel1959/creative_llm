    "Laser Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use laser cutting technology to cut through various materials. This would involve using a high-powered laser beam to cut through materials like paper, fabric, and even metal. Laser cutting would be a more precise and efficient way of cutting things, and it could be used for a wide range of applications, from crafting to industrial manufacturing.",
    "Cryogenic Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use cryogenic cutting technology to freeze objects and then shatter them into smaller pieces. This would involve using liquid nitrogen or another cryogenic fluid to freeze the object, and then shattering it with a hammer or other tool. Cryogenic cutting would be a more precise and gentle way of cutting things, and it could be used for applications where other cutting methods wouldn't work, such as cutting through delicate or sensitive materials.",
    "Sonic Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use sonic cutting technology to cut through various materials. This would involve using high-frequency sound waves to cut through materials like metal, plastic, and even stone. Sonic cutting would be a more efficient and precise way of cutting things, and it could be used for a wide range of applications, from cutting through heavy metal pipes to cutting through delicate glassware.",
    "Plasma Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use plasma cutting technology to cut through various materials. This would involve using a high-temperature plasma arc to cut through materials like metal, plastic, and even stone. Plasma cutting would be a more efficient and precise way of cutting things, and it could be used for a wide range of applications, from cutting through heavy metal sheets to cutting through delicate circuit boards.",
    "Magnetic Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use magnetic cutting technology to cut through various materials. This would involve using a powerful magnetic field to attract and hold onto a cutting tool, which could then be used to cut through materials like metal, plastic, and even stone. Magnetic cutting would be a more precise and gentle way of cutting things, and it could be used for applications where other cutting methods wouldn't work, such as cutting"
