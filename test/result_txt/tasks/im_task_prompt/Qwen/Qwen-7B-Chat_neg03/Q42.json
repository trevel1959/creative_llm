    "Design a suitcase that doubles as a portable office. The suitcase would have a built-in laptop stand, a fold-out desk, and comfortable seating for meetings or brainstorming sessions on the go.",
    "Create a suitcase that can transform into a tent. This would be perfect for camping trips or outdoor adventures where space is limited. The suitcase could easily collapse down to fit in small spaces and then expand into a cozy tent when needed.",
    "Develop a suitcase that has built-in solar panels. This would allow users to charge their electronic devices while traveling without relying on power outlets. The suitcase could also come equipped with a small battery pack to store excess energy for later use.",
    "Introduce a suitcase that uses air pressure technology to adjust its size and shape to fit different types of luggage. This would make it easier for travelers to fit multiple bags in one suitcase and save space during storage.",
    "Create a suitcase that is made entirely from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of travel but also promote eco-friendly practices among consumers. Additionally, the suitcase could feature unique designs and patterns to add a touch of style to any trip."
