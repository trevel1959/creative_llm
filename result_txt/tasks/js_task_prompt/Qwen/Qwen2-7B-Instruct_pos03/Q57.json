    "**Collaborative Governance**: This new form of government would emphasize collaboration between citizens and government officials. The structure would include a hybrid of democratic elections and citizen initiatives. Each year, citizens would vote on major policy decisions, but they would also have the ability to propose and vote on new legislation or amendments at any time. This system would empower citizens to directly influence policy, fostering greater civic engagement and a sense of ownership over the governance process.",
    "**Decentralized Autonomy**: In this model, power is distributed across multiple autonomous regions within the country. Each region would have significant autonomy in managing its own affairs, including education, healthcare, and local infrastructure projects. A central coordinating body would ensure that policies are consistent across regions and that resources are fairly distributed. This approach would promote innovation and experimentation while maintaining national unity.",
    "**Eco-centric Democracy**: Recognizing the interdependence of human societies and the natural environment, this government would prioritize sustainability and environmental protection. Policies would be designed to minimize ecological impact, and a council of environmental experts would provide guidance to lawmakers. Additionally, there would be a system for compensating individuals for their contributions to environmental conservation, such as carbon sequestration through reforestation or renewable energy production.",
    "**Transparency and Feedback Loop**: This government would be highly transparent, with all legislative processes and decision-making made public. Citizens would have real-time access to data on how laws are being enforced and how resources are allocated. There would be a robust system for public feedback, allowing citizens to suggest changes or improvements directly to policymakers. Regular surveys and public meetings would ensure continuous engagement and adaptation to changing societal needs.",
    "**Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Universal Basic Services (UBS)**: To address economic inequality and ensure a basic standard of living for all citizens, this government would implement a UBI alongside a system of UBS. UBI would provide a regular financial stipend to every individual, regardless of employment status. UBS would cover essential services like healthcare, education, and housing, ensuring that these necessities are accessible to all. This system would aim to reduce poverty, stimulate economic growth by increasing consumer spending, and promote social equality."
