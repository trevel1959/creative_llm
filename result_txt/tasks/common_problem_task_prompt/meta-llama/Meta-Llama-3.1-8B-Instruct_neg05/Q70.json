    "**Language Exchange Lunches**: Organize regular lunch breaks where employees from different departments and countries can gather to practice their languages. This could be a fun and informal way to improve language skills, while also fostering cross-cultural understanding and friendships. For instance, a Japanese employee could practice their English with a German colleague, while a Spanish speaker could help a Chinese colleague with their Spanish.",
    "**Multilingual Mentorship Program**: Pair employees with language skills with those who need improvement. This mentorship program would allow experienced employees to share their language expertise, while also providing a supportive environment for language learners. The mentors could also offer guidance on cultural nuances and customs.",
