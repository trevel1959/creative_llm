    "Eye-tracking Glasses with AI-powered Object Recognition: Develop a pair of glasses with built-in eye-tracking technology that can recognize objects in the user's surroundings. The glasses could use machine learning algorithms to identify objects and provide audio or haptic feedback to assist the user in navigating their environment. For example, the glasses could identify nearby landmarks, such as street signs or building names, and provide audio feedback to help the user navigate.",
    "Braille Display Watch: Design a smartwatch with a built-in Braille display that can translate digital information into Braille for the visually impaired. The watch could use a series of raised dots to display digital information such as time, messages, and notifications. The Braille display could be controlled using a built-in joystick or by using voice commands.",
    "Smart Cane with Sensors and GPS: Develop a smart cane with built-in sensors and GPS technology that can detect obstacles and provide real-time navigation information to the user. The cane could use sonar or LiDAR sensors to detect obstacles and provide haptic feedback to the user. The GPS technology could provide location-based information, such as nearby landmarks or public transportation options.",
    "AI-powered Virtual Reality Navigation: Create an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience that provides navigation assistance to the visually impaired. The VR system could use AI algorithms to generate a 3D map of the user's surroundings and provide audio or haptic feedback to guide the user through their environment. The VR system could also include social features, such as the ability to connect with other visually impaired individuals for support and guidance.",
    "Smart Glasses with AI-powered Image Recognition: Develop a pair of smart glasses with built-in AI-powered image recognition technology that can identify objects and provide audio or haptic feedback to assist the user in navigating their environment. The glasses could use machine learning algorithms to recognize objects such as street signs, buildings, and landmarks, and provide audio feedback to help the user navigate. The glasses could also include a built-in camera for taking photos and recognizing objects, and a voice assistant for providing additional information and assistance."
