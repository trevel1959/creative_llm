    "**Modular Design**:    - Create a modular laundry basket system where different sections can be detached or rearranged. Each module could be designated for different types of clothing (e.g., whites, colors, delicates). This allows users to easily separate clothes as they toss them in, streamlining the sorting process and reducing the need for a separate sorting stage.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Basket**:    - Develop a laundry basket with self-cleaning technology, using UV-C light to sanitize the interior and eliminate odors. This would be particularly beneficial for families with kids or pets, as it would keep the basket fresh and hygienic without requiring frequent manual cleaning.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**:    - Design a collapsible laundry basket that can easily be folded flat for storage or transport. This would be especially useful for those living in small spaces or for college students who need to carry laundry to communal facilities. The basket could also include a detachable handle for easy carrying.",
    "**Built-in Sorting Mechanism**:    - Innovate a laundry basket with a built-in sorting mechanism that uses a series of dividers and compartments that automatically sort clothes based on color and fabric type as they are added. Users could simply drop their laundry in, and the basket would sort it for them, making the laundry process more efficient.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material with Composting Feature**:    - Create a laundry basket made from biodegradable materials that can be composted at the end of its life cycle. The basket could also feature a compartment for collecting lint and fabric scraps, which could be composted or recycled, encouraging users to think about the environmental impact of their laundry habits."
