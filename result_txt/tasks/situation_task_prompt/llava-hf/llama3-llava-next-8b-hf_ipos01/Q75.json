    "**Biofuels**: Developing sustainable and renewable sources of fuel, such as biofuels derived from algae, plant matter, or even agricultural waste, could be an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. These fuels could be used to power vehicles and other energy-intensive processes.",
    "**Nuclear Power**: Nuclear power could become a more prominent source of energy for transportation, especially if the world moves towards cleaner and more sustainable nuclear technologies. Nuclear power plants could be used to generate electricity for electric vehicles or to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles.",
    "**Solar Roadways**: Imagine roads and highways covered in solar panels that could generate electricity to power electric vehicles. This innovative infrastructure would not only reduce the reliance on oil but also integrate clean energy into transportation systems.",
    "**Advanced Battery Technologies**: Improving battery technologies to increase the range and efficiency of electric vehicles could be a critical step towards reducing our dependence on oil. Advancements in battery technology could make electric vehicles more practical and appealing to a wider audience.",
    "**Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Technology**: This technology allows electric vehicles to act as a source of power for the grid, feeding electricity back into the power system. By enabling V2G, vehicles could be used to stabilize the grid, reduce strain on power plants, and potentially provide a source of income for vehicle owners."
