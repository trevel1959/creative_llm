    "Once in a vibrant savanna, a zebra named Zuri was born with a unique twist—her stripes shimmered in all the colors of the rainbow. At first, the other animals were skeptical. “Zebras are black and white!” they exclaimed. But Zuri embraced her differences, dancing through the grasslands, spreading joy wherever she went. The other animals soon realized that her colors brought them together, uniting them in a celebration of diversity. One day, a fierce storm threatened the savanna, but Zuri’s radiant stripes illuminated the dark skies, guiding everyone to safety. From that day on, Zuri was not just a zebra; she was a symbol of hope and acceptance.",
