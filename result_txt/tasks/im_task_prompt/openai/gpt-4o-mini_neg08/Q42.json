    "**Self-Weighing Suitcase**: This innovative suitcase would have an integrated scale that allows travelers to weigh their luggage simply by lifting it. An LED display on the suitcase would show the weight, helping travelers avoid overweight baggage fees. This feature could be enhanced with a companion app that provides tips on how to repack efficiently if the weight exceeds airline limits.",
    "**Modular Suitcase Design**: A suitcase that can be customized and expanded based on travel needs would be a game-changer. It could feature detachable compartments or sections that can be added or removed according to the length of the trip. For example, a traveler going for a weekend getaway might only need a small section, while a longer trip would require a larger configuration. This modular design would cater to various travel styles and reduce unnecessary bulk.",
    "**Built-in Charging Ports and Power Bank**: In an increasingly digital world, having a suitcase that includes built-in USB charging ports and a rechargeable power bank would be incredibly useful. Travelers could charge their devices on the go without needing to find an outlet, making it easier to stay connected while navigating airports or train stations. The power bank could be solar-powered for eco-friendly travel.",
    "**Integrated Security Features**: A suitcase with advanced security features, such as biometric locks (fingerprint recognition) or remote locking mechanisms via a smartphone app, would enhance traveler safety. Additionally, it could have an alarm system that triggers if someone attempts to open the suitcase without authorization, providing extra security during travel.",
    "**Weather-Resistant and Durable Materials**: Improving the materials used in suitcases can make them more durable and weather-resistant. A suitcase made from a combination of lightweight, high-strength materials, such as carbon fiber or advanced polymers, could withstand rough handling during travel. Additionally, incorporating water-resistant zippers and sealed seams would protect contents from rain or spills, ensuring belongings remain safe and dry."
