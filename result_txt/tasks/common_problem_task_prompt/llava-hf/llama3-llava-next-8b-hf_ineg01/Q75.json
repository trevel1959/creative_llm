    "Littering and pollution: National parks often attract large numbers of visitors, which can result in littering and pollution. To combat this issue, parks could invest in increased waste management infrastructure, such as trash cans and recycling bins, and conduct regular clean-up campaigns. Additionally, parks could educate visitors on the importance of keeping the environment clean and encourage them to take their trash with them when they leave.",
    "Habitat destruction: Human activities such as construction, mining, and deforestation can lead to habitat destruction, which can negatively impact wildlife populations. To address this issue, national parks could work with local communities to implement sustainable land-use planning and management practices that balance the needs of humans and wildlife. They could also invest in habitat restoration efforts and engage in conservation programs to protect endangered species.",
    "Climate change: Climate change can have a significant impact on national parks, causing changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. To address this issue, parks could invest in climate change research and monitoring, develop climate-resilient infrastructure, and implement adaptation strategies such as raising awareness about climate change and its impacts on the environment.",
    "Illegal activities: National parks are sometimes subject to illegal activities such as poaching, vandalism, and drug trafficking. To address this issue, parks could invest in increased law enforcement and surveillance, implement anti-poaching measures, and work with local communities to address the root causes of illegal activities.",
    "Inadequate funding: National parks often rely on funding from government and private sources, which can be inadequate to cover the costs of conservation efforts, infrastructure maintenance, and education programs. To address this issue, parks could diversify their funding sources, engage in fundraising campaigns, and collaborate with other organizations and stakeholders to secure additional resources."
