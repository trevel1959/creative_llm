    "Create a shelter: The first thing I would do is find or create a shelter to protect myself from the elements. I would use natural materials like palm fronds, vines, and rocks to build a lean-to or a debris hut. I would also look for any existing structures like caves or huts that could provide me with shelter.",
    "Find a source of water: Water is essential for survival, so I would search for a source of fresh water. I would look for streams, rivers, or ponds, or I would collect rainwater by placing a tarp or a large leaf over a collection point to catch the rain. I would also try to create a solar still to purify seawater or brackish water.",
    "Start a fire: Fire can provide warmth, light, and a way to cook food. I would gather dry wood, twigs, and other flammable materials to start a fire. I would also look for any flammable materials like coconut shells or driftwood to use as kindling. Once the fire is going, I would use it to cook my food and keep myself warm.",
    "Find food: I would look for any edible plants, fruits, and vegetables on the island to sustain myself. I would also try to catch fish and other sea creatures using a makeshift fishing net or by hand. I would also try to hunt for small animals like crabs, lobsters, or birds.",
    "Signal for help: I would use any available materials to create a signal fire or smoke signal to alert passing boats or planes of my presence on the island. I would also use any reflective materials like mirrors or aluminum foil to create a signal mirror to reflect sunlight towards any potential rescuers."
