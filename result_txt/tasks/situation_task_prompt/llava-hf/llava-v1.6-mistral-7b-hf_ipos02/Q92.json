    "Floating Sleep Pods: Another solution could be floating sleep pods. These pods would be similar to the ones used in some airlines for in-flight sleep, but designed for longer-term use. They could be filled with comfortable cushions and have built-in soundproofing and lighting to provide a restful environment. Floating sleep pods would be ideal for urban environments where space is at a premium.",
    "Rooftop Sleeping Gardens: For those who prefer a more natural sleeping environment, rooftop sleeping gardens could be a solution. These gardens would be designed with comfortable beds or hammocks placed on rooftops, providing a peaceful and secluded spot to sleep. They could be located in urban areas, where space is limited, or in more rural settings, where people can enjoy the beauty of nature while they sleep.",
    "Treehouse Sleeping: Treehouses could be repurposed as sleeping spaces, providing a unique and cozy alternative to traditional beds. They could be built in a variety of styles, from rustic cabins to more modern designs, and would be located in the treetops, providing a comfortable and secluded sleeping space.",
    "Underground Sleeping Caverns: For those who prefer a more subterranean sleeping experience, underground sleeping caverns could be created. These caverns would be dug into the earth and fitted with comfortable sleeping pods, providing a cool and dark environment that is conducive to sleep. They could be located in remote areas, where people can enjoy the peace and quiet of the natural surroundings.",
    "Repurposed Train Cars: In a world without beds, old train cars could be repurposed as sleeping spaces. These cars could be converted into comfortable and cozy sleeping compartments, providing a unique and mobile sleeping option. They could be parked in designated areas, allowing people to travel while they sleep."
