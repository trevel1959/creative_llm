    "Artificial Pollination Methods: Create a team of trained bees or butterflies that can be deployed in areas where flowers have disappeared. These pollinators can be genetically engineered to have a longer lifespan and enhanced pollination abilities.",
    "Solar-Powered Drones: Develop drones that are equipped with solar panels and pollen collectors. These drones can fly over areas where flowers have disappeared and transfer pollen to nearby plants using a built-in pollen transfer system.",
    "Plant-Based Pollination: Genetically engineer plants to produce pollen that can be transferred to other plants through natural means, such as wind or water. This could involve creating plants that produce more pollen or altering their pollen production patterns to mimic those of the missing flowers.",
    "Bee Hive-Inspired Pollination: Develop a pollination system inspired by bee hives. Create a network of underground tunnels and chambers where pollinators can collect and store pollen. These tunnels could be designed to mimic the structure of bee hives, with different sections for different types of pollen.",
    "Community-Led Pollination: Establish a community-led pollination program where individuals can participate in pollination efforts. This could involve creating a network of volunteers who collect and transfer pollen from one area to another, or establishing community gardens where pollinators can thrive."
