    "**Power Supply Issues**: Selecting an inadequate power supply unit (PSU) can lead to insufficient power for the system, resulting in instability or failure to boot. Conversely, an overly powerful PSU can lead to wasted energy and increased costs. A power calculator tool can be developed that takes into account the total wattage of the components and suggests the optimal PSU based on efficiency ratings.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When assembling computer parts, static electricity can damage sensitive components like the CPU and RAM. To mitigate this risk, an educational campaign can be created to inform builders about the importance of grounding themselves, using anti-static wrist straps, and working on non-static surfaces. Additionally, an innovative mat with built-in grounding features could be designed to help prevent static build-up.",
    "**Cooling and Airflow Management**: Improper cooling can lead to overheating, which can severely damage components. New builders might not understand the importance of airflow and may install fans incorrectly or neglect to include enough cooling solutions. A visual guide or interactive app could be developed to show optimal fan placement and cooling setups based on different case designs, helping users visualize airflow patterns.",
    "**Cable Management**: A messy cable setup can hinder airflow and make future upgrades or troubleshooting more difficult. To tackle this issue, an innovative cable management system can be designed, including modular cable ties and channels that allow users to route and organize cables efficiently. Additionally, a guide on best practices for cable management could be included in the assembly manual.",
    "**Software Installation Challenges**: After building the hardware, users may struggle with installing the operating system and drivers. To alleviate this problem, a step-by-step video tutorial series could be created that guides users through the installation process, along with troubleshooting common software issues. This could be paired with a checklist of essential drivers and software to install after the OS."
