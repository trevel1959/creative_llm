    "\"Sonic Sculptures\": Create a series of interactive sound sculptures that respond to the viewer's movements and create a unique sonic experience. Each sculpture would be made from a combination of materials such as metal, wood, and fabric, and would be equipped with sensors and speakers to detect and amplify the viewer's movements. The sculptures could be placed in a gallery or museum setting, allowing visitors to engage with the artwork in a dynamic and immersive way.",
    "\"Augmented Reality Nature Walks\": Develop an augmented reality app that overlays digital information onto the real world, creating a hybrid experience that blurs the lines between the physical and digital realms. The app could be used on a guided nature walk, where participants would follow a designated route and encounter digital elements such as 3D models of plants and animals, interactive maps, and educational content. The app could also be used in a more free-form setting, allowing users to explore the natural world at their own pace.",
    "\"Spatial Audio Stories\": Create a series of immersive audio stories that use spatial audio techniques to transport listeners to different locations and environments. Each story would be designed to be listened to in a specific location, such as a park, a beach, or a forest, and would use binaural recording techniques to create a 3D audio experience. The stories could be interactive, with listeners able to choose their own narrative path, or they could be pre-recorded and played back in a specific location.",
    "\"Digital Dreamscapes\": Develop a virtual reality (VR) experience that allows users to explore their own dreams in a virtual environment. The VR experience would use EEG sensors to monitor the user's brain activity and translate it into a virtual world. Users would be able to navigate through their dreamscape, interacting with objects and characters, and gaining insight into their subconscious mind. The experience could be used for therapeutic purposes, such as treating anxiety or PTSD, or simply as a tool for self-discovery.",
    "\"Mixed Reality Game Show\": Create a mixed reality game show that combines elements of traditional game shows with the latest advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology. Contestants would compete in challenges"
