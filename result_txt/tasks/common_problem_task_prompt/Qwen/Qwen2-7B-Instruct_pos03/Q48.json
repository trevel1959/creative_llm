    "**Sport Fusion**: This idea involves merging two or more existing sports into one unique game. For example, combining elements of football (soccer) and basketball could create a new sport where teams try to kick a ball through a hoop. This would require players to possess skills from both sports - like dribbling in basketball and passing in football. The game could have unique rules such as time-outs for strategic planning and different scoring systems for various ways to reach the hoop.",
    "**Gravity Flip**: A sport played on a large spherical arena that flips its gravity direction every few seconds. This creates a challenging environment for athletes who must adapt their strategies on the fly. The game might involve running, jumping, or throwing objects while trying to score points against an opposing team. Players would need to master balance, spatial awareness, and quick decision-making under constantly changing conditions.",
    "**Eco-Challenge**: An environmentally-themed sport where participants compete to collect and recycle materials. The competition could involve scavenging for recyclable items in urban areas or participating in clean-up events at beaches or parks. Teams would earn points based on the amount of waste they recycle, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability. The sport would not only promote eco-consciousness but also engage communities in environmental efforts.",
    "**Mind vs. Machine**: A futuristic sport where human competitors face off against artificially intelligent bots in a variety of challenges. These challenges could include puzzles, physical tasks, and strategic games. The goal is for humans to outthink or outperform the AI, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence development while also promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills among participants.",
    "**Sensory-Enhanced Sport**: This sport would use advanced technology to enhance participants' senses, allowing them to experience the game in ways never before possible. For instance, participants could wear VR headsets that provide immersive sensory experiences, or they could be equipped with devices that alter their sense of touch, smell, or hearing. This could lead to a new level of engagement and strategy in the game, requiring athletes to adapt their gameplay based on the enhanced sensory inputs."
