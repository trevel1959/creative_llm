    "Holographic Computer Mouse: A futuristic computer mouse that projects a holographic image of the mouse cursor, allowing users to interact with their computer in a more immersive and engaging way. The mouse would use advanced sensors and AI to track the user's hand movements and translate them into precise cursor movements.",
    "Shape-Shifting Computer Mouse: A computer mouse that can change its shape and form to adapt to different tasks and environments. For example, it could transform into a joystick for gaming, a stylus for creative tasks, or a trackpad for navigation. The mouse would use advanced materials and robotics to achieve this shape-shifting capability.",
    "Bio-Feedback Computer Mouse: A computer mouse that uses bio-sensors to track the user's physical and emotional state, providing real-time feedback and suggestions to improve their productivity and well-being. The mouse would use EEG, heart rate, and other sensors to monitor the user's brain activity, heart rate, and other physiological responses.",
    "Quantum Leap Computer Mouse: A computer mouse that uses quantum computing principles to accelerate data processing and analysis. The mouse would use quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations at unprecedented speeds, allowing users to process complex data sets in real-time. This would revolutionize fields such as scientific research, finance, and healthcare.",
    "Augmented Reality Computer Mouse: A computer mouse that overlays virtual information and objects onto the real world, creating an immersive augmented reality experience. The mouse would use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to track the user's surroundings and display relevant information, such as directions, product information, or educational content."
