    "Limited Space: Boutique hotels typically have a limited number of rooms, which may limit the number of guests the hotel can accommodate. This can be a problem if the hotel is located in a popular tourist destination or during peak travel seasons. To address this issue, the hotel owner may need to consider expanding the hotel or offering additional services like event spaces or meeting rooms to increase revenue.",
    "Competition: The boutique hotel industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with new hotels and concepts popping up all the time. This can make it difficult for a new boutique hotel to stand out and attract guests. To overcome this challenge, the hotel owner may need to focus on creating a unique brand and offering a distinctive experience that sets them apart from the competition.",
    "Staffing: Boutique hotels often have a smaller staff than larger hotels, which can make it more difficult to find and retain skilled employees. Additionally, staff may have higher turnover rates due to the demanding nature of the hospitality industry. To address this issue, the hotel owner may need to invest in employee training and development programs, as well as offering competitive salaries and benefits.",
    "Quality Control: With a limited number of rooms, it can be more difficult to maintain consistent quality across all rooms and services. This can be a problem if guests have different expectations and preferences. To overcome this challenge, the hotel owner may need to establish strict quality control measures and regularly inspect the hotel to ensure that all aspects of the guest experience meet their standards.",
    "Marketing: Boutique hotels may have a harder time reaching potential guests compared to larger hotels with more extensive marketing budgets. This can make it difficult for the hotel to attract the right target audience and generate bookings. To address this issue, the hotel owner may need to invest in targeted marketing campaigns and utilize social media and online review platforms to build a strong online presence and attract potential guests."
