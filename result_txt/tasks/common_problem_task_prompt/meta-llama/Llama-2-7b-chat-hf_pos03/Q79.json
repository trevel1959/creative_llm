    "City-Wide Housing Hub: Create a centralized hub that connects homeless individuals with available housing resources. The hub could be a physical location or an online platform that provides a one-stop-shop for homeless individuals to access housing services, such as application assistance, financial assistance, and case management.",
    "Micro-Housing Initiative: Develop micro-units, such as tiny homes or small apartments, that can be easily assembled and deployed in vacant lots or other underutilized spaces in the city. These micro-units could be designed to be affordable and flexible, allowing homeless individuals to have a permanent place to live.",
    "Mobile Shower and Laundry Services: Create a mobile shower and laundry service that travels to areas where homeless individuals congregate, providing on-site shower and laundry services. This would help to improve hygiene and overall well-being for homeless individuals.",
    "Community Land Trust: Establish a community land trust that allows homeless individuals to purchase or lease land at a reduced cost. This would provide a sense of stability and security, as well as a place to call home.",
    "Co-operative Housing Model: Develop a co-operative housing model where homeless individuals can purchase or lease a share in a co-operative housing complex. This would provide a collective sense of ownership and control over their living space, as well as a sense of community and support."
