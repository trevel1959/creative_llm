    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that can harness the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy, which can then be stored and used to power devices. This innovative solution would provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy, ensuring that devices continue to function even if traditional batteries fail.",
    "Pedal-Powered Generators: Develop a generator that utilizes human power to generate electricity. This device would be designed to connect to devices via USB ports, allowing users to pedal a bicycle or exercise bike to generate electricity that can be stored in the device's battery. This creative solution would provide a fun and active way to power devices, while also promoting a healthy lifestyle.",
    "Wireless Power Transfer: Create a technology that enables wireless power transfer between devices. This innovation would utilize electromagnetic fields to transfer energy between two devices without the need for physical contact. This would eliminate the need for batteries altogether, allowing devices to be constantly charged and ready for use. This technology could revolutionize the way we use and interact with our devices, making them more convenient and efficient than ever before.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a battery that uses organic matter, such as plant cells or bacteria, to generate electricity. This innovative solution would utilize the natural processes of these organisms to produce energy, providing a sustainable and renewable source of power. This technology could have a wide range of applications, from powering small devices to generating electricity for entire communities.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Fabrics: Create fabrics that can harness and store energy from the environment. These fabrics would be designed to capture and convert kinetic energy from the wearer's movement, as well as thermal energy from the environment, into electrical energy. This innovative solution would provide a convenient and sustainable way to power devices, eliminating the need for batteries altogether. This technology could have a wide range of applications, from powering wearable devices to generating electricity for entire buildings."
