    "**Smart Helmet Integration:** Develop a bicycle helmet that integrates advanced technologies like GPS tracking, Bluetooth connectivity, and AI-powered safety features. The helmet could have built-in sensors that detect sudden changes in speed or direction to alert the rider of potential dangers. It could also sync with a smartphone app, allowing friends and family to track the rider's location and receive real-time updates on their safety.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Capabilities:** Design a bicycle helmet that incorporates solar panels into its structure. This helmet would charge an internal battery as the rider pedals, providing power for built-in lights, speakers, or even a small fan for wind resistance reduction. This not only makes the helmet more eco-friendly but also enhances visibility and comfort during night rides.",
    "**Emergency Communication System:** Create a helmet with a discreet emergency button. When pressed, it automatically sends a distress signal to pre-registered contacts, including GPS coordinates of the riderâ€™s current location. The helmet could also include a loud siren and LED flashlights for attracting attention in case of accidents.",
    "**Customizable Comfort and Fit:** Develop a bicycle helmet that uses 3D scanning technology to create a personalized fit for each rider. The helmet would be adjustable based on the rider's head shape and size, ensuring maximum comfort and safety. This could also incorporate a system where the helmet learns the user's preferences over time, adjusting its settings accordingly.",
    "**Environmental Awareness and Education:** Produce a bicycle helmet that includes an educational component about environmental conservation. The helmet could display facts and tips related to sustainability, such as recycling rates, energy usage, or carbon footprints. Additionally, it could feature a small display that shows the amount of CO2 saved per ride based on factors like distance, speed, and mode of transportation (e.g., bike vs. car). This not only raises awareness but also motivates riders to contribute positively to the environment."
