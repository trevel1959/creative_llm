    "Markers or colored pencils: While not traditional writing instruments, markers or colored pencils could be used to write on paper or cardstock. The person could write with these tools, but the writing would be more permanent than with a pen or pencil.",
    "Digital writing tools: If a computer or tablet is available, digital writing tools such as a stylus or touchscreen could be used to write on a digital document. This would allow for immediate writing and the ability to edit or modify the text as needed.",
    "Stencils: Stencils could be used to write on paper or cardstock. This would require the person to have the stencil in the correct position and press down on it with a pen or pencil to create the letter or design.",
    "Carving or engraving: If the person is skilled in carving or engraving, they could use a knife or engraving tool to carve or engrave text into a material such as wood, metal, or stone. This would be a permanent form of writing, but it would be time-consuming and require a steady hand.",
    "Painting or drawing: The person could use paint or drawing tools to create text on a canvas or other suitable surface. This would be a more artistic form of writing, but it would still be legible and visible."
