    "**Scent-Activated Light Perfume Bottle**: Design a perfume bottle that not only holds the fragrance but also contains an LED light inside. The light can change color based on the scent being sprayed. For example, floral scents could trigger a soft pink glow, while spicy fragrances might activate a warm red hue. This creates an immersive experience for the user, enhancing their appreciation of the scent.",
    "**Customizable Scent Infusion System**: Create a perfume bottle with replaceable fragrance cartridges. Users can choose from a variety of base scents (like vanilla, sandalwood, etc.) and add different essential oils or fragrance blends to create unique, personalized scents. This system allows for endless customization options, making it perfect for individuals who want to tailor their perfumes to their mood or occasion.",
    "**Interactive Scent Projection System**: Develop a perfume bottle that projects the scent into the air when shaken. This technology could be particularly appealing in settings like restaurants or hotels, where guests can enjoy the fragrance without the need for multiple sprays. It would also be useful in personal spaces, such as bathrooms or bedrooms, to enhance the ambiance.",
    "**Smart Scent Delivery System**: Integrate a smart chip into the perfume bottle that can track usage and remind the user when it's time to refill or replace the fragrance. The smart system could also suggest new scent combinations based on the user's past preferences or offer recommendations based on time of day or season. This would appeal to tech-savvy users looking for convenience and personalization.",
    "**Heated/Chilled Perfume Bottle**: Design a perfume bottle that can adjust its temperature to complement the scent. For instance, a cool scent might be enhanced by keeping the bottle chilled, while a warm, comforting scent could benefit from being heated slightly. This innovative feature could elevate the olfactory experience by making the fragrance more immersive and enjoyable."
