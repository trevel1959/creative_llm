    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a hair dryer that utilizes sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals, for its construction. Additionally, implement an energy-efficient motor that reduces power consumption. This eco-friendly hair dryer could also feature a “green mode” that optimizes energy use while maintaining effective drying capabilities, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multifunctional Attachments**: Create a set of interchangeable attachments that not only serve different drying purposes but also include features like a scalp massager, hair straightener, and diffuser for curls. Each attachment could be designed to enhance specific hair types and styles, making the hair dryer a versatile tool for all hair needs. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices, saving space and cost.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism that uses a combination of UV light and heat to eliminate dust and bacteria buildup in the hair dryer. This feature would ensure hygiene and maintain the device's performance over time. Users could activate the self-cleaning mode with a simple button press, making maintenance hassle-free.",
    "**Sound Reduction Engineering**: Design the hair dryer with advanced sound-dampening technology to significantly reduce noise levels during operation. This could involve using quieter motors and sound-absorbing materials in the casing. A quieter hair dryer would be particularly appealing for users who value a peaceful environment, such as parents with sleeping children or those living in shared spaces.",
    "**Customizable LED Lighting**: Add customizable LED lighting options that allow users to choose different colors and intensities while drying their hair. This feature could be integrated with mood-enhancing settings, where soft, warm lights promote relaxation, and bright, vibrant lights energize the user. The lights could also serve as indicators for temperature settings, making it easier to manage heat levels visually."
