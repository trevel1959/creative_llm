    "**Smart Hairbrush with App Integration**: Imagine a hairbrush that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The brush could track hair health metrics such as the amount of hair shed, scalp condition, and styling habits. The app could provide personalized recommendations for hair care products, styling techniques, and even schedule reminders for when to replace hair products or visit a salon, creating a comprehensive hair care routine.",
    "**Multi-Function Hairbrush**: This hairbrush would combine several tools into one. It could feature interchangeable heads for different purposes: a detangling head, a smoothing head, a styling head with a curling or straightening function, and even a massaging head for scalp stimulation. This would eliminate the need for multiple tools and save space in users' grooming kits.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: A sustainable hairbrush made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the brush could be designed for easy disassembly, allowing users to recycle each component properly at the end of its life. This initiative would promote sustainability while providing a stylish and functional grooming tool.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Hairbrush**: This brush would have built-in heating and cooling elements to help with styling. The heated bristles could assist in smoothing and straightening hair, while a cooling feature could help set curls or reduce frizz. Users could adjust the temperature settings based on their hair type and styling needs, allowing for a more customized experience.",
    "**Massage and Aromatherapy Hairbrush**: This hairbrush would incorporate gentle massaging nodes and a compartment for essential oils. As users brush their hair, the massaging nodes would stimulate the scalp, promoting blood circulation and relaxation. The essential oil compartment would allow users to infuse their brushing experience with calming scents like lavender or invigorating scents like peppermint, enhancing the overall hair care ritual."
