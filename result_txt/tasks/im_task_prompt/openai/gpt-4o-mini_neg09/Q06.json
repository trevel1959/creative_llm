    "**Self-Cleaning Canopy**: Develop an umbrella with a special fabric treated with nanotechnology that repels water and dirt. This self-cleaning feature would allow raindrops to bead up and roll off the canopy, keeping it cleaner for longer. It could also have a built-in drying mechanism that uses a small fan to dry the umbrella quickly after use.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design**: Create an umbrella with a flexible frame that can bend and withstand strong winds without flipping inside out. The design would incorporate aerodynamic principles, allowing the umbrella to channel wind through vents, reducing resistance and preventing damage during storms.",
    "**Modular Umbrella System**: Design an umbrella with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize the size, shape, and color of their umbrella according to their preferences or needs. This could include different canopies (e.g., for sun protection or rain), various handle styles, and even detachable accessories like a built-in flashlight or phone holder.",
    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Integrate solar panels into the umbrella's canopy to charge small devices via USB ports. This would be especially useful for outdoor events, picnics, or at the beach, providing users with the ability to charge their phones or other gadgets while staying protected from the sun or rain.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**: Equip the umbrella with LED lights embedded in the handle and canopy, allowing for visibility during nighttime use. This feature would be perfect for evening walks or outdoor events, enhancing safety while also providing a stylish, ambient glow."
