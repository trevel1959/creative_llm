    "**Ironing Board Organizer**: Create an innovative ironing board that also functions as a storage system. The board would have multiple compartments to store items such as fabric softener sheets, starch bottles, ironing accessories, and even a small shelf to keep clothes while they are being ironed. The design could include a sliding drawer at the bottom for ironing supplies, and the top surface could be easily adjustable to accommodate different heights.",
    "**Smart Iron**: Develop a smart iron that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The iron could monitor the fabric type and adjust its heat settings accordingly. It could also remind you when it's time to clean the soleplate or alert you if you've left it on too long. Additionally, the app could provide tips and tutorials for proper ironing techniques.",
    "**Portable Iron Station**: Design a compact, lightweight iron station that can be carried from room to room within the house. This station would include a mini iron, a small water tank, and a retractable cord. The handle could be ergonomically designed for easy carrying, and the iron could be easily removed for use on various surfaces like clothing, curtains, or tablecloths.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Iron**: Invention of an iron that automatically cleans its soleplate after each use. This could involve a small motorized brush that removes any fabric fibers or residue, ensuring the iron is always ready for use without the need for manual cleaning. The self-cleaning feature could also help prolong the life of the iron by keeping the soleplate free of buildup.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Iron**: Create an iron that uses renewable energy sources, such as solar power, to operate. The iron would come with a solar panel that can be attached to the wall or window during use, charging the internal battery. When not in use, the iron could be placed in a docking station that continues to charge it using solar energy. This design not only reduces the environmental impact but also ensures the iron is always charged and ready to use."
