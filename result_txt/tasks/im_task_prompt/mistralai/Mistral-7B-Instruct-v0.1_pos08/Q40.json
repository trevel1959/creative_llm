    "One creative idea for sunglasses could be to design a pair that changes color based on the wearer's mood. This could be achieved through the use of special lenses or materials that react to changes in light or temperature. The sunglasses could also be equipped with sensors that track the wearer's heart rate or other physiological indicators to further personalize the color-changing experience.",
    "Another idea could be to create a pair of sunglasses that incorporate augmented reality technology. The lenses could display real-time information such as weather updates, maps, or notifications from a connected device. This would allow the wearer to stay informed and connected while enjoying outdoor activities.",
    "A third idea could be to design a pair of sunglasses that are specifically designed for people with certain medical conditions such as migraines or light sensitivity. These sunglasses could feature special filters or coatings that help to reduce glare and discomfort, making them ideal for people who spend a lot of time outdoors."
