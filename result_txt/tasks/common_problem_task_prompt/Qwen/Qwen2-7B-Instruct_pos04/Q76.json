    "**Mental Training Camp**: Develop a comprehensive mental training program that includes visualization exercises, meditation, and psychological resilience training. This can help athletes manage stress and maintain focus during the race. The program can be designed in collaboration with sports psychologists and can be conducted as a week-long retreat or spread out over several months.",
    "**Nutrition Bootcamp**: Create a personalized nutrition plan focusing on clean eating, hydration, and recovery foods. A nutritionist can help athletes understand their specific needs based on their training intensity and body composition. This might include cooking classes, nutritional workshops, and meal planning services to ensure they are fueling their bodies correctly throughout their training and race.",
    "**Cross-Training Challenge**: Incorporate other sports into the training routine to improve overall fitness and reduce the risk of injury.

The challenge could involve weekly sessions led by experts in those sports, or participation in local events to add competitive elements.",
    "**Sleep Optimization Program**: Focus on sleep quality and quantity as a critical component of recovery. Work with a sleep coach to develop a routine that maximizes rest, including strategies like sleep hygiene tips, napping, and creating a conducive sleep environment. This can be complemented by wearable tech that tracks sleep patterns and provides feedback on how to improve.",
    "**Post-Race Recovery Workshop**: After completing the Ironman, offer a workshop series focused on post-race recovery, rehabilitation, and injury prevention. This could include sessions on massage therapy, physical therapy, yoga, and mindfulness practices to help athletes recover quickly and prevent injuries. Partnering with local wellness centers or therapists can provide access to professional resources and expertise. "
