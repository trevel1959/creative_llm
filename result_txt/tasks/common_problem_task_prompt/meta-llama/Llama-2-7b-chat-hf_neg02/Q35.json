For example, a \"Penguin Palooza\" where visitors can feed and interact with penguins, or a \"Giraffe Feeding Frenzy\" where visitors can feed and learn about the tallest mammals on Earth.",
    "Sensory Exploration Areas: Create designated areas within the zoo where visitors can engage their senses through interactive exhibits and activities. For example, a \"Sensory Safari\" where visitors can touch, smell, and hear the different textures and sounds of various animals and their habitats.",
    "Zoo-to-Go: Develop a mobile app that allows visitors to explore the zoo from the comfort of their own homes. The app could include virtual tours, interactive games, and educational content, making it easier for people who may not be able0-visit the zoo in person to still learn about and engage with the animals.",
    "Conservation-Focused Events: Host events and workshops that raise awareness about conservation efforts and the importance of protecting endangered species. For example, a \"Save the Sea Turtles\" event where visitors can learn about the threats facing sea turtles and how they can help make a difference through conservation efforts."
