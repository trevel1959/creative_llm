    "**Sleep Pods**: Humans would adapt to sleep pods, which are specially designed, compact, and comfortable sleeping units that can be placed anywhere, even in public spaces. These pods would be equipped with advanced sleep technology, including temperature control, soothing sounds, and gentle vibrations to help individuals relax and recharge. They would be available in various sizes, from individual pods to larger communal ones, catering to different needs and preferences.",
    "**Sleep Suspension**: In a world without night-time, humans would develop a new form of sleep known as \"sleep suspension.\" This would involve a temporary state of suspended animation, where the body would enter a state of reduced metabolic activity, allowing individuals to conserve energy and recharge. This could be achieved through advanced technology, such as neural interfaces or bio-engineered cells, that would slow down the body's functions without causing harm.",
    "**Sleep Cycles**: Without night-time, humans would need to adapt to new sleep cycles. They would develop a system where sleep is divided into shorter, more frequent periods, allowing them to recharge and refresh their minds and bodies. This could be achieved through a combination of natural and artificial means, such as taking short naps throughout the day, using sleep-inducing substances, or employing advanced sleep technology.",
    "**Sleep Vortex**: In a world without night-time, humans would create a phenomenon known as the \"sleep vortex.\" This would be a designated area where individuals could enter a state of deep relaxation and sleep, surrounded by a soothing atmosphere and calming visuals. The sleep vortex would be a communal space, where people could come together to recharge and socialize, fostering a sense of community and connection.",
    "**Sleep Travel**: Without night-time, humans would develop a new form of travel that combines sleep and exploration. They would create \"sleep ships\" or \"dream vessels\" that would transport individuals to different destinations while they sleep. These vessels would be equipped with advanced technology that would simulate various environments, allowing passengers to experience different cultures, landscapes, and experiences while they sleep, making travel a more efficient and enjoyable experience.
