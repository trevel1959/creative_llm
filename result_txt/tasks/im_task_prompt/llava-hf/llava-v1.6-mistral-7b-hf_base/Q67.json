    "Magnetic Head: Another option could be to incorporate a magnetic head into the paintbrush. This would allow the bristles to cling to ferromagnetic surfaces, keeping them from falling on the floor and making it easier to switch between different brush types.",
    "Interchangeable Brushheads: The ability to switch between different brush heads could be a valuable feature. This would enable artists to have multiple brush head options at their disposal, allowing them to easily adapt to different painting styles and techniques.",
    "Smart Brush: Incorporating technology could be another way to improve a paintbrush. A smart brush could include sensors that detect the amount of paint being used, and adjust the flow accordingly. This could prevent over-painting or under-painting, leading to more precise and consistent results.",
    "UV Protection: Painting under bright lighting can be damaging to both the paint and the artist's eyes. A paintbrush with built-in UV protection could mitigate some of this risk, allowing artists to work in brightly lit environments without worrying about harming their work or vision.",
    "Self-Cleaning: A paintbrush that can clean itself would be a valuable tool for artists. This could involve a brush head that can vibrate or oscillate to dislodge any paint buildup, making it easier to keep the brush in good condition and extend its lifespan."
