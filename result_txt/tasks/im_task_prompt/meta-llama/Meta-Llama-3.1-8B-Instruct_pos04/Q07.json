    "A toothbrush that doubles as a mini flashlight: The toothbrush could have a small LED light at the base of the handle that can be turned on and off with a button press. This would allow users to see what they're doing while brushing their teeth in the dark, making it easier to clean hard-to-reach areas.",
    "A toothbrush with a built-in timer and Bluetooth connectivity: The toothbrush could have a built-in timer that alerts the user when it's time to switch to a different section of their mouth. The toothbrush could also connect to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing them to track their brushing habits and receive personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "A toothbrush with a replaceable head and a unique \"docking station\": The toothbrush could have a replaceable head that can be easily swapped out when it becomes worn or dirty. The docking station could be a small, sleek device that charges the toothbrush and stores the used head, making it easy to keep track of and dispose of used heads.",
    "A toothbrush with a built-in water flosser: The toothbrush could have a small water flosser built into the handle, allowing users to clean between their teeth and below the gumline with ease. This would be especially useful for people with tight spaces between their teeth or those who have difficulty flossing.",
    "A toothbrush with a built-in microphone and sound effects: The toothbrush could have a built-in microphone that detects the user's brushing habits and provides feedback in the form of sound effects. For example, the toothbrush could play a gentle \"ding\" sound when the user is brushing too hard, or a soothing \"whoosh\" sound when they're brushing effectively. This would make brushing teeth a more engaging and fun experience for kids and adults alike. </s> "
