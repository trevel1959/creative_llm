    "Social Media Integration: Integrate social media platforms directly into the TV's interface, allowing users to connect with friends, share content, and receive recommendations from their social circles. This could include features like a shared watch party mode, where multiple people can view and comment on a show in real-time, or personalized news feeds that aggregate content from users' favorite shows and influencers.",
    "Virtual Reality Experience: Offer a virtual reality (VR) mode that transforms TV watching into an immersive experience. Users can choose between different VR environments, such as a theater-like setting, a cozy living room, or even a remote location, while still enjoying the same content. This would provide a unique and memorable way to engage with television, especially for blockbuster movies or action-packed shows.",
    "Augmented Reality Enhancements: Use augmented reality (AR) technology to enrich the viewing experience. For example, when watching a historical drama, AR could overlay relevant historical facts, artifacts, or locations onto the screen in real-time, providing additional context and educational value. Similarly, for sports events, AR could highlight player stats, match predictions, or interactive replays.",
    "Personalized Content Recommendations: Implement advanced AI algorithms that learn from the viewer's habits, preferences, and reactions to suggest tailored content. The system could analyze everything from the genres watched, time spent on specific shows, and emotional responses to create a highly personalized recommendation engine. This would keep viewers engaged by constantly discovering new shows they might enjoy.",
    "Health and Wellness Integration: Introduce features focused on promoting a healthier lifestyle, such as workout routines, meditation sessions, and nutritional advice. Users can access these through dedicated channels or apps integrated into the TV, encouraging them to incorporate health-related activities into their daily TV-watching routine."
