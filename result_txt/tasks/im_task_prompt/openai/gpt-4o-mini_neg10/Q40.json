    "**Mood-Reflecting Color-Changing Lenses**: These sunglasses would utilize thermochromic or photochromic technology to change the color of the lenses based on the wearer’s mood or the intensity of sunlight. For example, when someone is feeling happy, the lenses could turn a bright yellow or orange, while a more relaxed mood might shift them to calming blue or green. This feature could also be tied to a smartphone app that tracks the wearer’s emotional state through biometrics.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Sunglasses with Built-in Solar Chargers**: To promote sustainability, these sunglasses would be made from recycled materials and include solar panels embedded in the frame. Users could charge their devices on the go by simply placing their phone or other gadgets on the sunglasses, allowing for an eco-friendly way to stay powered up while enjoying the sun.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: This innovative idea would allow users to easily swap out lenses based on their needs or preferences. The sunglasses could come with a base frame and multiple lens options for different activities—polarized lenses for fishing, blue light filtering for screen time, and UV protection for outdoor sports. This modular design would reduce waste and provide versatility for various environments.",
    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Noise-Canceling Technology**: Taking the concept of sunglasses a step further, these glasses would incorporate noise-canceling headphones into the arms of the frames. Users could enjoy their favorite music or podcasts while simultaneously protecting their eyes from the sun. This would be perfect for beach days, outdoor concerts, or simply enjoying a peaceful walk in a noisy environment.",
    "**Sunglasses with a Health Monitoring System**: These futuristic sunglasses could come equipped with sensors that monitor UV exposure, temperature, and even hydration levels. By syncing with a smartphone app, they could provide real-time feedback and alerts to help users take better care of their health while outdoors. For instance, if UV levels are too high, the glasses could remind the wearer to seek shade or apply sunscreen."
