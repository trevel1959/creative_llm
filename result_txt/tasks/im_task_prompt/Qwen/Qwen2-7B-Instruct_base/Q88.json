    "**Innovative Ski Pole Lights**: Develop ski poles that integrate LED lights into their design. These lights can be activated by a switch or motion sensor, providing enhanced visibility in low-light conditions or during night skiing. The lights can also change colors or patterns to indicate different functions, such as a strobe mode for emergency situations.",
    "**Ski Pole with Built-in Weather Sensor**: Create ski poles that include a small weather sensor to provide real-time data about the current temperature, wind speed, and even atmospheric pressure. This feature could help skiers make better decisions regarding gear and clothing, improving overall comfort and safety on the slopes.",
    "**Adjustable Grip Ski Poles**: Design ski poles with a grip that can adjust to different sizes, from children's to adult sizes, without the need for any tools. This feature would ensure that all skiers, regardless of their hand size, can have a comfortable and secure grip, enhancing control and reducing fatigue.",
    "**Ski Pole with Built-in GPS Tracker**: Incorporate a small GPS tracker into the ski pole, allowing users to track their movements on the mountain. This could be particularly useful for beginners learning to navigate different trails or for advanced skiers who want to explore new areas. The tracker could also send alerts if the skier is lost or falls behind the group.",
    "**Ski Pole with a Built-in Camera Mount**: Create a ski pole with a mount specifically designed to hold a camera securely. This would allow skiers to capture high-quality footage of their runs without worrying about holding the camera themselves, which could improve balance and potentially increase the risk of injury. The mount could be compatible with various action cameras, offering versatility for different users and occasions."
