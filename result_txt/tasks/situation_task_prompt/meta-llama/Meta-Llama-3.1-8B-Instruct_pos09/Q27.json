    "**Solar Window Technology**: Install windows with built-in solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity can be used to power a smart thermostat that regulates the indoor temperature. The windows can also be designed to absorb and store heat during the day, releasing it at night to maintain a consistent temperature. This technology would not only regulate temperature but also provide a sustainable energy source.",
    "**Greenhouse Effect**: Utilize the natural greenhouse effect by installing a transparent, domed structure above the building. This would allow sunlight to enter and warm the interior, while preventing heat from escaping. The structure could be designed with a retractable roof or walls to allow for ventilation and cooling during hot months.",
    "**Phase Change Materials**: Incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into building insulation. PCMs absorb and release heat as they change phases, maintaining a consistent indoor temperature. These materials can be integrated into walls, floors, and ceilings to provide a sustainable and energy-efficient temperature regulation system.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling**: Implement an evaporative cooling system that uses water to cool the air. This system works by drawing in hot air, which then passes through a wet mesh or pad, causing the water to evaporate and cool the air. This method is energy-efficient and can be powered by a solar panel or a wind turbine.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses thermal energy from the building's surroundings. This could be achieved by installing a network of underground pipes that absorb heat from the earth during the day and release it at night. The thermal energy can be used to power a heat pump or a refrigeration system, providing a consistent indoor temperature. This system would not only regulate temperature but also provide a sustainable and renewable energy source.
