    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Equip the table with built-in smart technology, such as wireless charging pads, Bluetooth speakers, and USB ports. The tabletop could feature touch-sensitive controls for adjusting lighting or playing music. This would transform the table into a multifunctional hub for work and entertainment, perfect for modern lifestyles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Self-Sustaining**: Design a table made from sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood or bamboo, that also incorporates a self-sustaining feature like a mini indoor garden. The table could have built-in planters that utilize hydroponics or soil, allowing users to grow herbs or small plants right on the table. This would promote sustainability and bring a touch of nature indoors.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop a table that works with AR technology, allowing users to project digital interfaces onto the surface. For example, during a meal, diners could see nutritional information about the food on their plates, or during a meeting, participants could display and interact with presentations directly on the table. This would enhance collaboration and engagement in both social and professional settings.",
    "**Dynamic Shape-Shifting Table**: Create a table that can change its shape and size based on user needs. Using advanced robotics, the table could expand for larger gatherings or retract for intimate dinners. It could also transform from a dining table to a workspace or a game table, adapting to various activities throughout the day, thus maximizing space efficiency.",
    "**Built-In Storage and Organization**: Design a table with hidden compartments and modular storage solutions. Drawers could be integrated into the table legs, or the tabletop could feature sliding panels that reveal storage for utensils, games, or office supplies. This would help keep spaces tidy and organized while providing easy access to essentials."
