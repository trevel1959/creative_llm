    "Solar panel farms: Build large-scale solar panel farms on unused land outside the city to generate electricity and distribute it to homes through underground cables. This approach would be more cost-effective than installing panels on every individual home, and would also help to reduce the visual impact of solar panels on residential areas.",
    "Solar panel-equipped bus shelters: Design bus shelters with built-in solar panels that generate electricity during the day and provide power to nearby homes through an underground network of cables. This would provide a convenient and efficient way to distribute solar energy to homes, especially in areas with high foot traffic.",
    "Solar-powered green roofs: Encourage homeowners to install green roofs with built-in solar panels. Green roofs provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create habitats for local wildlife. By integrating solar panels into the design of green roofs, homeowners can generate electricity while also enjoying the benefits of a green roof.",
    "Community solar gardens: Create community solar gardens where multiple homes can share the benefits of a single solar panel array. This approach would allow homeowners who cannot afford or do not have the space for individual solar panels to still benefit from the power of solar energy. Community solar gardens could also provide a sense of community and shared responsibility for sustainability.",
    "Solar-powered water purification systems: Install solar-powered water purification systems in homes and public spaces to provide clean drinking water. Solar panels could power a filtration system that removes impurities from water, making it safe for consumption. This approach would not only provide a sustainable source of clean water but also reduce the carbon footprint of water treatment plants."
