    "In the vibrant depths of the ocean, lived an octopus named Octavius, known for his peculiar charm—he had only seven arms. While other octopuses boasted eight, Octavius embraced his uniqueness. He painted coral with the colors of his imagination, weaving intricate tales in the sand. One day, a curious fish approached, asking why he had only seven arms. Octavius smiled, “With one less, I’ve learned to be more creative.” Inspired, the fish invited him to a grand underwater festival, where Octavius dazzled everyone with his art and stories. From that day, he became a symbol of creativity, proving that limitations can spark brilliance.",
