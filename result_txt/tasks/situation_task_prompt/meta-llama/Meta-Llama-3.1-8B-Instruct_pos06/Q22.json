    "**Aerial Transportation Network**: A network of drones and flying cars would be deployed to transport people and goods across the city. These vehicles would be powered by advanced solar panels and electric motors, reducing their carbon footprint. The network would be managed by an AI system that optimizes routes and schedules to minimize travel time and congestion.",
    "**Subterranean Tunnel System**: A vast network of tunnels and tubes would be built beneath the city, allowing people to move quickly and efficiently. These tunnels would be equipped with advanced transportation systems, such as magnetic levitation trains and vacuum-sealed tubes for high-speed travel. The tunnels would also provide a safe and secure environment for pedestrians and cyclists.",
    "**Water-Based Transportation**: The city's waterways would be revitalized, and a network of boats and barges would be used to transport people and goods. This would not only reduce congestion on land but also provide a unique and scenic way to travel. The boats would be powered by advanced solar panels and electric motors, minimizing their environmental impact.",
    "**Vertical Transportation**: The city would be transformed into a giant vertical transportation system, with towering skyscrapers and elevated walkways connecting different neighborhoods. People would use advanced elevators and escalators to move between levels, reducing the need for horizontal transportation. This would also provide stunning views of the city and its surroundings.",
    "**Personal Transportation Pods**: A network of small, autonomous transportation pods would be deployed throughout the city, allowing people to travel quickly and efficiently. These pods would be powered by advanced batteries and electric motors, and would use advanced navigation systems to avoid congestion and optimize routes. They would also provide a safe and secure environment for passengers."
