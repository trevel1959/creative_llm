    "Solar-Powered Skyboard: A skyboard that is powered by solar panels on its surface, allowing it to glide through the air without any external power source. It would be a clean and sustainable mode of transportation that could be used for short-distance travel.",
    "Maglev Train: A high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to hover above the tracks, allowing it to travel at incredible speeds with minimal friction. It would be a faster and more efficient mode of transportation than traditional trains.",
    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers and cargo at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. It would be a fast and efficient mode of transportation that could revolutionize long-distance travel.",
    "Hydrofoil: A watercraft that uses hydrofoils to propel itself through the water, allowing it to travel at high speeds with minimal drag. It would be a fast and efficient mode of transportation for short-distance travel on water.",
    "Gravity-Powered Sled: A sled that uses gravity to propel itself downhill, allowing it to travel at high speeds without any external power source. It would be a clean and sustainable mode of transportation that could be used for short-distance travel."
