    "If all water sources were polluted, one way to obtain clean drinking water would be to use a portable water filtration system that can remove contaminants and bacteria from polluted water. This system could be powered by solar energy, making it a sustainable solution for people who live in areas with limited access to clean water.",
    "Another solution would be to collect rainwater and store it in a specially designed container that can filter out pollutants and bacteria. This solution would require a large surface area to collect rainwater, but it would be a reliable source of clean drinking water for people who live in areas with low rainfall.",
    "In some cases, people may be able to obtain clean drinking water from natural sources such as rivers or streams. However, this would require extensive testing to ensure that the water is safe to drink. This could be done using portable water testing kits that can detect the presence of harmful bacteria and contaminants.",
    "People could also collect and purify sewage water using a process called wastewater treatment. This would require the installation of a sewage treatment plant that can remove contaminants and bacteria from the water. The treated water could then be used for irrigation or flushing toilets.",
    "Finally, people could look to alternative sources of water such as brackish water or groundwater. Brackish water is a mixture of freshwater and saltwater, and can be treated using a process called reverse osmosis to remove the salt and other contaminants. Groundwater can also be treated using similar methods to make it safe for drinking. However, both of these sources would require significant investment in infrastructure to extract and treat the water."
