    "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Plant: Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the temperature difference between the warm surface waters and cold deep waters of the ocean to generate electricity. An OTEC plant can be built in coastal areas, using the warm ocean water to produce steam, which is then used to power a turbine to generate electricity. The cold deep water can be used for cooling, reducing the amount of energy required for cooling. This technology has the potential to provide a significant amount of renewable energy, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.",
    "Floating Wind Turbines: Floating wind turbines are a relatively new technology that allows wind turbines to be placed in the ocean, rather than on land. These turbines are designed to float on the surface of the water, using advanced materials and designs to withstand the harsh marine environment. By placing wind turbines in the ocean, more wind energy can be harnessed, as the wind is often stronger and more consistent than on land. This technology has the potential to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy produced, particularly in coastal areas.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: A solar-powered desalination plant uses solar panels to generate electricity, which is then used to power a reverse osmosis system that removes salt and other impurities from seawater, producing fresh water. This technology has the potential to provide a reliable source of fresh water in coastal areas, where access to fresh water is limited. The plant can also be designed to produce fresh water for irrigation, supporting local agriculture and food security.",
    "Tidal Energy Farm: A tidal energy farm uses the rise and fall of the tides to generate electricity. The farm consists of a series of tidal barrages, or structures that are placed across a tidal estuary, allowing the water to flow in and out of the barrage, generating electricity through a turbine or other device. This technology has the potential to provide a significant amount of renewable energy, particularly in coastal areas with high tidal ranges.",
    "Bio-Energy Crops Plant: A bio-energy crops plant uses crops such as switchgrass, miscanthus, or willow"
