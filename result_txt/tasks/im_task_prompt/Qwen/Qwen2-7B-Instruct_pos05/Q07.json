    "**Innovative Toothbrush with LED Lights**: Design a toothbrush with integrated LED lights that change color to indicate different brushing zones or to encourage brushing for a full two minutes. The lights could also blink faster when brushing too hard, helping users develop a gentle brushing technique. This would make brushing more interactive and engaging for children.",
    "**Toothbrush with Smart Technology**: Create a toothbrush that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The app tracks brushing habits, sends reminders for brushing at specific times, and even provides feedback on areas that need more attention. It can also suggest toothpaste flavors based on the userâ€™s preferences and dietary needs.",
    "**Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, corn starch, or recycled plastics. These materials break down naturally, reducing environmental impact compared to traditional plastic toothbrushes. They could come in a variety of colors and designs to appeal to different tastes and ages.",
    "**Customizable Toothbrush Heads**: Offer toothbrushes with interchangeable heads that can be customized with various textures, bristle types, and flavors (e.g., mint, strawberry, or charcoal). This allows users to personalize their brushing experience based on their dental needs or preferences, promoting better oral hygiene.",
    "**Ergonomic Toothbrush with Adjustable Angles**: Design a toothbrush with an adjustable handle that can change angles to reach difficult areas of the mouth, such as the back teeth or gum line. This feature could include a locking mechanism to maintain the chosen angle during use. It would provide a more comfortable and effective brushing experience, particularly for those with limited dexterity or arthritis."
