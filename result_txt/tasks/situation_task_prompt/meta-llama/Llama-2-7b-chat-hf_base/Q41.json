    "Nature-Inspired Art: With paint gone, I would turn to nature for inspiration. I would use natural materials like leaves, twigs, rocks, and shells to create unique and organic decorations. I would arrange these materials in creative ways to create patterns, shapes, and designs on walls, floors, and furniture. The natural beauty of the materials would bring a sense of calm and serenity to the space.",
    "Light Installations: Without paint, I would focus on using light to create a visually striking space. I would use LED lights, neon signs, and fiber optics to create colorful and dynamic installations that add depth and texture to the space. I could create a mesmerizing light show on the walls, ceiling, or even in the furniture itself. The possibilities would be endless, and the effect would be both eye-catching and mesmerizing.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: With paint gone, I would turn to textiles to add color and pattern to my home. I would use a variety of textiles like fabric, yarn, and embroidery floss to create unique and eye-catching decorations. I could create intricate patterns on walls, floors, or furniture using these textiles, or I could use them to create soft and cozy textile installations that add warmth and comfort to the space.",
    "Three-Dimensional Collage: Without paint, I would experiment with three-dimensional collage techniques to create visually striking decorations. I would use a variety of materials like paper, cardboard, and found objects to create intricate and layered designs that add depth and texture to the space. I could create abstract sculptures or more figurative designs, depending on my mood and inspiration. The possibilities would be endless, and the result would be a unique and visually striking space."
