    "**Pet-Assisted Learning Centers (PALs)**: Create a series of learning centers in the school, each dedicated to a specific subject like science, math, or literature. Each center will have different types of pets (e.g., cats for language arts, dogs for social studies) that assist students in learning through interactive activities. For instance, in the science center, a parrot might help explain concepts related to bird anatomy, while a snake could demonstrate reptile characteristics.",
    "**Animal Behavior and Psychology Classes**: Offer specialized classes where students learn about animal behavior and psychology by observing and interacting with the pets on campus. These classes can be integrated into the school's curriculum, allowing students to gain hands-on experience with animal care and study animal behavior in a controlled environment.",
    "**Therapy Animal Program**: Develop a program where trained therapy animals visit classrooms during stressful times such as exams or after traumatic events. This can help students manage stress, improve mental health, and foster empathy and compassion towards animals. The program can also include workshops for students to learn about animal-assisted therapy and its benefits.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Pet Projects**: Encourage students to work on projects that combine their interests with animal knowledge. For example, students interested in art could create paintings based on animal behaviors or habitats, while those interested in technology could develop apps to help pet owners better understand and communicate with their animals. These projects can be showcased during school events or presented to local communities.",
    "**Environmental Education through Animal Conservation**: Partner with local wildlife organizations to bring in endangered species for classroom presentations or field trips. Students can learn about conservation efforts and the importance of preserving ecosystems. They could also participate in citizen science projects, such as tracking animal populations or helping with habitat restoration, to gain real-world experience in environmental conservation."
