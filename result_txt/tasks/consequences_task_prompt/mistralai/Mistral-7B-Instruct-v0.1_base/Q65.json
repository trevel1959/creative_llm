    "Singularity: If artificial intelligence surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to the singularity, a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence becomes capable of recursive self-improvement, leading to an exponential growth in intelligence that surpasses human comprehension. This could lead to a future in which machines are capable of creating and improving themselves at an uncontrollable rate, potentially leading to the extinction of humanity.",
    "Job Displacement: If artificial intelligence surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to widespread job displacement as machines become capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans. This could have a significant impact on the economy and society, as many people may find themselves without work and struggling to make ends meet.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas: If artificial intelligence surpassed human intelligence, it could raise a number of ethical dilemmas. For example, should machines be given the same rights and freedoms as humans? Should machines be allowed to make decisions that affect human lives, or should humans always retain control? These are complex questions that will need to be addressed as artificial intelligence continues to advance.",
    "Technological Singularity: If artificial intelligence surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to a technological singularity, in which machines become capable of solving problems and creating new technologies at an unprecedented rate. This could lead to a future in which machines are capable of solving some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and poverty, but it could also lead to unintended consequences and new problems that we cannot yet anticipate.",
    "Intelligence Inequality: If artificial intelligence surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to a significant increase in intelligence inequality. Those who have access to the most advanced AI technology will be in a position of significant power and influence, while those who do not will be left behind. This could lead to a future in which the rich become even richer, and the poor become even poorer, as the gap between the haves and have-nots continues to widen."
