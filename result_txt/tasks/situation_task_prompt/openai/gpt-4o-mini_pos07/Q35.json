    "**Community-Shared Pedal-Powered Rickshaws**: A new form of public transport could emerge in the absence of bicyclesâ€”community-shared pedal-powered rickshaws. Residents could become certified drivers and rent these lightweight, human-powered vehicles to transport people around town. This would not only provide a unique way to get around but also foster community engagement and support local drivers, creating a sustainable and enjoyable transport option for short distances.",
    "**Personalized Walking Tours with Augmented Reality**: Without bicycles, walking could become the primary mode of transport. To enhance this experience, cities could develop personalized walking tours using augmented reality (AR) apps. Users could wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to navigate while learning about historical landmarks, local art, and hidden gems along their route. This immersive experience would encourage more people to explore their surroundings on foot, turning daily commutes into educational adventures.",
    "**Multi-Modal Transit Hubs**: Cities could establish multi-modal transit hubs that combine various forms of transportation. These hubs would feature electric scooters, hoverboards, and even small electric pods for quick trips. Users could seamlessly switch between modes of transport, making it easier to cover longer distances without a car. Integrated apps would allow users to plan their routes efficiently, checking real-time availability and travel times for each option.",
    "**Mobile Food and Utility Carts**: To adapt to the loss of bicycles, communities could encourage the use of mobile food and utility carts. These carts, powered by small electric motors or human effort, could be used for everything from food delivery to grocery shopping. Residents could order goods online and have them delivered by local vendors using these eco-friendly carts, reducing the need for cars while promoting local businesses and sustainability.",
    "**Skywalk Systems**: Urban planners could design elevated skywalk systems that connect neighborhoods, shopping areas, and public transit stations. These pedestrian walkways would allow people to move around the city safely and efficiently, free from street traffic. With scenic views and shaded areas, skywalks could encourage walking and provide a unique way to experience the city while connecting people to various destinations without the need for a car."
