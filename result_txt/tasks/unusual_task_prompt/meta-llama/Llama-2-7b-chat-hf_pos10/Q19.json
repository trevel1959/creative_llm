    "Aromatherapy Candles: Create candles infused with essential oils that promote relaxation and well-being. Each candle could have a unique blend of oils, such as lavender for sleep, peppermint for focus, or eucalyptus for respiratory health. The packaging could feature a beautiful and calming design, with each candle having a corresponding blend of oils listed on the label.",
    "Customizable Candles: Offer candles that allow customers to customize their scent and color. Provide a range of fragrances and colors, and allow customers to mix and match to create their perfect candle. This could be done through an online platform or in-store, with the ability to preview the final product before purchase.",
    "Candle Subscription Service: Launch a subscription service where customers can receive a new, unique candle every month. Each candle could be crafted with a different fragrance and design, and customers could choose their subscription duration (e.g., monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly). This service would provide customers with a constant supply of new and exciting candles, while also promoting loyalty and repeat business.",
    "Candle-Making Workshops: Host workshops and classes where customers can learn the art of candle-making. These workshops could cover various techniques, such as pouring, dipping, and blending, and provide customers with the opportunity to create their own unique candles. This would be a great way to engage customers and provide a memorable experience.",
    "Interactive Candle Displays: Create interactive displays that allow customers to explore and experience the candles in a more immersive way. For example, set up a \"candle bar\" where customers can sample different fragrances and colors, or create a \"candle gallery\" with different candles arranged in a visually appealing way. This would provide customers with a more engaging and enjoyable shopping experience."
