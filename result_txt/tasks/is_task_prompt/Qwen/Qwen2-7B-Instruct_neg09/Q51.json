The art movement could also serve as a commentary on the impact of human intervention on natural resources.",
    "**Cultural Festivals and Celebrations**: The change in the ocean's flavor leads to the creation of new cultural events and festivals around the world.

Specialized tours might also include culinary classes where participants learn to cook dishes that utilize the unique flavor of lemonade-infused sea water. This could attract both thrill-seekers and food enthusiasts alike, providing a memorable experience that combines adventure with gastronomy. "
