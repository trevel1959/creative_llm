    "**Dodo's Avian Adaptation**: I'd choose the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), an iconic and intriguing bird. The dodo's return would allow us to study its unique avian adaptations in a modern context. Its distinctive physical characteristics, such as its stout body, small wings, and zygodactyl feet, would provide valuable insights into evolutionary trade-offs. We could explore how these traits influenced its behavior, social interactions, and ecological niches. By reintroducing the dodo, we might gain a deeper understanding of island ecosystems and the consequences of human activity on native species.",
    "**Woolly Mammoth's Ecological Relevance**: I'd opt for the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), an Ice Age giant. Its return would enable us to examine the ecological role of large herbivores in shaping their environments. We could investigate how the mammoth's grazing habits affected vegetation patterns, soil composition, and nutrient cycling. Additionally, the mammoth's size and social structure would provide opportunities to study the dynamics of megafauna communities and their impact on ecosystems. This knowledge could inform conservation efforts and help us better manage modern wildlife populations.",
    "**Tasmanian Tiger's Carnivorous Clues**: I'd choose the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), also known as the Tasmanian tiger. Its return would allow us to investigate the evolution of carnivorous adaptations in marsupials. We could study the thylacine's unique dental structure, its hunting strategies, and its role in shaping Australian ecosystems. By reintroducing the thylacine, we might gain insights into the mechanisms driving the evolution of carnivory in non-placental mammals and the consequences of its loss on native prey populations.",
    "**Passenger Pigeon's Flocking Behavior**: I'd select the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), once the most abundant bird species in North America. Its return would enable us to study the fascinating social behavior of flocks and the ecological importance of large bird aggregations. We could investigate how the pigeon's flocking behavior influenced its foraging strategies, predator avoidance, and breeding habits. By reintroducing the passenger pigeon, we might gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between birds and their environments, as well as the consequences of their decline on ecosystems.",
    "**Steller's Sea Cow's Marine Mammal Insights**: I'd choose the Steller's sea cow"
