    "Using Solar-powered Water Pumps: Solar-powered water pumps can be used to extract water from underground sources like wells or aquifers. These pumps can be powered by solar panels and can be used to water plants.",
    "Desalination: If all other sources of water are unavailable, one could use desalination techniques to extract saltwater from the ocean and make it drinkable. This water can then be used to water plants.",
    "Recycling Greywater: Greywater is the wastewater that comes from showers, sinks, and washing machines. It can be recycled and treated to make it safe for use in watering plants.",
    "Using Bamboo Watering Cans: Bamboo watering cans can be used to carry water from a nearby source to water plants. These cans are lightweight and can hold a large amount of water.",
    "Using Drip Irrigation Systems: Drip irrigation systems can be used to water plants with minimal water loss. These systems can be powered by solar panels and can be used to water plants even in the absence of rain."
