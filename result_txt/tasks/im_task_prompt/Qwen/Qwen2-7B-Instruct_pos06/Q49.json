    "**Smart Oral Health Monitoring System**: Create an electric toothbrush that integrates with wearable health technology like smartwatches or fitness trackers. The toothbrush would monitor brushing habits, such as duration, pressure applied, and areas missed. It could also track plaque buildup and provide real-time feedback on brushing technique, helping users improve their oral hygiene over time. The data collected could be used to create personalized oral care plans and alert users to potential dental issues early.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush**: Develop an electric toothbrush powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or kinetic energy generated from brushing. This innovation would not only reduce the environmental impact of traditional electric toothbrushes but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the toothbrush could come with biodegradable brush heads, reducing plastic waste further.",
    "**Oral Care Subscription Service**: Offer a monthly subscription service that delivers replacement brush heads, toothpaste, and other oral care products directly to customers' doorsteps. The electric toothbrush would sync with the subscription service, automatically ordering new products based on usage patterns. This would provide convenience and ensure that users always have fresh supplies, potentially leading to more consistent use of the product.",
    "**Innovative Brush Head Design**: Introduce a series of interchangeable brush heads designed for different purposes, such as sensitive gums, whitening, or deep cleaning. Each head would attach to the toothbrush via a magnetic or locking mechanism, making it easy for users to switch out according to their specific needs. This could enhance user satisfaction and encourage more frequent use of the product.",
    "**Dental Health Education App Integration**: Partner with dental professionals to create an app that pairs with the electric toothbrush. The app could provide educational content about proper brushing techniques, oral health tips, and updates on the latest dental trends. Users could receive personalized advice and reminders to maintain good oral hygiene practices, turning the toothbrush into a comprehensive oral care solution."
