    "**Innovative Art Installation**: Create an art installation using coat hangers as the primary medium. You could construct large sculptures, or intricate geometric patterns that serve as a commentary on consumerism and the transformation of mundane objects into art pieces. The installation could be placed in public spaces like parks, shopping malls, or galleries, inviting people to interact and engage with the artwork.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Fashion Line**: Design a clothing line that uses recycled coat hangers as the foundation for garment structures. This not only reduces waste but also introduces a new aesthetic to fashion, potentially appealing to eco-conscious consumers. You could explore how coat hangers can be transformed into 3D shapes, used as armholes, or even integrated into the fabric as a design element.",
    "**Interactive Educational Exhibit**: Develop an interactive exhibit at a museum or science center where visitors can use coat hangers to build various structures, from simple bridges to complex robotic arms. This hands-on experience would teach participants about physics principles such as tension, compression, and stability in a fun and engaging way.",
    "**Space-saving Furniture Design**: Design furniture that incorporates coat hangers into its structure, providing both storage and hanging space. For example, a desk with shelves that can be extended outwards to provide additional hanging space for clothes or accessories, or a bed frame that includes coat hangers for storing shoes or bags underneath. This solution is particularly useful in smaller living spaces.",
    "**Recycling Workshops**: Organize workshops in schools or community centers where participants learn how to repurpose old coat hangers into new, useful items. Activities could include creating coat hooks, key holders, or even small furniture pieces like stools or tables. These workshops not only teach valuable skills but also encourage a culture of recycling and resourcefulness."
