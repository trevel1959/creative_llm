    "Desalination Plants: In coastal areas, desalination plants can be set up to convert seawater into clean drinking water. These plants use various technologies such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet (UV) light, and distillation to remove salt and other contaminants from seawater.",
    "Community Water Filters: Community water filters can be installed in public spaces to provide access to clean drinking water for the community. These filters can be connected to a water source, such as a river or a well, and can be designed to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a system that combines fish farming with hydroponic plant cultivation. In this system, fish are raised in water, which is then circulated through a hydroponic system to grow plants. The plants absorb the nutrients from the fish's waste, and the water is filtered and reused for both fish and plant cultivation.",
    "Water Recycling: Another solution to obtain clean drinking water in a polluted water scenario would be to recycle wastewater. This can be done by treating wastewater to remove pollutants and contaminants, and then reusing it for drinking and other household purposes.",
    "Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Atmospheric water harvesting is a technology that captures water from the air and condenses it into clean drinking water. This can be done using condensers or fog collectors, which can be installed in buildings or on rooftops."
