    "Plant-based sources: Although fruits and vegetables are the primary sources of vitamins and minerals, there are plant-based alternatives that can provide essential nutrients. For instance, seaweed is a rich source of iodine, vitamin K, and folate. Soybeans, tofu, and tempeh are good sources of plant-based protein and can be fortified with vitamins and minerals.",
    "Fortified foods: Many foods, including cereals, pastries, and snack bars, can be fortified with vitamins and minerals. This means that these products can be manufactured to contain additional nutrients, such as vitamin B12, iron, or zinc, which may not be present in their original form.",
    "Vitamin and mineral supplements: If essential nutrients are not available in the diet through food sources, supplements can be taken to ensure adequate intake. Supplements can be found in various forms, including capsules, tablets, and powders, and can be purchased at health food stores or online.",
    "Personalized nutrition plans: A personalized nutrition plan can be created to ensure that an individual receives all the necessary vitamins and minerals. This may involve consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can assess an individual's dietary needs and provide recommendations for alternative food sources or supplements.",
    "Gardening and food production: If all fruits and vegetables disappeared, individuals could consider growing their own food or participating in community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs. This way, they can have access to fresh, locally grown produce, which may be more resilient to global food shortages."
