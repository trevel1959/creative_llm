    "**Initial Installation Costs**: Although solar panels can lead to long-term savings, the upfront costs of installation can be prohibitive for many homeowners. This could create inequity, where only wealthier households can afford the initial investment, leaving lower-income families without access to renewable energy.",
    "**Aesthetic Concerns**: Some homeowners may be concerned about how solar panels will affect the appearance of their homes. This could lead to resistance from residents who prioritize architectural integrity or historical preservation, potentially causing conflicts within the community.",
    "**Maintenance and Repairs**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to ensure they operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of the ongoing maintenance requirements, leading to potential performance issues and additional costs if panels are neglected.",
    "**Regulatory and Zoning Issues**: Local regulations may not support widespread solar panel installation. Zoning laws might restrict where panels can be placed, or homeowners associations might have rules against them, creating barriers to implementation.",
    "**Interconnection Challenges**: The local grid may not be equipped to handle the influx of energy produced by numerous solar panels. This could lead to technical challenges, such as the need for upgrades to the electrical grid, which could delay the project and increase costs."
