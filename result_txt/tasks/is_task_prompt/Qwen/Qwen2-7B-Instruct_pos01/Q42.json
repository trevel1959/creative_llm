    "**Sun-powered Snore Suppressors**: Develop a device that harnesses the energy of the sun to power a fan placed next to a snorer. The fan creates a gentle breeze that helps disperse the air, reducing the loudness of the snoring. This idea could be particularly innovative in eco-conscious communities. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Solar-Powered Sleep Pods**: Create sleep pods that utilize solar energy to power their internal systems, such as lights, fans, or white noise machines. These pods can offer a serene and comfortable environment for snorers and their partners, promoting better sleep quality. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Sun-Inspired Soundscapes**: Develop a series of audio tracks featuring natural sounds, like the rustling of leaves or the chirping of crickets, which are recorded during sunrise or sunset. Playing these soundscapes can help mask the sound of snoring, making it less disruptive to others. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Sun-Themed Sleepwear**: Design clothing specifically for snorers that incorporate reflective materials or patterns that mimic the sun's rays. These clothes can create a calming effect on the wearer, potentially reducing the intensity of snoring due to relaxation. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Sun-Sensitive Snoring Sensors**: Invent sensors that attach to the face or use a smartphone app, which detects changes in facial expressions associated with snoring. These sensors could trigger a fan or other devices to respond automatically, mitigating the snoring without waking the person up. Confidence Score: 0.8"
