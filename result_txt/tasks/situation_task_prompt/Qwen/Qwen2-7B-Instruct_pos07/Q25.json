    "**Human-Powered Ladder Climbing**: Create a large, sturdy ladder that can be safely climbed by multiple people simultaneously. This ladder could have rungs that expand and retract to accommodate different heights. It would require a team effort, with some individuals climbing while others assist or provide support at the base.",
    "**Inflatable Slide**: Design an inflatable slide that extends from the lower floors of the building to the higher levels. This could be a fun, adventurous way to reach the top but would also require safety measures such as harnesses, padding, and careful supervision to ensure safety.",
    "**Customized Elevator Harness System**: Develop a system where individuals are harnessed together, forming a human chain. This group would use their combined strength to pull themselves up the sides of the building using ropes and pulleys attached to the building's structure. Safety protocols would need to be meticulously planned and executed to prevent accidents.",
    "**Sky-Hung Gliders**: Create lightweight, portable gliders that can be assembled on-site. Participants would use these gliders to descend down the building's exterior, potentially utilizing wind currents for propulsion. Safety gear and training would be essential, as well as ensuring there is a safe landing area at each level.",
    "**Vertical Rappelling Competition**: Organize a competition where participants race to rappel down the building's exterior. This could include teams competing against each other, with the fastest time winning. Safety measures would include experienced instructors, safety equipment, and clear guidelines for participants. This could be a thrilling event with potential sponsorship opportunities for added excitement."
