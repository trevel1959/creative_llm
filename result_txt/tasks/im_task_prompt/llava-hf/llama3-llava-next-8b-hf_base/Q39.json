    "Pressure-regulating Spigots: Attach pressure-regulators to the hose's nozzle to prevent water pressure damage to garden tools and plants when using high-pressure water.",
    "Water-conserving Spray Nozzles: Incorporate water-saving spray nozzles that allow users to adjust the water pressure and flow, minimizing water waste for more effective watering.",
    "Water-recycling System: Equip the hose with a built-in water-repelling surface (e.g., nanotechnology) that repels insects and reduces the need for chemicals and pest control, promoting a healthier garden.",
    "Self-cleaning Materials: Design the hose using bacteria and algae-resistant materials, reducing maintenance and promoting better water quality.",
    "Smart Technology: Integrate sensors and Bluetooth connectivity into the hose to monitor soil moisture levels, enable remote monitoring, and send automatic alerts when water may be needed."
