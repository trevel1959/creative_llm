    "**Sun-Friendly Adaptations**: The idea revolves around the polar bear developing a unique adaptation that allows it to thrive in sunny environments. For instance, the polar bear could evolve with a reflective coat or special fur that absorbs sunlight efficiently, providing warmth without overheating. It could also have larger, more reflective eyes to help it see in bright conditions. This adaptation would allow the polar bear to bask in the sun, perhaps even seeking out sunny spots during its daily routine. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Sun-Soothing Musician**: In this scenario, our polar bear learns to play a magical instrument that produces soothing sounds only audible to other polar bears. These sounds are said to alleviate their fear of the sun, which is often a cause of stress due to the intense glare and lack of shade in sunny areas. The bear becomes a community leader, organizing music sessions that bring polar bears together, helping them cope with the challenges of sunny climates. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
