    "Use the position of the sun to track time. This would require a good understanding of astronomy and the ability to calculate the time based on the position of the sun.",
    "Use the movement of the earth to track time. This could be done by measuring the frequency of vibrations caused by the movement of the earth, such as the tides or earthquakes.",
    "Use the cycles of nature to track time. This could be done by observing the growth and decay of plants or animals, or by tracking the changing seasons.",
    "Use the cycles of the human body to track time. This could be done by tracking the natural sleep-wake cycle or the menstrual cycle.",
    "Use a digital device to track time. This could be done by using a smartphone or other device to track the time based on the device's internal clock. However, this would require a constant power source and a reliable device."
