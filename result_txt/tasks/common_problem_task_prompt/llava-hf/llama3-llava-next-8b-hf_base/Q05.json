    "Weather exposure - Tree houses are subject to weather elements such as rain, snow, and strong winds. These elements can lead to wear and tear on the structure, causing it to weaken over time. It's crucial to consider and protect the tree house from these weather conditions.",
    "Building regulations and permits - In many areas, there may be regulations that dictate where and how tree houses can be built. There may be height restrictions or other requirements that builders must adhere to. Failure to obtain necessary permits can result in fines or even the demolition of the structure.",
    "Building on unstable ground - Soil stability is important for a tree house's foundation. Building on unstable ground or soil can lead to the structure collapsing over time. It is crucial to have a proper ground assessment done before construction begins.",
    "Access - Building a tree house high up in a tree can make it difficult to access. The scaffolding or makeshift ladders can be risky and dangerous to use. This could pose a challenge for maintenance and repairs of the structure over time.",
    "Wildlife and insects - Tree houses are often built in wooded areas or near trees, which can attract wildlife and insects. Pesticides and insect repellants may need to be used to protect the structure and occupants."
