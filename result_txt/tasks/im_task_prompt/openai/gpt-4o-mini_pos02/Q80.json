    "**Ergonomic Whisk with Adjustable Handle**:    Design a whisk with an adjustable handle that can change its length and angle based on the user's comfort and the mixing bowl's size. This ergonomic design would reduce wrist strain and make it easier to whisk in deep bowls or pots. The handle could also feature a soft, non-slip grip for added comfort during prolonged use.",
    "**Multi-Functional Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**:    Create a whisk that comes with interchangeable heads for different mixing tasks. For example, a standard balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for sauces, and a spiral whisk for thicker mixtures. The heads could be easily swapped out and locked into place, making it a versatile tool for various culinary tasks while reducing the need for multiple utensils.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Mixing Bowl**:    Develop a whisk that incorporates a mixing bowl into its design. The whisk could have a collapsible or foldable bowl that expands when needed and collapses for easy storage. This would be perfect for small kitchens or for those who love to whisk on-the-go, such as campers or travelers who want to prepare quick meals without needing extra dishes.",
    "**Whisk with Color-Changing Heat Indicator**:    Design a whisk with heat-sensitive materials that change color when the mixture reaches a certain temperature. This feature would help bakers and cooks know when their ingredients are at the right temperature for optimal mixing, especially when working with chocolate or eggs, which require specific temperatures for best results.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Recipe Guide**:    Imagine a whisk that has a small, detachable digital display on its handle, showcasing recipes and instructions. Users could scroll through various recipes and receive step-by-step guidance while whisking. This would be especially helpful for novice cooks who need assistance with timing and techniques, making the cooking process more accessible and enjoyable."
