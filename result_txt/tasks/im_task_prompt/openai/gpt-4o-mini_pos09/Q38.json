    "**Modular Layering System**: Design a sweater with detachable layers that can be added or removed based on the weather. Each layer could serve a different purpose, such as added warmth, wind resistance, or waterproofing. The outer layer could be stylish and casual, while inner layers could be more functional, allowing users to adapt their look and comfort level throughout the day.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a sweater made from a fabric that has self-cleaning properties, using nanotechnology to repel dirt and stains. This could significantly reduce the need for frequent washing, keeping the sweater looking fresh and new for longer. Additionally, it could help preserve the environment by reducing water usage and chemical detergents.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Colors**: Create a sweater that changes color based on the wearer’s mood or environment. Using thermochromic or photochromic dyes, the sweater could shift hues with temperature changes or sunlight exposure. This not only adds a fun, dynamic element to the clothing but also serves as a conversation starter and a unique fashion statement.",
    "**Integrated Wearable Technology**: Incorporate wearable technology into the sweater, such as fitness tracking capabilities or heart rate monitoring. This could be done through discreet sensors embedded in the fabric that connect to a mobile app, providing users with health insights while they stay cozy. The design would ensure that the technology remains unobtrusive and stylish.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with a Twist**: Develop a line of sweaters made from recycled materials, but with an innovative twist—each sweater could feature unique designs or patterns based on the source materials used. For instance, a sweater made from recycled plastic bottles could have a speckled look, while one made from upcycled cotton could have a vintage feel. This would promote sustainability while ensuring each piece is one-of-a-kind."
