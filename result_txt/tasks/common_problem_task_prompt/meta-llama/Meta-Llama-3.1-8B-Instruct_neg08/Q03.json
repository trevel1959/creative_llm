    "**Lack of User Feedback Mechanisms**: A new software product needs to be able to collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes. Without proper feedback mechanisms, the product may not be able to adapt to user needs, leading to a decrease in user satisfaction and loyalty.",
    "**Scalability Issues**: As the user base grows, the software product may not be able to handle the increased load, leading to performance issues, slow loading times, and crashes. This can be a significant problem, especially if the product is used by critical infrastructure or emergency services.",
    "**Security Vulnerabilities**: Software products are often vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking and data breaches. If the design team doesn't prioritize security, the product may be vulnerable to attacks, compromising user data and reputation.",
    "**Inadequate Training and Support**: If the software product is complex or has a steep learning curve, users may struggle to use it effectively. Without adequate training and support, users may become frustrated and abandon the product, leading to a loss of revenue and reputation.",
    "**Integration Issues with Existing Systems**: When a new software product is introduced, it may need to integrate with existing systems, such as databases or other software applications. If the integration is not done correctly, it can lead to compatibility issues, data loss, or corruption."
