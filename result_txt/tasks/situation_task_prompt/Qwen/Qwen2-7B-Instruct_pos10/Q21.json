    "**Memorization Network**: Develop a system where individuals memorize large amounts of information. This network would function like a collective brain, where specific members would be assigned to remember different topics. For example, one person could focus on scientific facts, another on historical events, and so on. To access information, users would contact the appropriate member who would recall and share the required data.",
    "**Pre-Recorded Data Storage Devices**: Create a vast collection of pre-recorded data on physical storage devices such as hard drives, tapes, or flash drives. These could be stored in secure, underground vaults around the world. When the internet crashes, individuals or organizations could retrieve these devices and access the information manually using software designed for reading and displaying the content.",
    "**Analog Communication Networks**: Utilize traditional communication methods like telegraph lines, Morse code, and long-distance phone calls. Establish networks of trained operators who can relay messages between locations. This would require a significant amount of time for communication, but it could provide a way to exchange critical information during an internet outage.",
    "**Distributed Database Systems**: Set up a decentralized database system where information is stored across various physical locations rather than centralized servers. Each node would contain a portion of the data, and they would communicate directly when needed. This would ensure that even if one location loses its connection, others can still provide information until connectivity is restored.",
    "**Community-Led Information Kiosks**: Create standalone kiosks in public areas equipped with large screens and touch interfaces. These kiosks would store and display common information, such as news, weather updates, and emergency contact numbers. Users could interact with the kiosks to access data without needing an internet connection, fostering community self-reliance and information sharing."
