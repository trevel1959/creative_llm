    "**Aerial Lift System**: I would propose installing a temporary aerial lift system, consisting of a network of pulleys, ropes, and cranes, to transport people and essential goods to the top of the skyscraper. This system would be powered by a combination of human effort and mechanical advantage, allowing for a safe and efficient ascent.",
    "**Zip Line Rescue**: In the absence of elevators, I would suggest utilizing a zip line system to transport people to the top of the skyscraper. This would involve setting up a series of zip lines, each with a secure harness and a braking system, to enable a controlled and thrilling ride to the top.",
    "**Stairway Network**: I would propose creating a network of interconnected stairways, using existing building infrastructure, to provide a safe and accessible route to the top of the skyscraper. This would involve retrofitting the building with additional stairways, handrails, and emergency lighting to ensure a smooth and secure journey.",
    "**Rope-Assisted Climbing**: In a pinch, I would suggest using rope-assisted climbing techniques to ascend the exterior of the skyscraper. This would involve using specialized equipment, such as ropes, harnesses, and carabiners, to create a secure and controlled climb to the top.",
    "**Aerial Platform Deployment**: I would propose deploying a series of aerial platforms, suspended from a network of cables and pulleys, to provide a safe and accessible route to the top of the skyscraper. These platforms would be designed to support multiple people and would be equipped with safety features, such as harnesses and emergency braking systems."
