    "**Mood-Based Scheduling**: Introduce a mood tracking feature that allows users to input their current mood or energy level. The calendar assistant could then suggest activities or tasks that align with the userâ€™s emotional state. For instance, if a user feels stressed, the assistant could recommend lighter tasks or breaks, while on a high-energy day, it could suggest tackling challenging projects or social events.",
    "**Augmented Reality Calendar Views**: Develop an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows users to visualize their schedules in a 3D space. Users could wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to see their calendar overlaid in their physical environment, allowing them to interact with their schedule in a more engaging way. They could, for instance, \"grab\" tasks and move them around or visualize their day as a journey through a virtual landscape.",
    "**Collaborative Planning Spaces**: Create a feature that allows multiple users to collaborate on a shared calendar in real-time. This could be especially useful for teams or families, where users can suggest, vote on, and confirm events together. The assistant could facilitate discussions, track changes, and even send reminders to ensure everyone stays updated on shared commitments.",
    "**Gamification of Scheduling**: Introduce a gamification element where users earn points or rewards for completing tasks or adhering to their schedules. Users could set personal goals, and the assistant could provide fun challenges or achievements (like streaks for attending meetings on time) that motivate users to stick to their plans. This could be paired with social features where users can compete with friends or colleagues for added motivation.",
    "**Health and Wellness Integration**: Enhance the calendar assistant by integrating health and wellness features. Users could log their physical activity, sleep patterns, or mental health status, and the assistant could suggest breaks, exercise sessions, or mindfulness activities throughout the day. For example, if a user has been sitting for too long, the assistant could remind them to take a short walk or do some stretches."
