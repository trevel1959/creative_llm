    "**Innovative Watering System**: Create a watering can that utilizes a built-in timer and moisture sensor. The can automatically waters the plants when needed, ensuring that the plants are neither overwatered nor underwatered. This could be particularly beneficial for people who often forget to water their plants or live in a busy lifestyle where gardening might be overlooked.",

The scent is released as the water is poured, making the act of watering a soothing experience. This idea caters to individuals seeking relaxation and mindfulness through their gardening practices.",
    "**Solar-Powered Watering Can**: Integrate solar panels into the design of the watering can to charge an internal battery. Once charged, the can can pump water for a certain duration, making it a great solution for people living in areas with limited access to electricity or those who want a sustainable way to water their plants.",
    "**Interactive Educational Tool**: Produce a watering can that includes a QR code or NFC tag.
