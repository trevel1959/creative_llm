    "Mirror-like camera: Create a camera that has a mirror-like surface on its body, allowing users to see themselves and their surroundings in real-time while taking a photo or video. This would enable users to adjust their poses and expressions without having to stop and check their reflection on a separate screen.",
    "Shape-shifting camera: Develop a camera that can change its shape and form to adapt to different shooting situations. For example, it could transform into a wide-angle lens for landscape shots or a telephoto lens for portraits. This would allow photographers to have more flexibility and creative control when taking photos.",
    "Interactive camera: Create a camera that responds to voice commands or gestures, allowing users to control the camera's settings and functions hands-free. This could be particularly useful for vloggers, live streamers, or photographers who need to keep their hands free to move around or interact with their subjects.",
    "Invisible camera: Develop a camera that can be worn as a pendant or hidden in clothing, allowing users to capture photos and videos without being noticed. This could be useful for covert photography or for capturing candid moments without disturbing the subject.",
    "Holographic camera: Develop a camera that captures 3D holographic images, allowing users to view and interact with the holographic image in real-time. This could be particularly useful for applications such as education, entertainment, or advertising, where immersive and interactive experiences are desired."
