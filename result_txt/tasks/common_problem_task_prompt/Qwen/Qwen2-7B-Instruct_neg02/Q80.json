    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Instead of using traditional, high-emission vehicles for transportation, opt for bicycles or electric cars. You could even hire a fleet of vintage bicycles for your guests or rent a Tesla for the couple's getaway car. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also adds a unique touch to your wedding.",
    "**Seasonal & Local Food**: Choose a menu that includes seasonal, locally sourced food items. This supports local farmers, reduces the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation of food, and ensures the freshest ingredients. You could work with a chef who specializes in farm-to-table cuisine to create a delicious and sustainable meal.",
    "**Zero-Waste Banquet**: Implement a zero-waste policy by minimizing waste from food and decorations. Use compostable plates, cutlery, and cups, and encourage guests to bring their reusable containers for leftovers. Decorations can be made from biodegradable materials like bamboo, hemp, or recycled paper. Consider a professional waste management company to help manage any waste generated.",
    "**Sustainable Fashion Choices**: Encourage your wedding party and guests to wear clothes made from sustainable materials such as organic cotton, linen, or recycled fabrics. You could even offer a small discount to those who choose to dress sustainably. For the wedding dress and suits, consider renting rather than buying new garments, which can significantly reduce the environmental impact.",
    "**Renewable Energy Sources**: If possible, arrange for renewable energy to power your wedding venue. This could include solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal heating/cooling systems. Alternatively, you could purchase carbon credits to offset the energy consumption of your event. Make sure to communicate your commitment to sustainability to all vendors and guests, possibly through signage or informational cards at the venue."
