    "The Law of Gravity: The universe would have a unique gravitational force that governs the behavior of matter and energy. This force could be weaker or stronger than Earth's gravity, and it could have different properties such as being attractive or repulsive. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "The Law of Light: The universe would emit light in various forms, including visible light, radio waves, and even gravitational waves. The properties of light could be different from our universe, such as having different colors or wavelengths. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Law of Time: Time would flow differently in the new universe, possibly slower or faster than our own. This could result in unique phenomena such as time dilation or time reversal. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "The Law of Matter: The universe could have different types of matter, such as antimatter or exotic matter, with unique properties that differ from our own. This could lead to interesting phenomena such as matter-antimatter annihilation or the creation of stable exotic matter structures. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Law of Energy: The universe could have a unique form of energy that is not present in our own, such as a fifth fundamental force or a new form of radiation. This could have significant implications for the behavior of matter and energy within the universe. Confidence Score: 0.95"
