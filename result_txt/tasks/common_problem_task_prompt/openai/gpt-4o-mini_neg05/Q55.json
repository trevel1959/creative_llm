    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Gaining support from local communities can be challenging, especially if they feel that the park might limit their access to resources or land. To mitigate this, organizing workshops and informational sessions can help educate the community about the benefits of conservation. Creating a \"Friends of the Park\" program can also foster a sense of ownership and collaboration, allowing locals to participate in park activities and conservation efforts.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Securing funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant hurdle. Relying solely on government grants may not be sustainable. A creative approach could involve developing a multi-faceted funding strategy that includes partnerships with businesses, crowdfunding campaigns, and eco-tourism initiatives. Additionally, establishing a membership program for nature enthusiasts can generate a steady income stream.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: The introduction of invasive species can threaten the integrity of the ecosystem in the conservation park. Without a proper management plan, these species can outcompete native flora and fauna. A proactive strategy could involve creating a dedicated team for ongoing monitoring and removal of invasive species, as well as implementing educational programs for visitors to prevent the accidental introduction of non-native species.",
    "**Infrastructure Development vs. Conservation Goals**: Building infrastructure such as visitor centers, trails, and restrooms is often necessary for public access but can conflict with conservation goals. To address this, a design strategy that prioritizes eco-friendly materials and minimizes environmental impact is essential. Utilizing green architecture principles and conducting environmental impact assessments can ensure that infrastructure development aligns with conservation objectives.",
    "**Wildlife Human Interaction Conflicts**: As the park becomes a destination for visitors, conflicts may arise between wildlife and humans, leading to potential harm to both. To manage this, implementing clear guidelines for visitor behavior and creating designated viewing areas can minimize disturbances. Educational signage about local wildlife and their habitats can promote responsible behavior among visitors, reducing the likelihood of negative interactions."
