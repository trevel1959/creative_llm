    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Craft a leash made from eco-friendly materials that decompose naturally over time, reducing environmental impact. This not only promotes sustainability but also aligns with the growing trend of green living. Additionally, it could be designed with a unique, textured pattern that reduces slipping, making walks more comfortable for both the dog and the handler.",
    "**Adjustable & Expandable Leash System**: Create a modular leash system that allows for different configurations, such as connecting multiple leashes together for groups of dogs or expanding the length for more freedom during walks. This would offer versatility, catering to various situations and dog sizes.",
    "**Infrared Heat Sensor Dog Leash**: Incorporate an infrared sensor into the leash that detects changes in temperature. If the dog gets too close to a heat source (like a car engine), the leash vibrates or emits a warning sound, alerting the owner to prevent potential burns or injuries.",
    "**Pet-Friendly Light-up Leash**: Design a leash with integrated LED lights for nighttime walks, ensuring visibility and safety. The leash could have customizable colors or patterns, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and making each dog stand out. It could also double as a distress signal by flashing in an emergency situation.",
    "**Waterproof and Floatable Leash**: Make the leash waterproof and buoyant, perfect for beach or lake outings. This design prevents the leash from getting tangled in water currents or dragging along the ground, and ensures it stays accessible when retrieving the dog from water."
