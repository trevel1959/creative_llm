    "**Adjustable Scissor Handles for Customized Grip**:    Designing scissor handles with adjustable grips would allow users to customize the fit to their individual hand sizes and preferences. This could be achieved through a modular system with interchangeable grip components, enabling users to find the perfect fit for their hands.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Scissors**:    Developing self-sharpening scissors would eliminate the need for manual sharpening, making them more convenient and reducing the risk of accidents. This could be achieved through a built-in sharpening mechanism that uses a combination of diamond-coated surfaces and advanced materials.",
    "**Scissors with Integrated Cutting Guides**:    Incorporating cutting guides directly into the scissor design would provide users with precise control over their cuts, reducing waste and improving overall accuracy. These guides could be implemented using a combination of visual markers and subtle tactile cues.",
    "**Ergonomic Scissor Handles with Integrated Wrist Rests**:    Designing scissor handles with integrated wrist rests would provide users with a more comfortable and supportive grip, reducing fatigue and strain on the wrist. This could be achieved through a contoured handle design that cradles the wrist, providing a secure and stable base for cutting.",
    "**Scissors with Built-in LED Lighting**:    Adding LED lighting to scissors would provide users with improved visibility when cutting in low-light environments, reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall safety. This could be achieved through a series of small LEDs embedded along the blade or handle."
