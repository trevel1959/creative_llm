    "**Innovative 3D-Scrolling Mouse**: Develop a computer mouse that uses advanced sensors to detect the user's hand movements in three dimensions. This allows users to scroll not just vertically but also horizontally and diagonally, enhancing productivity and reducing repetitive strain injuries associated with traditional scrolling.",
    "**Smart Mouse for Left-Handed Users**: Create a mouse specifically designed for left-handed individuals, which could have the buttons arranged on the right side, making it more comfortable and intuitive to use. The design can include ergonomic features and customizable settings to cater to individual preferences.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Mouse**: Integrate gesture recognition technology into the mouse, allowing users to perform actions like clicking, scrolling, or selecting text by simply waving their hand near the device. This would make computing more natural and less dependent on direct physical contact with the mouse.",
    "**Wireless Charging Mousepad**: Design a mousepad that charges the mouse wirelessly while in use. The mouse would have a built-in battery and a charging coil, while the pad would have a power source. This would eliminate the need for USB cables and reduce clutter on the desk.",
    "**Ergonomic Mouse with Adaptive Feedback**: Develop a mouse that adjusts its sensitivity and shape based on the user's grip and typing style. The device might use pressure sensors to determine the optimal angle and force needed for the most comfortable and efficient typing experience. It could also provide real-time feedback on posture and typing habits to promote better ergonomics."
