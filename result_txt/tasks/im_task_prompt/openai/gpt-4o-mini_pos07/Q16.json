    "**Smart Hair Analysis**: Integrate sensors within the hairbrush that analyze hair health as it is brushed. The brush could assess factors like moisture levels, damage, and scalp condition, providing real-time feedback through a connected app. This would allow users to tailor their hair care routines and products based on their unique hair needs.",
    "**Adjustable Bristle Flexibility**: Design a hairbrush with adjustable bristle flexibility that allows users to switch between firm and soft bristles depending on their hair type or styling needs. A simple dial or button on the handle could enable this feature, catering to those with different hair textures and preferences.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Brushing**: Create a hairbrush with built-in heating elements that can warm up to help with styling and drying. This would be particularly useful for users who want to quickly smooth out their hair or set styles without needing to reach for a separate styling tool. The temperature could be adjustable and controlled via an app for personalized experiences.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a hairbrush made from biodegradable or recycled materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This eco-conscious design would appeal to environmentally-aware consumers, and the brush could come with a take-back program for recycling or repurposing old brushes.",
    "**Multi-Function Handle**: Design a hairbrush with a multifunctional handle that includes a built-in mirror, comb, and even a compartment for storing hair ties or clips. This would provide convenience for users on the go, allowing them to have all their essential hair care tools in one compact design."
