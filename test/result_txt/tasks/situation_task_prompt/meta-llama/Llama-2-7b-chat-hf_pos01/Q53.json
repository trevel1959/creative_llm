    "Instrument-based performances: In a world without recorded music, people could rely on live performances to experience music. Musicians could perform in public spaces, such as parks, plazas, or community centers, and people could gather to listen and appreciate the music. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Oral tradition: Music could be passed down through oral tradition, with musicians learning from their elders and sharing their knowledge with others.

    "Memory-based music: People could rely on their personal memories of music to create new songs and melodies. This would involve drawing from past experiences, emotions, and memories to create new music, rather than relying on recorded recordings. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Aural training: In a world without recorded music, musicians could develop their aural skills by training their ears to recognize and mimic different sounds, melodies, and rhythms.

    "Improvisation: Musicians could rely on their improvisational skills to create new music on the spot, using their knowledge of different scales, chords, and rhythms. This would allow for a more spontaneous and creative approach to music-making, as musicians would be able to respond to their surroundings and emotions in real-time. Confidence Score: 0.8"
