    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) System**: Develop a network of vertically-stacked, mesh-like structures that can capture water vapor from the air. The system would utilize condensation technology to collect and store water, ensuring a reliable source of hydration for communities. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Water-Generating Skyscrapers**: Design buildings with integrated water-gathering systems, incorporating materials like hydrophobic surfaces, fog collectors, or even aerodynamic shapes to maximize water collection. These skyscrapers would serve as self-sustaining water sources, providing a reliable supply for urban populations. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Floating Water Farms**: Establish artificial islands or floating platforms that utilize ocean water collection systems, desalination technology, or even seawater harvesting. These water farms would provide a sustainable source of water for coastal communities, minimizing the impact on the surrounding ecosystem. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Condensation-Based Water Collectors**: Create wearable devices or portable systems that harness condensation from human breath, body heat, or even industrial processes. These devices would collect and store water, providing a personal and efficient means of hydration in a rainless environment. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Aerodynamic Water Harvesting**: Develop large, wing-like structures that can harness wind energy to collect and condense water vapor from the air. These aerodynamic collectors would be placed in strategic locations, such as mountain passes or coastal areas, to maximize water collection and supply. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
