    "A paperclip with a built-in stapler: This idea combines the functionality of a paperclip with a stapler, making it a versatile tool for office use. The paperclip could have a small stapler mechanism integrated into its design, allowing users to staple papers together without needing a separate stapler. This would save space and time, as users wouldn't need to search for a stapler every time they need to staple a document.",
    "A paperclip with a built-in ruler: This idea adds a measuring tool to the paperclip, making it easier for users to measure and align papers. The ruler could be a simple strip of plastic or metal that is integrated into the paperclip's design, allowing users to measure distances and angles with ease. This would be especially useful for students and professionals who need to measure and align papers frequently.",
    "A paperclip with a built-in flashlight: This idea adds a light source to the paperclip, making it useful for tasks that require illumination. The flashlight could be a small LED light that is powered by a battery or a supercapacitor, allowing users to light up dark areas without needing a separate flashlight. This would be especially useful for people who work or study in low-light environments, such as basements or late at night.",
    "A paperclip with a built-in calculator: This idea adds a calculator function to the paperclip, making it a handy tool for quick calculations. The calculator could be a simple display that shows basic arithmetic functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This would be especially useful for people who need to perform simple calculations frequently, such as students, accountants, or construction workers.",
    "A paperclip with a built-in wireless charging pad: This idea adds a wireless charging pad to the paperclip, making it possible to charge small devices without needing a separate charging station. The paperclip could have a small charging coil integrated into its design, allowing users to place their devices on the paperclip to charge them wirelessly. This would be especially useful for people who are always on the go and need to keep their devices charged without needing to carry a separate charging cable."
