    "**Multi-Sensory Alerts**: Instead of just relying on sound, integrate a multi-sensory alert system that uses lights, vibrations, and even scent release. For instance, when the alarm is triggered, it could flash bright lights, vibrate a wearable device, and release a specific scent (like citrus) to alert those nearby without causing panic or confusion.",
    "**Emergency Response Integration**: Partner with local emergency services to create a direct link from the alarm system to responders. When an alarm is triggered, it can automatically notify the nearest police station or fire department, providing them with real-time data such as the type of alarm, location, and even live video feeds from security cameras.",
    "**User-Friendly Mobile App**: Develop a comprehensive mobile app that allows users to control their alarm system remotely. This app could feature a user-friendly interface that provides real-time alerts, a history of alarm events, the ability to set custom security modes (like 'Away' or 'Home'), and even a panic button that sends immediate alerts to emergency contacts.",
    "**Biometric Access Control**: Upgrade the alarm system with biometric features, such as fingerprint or facial recognition technology. This would allow only authorized users to disarm the system, making it more secure against unauthorized access. Additionally, it could log entries and exits, providing a detailed account of who is home at any given time.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Expand the alarm system to include environmental sensors that monitor for hazards such as smoke, carbon monoxide, or flooding. In the event of a detected hazard, the system would not only sound an alarm but also send alerts to the homeownerâ€™s phone and local emergency services, providing comprehensive safety coverage."
