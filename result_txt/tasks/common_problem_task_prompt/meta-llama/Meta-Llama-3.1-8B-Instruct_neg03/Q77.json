    "**Galactic Oasis**: Envision a boutique hotel that resembles a futuristic space station, with rooms designed to resemble planetary environments. Guests can choose from various \"planets\" to stay in, each with its own distinct theme, decor, and even scents. The hotel's central hub would be a zero-gravity lounge where guests can float, dine, and socialize while taking in breathtaking views of the surrounding cityscape through a massive, floor-to-ceiling window.",

Guests could even participate in workshops to learn traditional crafts, music, or dance from around the world.",
    "**The Dreamweaver**: Envision a boutique hotel that taps into the world of dreams and the subconscious. Guests would be able to choose from a variety of \"dreamscapes\" to sleep in, each designed to induce specific types of dreams or emotional responses. The hotel's rooms would feature cutting-edge sleep technology, including brain-computer interfaces and neurofeedback training. Guests could even participate in guided meditation and lucid dreaming workshops to explore the depths of their own subconscious. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are quite creative and original.
