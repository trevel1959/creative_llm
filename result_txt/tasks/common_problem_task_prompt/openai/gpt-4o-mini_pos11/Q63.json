    "**Time Zone Coordination**: Organizing events or activities across multiple time zones can lead to confusion and decreased participation. For example, a live-streamed event scheduled at a convenient time for one region might be at an inconvenient hour for another. To address this, the campaign could implement a \"rolling event\" strategy, where activities are repeated at different times to accommodate various audiences globally.",
    "**Digital Divide**: Not all regions have equal access to the internet or technology, which can limit participation in online fundraising efforts. Some areas may struggle with slow internet speeds or lack access to smartphones and computers. To counter this, the campaign could incorporate offline fundraising activities, such as local events, community gatherings, or partnerships with local businesses that can facilitate donations.",
    "**Transparency and Trust Issues**: Donors are increasingly concerned about where their money goes and how it is used. If the campaign lacks transparency about fund allocation, it may deter potential contributors. To build trust, the campaign should provide clear information about how funds will be used, offer regular updates on research progress, and share success stories resulting from previous donations.",
    "**Competing Campaigns**: The fundraising landscape is crowded, with many organizations vying for attention and donations. This competition can dilute the message and impact of the campaign. To stand out, the campaign could create a unique theme or challenge, such as a global \"Run for Research\" event, where participants can log their miles, raising awareness and funds simultaneously while promoting a sense of community.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Different countries have various laws regarding fundraising, tax deductions, and financial reporting. Navigating these legalities can be complex and may lead to unintentional violations. To mitigate this risk, the campaign should collaborate with local legal experts to ensure compliance with regulations in each target country and streamline the fundraising process."
