    "**Tactile Textures:** Each object could have a unique texture or surface quality that distinguishes it from others. For instance, wood might feel smooth and cool, while metal could be rough and warm to the touch. Textiles like fabrics or clothes could also vary in texture, such as soft cotton, scratchy wool, or slippery silk.",
    "**Sound Signatures:** Every object could make a distinct sound when touched, shaken, or manipulated. For example, a bell could produce a ringing sound, a glass might shatter upon impact, and a piece of paper could crinkle softly.",
    "**Temperature Changes:** Objects could be designed to be at slightly different temperatures, providing a sensory clue for differentiation. A cold ice cube could be placed in contrast to a warm cup of coffee, or a heated iron to distinguish it from a cold plastic spoon.",
    "**Olfactory Distinctions:** Each item could have a unique scent or odor that helps in identification. For instance, a book might smell of paper and ink, a flower could carry the sweet fragrance of nectar, and food items could have their characteristic aromas.",
    "**Vibrational Patterns:** Some objects could vibrate at specific frequencies that can be detected by the human body. A tuning fork, for example, vibrates at a consistent pitch, while a mechanical device might hum at a particular frequency. These vibrations could be used to identify the type and nature of an object."
