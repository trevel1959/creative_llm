    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Develop a built-in dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules of detergent, which dissolve during the wash cycle. This system would eliminate the need for plastic detergent bottles, reduce waste, and ensure the correct amount of detergent is used for each load, promoting sustainability.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Drum**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and UV light to sanitize the drum after each wash cycle. This would help prevent the buildup of mold and mildew, ensuring that clothes come out fresh and clean while also reducing maintenance efforts for the user.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Create an augmented reality (AR) interface that allows users to interact with the washing machine through their smartphones or smart glasses. Users could visualize the wash cycle, receive maintenance alerts, and even get step-by-step guidance on how to operate the machine effectively.",
    "**Dual Wash Compartments**: Design a washing machine with two separate compartments that can wash different loads simultaneously. This feature would allow users to wash delicates and heavier fabrics at the same time, saving time and energy while ensuring that each load is treated appropriately.",
    "**Water Recycling System**: Incorporate a water recycling system that collects and filters water from previous washes to be reused in future cycles. This would significantly reduce water consumption and promote sustainability, especially in areas facing water scarcity."
