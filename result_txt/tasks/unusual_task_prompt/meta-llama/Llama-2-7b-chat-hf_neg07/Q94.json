    "Blender-based Virtual Interior Decoration: Develop an AI-powered virtual interior decoration tool that utilizes Blender's 3D modeling capabilities to create customized and realistic interior designs. Users can upload images of their existing rooms or draw the layout of a new space, and the tool will generate a detailed 3D model with furniture, lighting, and decor. The tool can also suggest color palettes and materials based on the user's preferences, making it easy to visualize and realize their desired space.",
    "Blender-based 3D Printing Design: Create a plugin for Blender that enables users to design and print 3D objects directly within the software. Users can create complex shapes and designs using Blender's powerful modeling tools, and the plugin will export the design to a 3D printing software for fabrication. This would streamline the 3D printing process and make it more accessible to a wider range of users.",
    "Blender-based Virtual Reality Architecture: Develop a plugin for Blender that allows architects and designers to create virtual reality (VR) models of their designs. Users can import their Blender models into the VR environment and walk through the space, interacting with the design in a more immersive and realistic way. This would be particularly useful for architects and designers who want to present their designs to clients or stakeholders in a more engaging and interactive way.",
    "Blender-based Motion Graphics Animation: Create a set of tools and scripts for Blender that enable users to create motion graphics animations directly within the software. Users can create complex animations using Blender's powerful modeling and animation tools, and the tools will generate the final animation in a variety of formats, including MP4, GIF, and SVG. This would be a powerful tool for graphic designers, animators, and video editors who want to create motion graphics animations without leaving the Blender environment.",
    "Blender-based Artificial Intelligence: Develop a plugin for Blender that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate 3D models and animations. Users can input a few basic parameters, such as the desired shape or subject, and the AI will generate a complete 3D model or animation. This would be"
