    "**Temperature-Regulating Fabric**: Develop a yoga mat made from a special fabric that can regulate temperature. This material would be able to cool down during hot yoga sessions and warm up during cooler practices. By incorporating phase change materials (PCMs), the mat could help maintain an optimal temperature, enhancing comfort and performance.",
    "**Smart Feedback Technology**: Create a smart yoga mat equipped with pressure sensors that provide real-time feedback on alignment and posture. Users could connect the mat to a mobile app that offers personalized tips, visual cues, and progress tracking. This feature would help beginners learn proper techniques and allow advanced practitioners to refine their practice.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Modular Design**: Introduce a modular yoga mat that consists of interlocking pieces made from sustainable materials. Users could customize the size and thickness of their mat based on their preferences and the type of yoga they practice. This design would also make it easy to replace individual sections when they wear out, promoting longevity and reducing waste.",
    "**Dual-Sided Textures**: Design a reversible yoga mat with different textures on each side. One side could have a sticky, textured surface ideal for standard practices, while the other side could be smoother and more forgiving for restorative yoga or stretching. This versatility would allow users to switch sides based on their practice needs and preferences.",
    "**Built-in Alignment Guide**: Incorporate printed alignment guides directly onto the surface of the yoga mat. These guides could include lines, dots, or symbols that help users align their bodies correctly during various poses. This feature would be especially beneficial for beginners, providing visual cues to enhance their understanding of proper alignment and form."
