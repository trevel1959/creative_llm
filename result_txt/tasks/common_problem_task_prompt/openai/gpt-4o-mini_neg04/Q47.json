    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Handling sensitive electronic components can pose a risk of static electricity damage. Even a small static charge can fry components like the CPU or RAM. To prevent this, builders should use an anti-static wrist strap, work on a non-static surface, and avoid wearing materials that generate static, like wool. It’s also helpful to frequently ground oneself by touching a metal object.",
    "**Cooling Issues**: A common problem when building a computer is inadequate cooling, which can lead to overheating and potential damage to components. New builders might overlook the importance of proper airflow or the necessity of thermal paste application on the CPU cooler. To address this, it’s crucial to plan for adequate case fans, ensure that the airflow direction is correct, and properly apply thermal paste according to guidelines.",
    "**Cable Management**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered interior, obstructing airflow and making future upgrades difficult. New builders might struggle with organizing cables effectively, leading to a chaotic build. To solve this, it’s beneficial to use zip ties, Velcro straps, or cable management sleeves to keep cables tidy. Planning cable routing before installation can also help maintain an organized setup.",
    "**BIOS/UEFI Configuration**: After assembling the hardware, the next challenge is configuring the BIOS or UEFI settings. New builders may not know how to navigate these settings, which can affect system performance or prevent the computer from booting. To overcome this, users should consult the motherboard manual for guidance on essential settings like boot order, XMP profiles for RAM, and fan controls. Online forums and videos can also provide helpful tutorials.",
    "**Software Installation and Drivers**: Once the hardware is set up, the next hurdle is installing the operating system and drivers. New builders may encounter issues like missing drivers or software incompatibilities. To avoid this, it’s essential to download all necessary drivers from the manufacturer’s website beforehand. Creating a bootable USB drive with the operating system can streamline the installation process, and keeping a checklist of required software can help ensure nothing is overlooked."
