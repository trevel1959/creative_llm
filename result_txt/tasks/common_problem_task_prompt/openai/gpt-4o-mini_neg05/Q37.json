    "**Budget Constraints**: Art exhibitions can be costly to organize, and managing a budget can present numerous challenges. Issues may arise from underestimating costs related to venue rental, insurance for the artwork, marketing expenses, and catering for opening events. A tight budget could limit the quality of promotional materials or the ability to hire skilled staff, ultimately affecting the exhibition's success.",
    "**Artist Coordination and Communication**: Engaging with multiple artists can lead to misunderstandings regarding artwork submission deadlines, installation requirements, and insurance for their pieces. If communication is not clear, it could result in artists not delivering their work on time or in the right condition, leading to last-minute scrambling to fill gaps in the exhibition.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the exhibition is essential to attract visitors. Problems may include a lack of targeted marketing strategies, insufficient budget for advertising, or failing to leverage social media effectively. If the exhibition does not reach its intended audience, attendance could be lower than expected, impacting sales and overall visibility for the artists involved.",
    "**Artwork Handling and Installation**: The physical handling and installation of artwork can be fraught with challenges. Issues may arise from improper handling that could damage delicate pieces, insufficient installation support for larger works, or not having the right tools and equipment on-site. If artwork is not displayed properly, it can detract from the viewer's experience and diminish the perceived value of the artists' work.",
    "**Insurance and Liability Concerns**: Protecting the artwork during the exhibition is vital, and failure to secure adequate insurance can lead to significant financial loss in case of theft, damage, or accidents. Potential problems include navigating the complexities of insurance policies, ensuring that all artwork is covered, and understanding liability issues if visitors are injured during the event."
