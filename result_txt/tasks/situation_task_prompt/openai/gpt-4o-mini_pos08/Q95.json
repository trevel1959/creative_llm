    "**Cloud Cushion**: Replicate the softness of a pillow by filling a fabric bag with natural materials such as feathers, down, or even soft grass. This “cloud cushion” can be shaped to fit the contours of your head and neck, providing support without the bulk of a traditional pillow. The bag can be sewn from breathable fabric to keep the contents dry and comfortable, and it can be easily adjusted by adding or removing filling.",
    "**Foam Rollers**: Use foam rollers, commonly used for muscle recovery, to create a supportive sleep surface. By laying one or two foam rollers on their side, you can rest your head on the gentle curvature they provide. The firmness of the foam helps maintain proper alignment of the neck and spine, allowing for a restful sleep while also giving your muscles a chance to relax.",
    "**Towel Stack**: Roll up several towels and stack them to create a custom pillow. The number of towels can be adjusted based on personal comfort preferences, allowing for a soft yet supportive surface. This DIY pillow can be tailored to suit different sleeping positions, whether you sleep on your back, side, or stomach, ensuring that your head and neck are adequately supported.",
    "**Sandbag Pillow**: Fill a soft, durable bag with clean sand or rice to create a weighted pillow. The natural weight of the sand provides a comforting sensation, and the bag can mold to the shape of your head. This method not only supports your head but also offers a calming pressure that can help reduce anxiety and promote deeper sleep.",
    "**Bamboo Roll**: Create a cylindrical pillow using bamboo shoots, which are lightweight yet sturdy. By cutting and hollowing out a section of bamboo, you can create a firm yet comfortable surface to rest your head. The natural shape of the bamboo can cradle your neck, while its coolness can provide a refreshing touch during warm nights."
