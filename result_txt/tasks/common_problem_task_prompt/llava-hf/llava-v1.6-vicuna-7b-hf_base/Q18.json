    "Health and hygiene challenges: Without access to electricity for refrigeration, food storage and preservation become significantly more difficult. This can result in an increased risk of food spoilage, leading to a higher prevalence of foodborne illnesses. Additionally, limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities can increase the risk of waterborne diseases.",
    "Communication and connectivity: In an electricity-free society, traditional forms of communication, such as handwritten letters, may be the primary means of communication. This can lead to slower information sharing and an increased reliance on memories or oral traditions. Moreover, modern technological advancements, such as smartphones and the internet, would no longer be accessible, limiting education and economic opportunities.",
    "Access to healthcare: In a world without electricity, medical equipment that relies on electricity, such as lifesaving machines and modern surgical tools, would become unusable. Consequently, emergency medical procedures and lifesaving treatments may become difficult or impossible to perform, leading to a higher mortality rate.",
    "Transportation: The absence of electricity would render most modern forms of transportation obsolete or difficult to operate. Roadways and railroads would also require intensive manual labor for maintenance and construction, which would hinder mobility and increase travel times. This would result in a decrease in the efficiency of movement of goods and people across the region.",
    "Industrial production: Electricity is a crucial input for various industries, such as manufacturing, mining, and construction. Without electricity, these industries would come to a standstill, leading to widespread unemployment and decreased economic activity."
