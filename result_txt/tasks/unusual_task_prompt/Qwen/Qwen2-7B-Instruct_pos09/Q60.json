This versatile design would cater to diverse clothing needs and help maximize closet space.",
    "**Personalized Fragrance-Infused Hangers:** Introduce hangers infused with scents tailored to complement different types of clothing. For example, woody fragrances for suits, floral scents for dresses, or fresh aromas for casual wear. This idea combines fashion with sensory experiences, offering a subtle yet delightful way to enhance the overall wardrobe experience.
