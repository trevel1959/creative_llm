    "Natural Phenomena: Another way to keep track of time is by observing natural phenomena such as the tides, moon phases, or the growth of plants. For example, in many coastal regions, low tide occurs around the same time every day, which can be used as a reference point to estimate the time.",
    "Personal Timekeeping: You could also develop a personal timekeeping system based on your own habits and routines. For instance, you could use a specific event or activity as a reference point, such as the time you start your morning exercise or the time you finish your evening meal.",
    "Astronomical Observations: Another way to keep track of time is by observing celestial bodies. For example, the stars in the night sky can be used to estimate the time of night. By identifying specific constellations or stars that rise and set at predictable times, you can use them as reference points to estimate the time.",
    "Use of a Smartphone: Although not a traditional method, a smartphone with a GPS-enabled app can be used to keep track of time. These apps can use the phone's GPS signal to estimate the time based on the position of the phone relative to the sun.",
    "Use of a Solar-Powered Watch: While not a traditional method, a solar-powered watch can be a useful backup option. These watches use the power of the sun to charge their batteries and can be used to keep track of time even in the absence of other timekeeping devices."
