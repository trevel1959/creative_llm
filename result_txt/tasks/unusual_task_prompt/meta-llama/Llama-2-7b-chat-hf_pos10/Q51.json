The scissors would have two separate blades, one for cutting and the other for stitching. The stitching blade would be retractable, allowing for easy switching between cutting and stitching tasks. This feature would be particularly useful for tailors, seamstresses, and craftspeople who need to make precise cuts and stitches.",
    "Smart scissors with augmented reality display: These scissors would come equipped with an augmented reality (AR) display built into the handle. The display would show a virtual representation of the material being cut, allowing the user to see the cut line in real-time. This would be especially useful for cutting intricate designs or for people who are new to cutting and need visual guidance. The AR display could also provide tutorials or guides for different cutting techniques, making it a valuable tool for both professionals and beginners.",
    "Scissors with a built-in trimmer: This design combines the functionality of scissors with a built-in trimmer, allowing users to trim and cut their materials with ease. The trimmer would be located on the handle of the scissors and would be retractable, allowing for easy switching between cutting and trimming tasks. This feature would be particularly useful for people who need to trim and cut large quantities of materials, such as hairstylists or craftspeople working with fabric.",
    "Scissors with a ergonomic grip: These scissors would feature an ergonomic grip design that provides comfort and support for the user's hand. The grip would be contoured to fit the natural shape of the hand, reducing fatigue and strain during extended use. This feature would be particularly useful for people who use scissors frequently, such as hairstylists, tailors, or craftspeople who spend long hours working on projects.",
    "Solar-powered scissors: These scissors would be powered by solar energy, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option for cutting and trimming materials. The solar panels would be integrated into the handle of the scissors,"
