    "**Space Pod**: Create a portable, self-contained sleeping pod that could be attached to the underside of a desk or table. This would allow for sleep in virtually any location, whether at home, school, or work. The pod would have built-in ventilation, lighting, and temperature control systems, ensuring a comfortable sleep environment. ",
    "**Inflatable Hammock**: Design an inflatable hammock that can be easily carried around and set up anywhere. It could be made from lightweight, durable materials, and come with a pump for quick inflation. The hammock would also include built-in noise-canceling headphones and adjustable straps for different heights.",
    "**Sleeping Tents**: Utilize the concept of camping tents but shrink them down for urban environments. These tents would be compact, foldable, and easy to transport. They would also feature modular components such as windows, doors, and lighting, allowing for customization based on personal preferences and needs.",
    "**Gravity-Neutral Bed**: Develop a bed that can adjust its gravity level, allowing users to sleep in zero-gravity conditions. This bed would be especially beneficial for people who often travel or need to adapt to different gravitational forces, such as astronauts or those who frequently change time zones. The bed would use advanced technology to simulate the feeling of weightlessness while sleeping.",
    "**Smart Sleep Pods**: Integrate smart technology into the design of traditional beds, transforming them into smart sleep pods. These pods would be equipped with sensors to monitor sleep patterns, adjust the environment (temperature, light, noise) accordingly, and even provide guided meditation or breathing exercises to help users fall asleep more easily. The pods could be connected to smartphones or smart home devices for remote control and monitoring."
