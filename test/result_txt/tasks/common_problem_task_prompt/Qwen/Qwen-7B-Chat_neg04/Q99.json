    "Smart glasses with built-in object recognition technology: These glasses would use advanced computer vision algorithms to identify objects in the user's environment and provide audio descriptions of them. The glasses could also be programmed to recognize specific objects, such as doors or buttons, and provide haptic feedback when they are detected.",
    "Voice-activated braille display: This device would allow visually impaired users to interact with their environment using only their voice.
