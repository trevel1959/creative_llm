    "**Urban Overcrowding and Resource Depletion**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the population would skyrocket, leading to unprecedented overcrowding. This would result in severe resource depletion, including food, water, and energy. The city's infrastructure would struggle to accommodate the massive influx of people, causing widespread shortages and rationing. As a result, social unrest, crime, and disease would spread rapidly, making life in the city a constant struggle for survival.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: A single city would lead to a complete collapse of the global economy. The traditional concept of trade and commerce would be rendered obsolete, as resources would be limited and competition for them would be fierce. The city's economy would be based on a bartering system, with people exchanging goods and services for basic necessities. This would lead to a significant decrease in economic mobility and innovation, as people would be focused on survival rather than progress.",
    "**Loss of Cultural Diversity**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, cultural diversity would be lost. Different cultures and traditions would be forced to coexist in a single, homogenous environment, leading to the erasure of unique customs and practices. This would result in a loss of cultural identity and a sense of community, as people would be forced to conform to a single, dominant culture.",
    "**Environmental Disaster**: A single city would be a environmental disaster waiting to happen. The massive population would lead to unprecedented pollution, waste management issues, and strain on the city's infrastructure. The city would become a breeding ground for diseases, as people would be living in close proximity to each other and to waste. This would lead to a significant decrease in air and water quality, making life in the city a constant health risk.",
    "**Psychological Trauma**: Living in a single city would be a traumatic experience for many people. The constant stress of living in close proximity to others, combined with the lack of personal space and freedom, would lead to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and mental health issues. The city would become a place of constant stress and anxiety, where people would be constantly on edge and struggling to cope with the demands of urban life."
