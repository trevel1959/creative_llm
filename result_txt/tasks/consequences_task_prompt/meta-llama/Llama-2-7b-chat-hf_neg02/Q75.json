    "The oceans covering 71% of the Earth's surface would turn into freshwater lakes, reshaping the planet's geography and ecosystems. The transformation would have a profound impact on marine life, with many species struggling to adapt to the sudden change in environment.",
    "Coastal cities and communities would need to relocate inland to avoid being submerged by the newly formed freshwater lakes. This would lead to a massive migration of people, causing social and economic disruptions.",
    "The freshwater lakes would have a profound impact on global weather patterns, altering the distribution of rainfall and temperature. The change in temperature would also affect the global climate, leading to unpredictable weather events such as intense storms and droughts.",
    "The transformation of the oceans would also have a significant impact on the Earth's geology. The sudden change in water volume would cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, as the Earth's crust adjusts to the new weight distribution.",
    "The freshwater lakes would become a valuable resource, providing a new source of freshwater for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use. However, the sudden availability of freshwater would also lead to conflicts over its distribution and management, as different regions and industries compete for access to this limited resource."
