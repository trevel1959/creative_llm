    "Create a memory journal: In the absence of photos and paintings, we could start keeping a memory journal. This could be a physical notebook or an online journal where we write down our daily experiences, thoughts, and emotions. We could also include descriptions of people we meet, their personalities, and the events we witness. This would help us keep track of our memories and experiences over time.",
    "Record audio and video interviews: We could start recording audio and video interviews with people who have been important to us in the past. We could ask them about their experiences, thoughts, and emotions during significant events in our lives. This would help us remember their voices and personalities, even if we don't have any visual records of them.",
    "Create a scrapbook of tangible objects: We could start collecting tangible objects that represent memories, such as tickets to concerts or sporting events, souvenirs from trips, or trinkets from special occasions. These objects could serve as a physical reminder of the people and events that have been important to us in the past.",
    "Write poetry or fiction: We could start writing poetry or fiction that captures our memories and experiences. This could be a creative way to preserve our memories and share them with others. We could write about the people we've met, the places we've been, and the emotions we've felt.",
    "Participate in community events: We could start participating in community events, such as festivals, concerts, or sporting events. These events could provide us with new experiences and memories to cherish. We could also meet new people and form connections with them, which could help us remember the people we've met in the past."
