    "Cloud Harvesting: Build a network of cloud-harvesting towers across the affected area. These towers would be designed to collect and store water droplets from clouds, which could then be distributed to communities in need. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Atmospheric Water Extraction: Develop a technology that can extract water from the atmosphere, using a process called atmospheric water extraction. This technology could be used to collect water from the air, even in areas with little to no rainfall. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Desert Greenhouses: Build large-scale greenhouses in desert areas that are designed to collect and store rainwater. These greenhouses would be equipped with specialized systems to capture and store rainwater, which could then be used for irrigation and other purposes. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Ocean Water Distillation: Develop a technology that can distill seawater into fresh water. This technology could be used to collect water from the ocean, even in areas with limited access to fresh water. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bio-Sand Water Filters: Create a network of bio-sand water filters across the affected area. These filters would be designed to remove impurities and contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption. Confidence Score: 0.6"
