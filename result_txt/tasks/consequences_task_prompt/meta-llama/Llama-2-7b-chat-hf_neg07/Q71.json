    "Overpopulation and resource depletion: With immortality, the population would grow exponentially, leading to a strain on resources such as food, water, and energy. The Earth's ecosystem might not be able to sustain an endless stream of immortal beings, leading to resource shortages and potential conflicts over access to resources.",
    "Social and economic upheaval: Immortality would fundamentally change the nature of society and the economy. The concept of retirement, pensions, and inheritance would become obsolete, leading to a complete reorganization of the social safety net and financial systems. The value of money and the nature of work could also change, as people could continue to work and contribute to society indefinitely.",
    "Psychological and emotional challenges: Living forever would come with unique psychological and emotional challenges. Immortal individuals might experience boredom, loneliness, and a lack of purpose, as they would have an infinite amount of time to fill. They might also struggle with the loss of loved ones, as they would outlive their friends and family.",
    "Ethical considerations: Immortality would raise complex ethical questions, such as whether immortal individuals have a moral obligation to use their time and resources to benefit humanity. There could also be debates over the fairness of immortality, with some arguing that it is unfair to grant immortality to a select few while others die.",
    "The possibility of immortal dictatorships: With immortality, certain individuals could potentially become immortal dictators, ruling for centuries or millennia. This could lead to a concentration of power and a lack of accountability, as immortal leaders could outlast any challenges or opposition. The possibility of immortal dictatorships would require new forms of governance and checks on power to prevent abuses of authority."
