    "**Interactive Storytelling Pillowcases**: Each pillowcase could have a unique story printed on it, with different sections of the story appearing as one turns over the pages. Inside the pillowcase, there could be hidden pockets containing cards with additional details or prompts to help engage children in interactive storytelling sessions. This would combine creativity, imagination, and physical comfort.",
    "**Therapeutic Pillowcase for Sleep Improvement**: This pillowcase could be infused with essential oils known for their calming properties, such as lavender or chamomile.
