It could also cater to performers in circuses or theatrical productions, offering a unique spectacle for audiences.",
    "**Interactive Educational Exhibits**: Develop an interactive educational experience focusing on the unique features and biology of a zebra-striped horse. Visitors can learn about genetic modification, animal behavior, and conservation efforts. This could include virtual reality simulations, hands-on exhibits, and guided tours led by experts. Such a project would appeal to educational institutions, zoos, and science museums, promoting scientific understanding and appreciation for biodiversity.",
    "**Artistic Collaborations**: Engage artists, designers, and musicians to create a collaborative project inspired by a zebra-striped horse. This could manifest in various forms like paintings, sculptures, music compositions, and dance performances.
