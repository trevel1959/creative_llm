    "**Microfilm**: Microfilm is a technology that allows information to be stored on a small roll of film. It can store large amounts of data in a compact form and can be read using a microfilm reader or scanner. The film can be kept in an archive for long periods of time without degradation, making it a potentially viable option if all digital data were lost.",
    "**Magnetic particles on glass**: Another method involves coating glass surfaces with magnetic particles that can be programmed with data using a magnetic field. These particles can retain their data for decades under normal conditions. The glass plates could then be stacked and stored in a secure location.",
    "**Carbon Nanotube Storage**: Scientists are currently researching ways to use carbon nanotubes as a storage medium due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio and potential for storing vast amounts of data. Information could be encoded into these nanostructures, which could then be stored in a secure, physical location.",
    "**Porous Materials**: Porous materials like ceramic or glass can be filled with tiny capsules containing information. These capsules can be made from biocompatible materials so they don't harm living organisms, and they can be sealed and stored in various environments, including deep underground or in space.",
    "**Biochemical Encoding**: In this innovative approach, genetic material such as DNA could be used as a storage medium. Data could be encoded into the DNA sequences, and then stored in a controlled environment. The advantage of this method is that DNA has an extremely high data density and can potentially last for millions of years."
