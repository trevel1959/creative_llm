    "In the heart of the savannah, there lived a lion named Leo, known for his majestic mane but lacking a roar. While other lions intimidated with their thunderous calls, Leo communicated through kindness. One day, a drought struck, and the animals turned to Leo for guidance. Instead of roaring to assert dominance, he gathered them and suggested they work together to find water. Inspired by his wisdom, they formed a coalition. With their combined efforts, they discovered a hidden oasis. From that day forward, Leo’s silent strength taught the savannah that true leadership isn’t about power, but about unity and compassion.",
