    "**Biodegradable Waste Bags**: Invent and promote the use of biodegradable waste bags. These bags are made from natural materials like corn starch or cellulose that decompose quickly when disposed of. They can replace traditional plastic bags used for waste collection, significantly reducing environmental pollution.",
    "**Smart Trash Management System**: Develop a smart trash management system that uses sensors to detect waste levels in bins. This system could alert individuals or local authorities when a bin is full, encouraging timely collection. It could also incorporate recycling capabilities, sorting waste automatically into categories like paper, plastics, and organic waste.",
    "**Portable Waste Stations**: Create portable waste stations that people can carry with them. These could be small, lightweight bags or containers with built-in filters to prevent odor. This encourages personal responsibility for waste management and could be especially useful during outdoor activities or while traveling.",
    "**Community Composting Program**: Initiate a community composting program where people can bring their food scraps and yard waste to centralized composting facilities. The compost produced can then be used for community gardens, parks, or sold back to residents as a sustainable soil amendment.",
    "**Innovative Waste-to-Energy Technology**: Develop technology that converts non-biodegradable waste into energy. This could involve pyrolysis or gasification processes that convert waste into biochar or bio-gas (a mix of methane and other gases), which can be used to power homes, vehicles, or even public services like street lighting."
