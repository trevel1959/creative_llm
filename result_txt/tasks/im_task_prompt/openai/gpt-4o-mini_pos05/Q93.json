    "**Adjustable Weight System**: Design a bowling ball with an adjustable weight mechanism. Bowlers could add or remove weights to customize the ball's mass according to their preferences or specific lane conditions. This feature would allow bowlers to experiment with different weights to find their ideal balance for optimal performance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material Composition**: Create a bowling ball made from sustainable materials that do not compromise performance. By using biodegradable composites or recycled materials, the bowling industry could significantly reduce its environmental impact. This initiative would appeal to eco-conscious bowlers and promote sustainability in sports.",
    "**Customizable Surface Textures**: Develop a bowling ball with interchangeable surface textures that can be easily swapped out depending on the bowler's style or the lane conditions. For example, a smoother texture could be used for oily lanes, while a rougher texture might be better for dry lanes. This feature would allow bowlers to adapt quickly to varying conditions without needing multiple balls.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting for Visual Feedback**: Incorporate LED lights into the bowling ball that change color based on the ball's speed, spin, or impact with the pins. This visual feedback could enhance the bowling experience, making it more engaging and exciting for players and spectators alike. It could also serve as a tool for bowlers to better understand their performance in real-time.",
    "**Personalized Grip Technology**: Create a bowling ball that allows bowlers to mold the grip to their hand shape using a heat-sensitive material. As the bowler holds the ball, the material would conform to their grip, providing a customized fit that enhances comfort and control. This innovation would help prevent slippage and improve accuracy."
