This would cater to different spaces, from small apartments to larger homes, making it versatile and functional.",
    "**Coat Rack with Integrated Mirror and Storage**: Combine a coat rack with a full-length mirror and hidden storage compartments.

    "**Coat Rack with Built-in Weather Station**: Innovate a coat rack that includes a small weather station that displays current temperature, humidity, and forecasts.
