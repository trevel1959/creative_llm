    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Create a line of solar-powered lanterns that can be placed around the home or community to provide ample light during the day. These lanterns could be designed to be visually appealing and come in different shapes, sizes, and colors to suit various tastes. They would be powered by solar panels installed on rooftops or in designated areas, ensuring a sustainable and renewable source of energy.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Develop a unique lighting system that utilizes mirrors to reflect sunlight into dark areas. This could involve creating mirrored panels that can be hung on walls or ceilings, or even mirrored lamps that can be placed on tables or shelves. By strategically placing these mirrors, individuals can harness the reflected light to illuminate their surroundings, providing an alternative to traditional light sources.",
    "Plant-Based Lighting: Create a lighting system that leverages the natural light-absorbing properties of plants. This could involve using specialized planters with built-in LED lights that mimic the photosynthesis process of plants. By placing these planters in areas where light is needed, individuals can harness the natural light-absorbing properties of the plants to provide illumination. This innovative solution would not only provide light but also help purify the air and create a natural, calming atmosphere.",
    "Foldable Solar Panels: Develop foldable solar panels that can be easily carried and deployed in different areas. These panels could be made of lightweight, flexible materials that can be easily stored and transported, making them ideal for camping trips, outdoor events, or even emergency situations. By unfolding the panels and connecting them to a battery pack, individuals can generate electricity and light even in areas without access to traditional power sources.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Create a cloud-based lighting system that utilizes drones or balloons equipped with LED lights to provide illumination in areas without access to traditional power sources. These drones or balloons could be launched from a central location or deployed from a mobile platform, such as a truck or boat. By strategically positioning these light sources in the sky, individuals can provide light to areas that would"
