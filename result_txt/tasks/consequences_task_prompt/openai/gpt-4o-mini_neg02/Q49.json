People would gather to share experiences and create new narratives, leading to a rich oral tradition that emphasizes imagination and creativity. This could help individuals forge connections and establish a sense of identity within their communities, even in the absence of personal history. Storytelling could evolve into a new form of education, allowing people to learn about the world through shared experiences rather than historical facts.",
