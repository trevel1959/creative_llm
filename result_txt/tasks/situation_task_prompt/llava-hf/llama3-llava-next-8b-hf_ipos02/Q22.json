    "Bicycle-friendly infrastructure: Encouraging cycling as a primary mode of transportation would require the installation of dedicated bike lanes, secure bike parking facilities, and the promotion of bicycle-friendly policies, such as bike-sharing programs. This would help reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by reducing the reliance on motor vehicles.",
    "Public transportation improvements: Expanding and enhancing public transportation options, such as buses, trams, and trains, would be crucial for moving around the town or city. This would require investments in infrastructure, including the construction of new lines, stations, and terminals, as well as efforts to improve the frequency and capacity of existing services.",
    "Water-based transportation: If the town or city is located near a river or coastline, water-based transportation options, such as ferries, water taxis, or gondolas, could be developed to facilitate movement between different parts of the city. This would require investments in infrastructure, including the construction of piers, docks, and terminals, as well as efforts to improve water safety and navigation.",
    "Community-driven transportation: Encouraging residents to take an active role in transportation by forming carpooling groups, organizing neighborhood walks or bike rides, and promoting local transit initiatives would help reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall quality of life in the town or city.",
    "Electric vehicle charging infrastructure: If motor vehicles were still allowed, investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure would be essential to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and minimize air pollution. This would require the installation of charging stations in public spaces, such as parking lots and near residential areas, as well as efforts to promote the adoption of electric vehicles among residents."
