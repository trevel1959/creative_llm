    "**Modular Pencil System**: Create a modular pencil that allows users to customize the pencil's length, grip, and lead type. Users could purchase different components, such as ergonomic grips, varying lead hardness (2B, HB, etc.), and extensions for lengthening the pencil. This system would cater to individual preferences, making writing more comfortable and personalized.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Pencil**: Design a pencil made from biodegradable materials with a refillable lead cartridge. Instead of throwing away a pencil when it becomes too short, users could simply replace the lead and continue using the same pencil body. This would significantly reduce waste and promote sustainability, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Function Pencil**: Introduce a pencil that combines multiple writing tools in one. For example, one end could have a traditional graphite lead, while the other end features colored leads or even a fine-tip pen. Additionally, it could include a built-in eraser and a sharpener in the body, making it a versatile tool for artists and students alike.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Sensor Technology**: Create a pencil equipped with pressure sensors that can detect how hard a user is pressing down. This information could be sent to a connected app that provides feedback on writing technique, helping users improve their handwriting or drawing skills. The app could also track progress over time, offering personalized tips and exercises.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Color-Changing Pencil**: Develop a pencil that changes color based on the user's mood or temperature. This could be achieved using thermochromic or photochromic materials. For instance, the pencil could turn blue when the user is calm and red when they are stressed. This feature could serve as a fun and engaging way for users to express their emotions through their writing tools."
