Award medals or stickers for participation and create a fun atmosphere with music and cheering.",

You can also have a \"gallery walk\" where kids can display their artwork and explain their creations.",
    "**Pirate's Pirate Ship**: Transform your backyard or living room into a pirate's pirate ship. Create a \"walk the plank\" activity, where kids can walk on a balance beam or a line on the floor.
