    "**Adjustable Bristle Density**:    A paintbrush that allows users to adjust the density and stiffness of the bristles with a simple twist or click mechanism. This feature would enable artists to customize their brush strokes according to their technique, whether they need a fine tip for detail work or a broader stroke for filling large areas. It would combine the versatility of multiple brushes into one.",
    "**Integrated Water Reservoir**:    A paintbrush that incorporates a small, refillable water reservoir within the handle. This would allow artists to have a continuous water supply for watercolor painting or to keep acrylics moist while working. A small valve could control the flow of water to the bristles, ensuring that the paint remains workable without the need for constant trips to a water container.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Pressure Sensors**:    Design a paintbrush with an ergonomic grip that fits comfortably in the hand, reducing fatigue during long painting sessions. Additionally, incorporating pressure sensors could help artists monitor their stroke intensity. This data could be relayed to an app that tracks their technique over time, helping them improve their skills by analyzing how pressure affects their brushwork.",
    "**Multi-Function Brush Head**:    A paintbrush that features interchangeable heads for different painting techniques. One head could be a traditional bristle brush, while others could be sponges, palette knives, or even airbrush attachments. This would allow artists to switch between techniques without needing multiple tools, making it a versatile option for mixed media artists.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    A paintbrush designed with self-cleaning technology that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge paint from the bristles after use. Artists could simply place the brush in a special cleaning chamber, and the device would gently vibrate to remove paint residue, making cleanup quick and easy. This feature would extend the life of the brush and maintain its performance over time."
