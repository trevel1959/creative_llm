    "**Thermal Insulation Upgrade:** You could enhance the thermal insulation of your home. This involves improving the insulation in your walls, attic, and basement. This can be done by adding more insulation material or by sealing any gaps or cracks in the building envelope. With better insulation, heat from the sun during summer and warmth from your body during winter will be retained within your house, thus reducing the need for AC or heaters.",
    "**Water-Basin Cooling System:** Set up a water basin in a well-ventilated area of your home. The basin should be filled with cold water (from a cooler or refrigerator). The evaporation of water from the surface cools down the surrounding air due to the process of cooling by evaporation. This system works similarly to a swamp cooler but without the need for mechanical fans.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces:** Place reflective surfaces like aluminum foil on the inside of windows facing direct sunlight. This will reflect the sunlight away from your home, keeping it cooler inside. Additionally, you can use light-colored or reflective paint on the exterior of your home to reflect the sun's rays back into the atmosphere.",
    "**Planting Trees and Vegetation:** Plant trees and other vegetation around your home. Trees provide shade, which helps reduce the amount of heat absorbed by your home. The leaves of plants also help cool the air through transpiration, a process similar to evaporation that cools the environment around them.",
    "**Nighttime Ventilation:** Take advantage of the cooler temperatures at night by opening windows and doors to allow cool air to enter your home. In the morning, close these openings to trap the cool air inside until the sun heats up your home during the day. Use fans to circulate the air throughout the house. At night, open the windows again to allow hot air to escape and replace it with fresh, cool air."
