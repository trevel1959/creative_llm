    "Develop a method of purifying water through the use of solar energy. This could involve creating a solar-powered water filtration system that uses UV light to kill bacteria and viruses, and a heat source to boil away contaminants.",
    "Utilize a hydrogen fuel cell to purify water. This would involve using electricity to power a fuel cell that produces hydrogen gas, which can then be used to purify water through a process called electrolysis.",
    "Develop a system for extracting clean water from the air. This could involve using a machine that uses condensation to collect water vapor from the air, which can then be purified and used for drinking.",
    "Create a system for harvesting rainwater. This could involve building a large collection tank that can capture rainwater from a roof or other surface, and then using a filtration system to remove impurities and make the water safe to drink.",
    "Develop a method of purifying water through the use of plants. This could involve growing certain types of plants that are known to absorb and purify water, such as water lilies or lotus plants, and then harvesting the purified water from the plant's roots or leaves."
