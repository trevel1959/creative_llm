    "**Customizable Seating System**: A wheelchair with a modular seating system would be a game-changer. Users could customize their seating based on their needs and preferences. For example, the seat cushion could be replaced with one that provides extra support for the lower back or hips, while the backrest could adjust to different angles for better posture. This customization allows users to tailor the wheelchair to their specific requirements.",
    "**Incorporating Fitness Features**: To encourage physical activity, a wheelchair could be equipped with fitness tracking capabilities. Sensors built into the frame could monitor the user's movements, calculate distance traveled, calories burned, and even provide real-time feedback on their posture and balance. This not only makes the wheelchair more functional but also promotes health and well-being.",
    "**Smart Wheelchair with Augmented Reality Guidance**: By incorporating AR technology, the wheelchair could provide enhanced guidance and navigation. An integrated display or headset could overlay maps, directions, and even potential obstacles in the user's path, making it easier to navigate unfamiliar spaces. This feature could significantly boost independence and confidence for wheelchair users.",
    "**Ergonomic Control System**: A wheelchair with an ergonomic control system that adapts to the userâ€™s movements and preferences could greatly improve comfort and usability. The controls might be pressure-sensitive, requiring less effort to operate, or they could be customizable for different hand sizes and strengths. This could also include intuitive touchscreens or gesture controls for easier access.",
    "**Environmental Sensing and Adaptive Features**: A wheelchair could be designed with environmental sensing capabilities, adjusting its performance based on the surroundings. For instance, it could automatically slow down when detecting uneven terrain or slippery surfaces, ensuring safety. Additionally, it could have features like adjustable suspension to provide a smoother ride over various terrains."
