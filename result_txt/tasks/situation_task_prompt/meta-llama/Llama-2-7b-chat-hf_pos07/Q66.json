    "Bio-based Building Blocks: Develop a new type of building block made from renewable biomass sources like bamboo, corn starch, or sugarcane. These blocks would be biodegradable, compostable, and have a lower carbon footprint than traditional building materials. Using a 3D printing process, create intricate designs and structures that are both strong and lightweight.",
    "Smart, Self-Healing Concrete: Create a special type of concrete that can detect and repair cracks and damage on its own. This smart concrete would use advanced materials science and nanotechnology to create a self-healing mechanism. By incorporating tiny capsules filled with healing agents, the concrete would be able to repair itself without the need for manual intervention.",
    "Air-Swelling Structures: Design buildings that use air pressure to create structure and support. By using inflatable membranes made from flexible materials like rubber or plastic, buildings could be created that are lightweight, energy-efficient, and require less material than traditional construction methods. These air-swelling structures could be used for everything from homes to office buildings to public spaces.",
    "Living, Breathing Walls: Develop walls that are capable of photosynthesis, using a special type of biotechnology that combines living plants with advanced materials science. These living walls would be able to purify the air, produce oxygen, and even absorb carbon dioxide. By incorporating sensors and automation, the walls could also adjust their own composition and structure based on the environment around them.",
    "Shape-Shifting Buildings: Create buildings that can change their shape and form in response to external conditions. Using advanced materials like shape-memory alloys and smart materials, buildings could be designed to adapt to different weather patterns, climate conditions, or even the needs of their occupants. For example, a building could change its shape to optimize energy efficiency or provide better shelter from extreme weather events."
