    "**Herbal Remedies**: In a world without medicines, I would rely on the ancient wisdom of herbal remedies to treat a common cold. I would gather a selection of medicinal plants like eucalyptus, ginger, and echinacea, and create teas, infusions, and poultices to help alleviate symptoms. The antimicrobial properties of eucalyptus, for example, would help combat the virus, while ginger's anti-inflammatory properties would soothe a sore throat. Echinacea's immunomodulatory effects would help boost the body's natural defenses.",
    "**Honey and Lemon**: A classic combination, honey and lemon would be my go-to remedy for a common cold. The antimicrobial properties of honey would help combat the virus, while the acidity of lemon would help loosen mucus and reduce congestion. I would mix equal parts of honey and lemon juice in warm water to create a soothing drink that would help ease symptoms.",
    "**Steam Inhalation**: Steam inhalation would be an effective way to loosen mucus and reduce congestion. I would boil water, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil, and inhale the steam through a towel to help ease a stuffy nose and chest. This would also help reduce the severity of coughing fits.",
    "**Rest and Hydration**: Sometimes, the best medicine is simply rest and hydration. I would prioritize getting plenty of sleep, staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding strenuous activities to help my body recover from the cold. This would allow my immune system to fight off the virus more effectively.",
    "**Saltwater Gargle**: A saltwater gargle would be an effective way to soothe a sore throat and reduce inflammation. I would mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and gargle several times a day to help reduce swelling and ease discomfort. This would also help loosen mucus and reduce congestion."
