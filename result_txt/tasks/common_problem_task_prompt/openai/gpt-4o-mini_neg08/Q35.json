    "**Visitor Safety**: Ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount. Problems can arise from inadequate barriers, improper signage, or lack of staff training on emergency procedures. An incident involving a visitor getting too close to an animal or an animal escaping could result in serious injuries, legal liabilities, and a loss of public trust.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Zoos often face financial challenges due to high operational costs, including animal care, facility maintenance, and staff salaries. If revenue from ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships does not cover these costs, the zoo may struggle to maintain its operations, leading to cutbacks in care, staff layoffs, or even closure.",
    "**Conservation Efforts**: While many zoos promote conservation, they can face challenges in effectively contributing to species preservation. Problems can arise from a lack of collaboration with conservation organizations, insufficient funding for breeding programs, or failure to educate the public about the importance of wildlife conservation. If a zoo is perceived as merely a place for entertainment rather than a conservation partner, it could face backlash from the community.",
    "**Staff Turnover and Training**: High turnover rates among staff can lead to inconsistent care for animals and a lack of institutional knowledge. Problems may arise from inadequate training, low morale, or burnout among employees, which can impact the quality of care provided to the animals and the overall visitor experience.",
    "**Public Perception and Ethical Concerns**: Zoos often grapple with public perception, especially regarding ethical concerns about keeping animals in captivity. Problems can arise from negative media coverage, social media backlash, or protests from animal rights activists. A zoo must navigate these concerns by transparently communicating its mission, conservation efforts, and the benefits of educational experiences."
