    "**Underwater Exploration Vessels**: With the absence of planes, humans would need to rely on alternative modes of transportation. One possibility is to develop advanced underwater exploration vessels that can traverse the oceans. These vessels would be designed to withstand the immense pressure of the deep sea and would be equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, propulsion technology, and communication equipment. They could travel through the ocean floor, allowing people to reach distant continents by submerging themselves in the underwater world. This mode of transportation would not only provide a unique experience but also enable humans to explore the ocean's depths and discover new species.",
    "**Space-Based Transportation**: Another option would be to utilize space-based transportation systems. This could involve launching spacecraft that can travel through space, providing a more efficient and faster way to reach distant continents. These spacecraft could be equipped with advanced life support systems, propulsion technology, and communication equipment, allowing humans to survive the harsh conditions of space travel. By establishing a network of space-based transportation systems, humans could travel to any continent in a relatively short period of time.",
    "**Advanced Submarines**: With the absence of planes, advanced submarines could become the primary mode of transportation for crossing oceans. These submarines would be designed to be faster, more efficient, and more comfortable than traditional submarines. They would be equipped with advanced life support systems, propulsion technology, and communication equipment, allowing humans to travel long distances underwater. By developing advanced submarines, humans could travel to distant continents without the need for planes.",
    "**Maglev Trains with Underwater Tunnels**: Another option would be to develop Maglev trains that can travel through underwater tunnels. These trains would be designed to operate at high speeds, using magnetic levitation technology to propel them through the tunnels. The underwater tunnels would be constructed using advanced materials and engineering techniques, allowing the trains to travel safely and efficiently through the ocean. This mode of transportation would provide a fast and comfortable way to travel to distant continents.",
    "**Advanced Hydrofoils**: With the absence of planes, advanced hydrofoils could become a popular mode of transportation for crossing oceans. Hydrofoils are boats that use wings to lift the hull out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. Advanced hydrofoils would be designed to be faster, more efficient, and more comfortable than traditional hydrofoils. They would be equipped with advanced life support systems, propulsion technology, and communication equipment, allowing humans to travel long distances across the ocean. By developing advanced hydro"
