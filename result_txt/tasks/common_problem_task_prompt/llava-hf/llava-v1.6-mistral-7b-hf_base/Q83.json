    "Communication issues: Communication with the surface is crucial for any deep sea mission. The ocean's depth and distance from the surface can create significant communication challenges, including the risk of signal loss, equipment failure, or interference from underwater noise.",
    "Navigation difficulties: Navigating the ocean floor is difficult, even with modern technology. The lack of visual cues, such as landmarks or stars, can make it challenging to determine the exact location of the crew and their equipment.",
    "Limited resources: The deep sea environment is remote and inhospitable, which means that resources such as oxygen, food, and water are limited. The crew must plan carefully to ensure they have enough resources to survive the mission.",
    "Psychological challenges: The isolation and confinement of a deep sea mission can lead to psychological challenges for the crew. The lack of social interaction and limited sensory stimulation can cause stress, anxiety, and depression.",
    "Environmental hazards: The deep sea environment is home to a variety of hazards, including underwater volcanoes, landslides, and methane hydrates. These hazards can pose a significant threat to the crew and their equipment."
