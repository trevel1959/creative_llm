    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or a combination of steam and vinegar to clean the interior of the kettle. Users could activate this function with a simple button press, ensuring that mineral buildup and residue from previous uses are eliminated, thereby prolonging the kettle's lifespan and maintaining the purity of the water.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Insulation**: Develop a kettle with advanced eco-friendly insulation materials that retain heat longer, reducing energy consumption. This could be achieved using vacuum insulation technology or sustainable materials that provide excellent thermal resistance. The kettle could also have an energy-saving mode that automatically switches off after a certain period of inactivity.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Design a multi-functional lid that not only seals the kettle for boiling but also doubles as a measuring cup or a strainer. This would allow users to measure out ingredients directly while they boil water, making it easier to prepare recipes that require precise water measurements or infused beverages without needing additional tools.",
    "**Color-Changing Indicator**: Incorporate a color-changing LED light on the kettle that visually indicates the water temperature. For example, blue could represent cold water, green for warm, and red for boiling. This feature would not only be visually appealing but also provide a quick reference for users who want to avoid opening the lid to check the temperature.",
    "**Built-In Infuser Basket**: Create an electric kettle with a detachable infuser basket that allows users to steep loose leaf tea or herbs directly in the kettle. The basket could have adjustable steeping times and a timer function, ensuring that users can brew their beverages to their preferred strength without the hassle of transferring them to another vessel."
