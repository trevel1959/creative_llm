    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that utilizes high-heat technology similar to self-cleaning ovens but enhances it with a steam cleaning option. This would allow users to simply fill a water reservoir, and the oven would generate steam to loosen food particles and grease, which could then be easily wiped away, making maintenance hassle-free.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cooking Zones**: Create an oven with customizable cooking zones that can be set to different cooking methods simultaneously (e.g., baking, broiling, steaming). Each zone would have its own temperature and timer settings, allowing users to prepare multiple dishes with varying requirements at once, maximizing efficiency and versatility in meal preparation.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cooking Guide**: Introduce an augmented reality (AR) feature that overlays cooking instructions directly onto the ovenâ€™s glass door or a paired smart device. Users could see step-by-step guides, timing notifications, and even recipe suggestions based on the ingredients they have at home, making cooking more interactive and user-friendly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Mode**: Implement an eco-friendly mode that optimizes energy consumption during cooking. This mode would use sensors to detect when the oven is not in use and adjust power settings accordingly. It could also include a solar panel option for energy-efficient homes, allowing the oven to harness renewable energy sources.",
    "**Built-In Food Scanner**: Equip the oven with a built-in food scanner that uses infrared technology to analyze the type and size of food placed inside. This scanner would automatically suggest optimal cooking settings and times based on the analysis, making it easier for users to achieve perfect results without needing to guess or look up cooking times."
