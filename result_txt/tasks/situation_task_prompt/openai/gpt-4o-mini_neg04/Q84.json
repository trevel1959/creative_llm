    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: Create a lightweight, wearable exoskeleton that assists individuals with mobility challenges. This suit would be equipped with sensors that detect the user's movements and intentions, allowing them to walk or stand with support. The exoskeleton could be powered by rechargeable batteries and designed for ease of use, enabling users to engage in activities such as walking in parks or participating in social events. The suit could also have customizable settings for different levels of assistance, catering to the userâ€™s specific needs.",
    "**Personal Mobility Drone**: Imagine a personal mobility drone that can lift and transport individuals short distances. This drone would have a secure harness for the user and would be equipped with advanced stabilization technology to ensure a smooth ride. Users could simply input their destination via a mobile app, and the drone would autonomously navigate to the specified location. This mode of transportation would be particularly useful in urban environments, allowing users to bypass traffic and access hard-to-reach areas.",
    "**Smart Floor Tiles**: Develop a system of smart floor tiles that can detect user presence and facilitate movement. These tiles could be embedded with sensors that recognize when someone is trying to move and could activate a conveyor belt system that gently transports them to their desired location. The tiles could be programmed to work in homes, offices, or public spaces, providing an innovative way for individuals with mobility issues to navigate their surroundings without requiring manual effort.",
    "**Rolling Platform with Robotic Arms**: Design a rolling platform that features robotic arms to assist with tasks and mobility. This platform could be controlled via voice commands or a mobile app, allowing users to direct it to move to different locations. The robotic arms could help with picking up objects, opening doors, or even adjusting the height of the platform to reach different surfaces. This multifunctional device would empower users to maintain independence while navigating their environments effectively.",
    "**Personal Mobility Pods**: Create compact, personal mobility pods that are electric and can be summoned via a smartphone app. These pods would be designed for one person and would feature a comfortable seating area with safety harnesses. They could drive autonomously, allowing users to relax and enjoy the ride while being transported to their destination. The pods could be equipped with charging stations for devices, climate control, and even entertainment options, enhancing the user experience during travel."
