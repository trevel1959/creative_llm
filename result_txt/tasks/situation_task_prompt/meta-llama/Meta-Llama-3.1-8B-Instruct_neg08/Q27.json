    "**Personalized Thermal Curtains**: Develop a system where thermal curtains can be programmed to adjust their opacity and material to optimize indoor temperature based on external weather conditions, time of day, and desired temperature settings. These smart curtains would be made of phase-change materials that absorb or release heat as needed, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment.",
    "**Biometric Temperature Regulation**: Design a wearable device that monitors an individual's biometric responses to temperature changes, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and sweat rate. This data would be used to create a personalized temperature control system, adjusting the indoor temperature to maintain an optimal comfort zone for each individual.",
    "**3D-Printed Ventilation System**: Create a 3D-printed ventilation system that can be customized to fit any space. This system would use advanced materials and algorithms to optimize airflow, humidity, and temperature control, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment while minimizing energy consumption.",
    "**Indoor Temperature Forecasting**: Develop an AI-powered system that predicts indoor temperature fluctuations based on external weather forecasts, building insulation, and occupant behavior. This system would provide personalized temperature recommendations and automate temperature adjustments to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Design a system that harnesses thermal energy from various sources, such as solar radiation, geothermal energy, or waste heat, to power a thermoelectric cooling system. This system would generate electricity while providing a sustainable and efficient cooling solution for indoor spaces. [/INST] [/INST] "
