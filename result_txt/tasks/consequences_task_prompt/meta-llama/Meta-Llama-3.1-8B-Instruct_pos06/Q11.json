    "**Tidal Chaos**: With two moons, the tidal patterns on Earth would become increasingly complex, leading to unpredictable and extreme tidal fluctuations. This would cause widespread coastal erosion, flooding, and disruption to marine ecosystems. Coastal cities and low-lying areas would be at risk of being inundated, displacing millions of people. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Increased Earthquakes**: The gravitational pull of the second moon would cause the Earth's crust to shift and adjust, leading to an increase in earthquakes and seismic activity. This would make the planet more prone to natural disasters, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Altered Global Climate**: The presence of a second moon would disrupt the Earth's axial tilt, leading to changes in the planet's climate. This could result in extreme temperature fluctuations, making some areas uninhabitable and others more hospitable. The consequences would be far-reaching, affecting agriculture, ecosystems, and human settlements. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Disrupted Satellite Technology**: With two moons, the satellite technology used for communication, navigation, and weather forecasting would be severely impacted. The increased gravitational pull would cause satellites to malfunction or crash, leading to a significant disruption in global communication and navigation systems. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Astronomical Anomalies**: The presence of a second moon would create unusual astronomical phenomena, such as double eclipses, moonquakes, and unusual lunar phases. This would lead to a reevaluation of our understanding of celestial mechanics and the behavior of celestial bodies. (Confidence score: 0.88) [/INST] "
