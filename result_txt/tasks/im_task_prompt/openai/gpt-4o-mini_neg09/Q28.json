    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular helmet that allows users to customize and adapt it based on their needs. For example, riders could add or remove visors, face shields, or even a sunshade. This design could also include detachable padding that can be swapped out for different climatesâ€”thicker padding for winter rides and breathable padding for summer.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Innovate the internal structure of the helmet using advanced materials that enhance impact absorption. Incorporate layers of viscoelastic foam or air-filled bladders that can better distribute the force of an impact, thereby increasing safety. This technology could be marketed as a game-changer for serious cyclists and commuters alike.",
    "**Personalized Fit System**: Develop a helmet with an adjustable fit system that uses sensors to measure the rider's head shape and size. The helmet could then automatically adjust its internal padding and straps for a snug, comfortable fit. This feature would eliminate the need for multiple sizes and improve safety by ensuring that the helmet is always worn correctly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Shift the production of bicycle helmets to sustainable, biodegradable materials. This could involve using natural fibers or recycled plastics that reduce environmental impact. The helmet could also come with a take-back program where old helmets can be returned for recycling or repurposing, promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) visor into the helmet that displays essential information such as speed, distance traveled, and navigation prompts directly in the rider's line of sight. This visor could also highlight potential hazards or changes in traffic patterns, enhancing safety without the need for riders to look away from the road."
