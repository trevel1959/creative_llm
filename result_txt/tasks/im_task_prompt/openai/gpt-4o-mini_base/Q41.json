    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable parts, allowing users to easily swap out wheels, decks, and trucks. This would enable skaters to customize their ride based on their skill level, style, and terrain. For example, a softer wheel for cruising and a harder wheel for tricks could be easily interchanged, making it adaptable for different skateboarding experiences.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting System**: Design a skateboard with an integrated LED lighting system that lights up the deck and wheels. This would not only enhance visibility for night riding but also allow for customizable light patterns and colors, adding a fun aesthetic. Riders could sync the lights to music or set them to flash in various patterns, making night skating a vibrant experience.",
    "**Shock Absorbing Technology**: Develop a skateboard with advanced shock-absorbing technology built into the deck and trucks. This could be achieved using materials like rubberized composites or air-filled chambers that absorb impacts, providing a smoother ride on rough terrain. This innovation would be particularly beneficial for beginners or those with joint issues, making skateboarding more accessible.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard Materials**: Shift towards sustainable materials for skateboard production, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or bio-composites. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of skateboarding but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, creating a recycling program for old skateboards could encourage users to dispose of their boards responsibly.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Skateboarding App**: Develop an AR app that allows skaters to visualize and practice tricks in a virtual environment before attempting them in real life. The app could provide feedback on posture and technique, helping users to improve their skills. It could also include a social aspect where skaters can challenge each other to tricks or collaborate on new moves."
