    "Use a tunneling machine: Create a tunneling machine that can burrow into the ground, creating a tunnel for planting. This machine could be powered by electricity or human energy, and could be designed to dig at different angles and depths depending on the soil conditions.",
    "Grow vertically: Instead of digging into the ground, consider growing plants vertically using a system of trellises, towers, or walls. This approach would allow you to maximize the space available for planting while minimizing the need for digging.",
    "Use a hydroponic system: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water rather than soil. By using a hydroponic system, you can plant your garden without needing to dig into the ground. This system can be set up indoors or outdoors and can be used to grow a wide variety of plants.",
    "Create a green roof: A green roof is a layer of soil and plants on top of a building, providing insulation and aesthetic appeal. By planting a garden on top of a building, you can avoid digging into the ground altogether. This approach can also help to reduce stormwater runoff and provide habitat for local wildlife.",
    "Use a geodesic dome: A geodesic dome is a structure made up of interconnected triangles that can be used to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. By planting a garden inside a geodesic dome, you can create a protected environment that is optimized for growth, with minimal impact on the surrounding soil and ecosystem. The dome can be made from a variety of materials, including recycled plastic, and can be set up in a variety of locations, including indoors and outdoors."
