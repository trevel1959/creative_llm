    "A new era of mental wellness: If we found a cure for all mental illnesses, it would usher in a new era of mental wellness. People would no longer suffer from conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. They would be able to live their lives without the burden of mental illness, and this would lead to a happier, healthier society.",
    "A shift in society's perception of mental illness: The discovery of a cure for all mental illnesses would shift society's perception of mental illness. People would no longer see mental illness as a weakness or a burden, but rather as a medical condition that could be treated and cured. This would lead to greater acceptance and understanding of mental illness, and more people would seek help if they were struggling.",
    "The rise of preventative mental health care: With a cure for all mental illnesses, people would be more likely to prioritize preventative mental health care. This could include things like therapy, meditation, and other mental health practices. As a result, we would see a decrease in the incidence of mental illness, and a greater emphasis on mental health overall.",
    "The impact on the economy: The discovery of a cure for all mental illnesses would have a significant impact on the economy. With fewer people suffering from mental illness, there would be fewer sick days and fewer people receiving disability benefits. This would lead to increased productivity and a stronger economy.",
    "The importance of continued research: While a cure for all mental illnesses would be a major breakthrough, it would not be the end of mental health research. There would still be a need to study the brain and the mind, and to develop new treatments and therapies for mental health conditions. This research would continue to advance our understanding of the human mind and lead to even more breakthroughs in the future."
