    "In a vibrant savanna, a zebra named Zuri was born with a coat of rainbow stripes. While the other zebras teased her, Zuri embraced her uniqueness, exploring the world with joy. One day, a drought threatened the land, and the animals struggled to find water. Zuri, using her colorful stripes, attracted a flock of birds who guided her to a hidden oasis. The animals, amazed by her bravery, followed her to safety. From that day on, Zuri became a symbol of hope, teaching everyone that differences can unite and save lives. The savanna thrived, painted in the hues of acceptance.",
