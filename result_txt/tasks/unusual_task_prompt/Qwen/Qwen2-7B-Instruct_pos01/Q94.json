    "**3D Animation in Virtual Reality**: Develop an interactive VR experience where users can control and manipulate 3D models created in Blender within a virtual environment. This could involve a gamified learning system for beginners to understand 3D modeling principles or an immersive storytelling platform for professional animators. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9), as it combines existing technologies like VR and Blender in a novel way that could attract both hobbyists and professionals.",
    "**Blender-based Augmented Reality Art Gallery**: Create an AR app that allows artists to visualize their digital creations in real-world spaces using Blender's output. Users could scan physical spaces, and the app would overlay their 3D models onto these locations, allowing for real-time editing and viewing from various angles. This idea has moderate confidence (0.7) because it requires significant development in AR technology integration but could provide unique experiences for artists and consumers alike.",
    "**Blender for Sustainable Design**: Build a plugin for Blender that incorporates sustainability metrics into the design process, such as energy consumption, material usage, and waste reduction. Architects and designers could use this tool to create more eco-friendly buildings and products, integrating sustainability into every step of the design process. The confidence score for this idea is medium (0.6) since it requires collaboration with environmental science experts and might face regulatory compliance issues.",
    "**Blender AI Integration for Content Creation**: Integrate AI algorithms into Blender to automate certain tasks in content creation, such as generating textures, adding realistic lighting, or suggesting model poses based on user inputs. This could significantly speed up the production process and allow for more complex scenes and models to be created with less human intervention. The confidence score for this idea is low (0.4) because it involves complex AI development and might not always produce the desired level of creativity or realism.",
    "**Blender-based Educational VR/AR Modules**: Develop a series of interactive modules that teach various aspects of 3D modeling, animation, and other related skills through VR or AR experiences. These modules could be designed for schools, vocational training programs, or online platforms, providing a hands-on approach to learning Blender and other 3D tools. The confidence score for this idea is moderate (0.7) due to the educational market being well-established but requiring significant investment in content development and pedagogical expertise."
