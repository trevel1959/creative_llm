    "Use water and elbow grease: In the absence of soap, one could use water and physical effort to clean surfaces. For example, wiping down surfaces with a damp cloth or sponge can help remove dirt and grime. For stubborn stains, using a scrubbing brush or cloth can help remove them. Additionally, using a toothbrush to scrub hard-to-reach areas can be effective.",
    "Utilize reusable cleaning tools: Investing in reusable cleaning tools like cloths, sponges, and brushes can help maintain cleanliness without the need for disposable cleaning products. These tools can be washed and reused, reducing waste and the need for new products.",
    "Implement a cleaning schedule: Establishing a regular cleaning schedule can help maintain hygiene even without soap and cleaning products. For example, wiping down surfaces daily, vacuuming carpets weekly, and deep cleaning once a month can help keep the environment clean and hygienic.",
    "Practice good hygiene habits: Even without soap and cleaning products, maintaining good hygiene habits can help prevent the spread of germs and bacteria. Washing hands frequently, using hand sanitizer, and avoiding touching one's face can help reduce the risk of contamination.",
    "Utilize UV light technology: Using UV light technology to sanitize surfaces can be an effective alternative to soap and cleaning products. UV light can kill germs and bacteria, making it a viable option for maintaining cleanliness in the absence of soap."
