    "**Imaginative Storytelling**: Children would use their surroundings as a canvas for creative storytelling. They would use natural objects like leaves, sticks, and rocks to create characters and settings. They would take turns narrating stories, using their imagination to bring the environment to life. For example, a child might use a fallen log as a castle, a nearby stream as a moat, and a bird's nest as a dragon's lair. This would foster their creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to think outside the box.",
    "**Physical Play**: Without toys, children would focus on physical play using their bodies as the primary source of entertainment. They would engage in games like tag, hide-and-seek, and chase, which promote physical activity, coordination, and social interaction. They might also use natural objects like balls made from rolled-up leaves or sticks to play catch or roll-and-catch games. This would help them develop their gross motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and teamwork.",
    "**Music and Dance**: Children would use their voices, bodies, and natural objects to create music and dance. They might use rocks to create a drum set, sticks to create a makeshift marimba, or even use their feet to create a rhythmic beat on the ground. They would also use their imagination to create dance routines, incorporating movements inspired by animals, like jumping like a rabbit or flapping like a bird. This would foster their creativity, self-expression, and ability to appreciate music and movement.",
    "**Nature Exploration**: Without toys, children would focus on exploring and learning about their natural surroundings. They would go on scavenger hunts to discover new plants, animals, and insects. They might collect leaves, rocks, or sticks to create a nature-inspired collage or mobile. This would promote their curiosity, scientific thinking, and appreciation for the natural world.",
    "**Role-Playing**: Children would use their imagination to create scenarios and characters, using their surroundings as a backdrop. They might create a pretend store using a cardboard box or a pretend restaurant using a makeshift table. They would take turns acting out roles, using their creativity to develop characters, plotlines, and settings. This would foster their social skills, empathy, and ability to think creatively.
