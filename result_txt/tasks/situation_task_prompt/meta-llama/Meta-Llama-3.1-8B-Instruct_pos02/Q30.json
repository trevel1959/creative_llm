    "**Urban Algae Farms**: In the absence of fruits and vegetables, urban algae farms could become a vital source of essential vitamins and minerals. These farms would cultivate various species of algae, which are rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as minerals like iron and calcium. The algae would be grown in controlled environments, such as vertical farms or bioreactors, and harvested for human consumption. Algae-based supplements could also be developed to provide a concentrated source of nutrients.",
    "**Insect-Based Nutrition**: Insects, such as crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers, are already being considered as a sustainable protein source. In the event of a fruit and vegetable shortage, insect-based nutrition could become a vital component of our diet. Insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and calcium, and can be farmed on a large scale using efficient and environmentally friendly methods. Insect-based foods, such as insect flour or insect-based protein powders, could be developed to provide essential vitamins and minerals.",
    "**Seaweed-Based Supplements**: Seaweed is a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including iodine, iron, and zinc. In the absence of fruits and vegetables, seaweed-based supplements could become a vital component of our diet. These supplements could be developed in the form of capsules, tablets, or powders, and could be tailored to meet specific nutritional needs. Seaweed-based foods, such as seaweed snacks or seaweed-based energy bars, could also be developed to provide a convenient and tasty source of essential nutrients.",
    "**Mushroom-Based Nutrition**: Mushrooms are a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, copper, and selenium. In the event of a fruit and vegetable shortage, mushroom-based nutrition could become a vital component of our diet. Mushrooms could be cultivated on a large scale using efficient and environmentally friendly methods, and could be developed into a variety of products, including mushroom-based supplements, mushroom-based protein powders, and mushroom-based foods.",
    "**Lab-Grown Foods**: In the absence of fruits and vegetables, lab-grown foods could become a vital component of our diet. Lab-grown foods, such as lab-grown meat, lab-grown dairy products, and lab-grown plant-based foods, could be developed to provide essential vitamins and minerals. These foods could be grown using cellular agriculture, a process that involves growing cells in a controlled environment, and could be tailored to meet specific nutritional needs."
