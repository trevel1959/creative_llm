    "**Create a Personal Solar System**: Design a portable, wearable solar panel system that harnesses the energy of artificial lights or street lamps during the night, storing it in rechargeable batteries. This system could be worn on the arms, legs, or back to ensure you have enough light for daily activities.",
    "**Develop a Light-Reflecting Material**: Invent a new material that reflects light efficiently from existing sources (like streetlights, headlights, or other light fixtures) during the night. This could be incorporated into clothing or accessories to enhance visibility and safety during low-light conditions.",
    "**Innovate with Microbial Bioluminescence**: Cultivate a strain of microorganisms that emit light and are non-toxic to humans. These organisms could be applied to surfaces like walls, floors, or clothing to provide ambient lighting in the absence of sunlight.",
    "**Design a Smart Reflective Clothing System**: Create a reflective garment that uses sensors and algorithms to optimize light reflection based on the intensity and direction of available light sources. The system could adjust the level of reflectivity depending on the environment, ensuring maximum visibility while conserving the energy used.",
    "**Invent an AI-Controlled Sky Mirror**: Develop a large-scale, AI-driven mirror that reflects artificial light onto the ground during periods when natural sunlight is unavailable. The mirror could be placed in strategic locations such as urban centers, parks, or even rooftops, enhancing the overall lighting in affected areas. The AI would adjust the mirror's orientation and size based on the amount and quality of available light, ensuring efficient use of energy and optimal illumination."
