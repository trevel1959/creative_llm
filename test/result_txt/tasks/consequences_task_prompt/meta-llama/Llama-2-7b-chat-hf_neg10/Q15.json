    "Renewable Energy Revolution: If the world were to suddenly run out of oil, it would lead to a complete overhaul of the global energy landscape. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal would become the primary sources of power. This shift would result in a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a decrease in global warming and climate change. Governments and corporations would invest heavily in renewable energy infrastructure, creating new industries and job opportunities.",
    "Transportation Evolution: With oil no longer available, transportation would need to adapt to new technologies. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles would become the norm, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and decreasing air pollution. Personal transportation modes like cycling, walking, and public transportation would also see a significant increase in popularity. This shift would promote a healthier lifestyle and reduce traffic congestion in urban areas.",
    "Sustainable Agriculture: The lack of oil would lead to a re-evaluation of agricultural practices. Sustainable farming methods such as permaculture, organic farming, and vertical farming would become more prevalent. These methods focus on maintaining soil health, conserving water, and promoting biodiversity. This shift would result in more nutritious and sustainable food production, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.",
    "Circular Economy: The depletion of oil would force a rethink of the linear economy, where resources are extracted, used, and disposed of. A circular economy focuses on reducing waste, reusing materials, and recycling. This shift would lead to the development of new technologies and business models that promote sustainable consumption and production. Companies would need to adopt more sustainable practices, such as designing products for longevity, reducing packaging, and using recycled materials.",
    "Redefining Leisure: With the loss of oil, leisure activities would need to adapt to new sources of energy. People would turn to more active and outdoor pursuits like hiking, kayaking, and cycling. Community-based activities like gardening, cooking, and crafting would also become more popular. This shift would promote a healthier"
