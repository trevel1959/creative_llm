    "**Coastal Exploration**: With mountains gone, coastal areas would become the new playgrounds. People could engage in beach sports like sand volleyball, kite surfing, and paddleboarding. Organizing eco-tours would allow exploration of marine life, with snorkeling and diving experiences to discover underwater ecosystems. Additionally, coastal hiking trails could be developed along cliffs and dunes, providing breathtaking views of the ocean and opportunities for beachcombing and tide pooling.",
    "**Desert Expeditions**: In the absence of mountains, deserts could be the new frontier for outdoor enthusiasts. Adventure companies could offer guided desert tours, including camel trekking, dune bashing in 4x4s, and stargazing in remote locations. Workshops on survival skills, desert photography, and sandboarding could also attract thrill-seekers. Festivals celebrating desert culture could feature music, art, and food, creating a vibrant community around these unique landscapes.",
    "**River Rafting and Kayaking**: Without mountains, rivers would likely become more prominent as they carve through the land. White-water rafting and kayaking could become mainstream activities, with rivers offering various difficulty levels for all skill sets. Communities could host river festivals featuring races, water sports competitions, and river clean-up days to promote environmental awareness. Additionally, riverside camping and picnicking could provide a tranquil escape for families and friends.",
    "**Flatland Farming Adventures**: With mountains gone, agriculture could flourish in the expansive flatlands. Outdoor activities could include agritourism experiences such as picking fruits and vegetables, participating in farm-to-table dinners, and learning about sustainable farming practices. Workshops on organic gardening and cooking classes could be offered, allowing participants to connect with their food sources while enjoying the beauty of open fields and farms.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Trails**: In a mountain-less world, the focus could shift to exploring cultural heritage. Communities could develop trails that celebrate local history, art, and architecture. Activities could include guided historical walks, art installations in public spaces, and storytelling events that bring local legends to life. These trails would provide opportunities for education and connection, fostering appreciation for the diverse cultures that thrive in flat terrains."
