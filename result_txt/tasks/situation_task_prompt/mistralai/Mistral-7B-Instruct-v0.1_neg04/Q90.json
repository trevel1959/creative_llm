    "Solar still: This is a simple device that uses the sun's heat to collect water from a surface. A solar still consists of a flat, reflective surface (such as a metal sheet) and a container to collect the water. The surface is heated by the sun, causing the water to evaporate and condense into a mist. The mist is then collected in the container.",
    "Water harvesting system: This is a more advanced method of collecting water that involves the use of a pump and filtration system. Water harvesting systems can be used to collect rainwater from a roof or other surface, and can also be used to collect water from rivers or other sources. The water is then filtered and stored in a container for use.",
    "Desert mirage: This is a natural method of collecting water that involves the use of a reflective surface to create a mirage. A mirage is an optical illusion that occurs when light is bent by the atmosphere, creating the appearance of water on the ground. By creating a mirage, a person can collect water from the ground without actually touching it.",
    "Water vapor harvesting: This is a method of collecting water that involves the use of a cooling system to condense water vapor in the air. Water vapor is present in the air, and can be collected by cooling the air and condensing the vapor. This can be done using a refrigerator or other cooling system.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: This is a method of collecting rainwater from a surface, such as a roof or other flat surface. Rainwater can be collected using a container or other device, and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as watering plants or flushing toilets."
