    "**Access to Subjects**: Gaining access to key subjects or interviewees is crucial for a documentary's success. Potential problems include unwilling participants, scheduling conflicts, or subjects who may retract their consent. Filmmakers can address this by building rapport with subjects beforehand, offering incentives for participation, and having backup subjects or alternative angles to pursue.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Documentarians often face ethical challenges regarding representation, consent, and the impact of their work on subjects. Misrepresenting a subject or their story can lead to backlash. To navigate this, filmmakers should prioritize transparency, ensure informed consent, and maintain an open dialogue with subjects about how their stories will be portrayed.",
    "**Technical Difficulties**: Issues such as equipment malfunction, poor audio quality, or inadequate lighting can hinder the production process. To prevent these problems, filmmakers should conduct thorough equipment checks before shoots, have backup gear on hand, and consider hiring experienced technicians to handle complex technical aspects.",
    "**Narrative Structure**: Crafting a compelling narrative is essential for engaging audiences. A common issue is the inability to find a cohesive story arc, leading to a disjointed film. Filmmakers can overcome this by outlining their story beforehand, seeking feedback from trusted peers, and being willing to adapt their vision based on the footage and interviews collected.",
    "**Post-Production Challenges**: The editing phase can reveal issues such as an overload of footage or a lack of clear direction for the final cut. This can result in a lengthy editing process or a film that feels unfocused. To address this, filmmakers should maintain organized files during production, develop a clear editing plan, and work closely with experienced editors who can help refine the narrative."
