    "**Smart Leash**: Develop a smart leash that tracks the dog's activity, providing real-time feedback on the owner's daily exercise goals. The leash would include a built-in accelerometer, GPS, and a mobile app that syncs with the owner's wearable device. The app would display the dog's exercise levels, such as distance walked, calories burned, and time spent exercising. The owner could set personalized goals and receive notifications when they've reached them.",
    "**Leash-based Augmented Reality Experience**: Create an immersive AR experience that brings the dog's surroundings to life. Using a leash-mounted camera and AR software, the dog's owner could point the camera at various objects, such as trees, flowers, or buildings, and the app would display fun facts, trivia, or educational content related to the object. This would make walks more engaging and interactive, fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity.",
    "**Social Leash**: Design a leash that connects dog owners with similar interests or hobbies. The leash would include a built-in social feature that allows owners to join groups based on their dog's breed, size, or activity level. Owners could then meet up with other dogs and owners for playdates, walks, or even dog-friendly events. This would help combat loneliness and create a sense of community among dog owners.",
    "**Leash-mounted Air Quality Monitor**: Develop a leash that includes a built-in air quality sensor, tracking the owner's exposure to pollutants and allergens during walks. The leash would display real-time air quality data on a small screen, providing owners with valuable insights into their environment. This would help owners make informed decisions about their daily walks and potentially improve their overall health.",
    "**Leash-based Music Experience**: Create a leash that doubles as a portable music player. Using a built-in speaker and Bluetooth connectivity, the leash would allow owners to stream their favorite music or podcasts while walking their dog. The leash would also include a built-in equalizer, allowing owners to customize the sound to their liking. This would make walks more enjoyable and provide a unique way to experience music on-the-go.
