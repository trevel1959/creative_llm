    "**Piano Labyrinth**: Design a piano with a twist. The keys are arranged in a maze-like pattern, where each note is connected to a specific room or chamber within the instrument. As the player presses a key, the room corresponding to that note opens, revealing a unique sound or visual effect. For example, pressing the \"C\" key might open a room filled with tiny wind chimes, creating a soothing, ambient sound. This interactive experience blurs the line between music and exploration.",
    "**Piano of Memories**: Create a piano that captures and stores memories associated with each note. As the player presses a key, a small, delicate mechanism releases a tiny, glowing orb that floats above the piano. The orb contains a fragment of the player's memory, which can be replayed and relived by touching the orb. Over time, the piano becomes a repository of the player's experiences, allowing them to reflect on their past and connect with their emotions.",
    "**Piano of the Elements**: Envision a piano that responds to the player's emotions, using a unique, elemental system. The keys are arranged to represent different elements (water, earth, air, fire), and each note is associated with a specific emotional state (joy, sadness, calmness, etc.). As the player presses a key, the piano responds by creating a soundscape that reflects the corresponding element and emotion. For example, playing a melancholic melody might summon a gentle rainstorm, while a joyful tune might evoke a sunny day.",
    "**Piano of the Senses**: Design a piano that engages multiple senses, allowing the player to experience music in a more immersive and multisensory way. Each key is equipped with a different sensory trigger, such as: \t* A fragrance release (e.g., a sweet, floral scent for a gentle melody)",
    "**Piano of the Future**: Imagine a piano that incorporates cutting-edge technology to create a futuristic sound experience. The keys are equipped with sensors that track the player's movements, allowing the piano to adapt and respond in real-time. The instrument might use AI"
