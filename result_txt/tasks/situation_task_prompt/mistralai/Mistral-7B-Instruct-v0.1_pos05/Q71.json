    "Use a raised garden bed: If the ground is too hard to dig into, consider using a raised garden bed. This will allow you to plant your garden on a layer of soil that is easier to work with. You can build the raised bed yourself using wood, cinder blocks, or other materials, or you can buy one ready-made.",
    "Use a hydroponic system: A hydroponic system is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, the plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution that is free of harmful bacteria and other contaminants. This can be a great option if the ground is too hard to dig into, as it eliminates the need to work with soil altogether.",
    "Use a vertical garden: If the ground is too hard to dig into, consider using a vertical garden. This will allow you to plant your garden on a vertical surface, such as a wall or fence. You can use a hanging planter, a vertical garden kit, or build your own using materials such as wood or metal.",
    "Use a container garden: If the ground is too hard to dig into, consider using a container garden. This will allow you to plant your garden in pots or other containers, rather than directly in the ground. You can use a variety of container materials, such as plastic, ceramic, or metal, and fill them with a high-quality potting mix that will provide the necessary nutrients for your plants to thrive.",
    "Use a greenhouse: If the ground is too hard to dig into, consider using a greenhouse. A greenhouse is a structure that is designed to provide a controlled environment for plants to grow. It allows you to plant your garden in a soil that is specifically designed for growing plants, rather than having to work with the soil in the ground. You can build your own greenhouse using materials such as glass or plastic, or you can buy one ready-made."
