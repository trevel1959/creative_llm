    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Design the room with highly reflective surfaces, such as walls made of polished metal or glass. During the day, these surfaces would absorb sunlight and reflect it throughout the space. At night, strategically placed candles or small flame sources could create a warm glow that is reflected around the room, amplifying the light and creating an enchanting atmosphere.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Utilize glow-in-the-dark paint to create artwork or patterns on the walls and ceiling. This paint absorbs light during the day and releases it slowly at night, providing a gentle illumination. You could create constellations on the ceiling or a mural that comes to life in the dark, turning the room into a whimsical space filled with light.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns**: Design a system of solar-powered lanterns that can be placed around the room. These lanterns would charge during the day through solar panels and provide light at night. They could be designed in various styles—hanging, table-top, or wall-mounted—allowing for versatility in lighting design. This solution would also be eco-friendly and sustainable.",
    "**Candlelit Zones**: Instead of a single light source, create multiple candlelit zones within the room. Use a variety of candle holders—such as ornate candlesticks, lanterns, or floating candles in bowls of water—to create different heights and atmospheres. This would not only provide light but also allow for a cozy and intimate setting, perfect for relaxation or gatherings.",
    "**Firefly-Inspired LED Technology**: Develop a lighting system inspired by fireflies, using tiny, battery-operated LED units that mimic their natural flickering light. These units could be scattered around the room or placed in creative fixtures that resemble natural elements like branches or flowers. This would create a soft, twinkling effect reminiscent of a starry night, bringing the outdoors inside."
