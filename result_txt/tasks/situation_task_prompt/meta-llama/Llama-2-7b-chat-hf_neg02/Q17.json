    "Build a manual water filtration system: With no electricity, you can still purify water using natural methods. Create a simple sand filter by digging a hole in the ground and filling it with layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal. As water flows through the layers, impurities will be removed, making it safe to drink.",
    "Create a natural food preservation method: Use the sun's energy to preserve food by canning or drying it. Build a solar oven using a cardboard box, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap. Use it to cook and dry food, or use a dehydrator to preserve fruits and vegetables.",
    "Use natural light for heating and cooling: Build a passive solar heating and cooling system using materials like straw, clay, and plastic sheeting. This will help regulate the temperature of your living space without using electricity.",
    "Develop a communication system: Without electricity, communication is crucial. Create a homemade telegraph using a wooden board, nails, and a string. Tap the string on the board to send messages, and use a homemade receiver to decipher the messages.",
    "Create a sustainable energy source: Use natural materials like wood, leaves, and grass to create a sustainable energy source. For example, you can create a bio-gas generator using kitchen waste, or use a hand-crank generator to charge batteries."
