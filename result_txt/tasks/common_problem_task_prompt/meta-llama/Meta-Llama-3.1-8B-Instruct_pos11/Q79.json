    "**Community Land Trust (CLT) Program**: Establish a CLT, a non-profit organization that acquires and holds land for the benefit of the community. This allows low-income individuals and families to purchase homes at below-market rates, with the CLT retaining ownership of the land. This model helps preserve affordability and prevents gentrification, enabling those in need to access stable housing.",
    "**Mobile Tiny Home Village**: Design and implement a mobile tiny home village, consisting of compact, eco-friendly dwellings that can be easily relocated. This concept addresses the need for temporary or transitional housing, providing a safe and dignified space for individuals and families until they can secure more permanent housing. The mobile nature of the village allows for adaptability to changing community needs and avoids long-term commitments to a specific location.",
    "**Cooperative Housing Model**: Develop a cooperative housing model where residents collectively own and manage their housing, making decisions about maintenance, repairs, and community activities. This approach fosters a sense of community and mutual support, as residents work together to maintain their homes and provide services to one another. By sharing resources and responsibilities, cooperatives can reduce costs and increase affordability.",
    "**Micro-Home Construction Training Program**: Establish a training program that teaches individuals the skills necessary to construct and repair micro-homes, including carpentry, plumbing, and electrical work. This initiative empowers individuals to take control of their housing needs and provides them with a valuable skillset that can be applied to future projects. By training a workforce in micro-home construction, the program can help address the shortage of affordable housing options.",
    "**Rent-to-Own Program with Incentives**: Develop a rent-to-own program that offers individuals and families the opportunity to rent a home with the option to purchase it in the future. To incentivize participation, offer benefits such as reduced rent, down payment assistance, or credits towards the purchase price. This program helps bridge the gap between renting and homeownership, providing a stepping stone for those seeking more stability and long-term investment in their housing. By incorporating incentives, the program can attract a wider range of participants and increase the chances of successful homeownership.
