    "**Smart Bus Hubs**: Establish interconnected bus hubs with advanced technologies like real-time passenger information systems, smart fare payment systems, and high-speed Wi-Fi. These hubs can serve as multi-modal transportation centers, allowing passengers to seamlessly transfer between buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bus Fleet**: Introduce an all-electric or hybrid bus fleet, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution. This can be achieved by investing in clean energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to power the buses. Additionally, implementing a bus-sharing system can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road.",
    "**Dynamic Routing System**: Implement an AI-powered dynamic routing system that optimizes bus routes in real-time based on traffic conditions, passenger demand, and road closures. This system can reduce travel times, decrease congestion, and improve the overall efficiency of the public transportation network.",
    "**Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)**: Develop an ITS that integrates data from various sources, such as traffic cameras, sensors, and social media, to provide real-time traffic updates and alerts. This system can help passengers plan their routes more effectively, reducing the likelihood of delays and missed connections.",
    "**Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platform**: Launch a MaaS platform that allows passengers to plan, book, and pay for their trips using a single app or website. This platform can integrate public, private, and shared transportation services, making it easier for passengers to navigate the city and reducing the need for personal vehicles. [/INST] "
