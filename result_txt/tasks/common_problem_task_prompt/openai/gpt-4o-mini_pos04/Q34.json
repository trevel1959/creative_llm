    "**Power Supply Issues**: Robots require a reliable power source to function effectively. If the power supply is insufficient or inconsistent, the robot may not operate as intended. This can lead to unexpected shutdowns or performance lags. A potential solution could involve incorporating a hybrid power system that combines batteries with solar panels or kinetic energy recovery systems to ensure a steady power supply.",
    "**Software Bugs**: The programming aspect of creating a robot can lead to software bugs that cause malfunctions or erratic behavior. These bugs can arise from incorrect algorithms, syntax errors, or integration issues between different software components. To mitigate this risk, developers should adopt rigorous testing protocols, including unit testing and simulations, to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.",
    "**Sensor Calibration Problems**: Robots often rely on sensors to perceive their environment, and improper calibration can lead to inaccurate readings. For example, if a robot's distance sensor is miscalibrated, it may collide with obstacles or fail to navigate correctly. To address this, developers should implement a comprehensive calibration routine during the initial setup and periodically throughout the robot's operational life.",
    "**Material Limitations**: The choice of materials used in the robot's construction can pose significant challenges. Materials that are too heavy can limit mobility, while those that are too fragile may not withstand operational stresses. To overcome this issue, designers should research and select advanced materials, such as carbon fiber or lightweight alloys, that provide the necessary strength-to-weight ratio for the robot's intended tasks.",
    "**User Interface Challenges**: If the robot is designed for interaction with users, creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface can be difficult. A poorly designed interface can lead to confusion and hinder effective communication between the user and the robot. To solve this, designers should conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback and iteratively refine the interface, ensuring it meets the needs of its intended audience."
