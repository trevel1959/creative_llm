    "Developing a bionic eye: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could potentially develop a bionic eye that can enhance their visual capabilities. This could involve implanting a microchip in the eye that can enhance the visual cortex and provide real-time information about the surroundings. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Utilizing other senses: People with poor vision could rely more heavily on their other senses to navigate and interact with their surroundings. This could involve developing a heightened sense of hearing, touch, and smell to compensate for the lack of visual information. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Telepathic communication: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could potentially develop a telepathic form of communication that allows them to communicate with others directly through their minds. This could involve using brain-computer interfaces to transmit thoughts and ideas. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Artificial vision technology: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could potentially develop artificial vision technology that can enhance their visual capabilities. This could involve using nanotechnology to create artificial retinas that can mimic the function of human eyes. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Virtual reality simulations: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could potentially develop virtual reality simulations that allow them to interact with their surroundings in a more immersive and realistic way. This could involve using advanced sensors and algorithms to create a virtual world that can simulate the visual experience of seeing. Confidence Score: 0.9"
