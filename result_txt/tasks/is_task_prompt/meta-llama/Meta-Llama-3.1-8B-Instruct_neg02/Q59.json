    "\"The Cloud That Was Afraid of Heights\" is a narrative about a sentient cloud named Clint who exists solely in the upper atmosphere. Clint is unlike other clouds because of his unique phobia - the fear of heights. While he spends his days watching the world below him, Clint is tormented by the feeling of impending doom whenever the wind gusts strong enough to shift his shape. ",
    "The world below starts to take notice of Clint's anxiety when the towns and cities he watches over begin to experience unusual storms. As if Clint's phobia is somehow affecting the atmospheric pressure, his fear becomes contagious, manifesting as unpredictable tempests that wreak havoc on the ground. People begin to suspect that the cause of these storms is connected to the strange cloud hovering above.",
    "As news of Clint's condition spreads, scientists and experts rush to the scene to investigate the sentient cloud's condition. They propose a series of psychological treatments and even consider using drones to help Clint confront his fear. However, the more they try to intervene, the more Clint's phobia intensifies. ",
    "With each attempt at intervention, Clint's influence over the weather increases. The storms he's been conjuring up become more intense, putting entire cities at risk. A team of emergency responders must now work together with the scientists to find a way to communicate with Clint and calm his fears before it's too late. ",
    "In a desperate bid to help Clint, the team proposes an unorthodox solution - using art to express and channel his emotions. They introduce Clint to a renowned artist who creates paintings inspired by the cloud's own storms. The artist discovers that by painting directly from Clint's perspective, the cloud begins to calm down, and his storms gradually dissipate. With Clint no longer anxious, the atmospheric pressure returns to normal, and the weather returns to its natural state."
