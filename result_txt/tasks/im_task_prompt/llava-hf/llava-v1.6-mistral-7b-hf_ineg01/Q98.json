    "**Multi-Function Juicer**: Incorporate a blender or food processor function into the juicer. This would allow users to create smoothies, purees, and other blended beverages in addition to freshly squeezed juice.",
    "**Juicer with Separation Function**: Add a built-in separation system that allows users to extract juice and pulp separately. This would give users the option to create a smoothie with the pulp or a clear juice without it.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Juicer**: Design the juicer to be more energy-efficient, perhaps by using a motor that only activates when the juicer is in use, or incorporating a solar panel to harness renewable energy.",
    "**Juicer with Self-Cleaning Feature**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that automatically cleans the juicer after each use. This could include a built-in brush or a spray system that uses a cleaning solution to remove pulp and residue.",
    "**Portable Juicer**: Create a compact and portable version of the juicer, perfect for travel or use in small kitchens. This could include a battery-powered motor and a foldable design."
