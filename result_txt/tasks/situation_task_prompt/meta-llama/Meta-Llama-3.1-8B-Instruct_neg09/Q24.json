    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Contact Lenses**: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, a new market for AR contact lenses would emerge. These contact lenses would have a built-in microchip that provides users with real-time visual assistance, such as zooming, text-to-speech, and object recognition. They could also have a built-in GPS and navigation system, making it easier for people with poor vision to navigate their surroundings. Companies like Google and Apple could quickly adapt their AR technology to create these contact lenses, and they would likely become a game-changer for people with visual impairments.",
    "**Smart Canes**: A smart cane would be a game-changer for people with poor vision. It would have a built-in GPS, a camera, and sensors that detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback to the user. The cane could also have a built-in AI assistant that provides navigation assistance, such as turning directions and alerts for nearby hazards. Companies like Amazon and Google could integrate their AI technology into these canes, making them a valuable tool for people with poor vision.",
    "**3D Printing of Customized Prosthetics**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need to rely on other forms of visual assistance. 3D printing technology could be used to create customized prosthetic eyes that would provide people with a new form of visual assistance. These prosthetic eyes could be designed to provide real-time visual feedback, such as zooming and object recognition. Companies like Stratasys and 3D Systems could quickly adapt their 3D printing technology to create these prosthetic eyes.",
    "**Personalized Visual Assistants**: A personalized visual assistant would be a wearable device that provides users with real-time visual assistance. It would have a built-in camera, sensors, and AI technology that provides users with visual feedback, such as object recognition and navigation assistance. The device could also have a built-in voice assistant that provides users with audio feedback, making it easier for people with poor vision to navigate their surroundings. Companies like Amazon and Google could integrate their AI technology into these devices, making them a valuable tool for people with poor vision.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need to rely on other forms of visual assistance. VR therapy could be used to provide people with a new form of visual training. VR technology could be used to create immersive environments that simulate real-world scenarios, allowing"
