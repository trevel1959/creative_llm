    "Community Land Trust: Create a Community Land Trust (CLT) to acquire and hold land for the benefit of the community, rather than private developers. This would allow for affordable housing and community spaces to be built and maintained by the community, rather than being priced out by market forces. The CLT could also provide a platform for community members to develop skills and knowledge in construction, project management, and community organizing.",
    "Co-operative Housing: Establish a co-operative housing model where members of the community come together to purchase and manage a building or group of buildings. This would provide affordable housing and a sense of community, as well as a platform for members to develop leadership and organizational skills. Co-operative housing models have been shown to be effective in providing affordable housing and promoting community engagement.",
    "Micro-Communities: Create micro-communities within the city, each with their own unique character and identity. These micro-communities could be based on shared interests, cultural identity, or geographic location. By creating smaller, more intimate communities within the city, individuals can find a sense of belonging and connection to their community, which can help to combat feelings of isolation and disconnection.",
    "Mobile Housing: Develop a mobile housing solution that allows individuals to live in a safe and secure environment while also having the flexibility to move around the city as needed. This could be achieved through the use of modular housing units that can be easily transported and assembled in different locations. This would provide individuals with the ability to live in a variety of neighborhoods and environments, while also reducing the risk of displacement due to gentrification or other factors.",
    "Virtual Reality Simulation: Create a virtual reality simulation of a city that allows individuals to experience what it is like to live in different neighborhoods and environments. This could help individuals to better understand the challenges and opportunities of different areas of the city, and make more informed decisions about where to live. The virtual reality simulation could also be used to showcase the potential of different neighborhoods and communities, and to promote community engagement and investment."
