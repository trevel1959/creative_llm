    "Smart Home Integration: Create an alarm system that seamlessly integrates with popular smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. This would allow users to control their alarm system through voice commands, making it more convenient and accessible. For example, users could say \"Hey Alexa, arm the alarm\" or \"Hey Google, turn off the alarm.\"",
    "Motion-Activated Detection: Develop a motion-activated alarm system that can detect movement in multiple areas of a home or business. This would provide an added layer of security, as the system would be able to detect potential intruders in real-time, even if they are hiding or trying to remain undetected.",
    "Environmental Impact Alarm: Create an alarm system that not only detects intruders but also monitors the environmental impact of a home or business. For example, the system could detect excessive energy usage or water leaks, providing an alert to the homeowner or business owner to take action.",
    "Multi-Modal Alert System: Develop an alarm system that uses multiple modes of alert, such as sound, light, and vibration, to alert users of potential threats. This would provide a more comprehensive security solution, as users would be able to choose the alert method that works best for them. For example, a user could choose to receive a vibration alert on their phone, a light alert on their door, or a sound alert on their TV.",
    "Personalized Alarm Profiles: Create an alarm system that allows users to create personalized profiles for different times of the day or different locations. For example, a user could create a \"home\" profile that arms the alarm when they are away from home, and a \"work\" profile that disarms the alarm when they are at work. This would provide an added layer of convenience and flexibility for users, as they would not have to worry about manually disarming the alarm every time they move between locations."
