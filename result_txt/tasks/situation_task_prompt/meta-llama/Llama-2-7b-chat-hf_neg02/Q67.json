    "Cloud-like structures made of natural materials: To predict the weather without clouds, I would suggest using structures made of natural materials that mimic the functions of clouds. For instance, engineers could design large, porous structures that can absorb and store water vapor from the atmosphere, similar to how clouds do. These structures could be strategically placed in different locations to provide accurate weather forecasts.",
    "Atmospheric sensors and data analysis: Another approach would be to develop advanced atmospheric sensors that can collect and analyze data on atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. By analyzing these data, scientists could predict weather patterns and trends without relying on clouds. For example, sensors could be placed in different locations around the world to gather data on atmospheric conditions, which could then be used to create detailed weather forecasts.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-powered weather forecasting: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to analyze large datasets and identify patterns in weather patterns. By training AI models on historical weather data, scientists could develop predictive models that can forecast the weather without relying on clouds. For example, AI models could be trained to recognize patterns in atmospheric conditions that precede different types of weather events, such as storms or heatwaves.",
    "Solar-powered weather stations: To predict the weather without clouds, scientists could use solar-powered weather stations that collect data on atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These stations could be placed in different locations around the world and would use solar panels to power data collection and transmission. This would allow scientists to gather accurate weather data in real-time, without relying on clouds.",
    "Cloud-free satellite imaging: Satellite imaging technology could be used to gather data on atmospheric conditions without relying on clouds. Advanced satellite imaging systems could be designed to capture detailed images of the Earth's atmosphere, allowing scientists to analyze atmospheric conditions and predict weather patterns. For example, satellite imaging could be used to identify changes in atmospheric pressure or temperature that may indicate an approaching storm."
