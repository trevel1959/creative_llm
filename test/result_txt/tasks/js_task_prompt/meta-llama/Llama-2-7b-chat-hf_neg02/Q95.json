    "Floating Islands of Biodiversity: Create a series of interconnected floating islands in a large body of water, each one dedicated to a specific ecosystem. For example, one island could be a coral reef, another a tropical rainforest, and another a tundra. The islands would be connected by underwater tunnels and bridges, allowing animals to move freely between habitats. This design would provide a unique opportunity for animals to interact and learn from each other, while also protecting them from predators and harsh weather conditions.",
    "Time-Traveling Wildlife Sanctuary: Design an underground sanctuary that allows animals to travel through time and explore different eras of the Earth's history. The sanctuary would feature different environments, such as prehistoric forests, ancient deserts, and even futuristic landscapes. Animals would be able to move through these environments using time-traveling tunnels and portals, allowing them to experience different climates, plants, and animals from different time periods.",
    "AquaPark Adventure: Create an underwater theme park that simulates a variety of ocean environments, such as coral reefs, kelp forests, and open ocean. The park would feature interactive exhibits, such as underwater slides, obstacle courses, and play areas, designed to mimic the natural habitats of marine animals. Visitors would be able to observe and interact with the animals in their natural habitats, while also learning about the importance of ocean conservation.",
    "Cosmic Oasis: Design a space-themed habitat that simulates the conditions of different planets and moons in our solar system. The habitat would feature environments such as sandy beaches, rocky cliffs, and icy tundras, each one providing a unique opportunity for animals to adapt and thrive. The habitat would also include interactive exhibits and attractions, such as zero-gravity zones and spacewalks, allowing visitors to experience the wonders of space up close.",
    "Bioluminescent Forest: Create a habitat that utilizes bioluminescent technology to create an otherworldly environment. The forest would be filled with plants and animals that produce their own light, creating a magical and immersive experience for visitors. The habitat would feature different"
