There could be both positive effects, such as increased self-confidence and a sense of fulfillment, and negative effects, like feelings of isolation or pressure to constantly innovate. Societal norms and support systems would need to evolve to accommodate these changes, possibly leading to new forms of social interaction and community building based on shared intellectual pursuits."
