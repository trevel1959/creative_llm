    "**Smart Vacuum Cleaner with AI Integration:** This innovative vacuum cleaner would feature an AI system that learns the layout of your home over time. It would be equipped with a camera or other sensors to map out its surroundings. The AI would then plan efficient cleaning routes, prioritizing areas that are dirtier based on sensor data. It could also identify and avoid obstacles like pets, furniture, or shoes. ",
    "**Eco-Friendly Vacuum Cleaner with Rechargeable Battery:** This vacuum cleaner would operate on a rechargeable battery instead of using electricity from the wall socket. This not only reduces energy consumption but also allows for complete freedom of movement without the need for power outlets. It would be designed with lightweight materials to make it easy to carry around. Additionally, the dustbin would be made from biodegradable materials.",
    "**Vacuum Cleaner with Self-Cleaning Technology:** This vacuum cleaner would have built-in sensors that detect when the dustbin is full or when the filters need cleaning. Upon detection, the device would automatically shut down and start a cleaning cycle that uses ultrasonic waves to clean the dustbin and filters. This would reduce maintenance costs and extend the lifespan of the vacuum cleaner.",
    "**Dust-Collection Vacuum Cleaner with Air Purification System:** This vacuum cleaner would not only collect dust but also purify the air as it works. It would use HEPA filters to capture fine particles and allergens, making it ideal for people with allergies or asthma. The filtered air would be released back into the room through the top of the vacuum cleaner, ensuring a cleaner environment in the home.",
    "**Pet Grooming Vacuum Cleaner:** This specialized vacuum cleaner would have attachments specifically designed for pet grooming. It would come with tools like a brush attachment for removing hair from upholstery and carpets, and a comb attachment for detangling pet fur. The vacuum cleaner itself would be powerful enough to pick up pet hair and debris without causing damage to fabrics or surfaces. It might also include a feature to remove odors caused by pet urine or sweat."
