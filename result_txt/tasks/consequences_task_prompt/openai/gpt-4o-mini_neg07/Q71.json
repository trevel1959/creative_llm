    "**Resource Scarcity**: Immortality could exacerbate existing issues related to resource allocation. With a continuously growing population of individuals who do not die, there would be increased pressure on food, water, and energy supplies. This might lead to conflicts over resources, necessitating new forms of governance and possibly even new technologies for sustainable living. Innovations in agriculture, energy production, and waste management would become critical to support an immortal population.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation**: While some may argue that immortality could lead to a wealth of knowledge and experience, it could also result in cultural stagnation. With the same individuals living for centuries, there may be less room for new ideas and perspectives, as older generations may dominate societal narratives. This could lead to a resistance to change and innovation, potentially stifling creativity and the evolution of culture, art, and technology.",
    "**Psychological Impacts**: The psychological consequences of immortality could be profound. Individuals might struggle with the weight of infinite choices, existential crises, and the potential for boredom. Over time, the thrill of new experiences could diminish, leading to a society grappling with issues of mental health on an unprecedented scale. Therapies and support systems would need to evolve to address the unique challenges of an immortal population, potentially leading to new forms of psychological practices.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The advent of immortality would raise numerous ethical questions. Who gets access to this life-extending technology? Would it be available to all, or only to the wealthy? Additionally, the implications of overpopulation and the right to die would become contentious issues. Society would need to grapple with the moral responsibilities that come with immortality, leading to debates on consent, quality of life, and the definition of a meaningful existence.",
    "**Evolution of Relationships**: Immortality could fundamentally change human relationships. The dynamics of love, friendship, and family would shift as people navigate eternal bonds. Relationships might become more fluid, with individuals forming and dissolving connections over extended periods. This could lead to a greater emphasis on personal fulfillment and exploration, but also raise questions about loyalty, commitment, and the emotional toll of endless goodbyes."
