    "**High-Speed Maglev Trains**: High-speed trains that use magnetic levitation technology could be built to travel across continents. These trains would travel on elevated tracks, allowing them to travel at much higher speeds than traditional trains. They would be powered by a combination of solar energy and energy generated from the kinetic energy of the train itself.",
    "**Space Travel**: In a world without airplanes, space travel could become the most viable option for traveling between continents. Private companies could invest in developing reusable spacecraft that would be able to transport passengers and cargo between continents. These spacecraft would be powered by a combination of nuclear energy and solar energy.",
    "**Teleportation**: If we were able to develop teleportation technology, it would be possible to travel instantly between continents. This would be a game-changer for international travel and would revolutionize the way we move between countries.",
    "**Hyperloop Systems**: Hyperloop systems could be built to travel between continents. These systems would use a combination of magnetic levitation and vacuum technology to transport passengers and cargo at incredibly high speeds. They would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy.",
    "**Electromagnetic Propulsion**: If we were able to develop electromagnetic propulsion technology, it would be possible to travel between continents using a combination of magnetic levitation and electromagnetic propulsion. This would allow for fast and efficient travel between continents without the need for airplanes."
