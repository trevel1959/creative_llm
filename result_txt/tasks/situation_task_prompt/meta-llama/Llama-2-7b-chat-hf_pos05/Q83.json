    "Dream-catcher Beds: These beds would be designed with special mesh nets built into the headboard and footboard, allowing dreams to catch and float in mid-air during the day. The beds would be equipped with a special light system that mimics the colors and patterns of the night sky, creating a soothing and peaceful environment for sleep.",
    "Solar-Powered Sleep Masks: These masks would be designed to harness the power of the sun to regulate sleep patterns. The masks would contain tiny solar panels that absorb sunlight during the day and convert it into a gentle, soothing light that simulates the darkness of night. This light would be broadcasted through the mask, creating a sleep-conducive environment even during the day.",
    "Time-Release Sleep Aids: These would be small, discreet devices that could be worn on the wrist or clipped onto clothing. They would release a gentle, sleep-inducing scent at specific times throughout the day, gradually relaxing the body and mind. The scents could be customized to suit individual preferences, such as lavender for relaxation or peppermint for alertness.",
    "Dream-Projecting Headphones: These headphones would use advanced binaural beats technology to transport the listener into their dreams. By wearing the headphones and listening to the specially designed soundscapes, the listener would be able to enter a state of lucid dreaming, allowing them to control and manipulate their dreams.",
    "Sleep-Enhancing Smart Pillows: These pillows would be equipped with sensors that monitor the sleeper's brain waves and body temperature. Based on this data, the pillow would adjust its firmness, temperature, and even its scent to create the perfect sleep environment. The pillow could also play soothing sounds or emit a gentle, pulsing light to help the sleeper relax and fall asleep."
