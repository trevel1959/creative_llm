    "**Solar Window Technology**: Develop and install a thermochromic coating on windows that changes color in response to temperature fluctuations. In the summer, the coating would absorb heat and turn a dark color, while in the winter, it would reflect heat and turn a lighter color. This would allow natural light to enter the building while minimizing heat gain or loss. Additionally, the windows could be designed with a phase-change material that absorbs and releases heat as needed, further regulating the indoor temperature.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Utilize piezoelectric materials or thermoelectric devices to harness thermal energy from the building's foundation or walls. These devices convert waste heat into electricity, which can be used to power a heating or cooling system. This approach would reduce the need for traditional HVAC systems and create a more sustainable indoor environment.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling**: Implement an evaporative cooling system that uses a combination of air flow, evaporation, and phase-change materials to cool the building. This system would be more energy-efficient than traditional air conditioning and could be powered by a renewable energy source, such as solar or wind power.",
    "**Building-Integrated Photovoltaics**: Integrate photovoltaic panels into the building's design to generate electricity and provide passive solar heating and cooling. The panels could be designed to track the sun's movement and adjust their angle to maximize energy production. This approach would reduce the building's reliance on traditional HVAC systems and create a more sustainable indoor environment.",
    "**Smart Window Glazing**: Develop advanced window glazing materials that can change their optical properties in response to temperature fluctuations. These materials could be designed to reflect or absorb heat, depending on the season, and could be integrated into the building's facade to regulate indoor temperature. Additionally, the windows could be equipped with sensors and actuators to optimize their performance and minimize energy consumption. [/INST] "
