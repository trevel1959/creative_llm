    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Develop an electric toothbrush that offers a customizable oral care experience. The user can select from various modes like gentle brushing for sensitive teeth, deep cleaning mode for thorough cleansing, or even a mode designed to target specific areas of the mouth. Each mode can be paired with different vibration patterns and intensities to cater to individual preferences. This personalization helps users effectively address their unique dental needs while making the brushing experience more engaging.",
    "**AI-Driven Oral Health Coach**: Integrate an AI-powered system into the electric toothbrush. The AI acts as a personal oral health coach, monitoring brushing techniques, duration, and pressure applied by the user. It provides real-time feedback and coaching through the toothbrush handle or a connected mobile app. This technology can help users improve their brushing habits, prevent gum disease, and maintain overall oral health more efficiently.",
    "**Sustainable Brush Heads**: Design electric toothbrushes with replaceable, sustainable brush heads. Instead of using traditional plastic brush heads, the toothbrushes can come with brush heads made from biodegradable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, establish a subscription service where users can easily order replacement heads when needed, reducing waste and promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Smart Connectivity**: Incorporate wireless charging capabilities into the toothbrush handle, allowing users to charge their toothbrush wirelessly using any Qi-compatible charger. Pair this feature with a smartphone app that tracks brushing habits, sends reminders for daily brushing, and provides personalized dental care advice based on usage data. This integration makes it easier for users to manage their oral hygiene routine and stay motivated in maintaining good oral health.",
    "**Dental Education Integration**: Create an electric toothbrush that includes an educational component aimed at teaching proper brushing techniques and oral hygiene practices. The toothbrush could have built-in tutorials, interactive quizzes, and animations demonstrating the correct brushing angles, durations, and techniques. This educational feature can be particularly helpful for children and adults looking to improve their brushing skills, ensuring they are effectively removing plaque and maintaining healthy teeth and gums."
