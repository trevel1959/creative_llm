    "**Biometric Verification System**: We could create a system that uses biometrics like fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition to verify identity. The user's unique biometric data can be stored in a secure database and used to authenticate their identity when needed. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
    "**Voice Recognition Technology**: By developing an advanced voice recognition software, individuals could prove their identity through their unique vocal characteristics such as pitch, tone, and rhythm. This technology could be implemented in various devices, including smartphones and smart home systems. **Confidence Score**: 0.85",
    "**Genetic Identification**: Utilizing genetic information, such as DNA, to confirm one's identity could be a highly secure method. This involves creating a unique genetic profile for each individual that could be matched against a database. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: Analyzing unique behavioral patterns, such as typing speed, mouse movements, or touch patterns, could provide a reliable way to verify someone's identity. These patterns are hard to replicate and can be used by software applications and online services. **Confidence Score**: 0.8",
    "**Personalized Question System**: Instead of relying on personal details that might be easily forgotten or shared, we could implement a personalized question system where each individual answers a set of questions based on their life experiences. These questions would be tailored to them and would require specific knowledge only they possess. **Confidence Score**: 0.75"
