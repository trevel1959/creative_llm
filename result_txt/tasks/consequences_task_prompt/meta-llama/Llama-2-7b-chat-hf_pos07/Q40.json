    "Overpopulation: If all diseases were cured, people would live longer and healthier lives, leading to a significant increase in population. This could put a strain on resources, infrastructure, and the environment, leading to issues such as overcrowding, food shortages, and pollution.",
    "Economic Impact: The cure for all diseases would likely be expensive to develop and distribute, leading to a significant economic burden on governments and healthcare systems. This could lead to a shift in priorities, with resources being diverted away from other areas such as education and infrastructure.",
    "Social Changes: With the eradication of diseases, societal norms and values could change as people live longer and healthier lives. For example, there could be a shift towards more leisure time, as people no longer need to spend time and resources on illness and recovery. This could lead to a more relaxed and enjoyable lifestyle, but could also lead to a loss of purpose and meaning for some individuals.",
    "Psychological Effects: The cure for all diseases could have a profound psychological impact on individuals and society as a whole. People may experience a sense of invincibility or a loss of fear, leading to a shift in attitudes towards risk-taking and safety. This could lead to a more adventurous and exciting lifestyle, but could also lead to a loss of caution and a higher risk of accidents and injuries.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas: With the cure for all diseases, there could be ethical dilemmas surrounding access to the cure. Who should have access to the cure, and how should it be distributed? This could lead to debates and conflicts between governments, healthcare providers, and individuals. Additionally, there could be concerns about the potential for the cure to be used for non-medical purposes, such as enhancing athletic performance or extending lifespan beyond what is considered \"normal.\""
