    "**Human-Powered Devices**: Invent devices that are powered by human energy. This could be through pedal power, similar to exercise bikes, which could charge electronic devices like phones or laptops. A device might have a small wheel attached that the user can pedal to generate electricity. Alternatively, there could be devices that use kinetic energy from movement, such as a wristwatch with a built-in pedometer that charges when the wearer moves.",
    "**Solar Panels on Everyday Objects**: Design solar panels that are small enough to be integrated into common objects we already carry around, such as wallets, belts, or even clothing. These could be made of flexible materials to ensure they don't add significant weight or bulk to the items. The collected energy could be stored in a rechargeable battery that could then power small electronic devices.",
    "**Sound-Wave Energy Conversion**: Create wearable devices that convert ambient sound waves into electrical energy. This could be particularly useful in areas where wind is present. For example, a hat with built-in microphones and a generator could harvest wind-generated sound waves, which are then converted into electricity. This could be used to power small gadgets or charge a portable battery.",
    "**Biodegradable Batteries**: Develop a line of batteries that are designed to degrade naturally over time, making them a sustainable option when batteries stop working. These could be made from organic materials that break down into harmless substances when exposed to natural elements. They would be particularly useful for areas where recycling facilities are lacking or non-existent.",
    "**Innovative Charging Infrastructure**: Design public charging stations that utilize renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. These stations could be placed in strategic locations like parks, shopping centers, or along public transportation routes. This not only allows individuals to charge their devices but also encourages the community to adopt more sustainable practices. Additionally, these stations could potentially incorporate interactive features, like displaying local weather forecasts or offering free Wi-Fi, to make them more appealing and useful to the public."
