    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: As a detective or law enforcement officer, having the ability to see through walls would revolutionize crime prevention and investigation. You could monitor areas that are usually inaccessible or hidden, such as walls in abandoned buildings, secret rooms, or even within walls of houses under surveillance. This could lead to faster and more accurate identification of criminals, evidence, and potential threats.",
    "**Medical Diagnostics and Treatment**: In healthcare, being able to see through walls would be invaluable for non-invasive diagnostic procedures. For example, you could visually inspect organs or tissues without surgery, which would be especially useful in emergency situations or for patients who cannot undergo invasive procedures due to medical conditions. Additionally, it could aid in real-time monitoring of patients' conditions, enhancing personalized treatment plans.",
    "**Archaeological Research**: Archaeologists could use this power to explore ancient sites without disturbing the ground. They could see through layers of earth, identify artifacts or structures beneath the surface, and potentially discover new sites without the need for extensive excavation. This would be particularly beneficial for fragile or delicate archaeological sites where traditional methods might cause damage.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental scientists could use this ability to monitor ecosystems and environmental changes from an unseen perspective. They could observe wildlife behaviors, track illegal activities like deforestation or poaching, and monitor pollution levels in areas that are difficult to access. This could lead to more effective conservation strategies and quicker response times to environmental emergencies.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: Architects and urban planners could use this power to visualize and plan complex building designs and city layouts in three dimensions. It would allow them to consider the impact of their projects on surrounding structures and infrastructure, ensuring compatibility and minimizing disruption. Additionally, it could help in designing safer buildings by assessing structural integrity and planning emergency exits more effectively."
