    "Massive Overpopulation of Limbs: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, people could potentially grow extra limbs to use for various purposes, leading to overpopulation of limbs. This could result in a surplus of limbs that are not being used, leading to a waste of resources and potential health issues. Confidence Score: 0.8",

They may expect to be able to regenerate any limb or body part they lose, leading to disappointment and frustration when this is not possible. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Unbalanced Body Development: With the ability to regenerate limbs, the human body may become unbalanced, leading to developmental issues.
