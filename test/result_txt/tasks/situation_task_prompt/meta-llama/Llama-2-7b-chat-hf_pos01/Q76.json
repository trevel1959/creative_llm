    "Carrier Pigeons - Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries as a reliable means of long-distance communication. They can be trained to fly between two locations, carrying a message attached to their leg. While it may take longer than modern communication methods, carrier pigeons are a tried-and-true solution for long-distance communication. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Homing Pigeons - Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons are trained to return to their home location, making them a great option for long-distance communication. They can be released at one location and will fly back to their home, carrying a message attached to their leg. Homing pigeons are also more resistant to harsh weather conditions than carrier pigeons. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Mirror Signals - One way to communicate long distance without using phones is through mirror signals. This method involves using mirrors to reflect sunlight and create a message that can be read from a distance. By positioning mirrors in strategic locations, a message can be created that can be read from miles away. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Smoke Signals - Another ancient method of long-distance communication is smoke signals. By creating smoke from a fire, a message can be conveyed over long distances. This method is best used in areas with clear visibility and minimal wind. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Semaphore Flags - Semaphore flags are a visual communication system that uses flags to convey messages. By using a series of flags in a specific pattern, a message can be conveyed over long distances. This method is best used in areas with clear visibility and minimal wind. Confidence Score: 0.8"
