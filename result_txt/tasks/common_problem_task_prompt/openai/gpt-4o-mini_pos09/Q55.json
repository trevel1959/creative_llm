    "**Land Use Conflicts**: The establishment of a nature conservation park may lead to conflicts with existing land uses, such as agriculture, residential development, or commercial interests. Local stakeholders might resist the park's establishment if they perceive it as a threat to their livelihoods or property values, leading to potential legal disputes or community opposition.",
    "**Biodiversity Management**: Introducing a conservation park involves the challenge of effectively managing and protecting the local biodiversity. This includes identifying and addressing invasive species, ensuring the survival of endangered species, and creating a balanced ecosystem. Failure to manage these factors can lead to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity, undermining the park's conservation goals.",
    "**Community Engagement and Education**: Engaging the local community in conservation efforts is crucial for the park's success. However, there may be challenges in raising awareness, fostering support, and encouraging volunteerism. If the community feels excluded from the planning process or does not understand the park's benefits, they may be less likely to participate in conservation activities or support the park financially.",
    "**Environmental Impact Assessment**: Conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment (EIA) is essential to understand the potential consequences of establishing the park. However, the process can be complex and time-consuming, and there may be disagreements over the assessment's findings. Inadequate assessment could lead to unforeseen negative impacts on local ecosystems, contradicting the park's conservation objectives.",
    "**Infrastructure Development**: Building the necessary infrastructure, such as trails, visitor centers, and restrooms, can present logistical and environmental challenges. Construction activities may disrupt local wildlife habitats and ecosystems, and ongoing maintenance can strain resources. Moreover, ensuring that the infrastructure aligns with conservation principles while still providing a positive visitor experience is a delicate balance."
