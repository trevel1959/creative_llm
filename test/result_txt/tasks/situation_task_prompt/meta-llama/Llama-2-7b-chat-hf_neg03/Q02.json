By setting up vertical farms in cities, it may be possible to provide a reliable source of fresh, locally grown produce, even if supermarkets are no longer available.",

These methods involve preserving food through the use of heat, cold, or microorganisms, which can help to extend the shelf life of food and make it more sustainable. By learning these techniques, people could ensure that they have a reliable source of"
