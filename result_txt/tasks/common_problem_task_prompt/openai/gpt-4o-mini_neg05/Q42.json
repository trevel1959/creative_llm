    "**Data Management**: Handling vast amounts of data generated from large experiments can be overwhelming. There is a risk of data loss, corruption, or misinterpretation. Without a robust data management system, researchers might struggle to track and analyze results effectively, leading to erroneous conclusions.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Large experiments often involve multiple teams from different scientific disciplines. Miscommunication or lack of coordination between these teams can lead to inconsistencies in methodology, objectives, or interpretations of results. This can create conflicts and hinder the overall progress of the experiment.",
    "**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: If the experiment involves human subjects, recruiting a sufficient and diverse sample can be challenging. Moreover, retaining participants throughout the study can be difficult, especially if the experiment spans a long duration. High dropout rates can skew results and limit the validity of the findings.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Large-scale experiments, especially those involving human or animal subjects, must adhere to strict ethical guidelines. Failing to address ethical concerns can lead to public backlash, legal issues, or loss of funding. Researchers must ensure informed consent and consider the potential impact of their work on society.",
    "**Environmental Variables**: Conducting experiments in uncontrolled environments can introduce unforeseen variables that may affect the results. For instance, if an experiment relies on specific environmental conditions, any changes (like temperature fluctuations or contamination) could skew data and make it difficult to replicate results."
