    "**Galactic Bowling Ball**: Design a bowling ball that doubles as a spacecraft. The ball's surface features a map of the solar system, with each lane representing a different planet. As the ball rolls down the lane, it leaves a trail of glow-in-the-dark \"asteroids\" that create a 3D effect. The ball's core contains a miniature AI that can communicate with the player, providing real-time feedback and encouragement. After each game, the ball's AI analyzes the player's performance and suggests areas for improvement, offering personalized coaching to help them become a better bowler.",
    "**Sensory Deprivation Bowling Ball**: Create a bowling ball that challenges the player's senses. The ball's surface features a tactile pattern that changes texture as it rolls, providing a unique sensory experience. The ball also emits a low-frequency hum that resonates with the player's body, creating a sense of vibration. To further disorient the player, the ball's color scheme shifts and changes as it moves, making it difficult to track its trajectory. This ball is designed for players who want to push their limits and experience the game in a new, unconventional way.",
    "**Augmented Reality Bowling Ball**: Develop a bowling ball that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the gaming experience. The ball's surface features a high-resolution display that projects virtual pins, scoring information, and animations onto the lane. As the ball rolls, it leaves a digital trail that reacts to the player's movements, creating a dynamic and immersive experience. The ball's AR system also allows players to compete against virtual opponents, access real-time statistics, and participate in interactive mini-games.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bowling Ball**: Design a bowling ball made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic, bamboo, or cork. The ball's surface features a unique texture that incorporates natural patterns and designs, creating a visually striking appearance. The ball's core is filled with a biodegradable material that reduces waste and minimizes environmental impact. To further reduce waste, the ball's design incorporates a modular system, allowing players to easily replace worn-out parts or upgrade to a new ball without generating unnecessary waste.",
    "**Smart Bowling Ball**: Create a bowling ball that tracks the player's performance and provides real-time feedback using advanced sensors and AI. The ball's surface features a series of small sensors that monitor the player's swing speed, accuracy, and release. The ball's AI analyzes this data and provides personalized coaching, suggesting adjustments to the player's technique and offering"
