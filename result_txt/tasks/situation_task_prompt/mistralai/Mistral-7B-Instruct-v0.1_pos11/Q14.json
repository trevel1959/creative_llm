    "Invent new instruments: If all music instruments disappeared, we could start by creating new instruments from scratch. We could use materials such as metal, wood, or plastic to make new instruments that would create unique sounds. For example, we could make a drum set out of recycled plastic bottles or a guitar from a wooden plank.",
    "Use household objects: We could also use household objects to create music. For example, we could use a bowl and spoons to make a percussion set or a plastic straw and rubber bands to make a flute.",
    "Use nature: We could also use natural objects to create music. For example, we could use rocks and sticks to create a percussion set or use wind to create a flute by blowing air through a straw.",
    "Use technology: We could also use technology to create music. For example, we could use a computer or a tablet to create music using digital instruments or use a synthesizer to create new sounds.",
    "Collaborate with others: We could also collaborate with others to create music. We could work together to create new instruments or use different objects to create music. We could also use our voices to create music and work together to create a song."
