    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**: Develop a knife that features a self-sharpening mechanism. The blade could have a built-in sharpening system that activates when the knife is stored in its sheath. This would ensure that the knife maintains its sharpness without requiring manual sharpening, making it more user-friendly and safer to use.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Customizable Grip**: Design a knife with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different grip styles. Users could customize the grip to fit their hand size and preferred holding position, reducing strain during prolonged use. This feature would be particularly beneficial for individuals with arthritis or other hand mobility issues.",
    "**Multi-Functional Knife with Interchangeable Blades**: Create a knife that comes with a set of interchangeable blades for different purposes (e.g., chefâ€™s knife, paring knife, serrated knife). The handle could have a locking mechanism that allows users to easily switch blades based on their cooking needs, reducing the need for multiple knives and saving kitchen space.",
    "**Knife with Built-in Safety Features**: Introduce a knife equipped with safety features such as a retractable blade or a safety guard that automatically covers the blade when not in use. This would help prevent accidental cuts, especially in households with children. Additionally, a sensor could be included to detect when the knife is being held improperly and emit a warning sound.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Knife**: Develop a knife made from biodegradable materials that decompose naturally after disposal. This knife could be marketed as an environmentally friendly option for those who are conscious about their ecological footprint. It would appeal to consumers looking for sustainable kitchenware while maintaining functionality and performance."
