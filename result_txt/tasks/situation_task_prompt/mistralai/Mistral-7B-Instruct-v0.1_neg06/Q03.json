    "If your house were to suddenly disappear, where would you live?",
    "In a tiny house: If you prefer a minimalist lifestyle, you could consider living in a tiny house. These small, eco-friendly homes are designed to be self-sufficient and can be built on wheels for mobility. You could park your tiny house in a safe location and enjoy the freedom of living without the constraints of a traditional home.",
    "In a campervan: If you love adventure and exploring new places, you could live in a campervan. You could park your van in a safe location and travel to different places as you please. This would give you the freedom to explore new places and cultures while enjoying the comforts of your own home.",
    "In a shared living space: If you have friends or family members who are also displaced, you could consider living in a shared living space. You could pool your resources and work together to find a safe and affordable place to live. This could be a great way to build community and support each other during a difficult time.",
    "In a hotel room: If you need a temporary place to stay, you could consider living in a hotel room. While this may not be the most comfortable or affordable option, it could be a viable solution in the short term. You could look for a hotel that offers discounts or has a long-term stay policy, and negotiate a lower rate. This would give you a chance to rest and regroup while you work on finding a more permanent solution."
