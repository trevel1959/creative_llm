    "**Solar-Powered Roof Panels**: Equip cars with flexible solar panels on the roof and hood to harness solar energy. This would supplement the vehicle's battery, extending its range and reducing reliance on charging stations. The solar energy could also power auxiliary systems like air conditioning and infotainment, promoting sustainability and energy efficiency.",
    "**Augmented Reality Dashboard**: Replace traditional dashboard displays with an augmented reality (AR) interface that projects essential information directly onto the windshield. This would provide real-time navigation, speed, and safety alerts while keeping the driver's focus on the road. The AR system could also highlight points of interest and provide contextual information about surroundings.",
    "**Personalized AI Co-Pilot**: Develop an AI co-pilot that learns the driver's habits, preferences, and routines. This AI could suggest optimal routes based on traffic conditions, remind the driver of scheduled appointments, and even manage in-car entertainment systems. The co-pilot could also provide driving tips to improve efficiency and safety, creating a more engaging driving experience.",
    "**Biodegradable Interior Materials**: Use sustainable, biodegradable materials for car interiors to reduce environmental impact. For example, seat covers made from natural fibers or plastics derived from plant materials would not only look stylish but also break down more easily at the end of their lifecycle. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers and promote a circular economy in automotive design.",
    "**Dynamic Noise Cancellation**: Incorporate advanced noise-cancellation technology that actively reduces external noise from the environment, providing a quieter cabin experience. Using microphones and speakers, the system would analyze incoming sounds and generate opposing sound waves to neutralize unwanted noise, enhancing passenger comfort and allowing for more enjoyable conversations or music."
