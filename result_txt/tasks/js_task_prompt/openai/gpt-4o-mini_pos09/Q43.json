    "**Home Security Solutions**: I would develop advanced home security systems that utilize this power. By being able to see through walls, I could identify potential entry points for intruders, assess vulnerabilities in a property, and provide tailored recommendations for security upgrades. This could extend to creating an app that alerts homeowners in real-time if suspicious activity is detected behind their walls, enhancing their peace of mind.",
    "**Disaster Response Training**: In collaboration with emergency services, I would create training simulations for disaster response teams. By visualizing the layout of buildings in real-time, responders could practice navigating through complex structures during fires, earthquakes, or other emergencies. This would help them learn to locate victims and safely navigate obstacles, ultimately saving lives in real situations.",
    "**Art and History Exploration**: I would use this power to explore historical buildings and archaeological sites without disturbing them. By seeing through walls, I could uncover hidden chambers, artifacts, or ancient murals that have been long forgotten. This would not only enrich our understanding of history but also allow for the preservation of sites that might otherwise be excavated, providing a non-invasive way to study our past.",
    "**Mental Health and Therapy**: I would apply this ability in therapeutic settings, particularly for individuals dealing with trauma or anxiety. By visually representing a person's internal struggles or memories, therapists could create a safe space for clients to confront their feelings. This metaphorical \"seeing through walls\" could help clients visualize barriers in their lives, leading to breakthroughs in their healing processes.",
    "**Environmental Conservation**: By using this power in natural habitats, I could assess the health of ecosystems without disturbing wildlife. I could see how animals interact with their environment, identify signs of pollution, and locate areas that need conservation efforts. This information could be invaluable for wildlife organizations, helping them to implement effective strategies to protect endangered species and restore natural habitats."
