    "Nature-Inspired Artwork: Without paint, I would turn to nature for inspiration. I would use natural materials like leaves, twigs, and rocks to create intricate designs on my walls. I would arrange the materials in patterns and shapes to create a unique and organic look. For example, I could create a mosaic of leaves on a wall to give it a sense of depth and texture.",
    "Light Installations: Instead of relying on paint, I would experiment with different light sources to create visually striking decorations. I would use LED lights, neon signs, and even candles to create a warm and inviting atmosphere in my home. I could create a stunning chandelier using a combination of these light sources, or I could create a more subtle and minimalist look by using a single light source in a strategic location.",
    "Collage Art: Without paint, I would turn to collage art to add color and texture to my home. I would collect a variety of materials like newspaper clippings, fabric scraps, and found objects to create a unique and eclectic look. I could create a collage on a large wall or even on a series of smaller canvases to create a cohesive and eye-catching display.",
    "3D Installations: I would use 3D objects to create a unique and immersive decorative experience in my home. I could create a sculpture using clay, wood, or other materials, or I could use found objects to create a more abstract and conceptual piece. For example, I could create a sculpture using vintage cameras and other objects to create a surreal and thought-provoking installation.",
    "Mirrored Rooms: To create a dramatic and reflective look in my home, I would use mirrors as a primary decorative element. I could cover an entire wall in mirrors, creating a sense of depth and space. I could also use mirrors to create a sense of symmetry and balance in my home, or I could use them to create a more abstract and experimental look by arranging them in an unconventional way."
