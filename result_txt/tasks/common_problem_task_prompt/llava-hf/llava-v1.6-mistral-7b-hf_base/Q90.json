    "Access to subjects: Documentary filmmakers may face challenges in gaining access to their subjects. It can be difficult to gain the trust of people who are not accustomed to being in the spotlight or who are being filmed for the first time. This can result in subjects being unwilling to participate or reluctant to share their stories. In some cases, filmmakers may need to employ covert tactics or use hidden cameras to capture footage.",
    "Time constraints: Documentary films require a lot of time and effort to produce, and filmmakers often work on a tight schedule. They need to find a balance between capturing all of the footage they need and ensuring that it is of high quality. Time constraints can also make it difficult to schedule interviews or access locations and subjects.",
    "Ethical considerations: Filmmakers need to be mindful of ethical concerns when making a documentary. They must ensure that their subjects are treated with respect and that their privacy and personal safety are protected. They must also be transparent about the filmmaking process and obtain informed consent from their subjects.",
    "Editing and storytelling: Documentary filmmaking is as much about storytelling as it is about documentation. Editing footage to create a compelling and engaging narrative can be challenging. Filmmakers need to weigh the importance of each scene, choose the right music and sound effects, and determine how to tell a story while also remaining true to the facts.",
    "Distribution: Once the documentary is complete, filmmakers need to find a way to distribute it. They can submit it to film festivals, use online platforms or create their own distribution channels. However, finding the right audience and getting their film seen by a larger audience can be challenging."
