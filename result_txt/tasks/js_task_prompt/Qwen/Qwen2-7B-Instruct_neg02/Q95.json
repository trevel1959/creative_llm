    "**Quantum Zoo**: This habitat would be a quantum physics-based environment where animals are not bound by classical laws of physics. For example, fish might swim through walls or trees might grow upside down. The habitat could be designed using quantum entanglement, where an action on one particle instantly affects its entangled counterpart, creating a unique experience for both visitors and the creatures.",
    "**Temporal Temples**: In this habitat, the concept of time is manipulated, allowing visitors and animals alike to experience life in different eras. Time travel technology would be used to create a series of interconnected habitats, each representing a different era (e.g., prehistoric, medieval, futuristic). Animals from various periods could interact, leading to unique evolutionary adaptations.",
    "**Eco-Power Plants**: A habitat that integrates renewable energy technologies into its ecosystem. For instance, plants could convert sunlight directly into food and energy, while aquatic creatures produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Wind turbines could be embedded within the habitat, powered by the natural movement of animals like birds and fish, providing sustainable energy for the entire ecosystem.",
    "**Neural Nexus**: This habitat would focus on the development of neural networks and artificial intelligence in animals. Creatures would have enhanced cognitive abilities, including advanced learning, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. They could communicate with humans and each other using complex languages, potentially leading to a symbiotic relationship where they assist in scientific research and conservation efforts.",
    "**Cosmic Canyons**: An outer-space themed habitat where gravity varies across different areas, creating environments that mimic the effects of gravity on planets like Mars, Jupiter, and Earth's moon. This habitat would feature large-scale structures made of alien materials, allowing for the survival of various extraterrestrial life forms alongside Earth's fauna. Visitors could explore different gravity zones and learn about the challenges and opportunities of space colonization."
