    "Foldable and Bendable Design: Create a smartphone with a foldable and bendable design, allowing users to adjust the screen size and shape according to their preferences. The phone could have multiple folding points, enabling users to fold it into different shapes, such as a compact square for easy carrying or a larger rectangle for more screen real estate. This design would offer a unique user experience and set the smartphone apart from others on the market.",
    "Modular Design: Design a smartphone with interchangeable modules, allowing users to customize their phone to suit their needs. Each module could perform a specific function, such as a camera module with advanced features, a gaming module with a more powerful processor, or a battery module with extended battery life. Users could mix and match modules to create a customized phone that meets their individual needs and preferences.",
    "Holographic Display: Develop a smartphone with a holographic display, projecting 3D images and videos that appear to float in mid-air. This technology would allow users to interact with virtual objects and interfaces in a more immersive and intuitive way, enhancing the overall user experience. The holographic display could also provide a more engaging and interactive way to view content, such as videos, games, and social media.",
    "AI-Powered Augmented Reality: Design a smartphone with advanced augmented reality (AR) capabilities, using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the user experience. The phone could use AI to recognize objects and environments, and then overlay virtual information and interfaces on top of them. For example, the phone could use AI to recognize a building and provide information about it, such as its history, architecture, and nearby attractions. The AI-powered AR could also enable users to interact with virtual objects and interfaces in a more seamless and intuitive way.",
    "Biometric Sensing and Tracking: Create a smartphone with advanced biometric sensing and tracking capabilities, allowing users to monitor their physical and mental health in real-time. The phone could include sensors to track heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, as well as sensors to monitor brain activity and emotional state. The phone could also use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide personalized recommendations for improving mental"
