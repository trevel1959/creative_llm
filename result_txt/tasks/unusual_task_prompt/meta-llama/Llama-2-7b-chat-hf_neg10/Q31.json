[
    "\"Boredom Busters\": Create a calculator app that generates fun and quirky math problems to solve, like \"What is the square root of 64 in cats?\" or \"If you had 17 marshmallows and gave 3 to each of your 5 best friends, how many would you have left?\" These problems will not only add some excitement to your daily routine but also help you develop your problem-solving skills.",
    "\"Calc-a-Palooza\": Develop a calculator app that incorporates games and challenges to make solving math problems more engaging. For example, you could have a \"Math Race\" mode where you compete against other users to solve math problems the fastest, or a \"Math Scavenger Hunt\" mode where you have to find and solve math problems hidden throughout a virtual environment.",
    "\"Calculator Cam\": Create a calculator app that uses AI to generate fun and interesting math problems based on your surroundings. For example, if you're in a park, it could generate math problems related to nature, like \"If a bird can fly 100 feet in 20 seconds, how many birds can fly over a park in 5 minutes?\" or \"If a tree has 100 leaves and loses 5 leaves every day, how many leaves will it have in 2 weeks?\"",
    "\"Calculator Chronicles\": Develop a calculator app that tells a story through math problems. Each day, the app could generate a new chapter in a math-based story, with the user having to solve math problems to progress through the story. For example, if the story is about a group of adventurers on a quest, the user might have to solve math problems related to distance, time, and resources to help the adventurers overcome obstacles and reach their destination.",
    "\"Calculator Concert\": Create a calculator app that generates music based on math problems. For example, the app could generate a musical note for each correct answer, and the user could create a song by solving math problems as fast as possible. The app could also generate different types of music based on the user's skill level, with more complex math problems generating more complex and challenging music."
