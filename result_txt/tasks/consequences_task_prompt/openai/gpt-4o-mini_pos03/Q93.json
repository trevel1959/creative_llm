    "**Economic Boom in Mental Health Services**: With a cure available, there would be a shift in the mental health industry from treatment to prevention and maintenance of mental well-being. This could create a new sector focused on mental health education, resilience training, and wellness retreats. Companies might invest in programs that promote mental health literacy among employees, potentially reducing absenteeism and increasing productivity. Additionally, insurance companies could reevaluate their policies, leading to increased funding for mental wellness initiatives.",
    "**Shifts in Pharmaceutical Industry**: The pharmaceutical industry would undergo significant changes, as the demand for psychiatric medications would drastically decline. Companies that previously focused on psychotropic drugs may pivot to research and development of preventative mental health strategies or alternative therapies. This shift could lead to a rise in holistic and integrative approaches, incorporating mindfulness, nutrition, and lifestyle changes as primary tools for maintaining mental health.",
    "**Redefinition of 'Normal'**: With the elimination of mental illness, society may experience a shift in the definition of what is considered \"normal.\" Traits that were once stigmatized, such as neurodivergence or emotional sensitivity, might be celebrated as unique aspects of human diversity. This could foster a culture that embraces a broader range of emotional and cognitive experiences, promoting creativity and innovation as individuals feel freer to express themselves without fear of judgment.",
    "**Global Mental Health Initiatives**: The availability of a universal cure could prompt international collaboration to address mental health on a global scale. Countries could share resources, knowledge, and practices to ensure equitable access to the cure, thereby improving mental health outcomes worldwide. This could lead to a decrease in stigma associated with mental health issues globally, as the focus shifts from illness to health and wellness.",
    "**Impact on the Criminal Justice System**: A cure for mental illness could have significant implications for the criminal justice system. Many individuals incarcerated for crimes related to untreated mental health issues could be rehabilitated, leading to a decrease in recidivism rates. This shift could prompt a reevaluation of punitive measures, focusing instead on restorative justice practices that emphasize healing and reintegration into society."
