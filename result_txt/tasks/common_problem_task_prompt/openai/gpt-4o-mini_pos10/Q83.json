    "**Limited Communication**: Underwater communication presents a major hurdle due to the attenuation of radio waves in water. As the mission descends deeper, maintaining contact with surface teams becomes increasingly challenging. This could lead to delays in decision-making, coordination issues, and a lack of situational awareness. Solutions may include the use of acoustic communication systems or advanced autonomous navigation technologies that allow the submersible to operate independently while still collecting and transmitting data.",
    "**Navigation Difficulties**: Navigating the deep ocean can be problematic due to the lack of GPS signals and the complex underwater topography. This could result in the submersible getting lost or colliding with underwater obstacles. To address this, the mission could incorporate advanced sonar systems and mapping technologies to create detailed 3D maps of the ocean floor, along with inertial navigation systems that help track the vehicle's position relative to its last known location.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The deep ocean is home to various environmental hazards, such as strong currents, underwater volcanic activity, and sharp geological formations. These factors can pose risks to the submersible and its crew. Conducting extensive pre-mission surveys and utilizing real-time environmental monitoring systems could help anticipate and mitigate these risks, ensuring the safety of the mission.",
    "**Life Support Systems**: Maintaining a stable life support system is critical for the safety and health of the crew during extended missions. Challenges may arise in recycling air, managing carbon dioxide levels, and ensuring adequate food and water supplies. Developing robust life support technologies, such as advanced air filtration and water purification systems, will be essential for the success of the mission, especially for longer durations.",
    "**Psychological Effects on Crew**: The isolation and confinement of deep-sea missions can lead to psychological stress among crew members. The lack of natural light, limited social interaction, and the pressure of high-stakes environments may contribute to anxiety or interpersonal conflicts. To combat this, the mission could incorporate regular psychological assessments, team-building exercises, and virtual reality experiences that simulate natural environments to help maintain crew morale and mental well-being."
