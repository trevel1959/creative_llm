    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Body Modification**: If limb regeneration became a reality, society might face ethical questions surrounding body modification. People might choose to deliberately amputate limbs to experience the regenerative process, leading to debates about bodily autonomy versus mental health concerns. This could necessitate new regulations and guidelines regarding surgical procedures and mental health evaluations before allowing such actions. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Shift in Disability Perception**: The ability to regenerate limbs could drastically alter society's perception of disability. With the potential for anyone to regenerate lost limbs, the stigma associated with disabilities might diminish, fostering a more inclusive environment.

Conversely, there might be a surge in demand for specialized regenerative therapies, potentially creating a new sector within healthcare and generating economic growth. Confidence score: 0.75",
    "**Environmental Impact of Limb Regeneration**: The regenerative capabilities could extend to other areas of biology, prompting scientists to explore the potential for environmental restoration. For example, if plants or animals could regenerate damaged parts, it could lead to innovative approaches to conservation and restoration of ecosystems. This could also encourage bioengineering practices that enhance the resilience of species against climate change. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Cultural and Artistic Expressions**: The phenomenon of limb regeneration could inspire new forms of art and cultural expressions. Artists might explore themes of regeneration, identity, and the human experience in their work, leading to a renaissance of creative endeavors that reflect society's evolving relationship with the body.
