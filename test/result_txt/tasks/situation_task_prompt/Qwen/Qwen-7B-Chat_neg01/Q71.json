    "Use hydroponics: If the ground is too hard to dig into, you can use hydroponics to grow plants without soil. Hydroponics involves growing plants in water or nutrient-rich solutions instead of soil. This method allows you to control the environment for your plants, including the amount of light, water, and nutrients they receive. You can use plastic containers, wooden boxes, or other materials to create a hydroponic system for your garden.",
    "Create a vertical garden: If you don't have much space to plant a garden, you can create a vertical garden using wall-mounted planters or shelves. Vertical gardens are perfect for small spaces like balconies, patios, or indoors. By arranging your plants vertically, you can maximize your space and create a beautiful display.",
    "Grow plants in containers: If the ground is too hard to dig into, you can use containers to plant your garden. Containers come in all shapes and sizes, from small pots to large planters. You can choose containers made of plastic, clay, or metal, depending on your preferences and budget. Containers allow you to move your plants around easily if needed, making them a great option for people who want to experiment with different planting locations.",
    "Use raised beds: Raised beds are another option for planting in difficult soil conditions. A raised bed is a container that is elevated above the ground level. By creating a raised bed, you can make it easier to work with the soil and provide your plants with better drainage. You can fill your raised bed with compost, vermiculite, or other soil amendments to improve its quality.",

Container gardening is an easy and flexible option for people who want to grow their own food or add some greenery to their home."
