    "Weather conditions: Another potential problem is unpredictable weather conditions. The team may encounter strong currents, storms, or changes in water temperature that can make the mission dangerous. For instance, a sudden storm could cause the submersible to lose buoyancy, leading to a loss of control.",
    "Limited visibility: The deep sea is a dark environment, and the team may experience limited visibility due to the lack of light. This can make it difficult to navigate, identify marine life, and locate any potential hazards. For example, the team may encounter a school of fish that they cannot see, causing them to collide with it.",
    "Navigation issues: The team may experience navigation issues due to the vastness of the ocean and the difficulty in determining their location. They may become disoriented or lose their way, causing them to miss important landmarks or locations. For instance, the team may mistake a coral reef for a mountain range, leading them to take a wrong turn.",
    "Marine life encounters: The team may encounter unexpected marine life, which can be dangerous or disruptive to the mission. For example, they may encounter a giant squid that can damage the submersible or a school of sharp-toothed fish that can cause injury.",
    "Equipment theft: The team may experience equipment theft, where some of their tools or equipment are stolen by curious marine animals or other underwater creatures. This can cause delays in the mission and hinder the team's ability to complete their objectives. For instance, a sea turtle may steal a vital tool, causing the team to have to abort their mission and return to the surface."
