    "Another way to improve a washing machine is to make it more user-friendly. This can be accomplished through the use of intuitive controls, illuminated indicator lights to remind users of the remaining cycle, programmable settings for different fabric types, and easy-to-use mobile apps that allow users to remotely control their washing machines.",
    "To increase the durability of a washing machine, it can be made with more robust materials and components. Additionally, employing self-diagnosing software can help identify and resolve potential issues before they occur, and ensure that the machine operates at optimal levels.",
    "Wireless connectivity can be added to washing machines to enhance user experience, enabling them to remotely control the machine, receive cycle alerts, and monitor machine status using smartphones or other devices. This can also improve the laundering process by enabling users to start or stop cycles using voice commands.",
    "Introducing touchless technology to the washing machine's controls can make the user experience more pleasant and hygienic, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of infrared sensors or other touchless technology can replace traditional buttons and touchscreens, reducing the spread of germs and creating a more sanitary laundering environment.",
    "To make a washing machine more environmentally friendly, consider adding features that promote energy conservation, use of sustainable materials, and reduction of water consumption. This could include programs that use only the amount of water necessary to complete a cycle, recycling systems that break down laundry waste, and the use of natural, eco-friendly cleaning agents."
