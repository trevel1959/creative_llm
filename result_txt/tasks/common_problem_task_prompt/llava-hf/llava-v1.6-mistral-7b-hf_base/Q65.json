    "Security: Another potential problem is security. With more data being stored on smartphones, there is an increased risk of hacking and data breaches. To address this issue, the company could incorporate advanced security features such as biometric authentication, encryption, and secure boot processes. Additionally, the company could offer regular security updates and patches to ensure that the phone remains secure over time.",
    "User Interface: A potential problem is the user interface. As smartphones become more complex, it can be challenging to design an interface that is intuitive and easy to use for all users. To address this issue, the company could conduct user testing and gather feedback to improve the user interface and make it more user-friendly.",
    "Compatibility: Another potential problem is compatibility. As smartphones become more advanced, they may not be compatible with older applications or devices. To address this issue, the company could ensure that the phone is backward compatible with older applications and devices, or offer a compatibility mode that allows users to run older apps on the new device.",
    "Overheating: A potential problem is overheating. As smartphones become more powerful, they generate more heat, which can reduce performance and potentially damage the device. To address this issue, the company could use heat-resistant materials and design the phone to dissipate heat more efficiently.",
    "Environmental Impact: Another potential problem is the environmental impact of the device. As smartphones become more advanced, they often contain more rare and toxic materials, which can be harmful to the environment. To address this issue, the company could use sustainable materials and design the phone to be more energy-efficient."
