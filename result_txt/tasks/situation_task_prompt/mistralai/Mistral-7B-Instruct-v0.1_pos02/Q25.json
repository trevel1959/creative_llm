    "Use a rope ladder: One option would be to the top of the skyscraper using a rope ladder. The ladder could be attached to a sturdy point on the ground floor, and then tied to a secure point on the top floor. The climber would need to the ladder up the building one rung at a time, being careful not to slip.",
    "Use a grappling hook: Another option would be to use a grappling hook to climb the building. The climber would need to tie the hook to a secure point on the ground floor and then use it to grab onto a point on the top floor. They would then pull themselves up the building using the hook.",
    "Use a pulley system: A pulley system could be used to lift the climber up the building. The climber would need to tie a rope to a secure point on the ground floor and then attach it to a pulley system. The pulley system would then lift the climber up the building.",
    "Use a drone: A drone could be used to transport the climber up the building. The drone would need to be equipped with a harness and a secure attachment point for the climber. The climber would then sit in the harness and be lifted up the building by the drone.",
    "Use a human chain: A human chain could be used to climb the building. The climber would need to find a group of people who are willing to help them climb the building. Each person would hold onto the climber's hands and pull them up the building one step at a time. This would be a challenging and dangerous option, but it could be done if necessary."
