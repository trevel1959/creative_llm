    "**Educational Solar Panels:** Design solar panels that are not only functional but also serve as educational tools for homeowners. These panels could have interactive features where users can learn about solar energy generation, storage, and how their energy consumption impacts the environment. They could also display real-time data on power generation, allowing users to see their contribution to renewable energy production.",
    "**Community Solar Gardens:** Instead of installing individual solar panels on each home, create large communal solar gardens. These gardens could be located in open spaces such as parks or rooftops of community centers. The electricity generated would then be distributed among participating households. This idea encourages community involvement and allows residents to benefit from solar energy without the need for personal installations.",
    "**Solar-Powered Smart Homes:** Develop homes equipped with advanced smart technologies integrated with solar panels. These homes could include features like automated shading systems, efficient appliances, and intelligent lighting that adjusts based on sunlight availability. The system would optimize energy usage by dynamically managing power distribution between grid power and solar-generated power, reducing overall energy costs.",
    "**Solar-Powered Public Services:** Extend the solar panel installation concept beyond residential areas to public services like schools, libraries, and municipal buildings. This not only reduces the city's carbon footprint but also serves as an example for citizens, encouraging them to adopt similar sustainable practices. Additionally, these public installations could generate surplus energy that could be sold back to the grid, providing additional revenue for the city.",
    "**Solar-Powered Transportation Hubs:** Install solar panels at transportation hubs like bus stations, train terminals, and airports. These panels could power charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs), provide lighting, and even support Wi-Fi networks. By integrating solar energy into transportation infrastructure, the city promotes sustainable commuting options while reducing dependence on fossil fuels. This initiative could also attract green-conscious travelers and encourage more people to switch to EVs."
