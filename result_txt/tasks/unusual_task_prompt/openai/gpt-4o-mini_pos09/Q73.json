    "**Miniature Aquarium**: Transform a clear lightbulb into a tiny aquarium for small aquatic plants or fish (like a betta). After removing the filament and base, fill it with water, pebbles, and aquatic plants. This whimsical decoration can serve as a conversation starter, but ensure it's well-sealed to prevent leaks.",
    "**Message in a Bottle**: Use the lightbulb as a creative way to send messages or notes. Write a tiny message on a piece of paper, roll it up, and place it inside the bulb. Seal the opening with a cork or wax, and gift it to someone as a unique keepsake or use it for a scavenger hunt.",
    "**DIY Candle Holder**: Create an elegant candle holder by cutting the top off a lightbulb and placing a small tealight candle inside. The glass will amplify the candle's glow, providing a soft and ambient light. This can be a beautiful centerpiece for dinner parties or romantic evenings.",
    "**Artistic Sculpture**: Use multiple lightbulbs to create an artistic sculpture. By painting or decorating the bulbs in various colors and patterns, you can arrange them on a base to form a unique piece of art. This can serve as an eye-catching decoration for your home or garden.",
    "**Glass Orb for Home Décor**: Convert a lightbulb into a decorative glass orb by removing the base and filling it with colored sand, glitter, or small decorative items. You can place these orbs on shelves or hang them with twine to add a touch of whimsy to your décor."
