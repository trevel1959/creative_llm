    "Customizable Oral Care: Develop a toothbrush with interchangeable heads that cater to specific oral care needs. For example, one head could focus on gum health, another could target plaque removal, and a third could be designed for sensitive teeth. Users can choose the right brush head based on their oral health concerns.",
    "Eco-Friendly Materials: Use sustainable materials in the construction of the toothbrush, such as biodegradable handles and recyclable parts. Offer the option to purchase refill packs instead of buying new brushes regularly, reducing waste and promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "Vibrating Massager: Integrate a vibrating massager feature into the toothbrush handle, providing a gentle massage to the gums and facial muscles during brushing. This not only enhances the brushing experience but may also contribute to stress relief and relaxation.",
    "UV-C Sanitization: Incorporate a UV-C light inside the toothbrush charger or stand, which sanitizes the brush heads automatically after each use. This helps eliminate bacteria and germs, ensuring a cleaner and safer oral care routine.",
    "Voice Assistant Integration: Partner with popular voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) to allow users to control their toothbrushes hands-free. Users can set brushing times, receive recommendations, or even listen to music while brushing."
