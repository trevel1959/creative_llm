    "**Smart Candle with App Integration**:    Develop a smart candle that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. Users could control the candle's brightness, color, and scent intensity from their devices. The app could also offer guided meditations, relaxation techniques, or reminders to practice mindfulness when the candle is lit. Additionally, users could set timers for the candle to turn on and off automatically, enhancing convenience and safety.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Candle Holder**:    Create a candle that comes with a reusable holder made from sustainable materials. Once the wax has burned down, users can replace the wax with refillable pods that come in various scents and colors. This reduces waste and encourages creativity, as users can mix and match scents or create their own custom blends, while the holder itself can be decorated or personalized.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Seeds**:    Design a candle that contains embedded seeds within the wax. Once the candle has burned down, the leftover wax can be planted in soil, allowing the seeds to germinate. This concept combines the pleasure of candlelight with a commitment to sustainability, as users can grow flowers or herbs from their used candles, creating a beautiful and fragrant garden.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Candle**:    Introduce a candle that reacts to the emotional state of the room. Using advanced sensors, this candle could detect changes in temperature, sound, and even the presence of people. If it senses a quiet, relaxed environment, it could emit a soft glow and a calming scent. Conversely, in a lively setting, it could switch to a more vibrant color and a refreshing fragrance. This would make it an interactive centerpiece for gatherings or personal relaxation.",
    "**Candle with Soundscapes**:    Incorporate a sound module within the candle that plays soothing soundscapes as it burns. Users could choose from a variety of ambient sounds, such as ocean waves, forest sounds, or soft instrumental music. This multi-sensory experience would enhance relaxation and create a more immersive atmosphere, perfect for meditation, yoga, or unwinding after a long day."
