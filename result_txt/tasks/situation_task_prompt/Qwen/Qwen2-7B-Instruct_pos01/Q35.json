    "**Invention of Personal Flying Devices**: Develop a new technology that allows individuals to fly short distances using lightweight, portable devices. These could be personal flying machines similar to drones but designed for human use. They would require specialized training and safety protocols but could provide an alternative mode of transportation when bicycles are not available.",
    "**Urban Pedestrianization**: Encourage cities to become pedestrian-friendly by converting roads into pedestrian walkways, especially in densely populated urban areas. This would involve redesigning streets to remove cars and provide safe spaces for pedestrians to walk or jog. This approach would necessitate significant urban planning and infrastructure changes but could greatly reduce dependence on bicycles.",
    "**Hybridized Vehicles**: Create hybrid vehicles that combine elements of bicycles and cars. For example, these could be electric bikes equipped with small, efficient engines that kick in at high speeds or when carrying heavy loads. These would provide the convenience of motorized transport while maintaining some of the environmental benefits of biking.",
    "**Elevated Walkways and Skywalks**: Implement a network of elevated walkways and skywalks connecting key destinations like homes, offices, schools, and public spaces. This would allow people to move around without encountering vehicular traffic, making it a safer and more efficient alternative to both bicycles and cars.",
    "**Community-Centric Transportation Services**: Establish a system of shared, community-owned vehicles such as electric cars, vans, or even small buses. These vehicles could be rented out by individuals or communities for local transportation needs. The idea is to promote sharing and reduce the overall number of privately owned vehicles, thereby minimizing the need for bicycles."
