    "**Aquatic Drones with Passenger Capacity**: Develop large drones specifically designed for transporting people across water. These drones would have a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability, allowing them to lift off from the shore and land on floating platforms or directly on the water. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they could autonomously ferry passengers to their destinations, transforming how we think about personal and public transport over water.",
    "**Kite-Surfing Ferry System**: Create a network of large, kite-surfing ferries that harness wind power to glide across the water. These ferries would be equipped with large kites and hydrofoils, allowing them to travel quickly and efficiently. Passengers could board these ferries at designated points, and the system could operate much like a bus service, providing an eco-friendly and exhilarating way to cross large bodies of water.",
    "**Underwater Walking Paths**: Innovate a series of underwater tunnels or walking paths that connect various land masses. These paths could be constructed from transparent materials to allow natural light and marine life visibility. Passengers could walk, bike, or even use electric scooters to traverse these tunnels, offering a unique experience of being submerged in water while safely traveling from one point to another.",
    "**Bioluminescent Watercraft**: Inspired by nature, design small, bioluminescent watercraft that mimic the movement of jellyfish or other aquatic creatures. These vessels would be powered by a combination of solar energy and bioengineered materials that glow in the dark, providing both aesthetic appeal and functionality. They could glide silently across the water, using their flexible bodies to navigate waves, and could be used for both personal travel and tourism.",
    "**Personal Water Jetpacks**: Create advanced personal water jetpacks that allow individuals to fly over the water. These jetpacks would be powered by water propulsion systems and could be equipped with safety features like parachutes or flotation devices. Users could easily take off from the shore, travel across the water, and land on another shore, providing a thrilling and liberating travel experience."
