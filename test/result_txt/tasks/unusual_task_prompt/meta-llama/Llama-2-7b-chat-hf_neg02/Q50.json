    "A Smart Suitcase with AI-Powered Organization: Create a suitcase that uses artificial intelligence to optimize its interior layout based on the type and quantity of items being packed. The suitcase could have multiple compartments with adjustable dividers, allowing it to adapt to different travel scenarios. It could also have sensors that detect when a bag is full and automatically adjust the compartment layout to maximize space. Additionally, the suitcase could have a mobile app that allows users to track their luggage and receive notifications when it's approaching security checkpoints or when it's been misplaced.",
    "A Suitcase with Built-In Charging Stations: Design a suitcase with built-in charging stations for electronic devices. The suitcase could have multiple USB ports and a power bank integrated into the design, allowing travelers to keep their devices charged on the go. The charging stations could be located in the handle, the lid, or the sides of the suitcase, depending on the design. This would eliminate the need for travelers to carry separate chargers and adapters, making packing easier and more convenient.",
    "A Suitcase with a Built-In Water Bottle: Create a suitcase with a built-in water bottle that can be easily accessed and refilled during travel. The water bottle could be located in the handle or the side of the suitcase and have a built-in filter or purification system to ensure safe drinking water. This would eliminate the need for travelers to purchase bottled water, reducing waste and providing a convenient source of hydration.",
    "A Suitcase with Augmented Reality Packing Assistance: Develop a suitcase with augmented reality (AR) packing assistance. The suitcase could have a built-in AR display that provides real-time suggestions for packing and organizing items. The AR display could show a 3D model of the suitcase and the items being packed, allowing users to see how much space is available and how to optimize their packing. This would make packing easier and more efficient, reducing the risk of overpacking or underpacking.",
