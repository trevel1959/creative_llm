    "**Biodegradable Materials**: Instead of using traditional plastics, opt for biodegradable materials such as plant-based polymers (PLA or PHA), which are derived from natural sources like corn starch or sugarcane. These materials can break down into non-toxic compounds when exposed to the right conditions, reducing environmental impact.",
    "**Recycled Materials**: Recycle existing waste products into new plastic alternatives. For example, old clothes, paper, or even food waste could be transformed into plastic-like substances through processes like pyrolysis or chemical recycling. This not only reduces landfill waste but also conserves resources.",
    "**Nanostructured Materials**: Develop new materials that mimic the properties of plastics at a microscopic level. For instance, using nano-engineered cellulose fibers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) could create strong, lightweight, and potentially more durable alternatives to traditional plastics.",
    "**Plant Cellulose-Based Composites**: Create composite materials by combining cellulose (found in plants) with other materials like carbon fibers or glass fibers. These composites are not only strong but also sustainable due to their renewable source and potential for biodegradability.",
    "**Smart Materials**: Develop smart plastics that change properties based on external stimuli such as temperature, light, or pH levels. For example, a plastic material that becomes stronger under pressure or changes color in response to pollution could offer unique solutions in various applications, while also serving as indicators for environmental conditions.
