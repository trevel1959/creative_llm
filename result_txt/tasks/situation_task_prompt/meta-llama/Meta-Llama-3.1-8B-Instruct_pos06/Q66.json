    "**Bioluminescent Architecture**: I would build a house using bioluminescent organisms like glowing mushrooms, bacteria, or plankton. These organisms would be cultivated in a controlled environment and used to create a structure that emits a soft, ethereal glow. The bioluminescent material would be used for walls, floors, and even furniture, creating a unique and sustainable living space. The glow would also provide a natural source of light, eliminating the need for artificial lighting. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Geodesic Dome Made of Recycled Plastic**: I would design a geodesic dome using recycled plastic waste, which would be collected, sorted, and processed into a durable and versatile material. The dome would be constructed using a combination of tensioned cables and recycled plastic panels, providing a strong and lightweight structure. The dome's shape would allow for maximum space utilization while minimizing material usage. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**3D-Printed Structure Using Plant-Based Materials**: I would use 3D printing technology to create a structure using plant-based materials like cellulose, chitin, or alginate. These materials would be sourced from agricultural waste or algae and processed into a printable form. The 3D printer would create a complex structure with a high degree of precision, using a combination of plant-based materials and a binding agent to create a strong and durable framework. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Inflatable Habitat Made of Advanced Membranes**: I would design an inflatable habitat using advanced membranes that are lightweight, flexible, and highly durable. These membranes would be made from materials like silicone or polyurethane and would be designed to provide a comfortable and safe living space. The inflatable structure would be filled with a gas that maintains a consistent pressure, ensuring a stable and secure environment. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Modular, Self-Healing Structure Using Shape-Memory Alloys**: I would create a modular structure using shape-memory alloys (SMAs) that can change shape in response to temperature changes. These SMAs would be used to create a framework that can be easily assembled and disassembled, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. The SMAs would also have self-healing properties, allowing the structure to repair itself in the event of damage. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
