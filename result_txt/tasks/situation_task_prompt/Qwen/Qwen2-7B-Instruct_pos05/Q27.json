    "**Utilize Natural Ventilation**: If all heaters and air conditioners were to stop working, one creative solution could be to rely on natural ventilation. Open windows and doors during cooler times of the day when it's not too hot or cold outside. This allows for a natural exchange of air and can help regulate the temperature inside. Use fans to circulate the air within the building. During warmer days, open windows in the morning to let in cooler air and close them during the hottest part of the day to keep the cool air inside.",
    "**Reflective Materials**: Implement reflective materials around the interior surfaces of buildings. Use mirrors, polished metal sheets, or white paint to reflect sunlight away from the interior space, reducing heat absorption. In colder climates, use reflective surfaces like glass or metal to retain heat more efficiently. This technique requires careful planning to balance light and heat regulation.",
    "**Plant Walls and Green Roofs**: Introduce plant walls or green roofs to buildings. Plants can help regulate temperature by absorbing heat through transpiration, which cools the surrounding environment. Additionally, plants improve air quality, making the space more comfortable. This method is particularly effective in urban areas where buildings are densely packed.",
    "**Thermal Mass Construction**: Construct buildings using materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete, stone, or brick. These materials absorb and store heat during the day and release it slowly at night, maintaining a more stable indoor temperature. This passive cooling and heating system helps regulate the internal climate without relying on active mechanical systems.",
    "**Underground Temperature Stabilization**: Design buildings with underground foundations or incorporate underground spaces as part of the building design. Underground environments tend to have more stable temperatures than above-ground spaces due to the earthâ€™s constant temperature. Utilize this natural phenomenon by creating underground rooms or corridors for specific functions, like storage or living quarters, to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the year."
