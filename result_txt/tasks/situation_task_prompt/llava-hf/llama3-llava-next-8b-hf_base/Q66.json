    "Incorporating recycled materials: With the depletion of natural materials, it is essential to incorporate recycled building materials like steel, aluminum, or plastic to minimize waste and promote sustainability. These materials can be used to reinforce structures and insulation.",
    "Utilizing low carbon construction techniques: Using low carbon construction techniques, such as natural ventilation, passive solar heating and cooling, and insulation materials made from natural fibers can reduce energy consumption and promote energy-efficient living.",
    "Opting for modular systems: One alternative to traditional construction techniques would be to opt for prefabricated modular housing. This would involve constructing homes in factories, transporting them in pieces, and assembling them on-site.",
    "Building using vertical construction: Utilizing vertical construction using steel or other lightweight structure systems can reduce waste, labor, and environmental impacts. These systems can be designed to support the weight of multiple layers of insulation materials to improve energy efficiency.",
    "Sustainable bamboo: While not a natural material, bamboo has become a sustainable building material globally. With its fast-growing properties, low ecological footprint, and insulating properties, bamboo could become a viable alternative to traditional building materials like wood and stone."
