    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and high temperatures to sanitize the interior. After cooking, the user could activate a cleaning cycle that generates steam from water, loosening food particles and stains. The microwave would then use a fan to vent out the moisture, leaving a clean and odor-free interior without the need for manual scrubbing.",
    "**Modular Design**:    Create a modular microwave that allows users to customize features based on their cooking habits. For instance, users could add or remove compartments for steaming, grilling, or even baking, transforming the microwave into a multi-functional kitchen appliance. This flexibility would cater to diverse cooking styles and preferences, enhancing user experience.",
    "**Health Monitoring System**:    Equip the microwave with a health monitoring system that tracks the nutritional content of the food being cooked. By scanning barcodes or using a database of common foods, the microwave could provide real-time feedback on calorie counts, fat content, and more. This feature could also suggest healthier cooking methods or alternative ingredients to promote better eating habits.",
    "**Integrated Recipe Library**:    Incorporate a touchscreen interface with an extensive recipe library that includes microwave-specific cooking instructions. Users could browse recipes, watch instructional videos, and select a dish to prepare. The microwave would then automatically adjust the cooking time and power based on the chosen recipe, making meal preparation easier and more accessible.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Features**:    Design a microwave that prioritizes energy efficiency by incorporating solar panels or kinetic energy technology. This eco-friendly microwave could harness energy from sunlight or user movements to reduce electricity consumption. Additionally, a recycling compartment could be included for packaging waste, encouraging users to dispose of materials responsibly."
