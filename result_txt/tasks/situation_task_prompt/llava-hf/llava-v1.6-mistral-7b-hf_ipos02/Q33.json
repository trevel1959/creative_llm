    "**Solar Position**: Another method is to use the position of the sun to estimate the time of day. By observing the sun's position in the sky and knowing the time zone, one could estimate the time. This method is less accurate than using a clock or watch, but it can provide a rough estimate.",
    "**Biological Clock**: Humans have an internal clock called the circadian rhythm that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. By paying attention to one's own body signals, one could use their biological clock to estimate the time of day. This method is less precise than using a clock or watch, but it can provide a general idea of the time.",
    "**Earth's Rotation**: One could also use the Earth's rotation to estimate the time of day. By observing the position of the stars and the sun, one could estimate the time based on the Earth's rotation. This method is more accurate than using a biological clock but requires a good understanding of astronomy.",
    "**Sound-based Timekeeping**: Some animals, such as birds, use sound-based timekeeping to synchronize their activities. By observing the songs or calls of local birds, one could estimate the time of day. This method is less precise than using a clock or watch, but it can provide a rough estimate.",
    "**Sand Hourglass**: A sand hourglass is a simple timekeeping device that uses sand to measure the passage of time. By observing the amount of sand in the hourglass, one could estimate the time of day. This method is less precise than using a clock or watch, but it can provide a general idea of the time."
