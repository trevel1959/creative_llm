    "**Interactive Dog Leash**: Design a leash that incorporates a built-in training system for dogs. The leash could have a small speaker and microphone attached to it, allowing owners to play recorded commands or even their voice to train their dog while walking. Additionally, it could include a vibration sensor that alerts the owner when the dog pulls too hard, encouraging the dog to walk more calmly.",
    "**Biodegradable Dog Leash**: Develop a dog leash made from natural materials like bamboo, hemp, or recycled cotton. These materials break down faster than traditional nylon leashes, reducing environmental impact. The leash could also feature a special coating that repels water and dirt, keeping it clean and hygienic.",
    "**Adjustable Dog Leash with Safety Features**: Create a leash that adjusts in length but also has a safety feature such as a quick-release mechanism that can be activated by pressing a button on the handle. This allows for immediate control if the dog spots a squirrel or other distraction. It could also incorporate a light-up feature that enhances visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "**Smart Dog Leash with GPS Tracking**: Integrate a GPS tracker into the leash so that pet owners can monitor their dog's location in real-time using a smartphone app. This would not only help in tracking lost pets but also allow owners to set up virtual fences around their home, sending notifications when the dog crosses the boundary.",
    "**Therapeutic Dog Leash for PTSD Patients**: Design a leash specifically for use with PTSD patients and their therapy dogs. The leash could be padded with a calming material, such as lavender-infused fabric, to help soothe the patient and their dog during walks. It might also include a pouch for carrying medication or tools needed for managing the patientâ€™s condition. The leash could also have a built-in noise-canceling device to reduce external stimuli that might trigger anxiety in the patient or their dog."
