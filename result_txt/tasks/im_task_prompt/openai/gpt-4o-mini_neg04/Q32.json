    "**Multi-Function Touchscreen Interface**: Upgrade the traditional printer interface to a large, interactive touchscreen that offers intuitive navigation. This interface could include features like drag-and-drop printing from a connected device, the ability to edit documents directly on the screen, and built-in templates for various printing needs (like brochures, flyers, or labels).",
    "**Eco-Friendly Printing Mode**: Introduce an eco-friendly printing mode that optimizes ink usage and paper consumption. This mode could utilize algorithms to adjust settings based on the type of document being printed, such as reducing color saturation for drafts or using both sides of the paper by default. Additionally, it could provide users with feedback on their printing habits and suggest greener alternatives.",
    "**Wireless Charging Dock**: Create a printer that includes a wireless charging dock for compatible devices. Users could place their smartphones or tablets on the dock to charge while printing documents directly from their devices. This would streamline the printing process and reduce clutter from cables, enhancing the overall user experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Printing**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) capabilities into the printer. Users could scan documents with their smartphones and view them in 3D or interactive formats through an AR app. This feature would be particularly useful for educational materials, architectural designs, or any content where visual representation enhances understanding.",
    "**Personalized Print Profiles**: Develop a system that allows users to create personalized print profiles based on their preferences and frequent tasks. For example, a user could set up a profile for printing photos, another for documents, and a third for presentations, each with customized settings for quality, color, and paper type. This would save time and ensure optimal results for different printing needs."
