    "**Interactive Hanger System for Retail Stores**: Design a clothes hanger that incorporates interactive technology, such as RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags or NFC (Near Field Communication) chips. These tags can communicate with store computers or mobile apps to provide customers with product information, pricing, availability, and even customer reviews directly on their smartphones. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the need for printed labels and manual tagging.",
    "**Sustainable Hangers Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a line of clothes hangers made entirely from recycled materials like plastic bottles, reclaimed wood, or repurposed metal. These hangers could be designed in various shapes and sizes to accommodate different clothing items while reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Additionally, they could feature eco-friendly coatings or finishes that are biodegradable or have low chemical emissions.",
    "**Adjustable Hangers for All Sizes**: Develop a set of hangers that can adjust to different sizes and weights, making them suitable for all types of garments. The hangers could use an internal mechanism that allows them to expand or contract based on the size of the item being hung. This would prevent overloading or bending of the hangers, which can damage clothes, and ensure that each garment is supported safely and comfortably.",
    "**Smart Hangers for Closet Organization**: Integrate smart features into the design of the hangers, such as LED lights, temperature sensors, or humidity indicators. These features could help users monitor the condition of their clothing and make adjustments to their closet environment to extend the life of their garments. For example, LED lights could turn on when the door to the closet is opened, guiding users to their desired items. Temperature and humidity sensors could alert users if conditions are not optimal for storing certain fabrics.",
    "**Ergonomic Hangers for Back Pain Relief**: Design clothes hangers that incorporate ergonomic principles to reduce back strain for those who hang up large quantities of clothes daily, such as dry cleaners or laundry service providers. The hangers could feature curved hooks that distribute weight more evenly across the garment, reducing pressure points on shoulders and arms. Additionally, they could include adjustable tension settings to accommodate various clothing weights and sizes, providing a comfortable and stress-free experience for workers handling heavy loads."
