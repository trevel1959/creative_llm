    "Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience where users are placed in a room with a rubber hand. The user will wear a VR headset and be able to see their real hand on one side of their body and the rubber hand on the other. The user will be able to interact with the virtual objects in the room using their real hand, but the rubber hand will also be able to move and interact with the virtual objects. This will create a dissociation between the user's real hand and their rubber hand, allowing them to experience a sense of ownership and agency over the rubber hand.",
    "Sensory Deprivation Tank: Create a sensory deprivation tank where users can float in a tank of water with a rubber hand. The tank will be designed to completely isolate the user from any external sensory input, allowing them to focus solely on their body and the sensations of the rubber hand. The user will be able to manipulate the rubber hand using their real hand, creating a sense of connection and control.",
    "Mirrored Room: Create a room with mirrors on all walls, floor, and ceiling. The room will be completely mirrored, creating an infinite reflection of the user's body and the rubber hand. The user will be able to move around the room and see their real hand and the rubber hand reflected in every direction. This will create a disorienting and confusing experience, blurring the lines between the user's real hand and the rubber hand.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Create an interactive art installation where users can manipulate a large rubber hand using sensors and motors. The installation will be designed to create a sense of connection between the user and the rubber hand, allowing them to manipulate it in a way that feels natural and intuitive. The installation will also include a mirror or a large screen displaying the user's real hand, creating a sense of synchronization between the two.",
    "Virtual Reality Game: Create a virtual reality game where users play as a character with a rubber hand. The game will be designed to create a sense of immersion and agency over the rubber hand, allowing users to manipulate it and interact with the virtual environment in a way that feels natural and intuitive. The game will also include puzzles and challenges that require the user to use their real hand"
