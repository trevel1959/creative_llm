    "**Stapler-Integrated Bookmarks**: Design a stapler that can also serve as a bookmark. The idea is to have a small, retractable clip on the side of the stapler that you can use to mark your place in a book. When you're done reading, simply press the clip into the page and then staple the top of the book. This way, the reader doesn't need to worry about losing their spot or using sticky notes.",
    "**Smart Stapler with NFC Technology**: Develop a stapler that incorporates Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Users can tap their smartphone against the stapler to send a message to the device, such as a reminder for when to replace the staples or to check the ink level in the printer. The stapler could also sync with a user's calendar to remind them of important dates or meetings.",
    "**Ergonomic Stapler for People with Hand Pain**: Design a stapler that has a larger, more ergonomic handle to accommodate users with arthritis or other conditions that cause hand pain. The design could include a softer grip material, a contoured shape, and a slightly larger size to make it easier for individuals to hold and use. Additionally, the stapler could have a mechanism to reduce the force needed to staple, further alleviating strain on the userâ€™s hands.",
    "**Auto-Stapling Stapler for Convenience**: Create a stapler that automatically staples documents after the user presses a button. This could be particularly useful in office settings where speed and efficiency are crucial. The stapler would detect when a stack of paper is placed on its base and automatically staples the top sheet before moving on to the next document. This could save time and effort for busy professionals.",
    "**Sustainable Stapler Made from Recycled Materials**: Develop a stapler made entirely from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or cardboard. This not only reduces waste but also promotes environmental responsibility. The design could focus on simplicity and functionality while ensuring that the stapler is durable and reliable. Additionally, the packaging could be designed to be reusable or recyclable, further reducing the product's environmental impact."
