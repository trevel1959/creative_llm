    "**Braille Audio Reader**: Create a device that reads out Braille text aloud in real-time using advanced speech synthesis technology. This would be especially helpful for the visually impaired to quickly understand and interpret written materials they encounter daily, like signs, receipts, or printed documents.",
    "**Interactive Braille Notetaker**: Design a portable device that allows the visually impaired to take notes, dictate audio recordings, and receive immediate Braille output. The device could also include features like voice-to-text conversion, allowing users to transcribe spoken words into Braille instantly.",
    "**Enhanced Smart Canes**: Develop smart canes that incorporate ultrasonic sensors, infrared cameras, and GPS tracking. These canes would not only help guide the user through their environment but also provide auditory descriptions of surroundings (like obstacles, directions, and nearby landmarks) in real-time.",
    "**Virtual Reality Accessibility Platform**: Build a VR platform specifically designed for the visually impaired, offering immersive experiences that can simulate various environments (like museums, historical sites, or everyday settings). The platform would allow users to navigate these virtual spaces using tactile feedback and audio cues, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of different environments.",
    "**Emotional Sensory Feedback System**: Create a wearable technology that uses vibrations, temperature changes, and scent emissions to provide sensory feedback about emotions or situations. For example, if someone is in danger, the system might vibrate more intensely or emit a specific scent to alert the user without relying on visual cues. This could be particularly useful in unpredictable environments where visual signals are unreliable."
