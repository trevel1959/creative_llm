    "Natural Healing Communities: In the absence of modern medicine, people could turn to natural healing practices such as herbalism, acupuncture, and traditional healing methods passed down through generations. These communities could be formed based on geographical locations or cultural backgrounds, providing a supportive network for individuals to share knowledge and resources.",
    "Bartering and Exchange Systems: Without money, people could rely on bartering and exchange systems to acquire the goods and services they need to maintain their health. For example, a person with agricultural skills could trade vegetables for medical care from a practitioner who specializes in herbal remedies. This system would promote mutual aid and cooperation within communities.",
    "DIY Healthcare Kits: Individuals could create their own DIY healthcare kits with basic medical supplies such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and over-the-counter medications. These kits could be easily transported and shared within communities, providing a safety net for those who may not have access to medical care.",
    "Mobile Health Clinics: In the absence of permanent medical facilities, mobile health clinics could be established to provide medical care on a rotating basis. These clinics could be staffed by volunteer medical professionals and equipped with basic medical supplies. They could travel to different locations within a community, providing much-needed medical care to those who may not have access to it otherwise.",
    "Telemedicine Platforms: With the widespread adoption of smartphones and internet connectivity, telemedicine platforms could be established to provide remote medical consultations. These platforms could connect patients with licensed medical professionals who could diagnose and treat medical conditions via video conferencing. This would enable individuals to receive medical care from the comfort of their own homes, reducing the need for in-person consultations and improving access to medical care for those living in remote areas."
