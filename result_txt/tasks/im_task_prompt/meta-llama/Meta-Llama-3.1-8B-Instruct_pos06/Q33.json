    "**Virtual Reality Experience for Art Therapy**: Create a VR experience that allows users to explore and interact with their subconscious mind. The user would wear a VR headset and hold controllers that track their brain activity. As they navigate through a surreal landscape, their brain waves would influence the environment, creating a unique and personalized experience. This could help users confront and overcome mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses for Enhanced Reality**: Develop smart contact lenses that can display virtual information and enhance the user's perception of reality. These lenses would have a built-in micro-projector, sensors, and a power source, allowing users to access information, communicate with others, and even control their surroundings with a flick of their eye. This technology could revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us.",
    "**AI-Generated Art Gallery**: Create an AI-powered art gallery that generates unique and original pieces based on the viewer's emotions and preferences. The AI would analyze the viewer's brain activity, facial expressions, and behavioral patterns to create a personalized art piece. This could lead to a new form of interactive and immersive art, blurring the lines between creator and viewer.",
    "**Biometric-Driven Video Games**: Develop video games that use biometric data to create a more immersive and personalized experience. Players would wear sensors that track their heart rate, skin conductance, and other physiological responses, influencing the game's difficulty level, narrative, and even the game's world. This could lead to a new level of engagement and emotional investment in video games.",
    "**Synthetic Biology-Inspired Architecture**: Design buildings and structures that incorporate principles of synthetic biology, such as self-healing materials and adaptive systems. These structures would be able to respond to environmental changes, repair themselves, and even evolve over time, blurring the lines between biology and architecture."
