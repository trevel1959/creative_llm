The wax tablet could be erased and reused multiple times, making it a sustainable option.",

This method would involve tattooing words or symbols onto the skin, creating a permanent record of information. This could be a creative way to preserve memories, ideas, or messages, especially for those who value permanence and individuality.",
    "Use the human body as a canvas: Another option would be to use the human body as a canvas for writing.
