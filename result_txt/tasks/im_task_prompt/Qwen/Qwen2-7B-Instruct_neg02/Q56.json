    "**Innovative Bicycle Bell Design:** Create a bicycle bell that incorporates a unique design concept. This could be an aesthetically pleasing, eco-friendly bell made from recycled materials, or a high-tech bell that uses LED lights to create different patterns when pressed. The bell could also include sound customization options for users to adjust the pitch and volume according to their preferences.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell with Augmented Reality:** Develop a bicycle bell that utilizes augmented reality technology. When the bell is rung, it can display messages or animations on a user's smartphone screen. These messages could be fun, educational, or serve as safety reminders, such as \"Stop and Look\" or \"Be Careful.\" This adds an interactive element to the traditional bell usage.",
    "**Vibration-Enhanced Bicycle Bell:** Design a bicycle bell that combines sound with vibration feedback. The bell would vibrate in different patterns based on the type of alert or message it is conveying. For example, a low vibration could indicate a minor warning, while a higher vibration might signal an urgent situation. This provides an additional sensory cue for riders and potential recipients.",
    "**Smart Bicycle Bell with Voice Recognition:** Implement a smart bicycle bell that includes voice recognition technology. Riders can customize commands (e.g., \"Beep\", \"Ring\", \"Chime\") through a mobile app, allowing them to activate the bell without physically pressing it. The app could also track usage patterns, suggest personalized settings, and integrate with other smart devices like lights or locks.",
    "**Wireless Bicycle Bell with Bluetooth Connectivity:** Create a wireless bicycle bell that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone. The bell allows users to control its volume, tone, and even set custom alerts for specific scenarios. For instance, if the rider gets too close to a pedestrian zone, the bell automatically changes its tone to alert nearby pedestrians. The smartphone app could also display the battery level, track usage history, and provide maintenance reminders."
