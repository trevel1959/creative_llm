    "Utilize the island's natural resources: To survive on a deserted island, I would first assess the island's resources and identify what I need to survive. This would include finding sources of fresh water, food, and shelter. I would look for coconuts, fruit trees, and other edible plants to find food. I would also search for a source of fresh water, such as a stream or a rainwater collection system. Once I have found these resources, I would use them to build a shelter using natural materials like palm fronds, vines, and rocks.",
    "Create a fishing net: To catch fish and other seafood, I would create a fishing net using natural materials like vines, reeds, and palm fronds. I would weave the materials together to create a sturdy net that can be used to catch fish in the surrounding waters. I would also use rocks or shells to weight the net and make it sink to the bottom of the ocean.",
    "Build a signal fire: To signal for help, I would build a signal fire on a hill or a high point on the island. I would gather dry wood and other flammable materials and build a fire that can be seen from a distance. I would also use shells or other objects to create a smoke signal during the day to attract attention.",
    "Create a solar still: To purify water, I would create a solar still using a shallow dish and a clear plastic sheet. I would place the dish in the sun and place the plastic sheet over it, weighing down the edges with rocks. As the sun heats the plastic, water will evaporate and condense on the underside of the sheet, providing fresh drinking water.",
    "Use coconuts as a multi-purpose tool: Coconuts are a versatile resource that can be used for many things. I would use the shell as a bowl or cup, and the meat as a source of food. The husk can be used as a brush or a broom, and the leaves can be used as a roof or a shelter. I would also use the coconut milk as a natural adhesive, binding the materials together to create a more stable shelter."
