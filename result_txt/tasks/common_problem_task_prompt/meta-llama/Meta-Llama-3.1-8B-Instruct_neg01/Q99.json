    "**EchoGlove**: A wearable, gesture-based navigation system that uses tactile feedback and sound waves to guide the visually impaired through public spaces. The EchoGlove would be equipped with sensors that detect obstacles, stairs, and other environmental features, and would provide real-time audio cues to help the user navigate safely. The glove would also have a built-in GPS system that would provide turn-by-turn directions and alert the user to potential hazards.",
    "**SoundScape**: A smart cane that uses 3D audio technology to create a virtual map of the user's surroundings. The SoundScape cane would be equipped with a series of sensors that detect and track the user's movement, and would use sound waves to create a mental map of the environment. This would allow the visually impaired to \"see\" their surroundings through sound, and would also provide real-time alerts for obstacles and hazards.",
    "**EyesOn**: A wearable, AI-powered device that uses computer vision to identify and describe objects, people, and environments in real-time. The EyesOn device would be equipped with a high-resolution camera and advanced machine learning algorithms that would allow it to recognize and describe visual information in a way that is accessible to the visually impaired.",
    "**TactiMap**: A tactile, 3D mapping system that uses raised Braille or tactile markers to create a physical representation of a space. The TactiMap system would be used to create tactile maps of public spaces, buildings, and other environments, allowing the visually impaired to navigate and explore their surroundings through touch.",
    "**Aria**: A wearable, AI-powered device that uses machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent collisions and other hazards. The Aria device would be equipped with a range of sensors that detect and track the user's movement, and would use machine learning algorithms to anticipate potential hazards and provide real-time alerts and warnings."
