An alien, no taller than a garden gnome, with skin that sparkled like stardust, peered curiously at him. “Greetings, Earthling!” it chirped, its voice a melodic hum. Timmy’s heart raced with excitement. “Can you help me find my spaceship?” it pleaded, pointing to a crumpled silver object stuck in the fence. Together, they freed the craft, which whirred to life with a soft glow. “Thank you, brave human!” the alien exclaimed, before soaring into the sky, leaving behind a single glowing daisy as a token of friendship.",
