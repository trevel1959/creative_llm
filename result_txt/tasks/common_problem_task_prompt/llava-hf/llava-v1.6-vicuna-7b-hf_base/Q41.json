    "Lack of oxygen: Another potential problem is the lack of oxygen. In space, there is no breathable atmosphere, so it is essential to have a reliable and efficient system for providing oxygen to the crew. This can be achieved through the use of life support systems, which can be challenging to design and maintain.",
    "Limited space: Space is a finite resource, and as such, there is only a limited amount of space available for designing and building a spaceship. This can make it difficult to accommodate all the necessary systems and equipment, such as living quarters, life support, engines, and other critical components.",
    "Weight restrictions: The weight of a spaceship is a critical factor, as it affects its overall performance and ability to perform its intended mission. Too much weight can affect the spaceship's maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and overall stability. This can make it challenging to design a spaceship that is both functional and lightweight.",
    "Radiation exposure: Space is filled with radiation, which can be harmful to the crew's health. To minimize the risk of radiation exposure, it is essential to design the spaceship with adequate shielding and protection measures. This can be challenging, as it requires careful consideration of the materials and construction techniques used.",
    "Limited communication: Communication is essential when traveling through space, as it allows the crew to communicate with mission control and receive updates on their location and status. However, the vast distances between planets and stars can make communication difficult, requiring the use of specialized equipment and systems to ensure reliable and efficient communication."
