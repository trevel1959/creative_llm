    "**Eternal Consequences**: With immortality, people would live indefinitely, accumulating wealth, power, and influence over centuries. This could lead to an aristocracy of immortals, with the powerful and wealthy controlling the world's resources and decision-making processes. The consequences could be a widening wealth gap, as the immortals would continue to accumulate wealth and power, while the mortal population would struggle to keep up.",
    "**Overpopulation**: If people lived indefinitely, the global population would continue to grow exponentially, putting a strain on the planet's resources, infrastructure, and ecosystems. This could lead to severe resource depletion, environmental degradation, and social unrest, as the population grows beyond the planet's carrying capacity.",
    "**Loss of Identity and Purpose**: With immortality, people would no longer have a finite lifespan, and their sense of purpose and identity might become disconnected from their mortality. This could lead to a sense of disconnection and meaninglessness, as people struggle to find new reasons to live and contribute to society.",
    "**Psychological Trauma**: Witnessing centuries of history, including the rise and fall of civilizations, empires, and personal relationships, could lead to immense psychological trauma. Immortals might struggle with the weight of accumulated memories, leading to depression, anxiety, and PTSD.",
    "**The End of Progress**: With immortals accumulating knowledge and experience over centuries, they might become stagnant and resistant to change. This could lead to a stagnation of progress, as the immortals become comfortable with the status quo and resistant to new ideas and innovations, hindering human progress and evolution. [/INST] "
