    "**Smart Ink System**: Develop a fountain pen that can detect when the ink is running low and automatically alert the user via a built-in sensor and Bluetooth connectivity. This feature would eliminate the need for manual checks and ensure that the pen is always ready for use.",
    "**Personalized Ink**: Introduce a feature that allows users to upload their favorite colors or patterns to the pen, enabling them to create custom ink blends and designs. This could be achieved through a companion app or a microSD card slot.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a fountain pen with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses a combination of ultrasonic vibrations and gentle airflow to remove dried ink and debris from the nib. This would make maintenance a breeze and extend the life of the pen.",
    "**Adjustable Line Width**: Create a fountain pen with an adjustable line width mechanism, allowing users to switch between fine and broad lines with ease. This feature would be particularly useful for artists and writers who require varying line widths for different projects.",
    "**Integrated Light**: Develop a fountain pen with a built-in light source, such as an LED or a fiber optic light, that illuminates the writing area. This feature would be ideal for users who write in low-light environments or prefer a soft, ambient glow."
