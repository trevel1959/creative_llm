    "Paintbrush that changes colors: The paintbrush could change colors depending on the type of paint it is dipped in, allowing artists to easily switch between different colors without having to stop and change brushes. This would be a game-changer for artists who work with multiple colors and need to switch between them frequently. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Paintbrush with built-in mixing palette: The paintbrush could have a built-in mixing palette that allows artists to mix their colors directly on the brush. This would save time and space, as artists wouldn't need to have a separate mixing palette nearby. The paintbrush could also have different sections for different colors, allowing artists to easily switch between them. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Paintbrush with adjustable bristles: The paintbrush could have bristles that can be adjusted to different lengths, allowing artists to control the amount of paint applied to the canvas. This would be especially useful for artists who want to create subtle gradations of color or who work with very thin paint. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Paintbrush with heating/cooling properties: The paintbrush could have heating or cooling properties that allow artists to adjust the temperature of the brush to suit their needs. For example, a heated brush could be used to melt and blend colors, while a cooled brush could be used to create sharp, defined lines. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Paintbrush with augmented reality capabilities: The paintbrush could have augmented reality capabilities that allow artists to see the finished painting in real-time as they work. This could be especially useful for artists who are working on large, complex pieces or who want to experiment with different color combinations. Confidence score: 0.9"
