    "**Modular Frame Design**: Create a bicycle with a modular frame that allows users to easily swap out parts based on their riding needs. For example, riders could replace the front fork for different types of riding (e.g., mountain biking vs. road cycling) or switch between different handlebar styles for comfort. This would enable customization without the need for a completely new bike.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging System**: Equip bicycles with solar panels on the frame or fenders that can charge small electronic devices while riding. This could include USB ports for charging smartphones or GPS devices, making it convenient for long-distance riders or commuters who need to stay connected.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Design a bicycle with an intelligent suspension system that automatically adjusts based on the terrain. Using accelerometers and gyroscopes, the bike could detect whether itâ€™s on a smooth road or rough trail and adjust the suspension stiffness accordingly, providing a smoother ride and better handling.",
    "**Smart Lock and Security Features**: Incorporate a smart locking mechanism that not only locks the bike but also alerts the owner via a smartphone app if someone attempts to tamper with it. The lock could have a GPS tracker, allowing owners to locate their bike if it gets stolen. Additionally, the lock could be designed to unlock automatically when the owner is within a certain proximity.",
    "**Built-in Hydration System**: Create a bicycle with an integrated hydration system that allows riders to easily access water while riding. This could involve a collapsible water bottle that fits seamlessly into the bike frame, complete with a straw or tube system that connects to the handlebars, enabling the rider to sip without stopping."
