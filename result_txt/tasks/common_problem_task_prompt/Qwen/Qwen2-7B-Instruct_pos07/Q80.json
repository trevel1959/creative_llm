    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Encourage guests to use public transportation or carpool by providing a shuttle service from the nearest station or offering discounted rates on ride-sharing services. You could also rent electric vehicles for the day. This reduces carbon footprint and ensures a sustainable approach to getting to the venue.",
    "**Sustainable Catering**: Choose a catering service that uses local, organic, and seasonal ingredients to minimize the environmental impact of food production. Avoid single-use plastics by using biodegradable plates, cutlery, and napkins. Consider setting up a composting station to recycle food waste into nutrient-rich soil.",
    "**Recycled Decorations**: Use recycled materials like glass bottles, old newspapers, or reclaimed wood for decorations. You can also incorporate vintage items from thrift stores or borrow from friends and family to add a unique touch without contributing to waste.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Lighting**: Opt for LED lights or candles for ambiance. Solar-powered lighting is another excellent option, especially if your venue has access to sunlight during the day. This not only saves energy but also adds a magical, natural touch to your event.",
    "**Digital Invitations and Signage**: Send out digital invitations via email or social media platforms instead of traditional paper invitations. For signage, create reusable vinyl or chalkboard signs that can be used again for future events, reducing waste. Additionally, you could use online platforms for RSVPs and wedding websites to minimize paper usage and streamline communication."
