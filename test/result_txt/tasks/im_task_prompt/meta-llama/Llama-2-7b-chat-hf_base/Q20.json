    "A smart coffee maker that learns your preferences and brews your perfect cup: Imagine a coffee maker that uses AI to learn your coffee preferences over time. It could use sensors to track how you like your coffee brewed, what temperature you prefer it at, and even what type of coffee beans you prefer. Based on this data, the coffee maker could automatically adjust its brewing settings to create the perfect cup of coffee for you every time.",
    "A coffee maker that uses voice commands: A coffee maker that allows you to control it with voice commands could revolutionize your morning routine. With just a simple voice command, you could start the brewing process, adjust the temperature, or even select your favorite coffee blend. This would save you time and hassle in the morning, and make it easier to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of coffee.",
    "A coffee maker that grinds the beans in-house: Traditional coffee makers often require you to grind the beans before brewing. But what if the coffee maker could do this for you? A coffee maker that grinds the beans in-house would eliminate the need for an additional grinder, making the brewing process even simpler and more convenient. Plus, you could choose from a variety of grind settings to customize the grind to your preferred coffee maker.",
    "A coffee maker that uses mood lighting: A coffee maker that changes color based on your mood could add a fun and personalized touch to your morning routine. With mood lighting, you could choose a color that matches your mood, such as blue for a relaxing morning or red for a more energizing cup of coffee. This would not only make the coffee maker more visually appealing, but also create a more enjoyable and personalized brewing experience.",
    "A coffee maker that brews coffee on demand: Imagine a coffee maker that can brew a cup of coffee as soon as you need it. With a built-in water tank and heating element, this coffee maker could brew a fresh cup of coffee whenever you want it, without the need for a separate k-cup or pod. This would be especially useful for people who are always on the go and need a quick cup of coffee to start their day"
