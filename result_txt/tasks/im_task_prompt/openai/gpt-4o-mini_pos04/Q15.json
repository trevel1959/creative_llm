    "**Adaptive Ergonomic Design**: Utilizing advanced materials and sensors, this backpack would adjust its shape and weight distribution based on the user's posture and the load it carries. It could use a system of inflatable compartments that expand or contract to ensure optimal comfort, reducing strain on the back and shoulders. The backpack would also provide real-time feedback through a connected app, alerting users when they need to adjust their posture.",
    "**Multi-Functional Modular System**: This backpack would consist of modular compartments that can be easily attached or detached, allowing users to customize the backpack according to their needs. For example, it could include a detachable cooler for picnics, a laptop sleeve, or a hydration pack. Users could mix and match components based on whether they are hiking, commuting, or traveling.",
    "**Built-In Safety Features**: The backpack would include reflective strips for visibility at night, a built-in alarm system that can be activated in case of theft, and a GPS tracker that can be accessed via a smartphone app. This would provide peace of mind for users, especially students or travelers who may be in crowded or unfamiliar areas.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: The backpack could be made from a revolutionary self-cleaning fabric that uses nanotechnology to repel dirt, stains, and odors. When exposed to sunlight, the fabric would activate a photocatalytic process that breaks down grime and bacteria, keeping the backpack looking fresh and clean without the need for frequent washing.",
    "**Integrated Hydration System**: This backpack would feature a built-in hydration reservoir with a flexible tube that allows users to drink hands-free while on the move. The reservoir could be insulated to keep water cool for extended periods, and the backpack would include an easy-to-fill opening for quick refills. Additionally, it could have a filtration system that allows users to fill the reservoir from natural water sources while hiking."
