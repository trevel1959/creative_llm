    "Heat-Sensitive Spatula: Develop a spatula with a heat-sensitive handle that changes color when it reaches a certain temperature, indicating when the food is cooked to the desired doneness. This would eliminate the need for constant checking and reduce the risk of overcooking or undercooking.",
    "Spatula with Built-In Whisk: Incorporate a built-in whisk into the spatula design, allowing users to mix and stir ingredients without needing an additional utensil. This would save time and space in the kitchen, making the spatula a more convenient tool.",
    "Spatula with LED Light: Create a spatula with an integrated LED light that illuminates the cooking surface, making it easier to see what you're cooking, especially when working in low-light environments. This would be especially useful for evening cooking or when cooking in a dimly lit kitchen.",
    "Smart Spatula: Develop a spatula with a built-in sensor that tracks the temperature of the food being cooked, providing real-time updates on the cooking progress. This would ensure that food is cooked to a safe internal temperature, reducing the risk of foodborne illness.",
    "Collapsible Spatula: Design a spatula that can be collapsed and stored in a small space, making it easy to transport and take on the go. This would be ideal for camping trips, picnics, or for those who live in small kitchens."
