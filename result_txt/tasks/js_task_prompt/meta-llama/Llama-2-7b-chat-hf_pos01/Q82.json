    "Self-healing properties: The new plant species, called \"Regenera,\" would have the ability to repair and heal itself from any damage or injury. This would be achieved through a unique combination of bioactive compounds and a specialized cellular structure that enables efficient cell repair. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Air purification: Regenera would have large, flat leaves that are covered in tiny hairs, which would capture and break down pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. The plant would also produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, further purifying the air. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Edible fruit: Regenera would produce a sweet and nutritious fruit that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The fruit would be a unique shape and color, making it easy to identify and attractive to animals that help disperse the seeds. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Underground storage: Regenera would have a unique underground storage system that allows it to store water and nutrients during times of drought or low light conditions. This would enable the plant to survive in harsh environments and recover quickly when conditions improve. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Symbiotic relationships: Regenera would have the ability to form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as fungi or bacteria, which would help the plant access nutrients and protect it from pests and diseases. This would create a mutually beneficial relationship that enhances the overall health and resilience of the plant. Confidence score: 0.9"
