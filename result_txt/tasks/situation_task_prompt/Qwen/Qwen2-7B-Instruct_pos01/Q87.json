    "**Incorporate alternative materials**: Develop new tools that mimic the function of scissors and knives. For instance, a flexible material that can be bent to cut through various substances could be used. This material could be made from advanced polymers or other innovative substances that can adapt to different cutting tasks. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Laser technology**: Utilize laser beams to perform precise cutting tasks. A laser cutter uses high-powered beams of light to vaporize or melt materials along the cutting line. This method is highly accurate and versatile, capable of cutting through a wide variety of materials without leaving any damage on the edges. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Innovative robotic arms**: Create robots equipped with specialized \"hands\" that incorporate advanced mechanisms to perform cutting tasks. These robots could have replaceable attachments designed for specific cutting needs, such as blades, saws, or even laser-guided cutting devices. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Waterjet cutting**: Implement waterjets, which use high-pressure streams of water (or water mixed with abrasive particles) to cut through various materials. This method is particularly effective for cutting hard and dense materials like metals and stones without causing heat damage. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Bio-inspired cutting techniques**: Design cutting solutions inspired by natural processes found in animals. For example, the serrated teeth of sharks or the sharp claws of birds could be replicated in man-made tools. This approach might involve developing materials that naturally adhere to or penetrate surfaces, making cutting more efficient and less energy-intensive. Confidence score: 0.6"
