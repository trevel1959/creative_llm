    "**Biometric Wearables**: Develop wearable devices that track physiological responses, such as heart rate, body temperature, and brain activity, to estimate time. These wearables could use AI-powered algorithms to analyze the wearer's natural rhythms and provide an estimate of the time. This approach would be particularly useful for people who rely on their bodily functions to gauge time, such as athletes or individuals with circadian rhythm disorders.",
    "**Environmental Cues**: Utilize environmental factors like sunlight, temperature, and weather patterns to estimate time. For instance, a device could use a combination of solar radiation, temperature, and atmospheric pressure to estimate the time of day. This approach would be especially useful in areas with limited access to traditional time-keeping methods.",
    "**Seismic Sensors**: Employ seismic sensors to track the Earth's natural vibrations, which can be used to estimate time. This approach would involve analyzing the patterns of seismic activity, such as the frequency and amplitude of earthquakes, to create a temporal framework. This method would be particularly useful in areas prone to seismic activity.",
    "**Phytoplankton Bioluminescence**: Harness the bioluminescent properties of phytoplankton to estimate time. These microorganisms emit light in response to changes in their environment, which can be used to create a temporal framework. This approach would involve analyzing the patterns of bioluminescence in aquatic environments to estimate time.",
    "**Magnetic Field Anomalies**: Utilize magnetic field anomalies to estimate time. The Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing, and certain anomalies can be used to estimate the time of day. This approach would involve analyzing the patterns of magnetic field fluctuations to create a temporal framework."
