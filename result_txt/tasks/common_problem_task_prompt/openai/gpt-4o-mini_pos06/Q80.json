    "**Sustainable Catering**: Finding a caterer who sources local, organic, and seasonal ingredients can be difficult. Additionally, some caterers may use non-biodegradable packaging or produce excessive food waste. Couples can address this by researching and interviewing caterers who specialize in sustainable practices, ensuring they offer composting options and plan a menu that minimizes waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Many wedding dresses and suits are made from non-sustainable materials and produced in ways that harm the environment. Couples should consider renting attire, purchasing second-hand, or choosing designers who use sustainable fabrics and ethical production methods. This not only reduces waste but also supports eco-conscious businesses.",
    "**Invitations and Stationery**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples can opt for digital invitations or choose recycled paper and eco-friendly inks for their printed materials. They might also consider using plantable invitations that can be grown into flowers or herbs after the wedding, promoting sustainability even after the event.",
    "**Transportation**: Guests traveling to the wedding venue can lead to a significant carbon footprint. To address this, couples can arrange group transportation, such as buses or shuttles, to minimize individual car use. They could also encourage carpooling or provide information on public transportation options to reduce emissions.",
    "**Decor and Flowers**: Many wedding decorations and floral arrangements are sourced from unsustainable practices, contributing to environmental degradation. Couples can choose locally grown, seasonal flowers or even potted plants that guests can take home afterward. For decor, they might consider renting items or using biodegradable materials, reducing waste and supporting local artisans."
