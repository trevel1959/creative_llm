    "**Cloud Reflectors**: Create a network of large, lightweight, reflective drones that hover in the atmosphere. These drones would be equipped with solar panels and mirrors designed to capture and reflect sunlight down to the surface. By adjusting their positions based on the cloud cover, they could maximize the amount of light reaching the ground, effectively creating “sunlight zones” for outdoor activities and agriculture.",
    "**Light Harvesting Skyscrapers**: Design skyscrapers with integrated light-harvesting technology that uses bioluminescent materials and solar concentrators. These buildings would capture ambient light and convert it into usable energy while providing a soft glow during cloudy days. The bioluminescent materials could also be used in public spaces, creating an enchanting atmosphere that mimics the warmth of sunlight.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Therapy Pods**: Establish public light therapy pods in urban areas where people can go to experience simulated sunlight. These pods would be equipped with full-spectrum light therapy lamps that replicate the effects of natural sunlight, helping to improve mood and combat seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The pods could be designed as relaxing spaces with comfortable seating, soothing sounds, and aromatherapy to create a holistic experience.",
    "**Wearable Sunlight Simulators**: Invent wearable devices that emit artificial sunlight. These devices could be designed as lightweight, stylish accessories like bracelets or pendants that use LED technology to simulate sunlight exposure. They would be programmed to adjust the intensity and spectrum of light based on the user’s needs, helping to regulate mood and energy levels throughout the day.",
    "**Light-Infused Architecture**: Create buildings with innovative architectural designs that incorporate light wells and atriums. These structures would feature large, strategically placed windows and reflective surfaces to maximize any available natural light. By using advanced materials that filter and diffuse light, these buildings could create bright, inviting spaces that feel warm and sunny, even on the cloudiest days."
