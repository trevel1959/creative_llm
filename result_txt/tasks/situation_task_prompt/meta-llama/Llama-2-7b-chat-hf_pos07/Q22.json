    "Floating Transportation: With all roads disappearing, you could utilize the power of levitation to create a transportation system that floats above the ground. This could involve the development of specialized hovercrafts or magnetic levitation trains that can transport people and goods with ease.",
    "Underground Tunnels: If roads are no longer an option, you could explore the vast network of underground tunnels and caverns that exist beneath your town or city. These hidden passageways could be repurposed as transportation routes, allowing people to move around without having to rely on the surface.",
    "Airships: In a world without roads, airships could become the primary mode of transportation. These massive vessels could be powered by wind, solar, or even nuclear energy, and could transport people and goods across long distances with ease.",
    "Waterways: Rivers, lakes, and coastal areas could become the new highways, with boats and ships taking the place of cars and trucks. This could involve the development of specialized watercraft, such as hydrofoils or submersibles, that can navigate the waterways with ease.",
    "Personal Teleportation Devices: With the disappearance of roads, you could invest in personal teleportation devices that allow you to instantly transport yourself from one location to another. These devices could use advanced quantum technology to dematerialize and rematerialize your body at a different location, making it possible to travel vast distances in an instant."
