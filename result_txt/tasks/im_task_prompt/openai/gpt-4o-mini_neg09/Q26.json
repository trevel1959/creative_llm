    "**Self-Cleaning Trash Can**: This trash can would incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism using UV light or a steam-cleaning feature.

This would be particularly useful in kitchens or areas where food waste is disposed of, promoting hygiene and reducing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "**Compacting Trash Can**: A compacting trash can that uses a simple mechanical or battery-operated mechanism to compress waste down into smaller volumes. This would allow users to fit more waste into the can before needing to empty it, reducing the frequency of trips to the curb. It could be designed with a user-friendly interface that lets you know when the can is full and ready to be emptied.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can with Biodegradable Liners**: A trash can that comes with specially designed biodegradable liners made from plant-based materials. This would encourage users to dispose of their waste in an environmentally friendly manner. The can could also feature a compartment for compostable waste, promoting organic recycling and reducing landfill contributions.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can with Reward System**: This trash can would be equipped with a touch screen interface that engages users in a fun way. Users could scan items before throwing them away, and the can would provide instant feedback on whether itâ€™s recyclable or not. For every correct disposal, users could earn points redeemable for discounts at local businesses or community services, encouraging responsible waste disposal and recycling habits.",
    "**Multi-Functional Trash Can**: A trash can that doubles as a small garden composter. This can would have a separate compartment where users can deposit organic waste. The can would utilize aeration and a small motor to mix the waste, speeding up the composting process. Users could then use the finished compost in their gardens, promoting a circular economy approach to waste management."
