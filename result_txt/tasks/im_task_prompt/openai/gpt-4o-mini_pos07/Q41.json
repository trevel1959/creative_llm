    "**Adjustable Wheel Base**: Create a skateboard with an adjustable wheel base that allows riders to change the distance between the front and rear wheels. This feature would enable skaters to customize their ride for different stylesâ€”shorter for tricks and street skating, and longer for cruising and stability. The adjustment mechanism could be as simple as a locking lever or a more sophisticated motorized system controlled via an app.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Skateboard**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. The skateboard could also feature biodegradable grip tape and non-toxic finishes. This initiative would not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also raise awareness about sustainability in sports equipment.",
    "**Magnetic Rail System for Tricks**: Introduce a skateboard that includes a built-in magnetic rail system along the bottom of the board. Riders could attach and detach magnetic rails that can be used for grinding and performing tricks. These rails could come in various shapes and sizes, allowing for customization and new trick possibilities, encouraging creativity in skateboarding.",
    "**LED Light-Up Deck**: Design a skateboard with an integrated LED lighting system within the deck that changes colors based on the rider's speed or tricks performed. This feature could enhance visibility during night skating and add an element of fun and personalization. Riders could choose different lighting patterns and colors through an app, making their skateboard truly unique.",
    "**Modular Skateboard Components**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable components, such as decks, wheels, and trucks. This modular design would allow riders to easily swap parts based on their skating style or preferences. For example, a rider focused on street skating could choose a more flexible deck and softer wheels, while a downhill rider could opt for a stiffer deck and harder wheels."
