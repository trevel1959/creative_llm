    "**The Universal Sharing Rule**: Establish a global rule where everyone has to share at least 10% of their income with those in need. This could be done through a centralized platform or community-led initiatives. The idea is to create a culture of generosity and interconnectedness, fostering a sense of responsibility and empathy among individuals. By doing so, we can reduce income inequality, alleviate poverty, and promote a more equitable society.",
    "**The Time Banking System**: Introduce a global system where people can exchange time and skills instead of money. For every hour of work or service provided, individuals would receive an hour of credit, which they could use to access services or skills from others. This would promote a culture of mutual support, skill-sharing, and community engagement, ultimately leading to a more resilient and resourceful society.",
    "**The Global Education Exchange**: Establish a rule where every individual has the right to access free, high-quality education, regardless of their background or location. This could be achieved through online platforms, community-led initiatives, or partnerships with educational institutions. The goal is to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and critical thinking, leading to a more informed and engaged global citizenry.",
    "**The Sustainable Living Mandate**: Implement a global rule that requires individuals, businesses, and governments to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint. This could involve setting targets for renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting eco-friendly technologies. By doing so, we can mitigate the effects of climate change, preserve natural resources, and create a healthier environment for future generations.",
    "**The Intergenerational Time Capsule**: Establish a global rule where every individual has to contribute to a collective time capsule, which would be opened at a designated future date (e.g., 100 years from now). This could be done through writing letters, creating art, or recording stories about their lives, experiences, and hopes for the future. The idea is to create a shared human history, fostering empathy, understanding, and a sense of connection across generations and cultures. By doing so, we can build a more compassionate and inclusive world, where the past informs the present and shapes a better future. [/INST] "
