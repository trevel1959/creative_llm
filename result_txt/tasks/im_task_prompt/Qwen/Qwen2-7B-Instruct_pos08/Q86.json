    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design Challenge**: Design a wheelchair that incorporates smart technology, such as sensors that can detect changes in terrain or obstacles, and adjust accordingly. The design should also include an AI-powered navigation system that guides the user through various environments, ensuring safety and efficiency. Additionally, the wheelchair could feature a virtual reality interface, allowing users to experience different environments virtually before attempting them physically.",
    "**Accessible Outdoor Adventure Challenge**: Create a series of adventure activities tailored specifically for individuals using wheelchairs. This could involve developing accessible hiking trails, rock climbing ramps, and even water sports equipment. Each activity would be designed with safety measures in mind, ensuring that participants can enjoy the outdoors without compromising their comfort or ability to engage fully.",
    "**Ergonomic Wheelchair Customization Challenge**: Develop a platform that allows wheelchair users to customize their chairs according to their specific needs and preferences. This could include adjustable armrests, seat depths, backrest angles, and various seating options like air-filled cushions or gel inserts. By providing customization options, the platform aims to enhance user comfort and reduce the risk of injuries associated with prolonged sitting.",
    "**Remote Assistance and Training Challenge**: Create an online platform that offers virtual training sessions for wheelchair users on how to navigate challenging terrains or perform daily tasks more efficiently. The platform could feature interactive videos, live coaching sessions, and a community forum where users can share tips, experiences, and advice. Additionally, it could incorporate augmented reality (AR) elements, allowing users to practice movements and techniques in real-time within their own environment.",
    "**Sustainable Wheelchair Production Challenge**: Develop a process for producing wheelchairs using sustainable materials and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. This could involve sourcing eco-friendly components, utilizing renewable energy sources in production facilities, and designing chairs that are easily disassembled and recyclable. By promoting sustainability, this initiative not only addresses the immediate needs of wheelchair users but also contributes to a more environmentally conscious society."
