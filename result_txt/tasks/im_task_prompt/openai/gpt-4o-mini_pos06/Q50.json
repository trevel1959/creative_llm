    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Enhance smartphones with built-in health monitoring tools that go beyond standard fitness tracking. This could include advanced sensors that can measure blood pressure, glucose levels, or even hydration status. The phone could then provide real-time health insights, alerts for potential health issues, and suggestions for lifestyle adjustments, making it a comprehensive health companion.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular smartphone that allows users to customize and upgrade individual components such as the camera, battery, or processor. This could reduce electronic waste and extend the lifespan of the device, as users can simply replace or upgrade parts instead of buying a new phone. Additionally, it would empower users to tailor their devices to their specific needs and preferences.",
    "**Holographic Display**: Introduce a holographic display feature that allows users to project 3D images or videos from their smartphones. This could be used for everything from gaming to virtual meetings, providing an immersive experience. Users could interact with holograms using gestures, creating a more engaging and dynamic way to use their devices.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Upgrade the smartphone’s virtual assistant with advanced AI capabilities that can predict user needs and automate tasks. For instance, it could learn the user’s routine and suggest optimal times for reminders, schedule meetings, or even suggest meals based on dietary preferences. This would create a seamless integration of technology into daily life, making smartphones not just tools but proactive companions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop smartphones using sustainable and biodegradable materials without compromising performance. This could include plant-based plastics, recycled metals, and other eco-friendly resources. Alongside this, a take-back program could be implemented where users can return old devices for recycling, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impact."
