    "\"What if we used sound waves to control the vehicle's movement? By manipulating the frequency and intensity of these waves, we could steer the car in any direction we desire.\"",
    "\"Why not create a virtual reality world inside the car? We could drive around in a simulated environment that feels just like the real thing, but without the need for a physical steering wheel.\"",
    "\"Imagine if the steering wheel was replaced by a touch screen interface. We could use gestures and taps to control the vehicle's movements, making driving feel like a game rather than a chore.\""
