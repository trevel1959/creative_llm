    "Sun Dials: One way to keep track of time without clocks or watches would be to use sundials. Sundials are devices that use the sun's shadow to measure time. They are simple and easy to use, and can be built using basic materials like wood or stone. All you need to do is place the sundial in a sunny spot and wait for the shadow to move. The length of the shadow will indicate the time of day.",
    "Water Clocks: Another way to keep track of time without clocks or watches would be to use water clocks. Water clocks, also known as clepsydras, measure time by the flow of water from one container to another. The amount of time it takes for the water to flow from one container to another will indicate the time. Water clocks are accurate and can be built using simple materials like clay or stone.",
    "Fire Clocks: Fire clocks are another way to keep track of time without clocks or watches. Fire clocks measure time by the burning of a fuel, such as wood or coal. The amount of time it takes for the fuel to burn will indicate the time. Fire clocks are simple and easy to use, and can be built using basic materials like a pot and a stick.",
    "Shadow Sticks: Shadow sticks are a fun and creative way to keep track of time. Shadow sticks are two sticks of equal length, one of which is marked with a notch or a line. The other stick is placed in a sunny spot, and the shadow of the unmarked stick will move as the sun moves. By matching the position of the shadow stick with the marked stick, you can tell the time.",
    "Time Balls: Time balls are a unique and interesting way to keep track of time. Time balls are large balls that are suspended from a cord or a wire. The ball is painted with different colors to represent different times of the day. By observing the position of the ball in relation to the sun, you can tell the time. Time balls were used in the past by navigators and astronomers to keep track of time at sea."
