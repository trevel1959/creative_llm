    "Modular prefabricated house: In a world where natural materials like wood and stone are no longer available, the construction industry would have to rely on synthetic materials. One option could be to build a modular prefabricated house using materials like steel, aluminum, and concrete. These materials can be easily transported and assembled on-site, making it easier to construct a house without the need for natural resources.",
    "3D printing: Another option could be to use 3D printing technology to construct a house. This technology allows for the creation of complex structures with minimal waste, making it an environmentally friendly option. The house could be printed layer by layer using a combination of synthetic materials like plastic and metal.",
    "Recycled materials: In a world where natural resources are scarce, it may become necessary to use recycled materials in construction. This could include using recycled plastic, glass, and metal to construct a house. These materials can be easily sourced and processed, making it a sustainable option.",
    "Earthbag construction: Earthbag construction is a technique that uses bags filled with soil or sand to create a strong and durable structure. This technique could be used to construct a house in a world where natural materials are no longer available. The bags could be filled with recycled materials like plastic or metal, making it a sustainable option.",
    "Geodesic dome: A geodesic dome is a type of dome made of lightweight and strong materials like aluminum and steel. These domes can be easily constructed and are highly energy efficient, making them an ideal option for a house in a world where natural materials are no longer available. The dome could be constructed using recycled materials like plastic and metal, making it a sustainable option."
