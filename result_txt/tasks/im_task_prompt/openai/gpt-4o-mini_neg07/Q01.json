    "**Customizable Display Interface**: Create a wristwatch with a modular display that allows users to change the watch face and functionality through interchangeable skins or overlays. This would enable users to switch between different themes, colors, and layouts based on their mood or outfit, making the watch more personal and stylish.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Integrate advanced health sensors that can monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and hydration levels. This watch could sync with a health app to provide insights and alerts for maintaining wellness, making it not just a timepiece but a health companion.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop a wristwatch that connects with AR glasses to provide users with real-time notifications, navigation, and fitness tracking overlays directly in their line of sight. This would enhance the user experience by allowing them to interact with their environment while keeping their hands free.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Notifications**: Instead of standard vibration alerts, this wristwatch could feature customizable haptic feedback patterns for different notifications. Users could set unique vibrations for calls, messages, or reminders, allowing them to discern alerts without looking at the watch, enhancing both privacy and convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design the wristwatch using sustainable materials such as recycled metals, biodegradable plastics, or ethically sourced wood. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a message of sustainability, potentially even featuring a program where customers can return old watches for recycling."
