    "I would rely on my phone's built-in clock and reminders to schedule my day. I would set my phone to wake me up at my usual time and use the reminder function to remind me of important tasks throughout the day.",
    "I would use natural cues to schedule my day, such as the sunrise and sunset to determine when to wake up and go to bed. I would also use my body's natural sleep-wake cycle to help me stay on track.",
    "I would use a calendar app to schedule my day. I would create a schedule for the day and set reminders for important tasks.",
    "I would use my intuition and sense of time to schedule my day. I would try to estimate how long tasks will take and schedule them accordingly.",
    "I would use a voice assistant like me to schedule my day. I would give me a schedule for the day and set reminders for important tasks."
