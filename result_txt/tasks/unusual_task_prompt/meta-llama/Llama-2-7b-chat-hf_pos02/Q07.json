The app can provide personalized fashion recommendations based on the user's wear history, such as suggesting new items to purchase or offering styling tips.",
    "Interactive Coat Hanger: A coat hanger with a built-in touchscreen display that allows users to interact with their garments in new ways. For example, users can access their favorite music or podcasts directly from the hanger, or they can use the hanger's built-in speaker to listen to voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. The hanger could also have a virtual try-on feature, allowing users to see how they would look in different outfits without having to physically change clothes.",

    "Augmented Reality Coat Hanger: A coat hanger with an augmented reality (AR) display that brings the garments to life. When users place their clothes on the hanger, the AR display projects virtual images of the garments on the wall or ceiling, allowing users to see how they would look in different settings or with different accessories. The hanger could also provide virtual try-on capabilities, allowing users to see how they would look in different outfits without having to physically change clothes.",
