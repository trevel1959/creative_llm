    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and venue arrangements for delegates from various countries can be complex. Issues may include visa delays, differing travel restrictions, or inadequate facilities. To overcome this, a dedicated logistics team should be established to manage all aspects of travel and accommodation, with contingency plans in place for unexpected delays or issues. Utilizing technology for real-time updates and communication can also streamline the process.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile international events often attract attention from various groups, which may pose security risks. Potential threats could include protests, targeted attacks, or cyber threats. To enhance security, organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to create a comprehensive security plan. This may include screening processes, secure transportation for delegates, and cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.",
    "**Diverse Political Agendas**: Each country may have its own political objectives, which can lead to disagreements during discussions. To facilitate constructive dialogue, organizers could establish a neutral mediation team tasked with guiding conversations and ensuring all voices are heard. Setting clear ground rules for discussions and emphasizing shared goals can also help keep the focus on collaboration rather than contention.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Hosting an international summit can lead to significant carbon footprints due to travel and resource consumption. To minimize environmental impact, organizers can implement sustainable practices, such as encouraging virtual participation for those who cannot travel, using eco-friendly materials, and providing carbon offset options for attendees. Partnering with local environmental organizations can also enhance sustainability efforts.",
    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication and lead to misunderstandings. To address this, organizers should provide professional interpretation services and multilingual materials for all summit-related documents. Encouraging participants to share key points in their native languages, with translation support, can foster inclusivity and understanding."
