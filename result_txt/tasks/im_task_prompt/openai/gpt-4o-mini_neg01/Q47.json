    "**Multi-Surface Adaptive Brush System**: Create a vacuum cleaner that features a brush system that automatically adjusts its bristle stiffness and angle based on the type of surface being cleaned. For example, softer bristles could be used for hardwood floors to prevent scratches, while stiffer bristles could engage for carpets to remove embedded dirt more effectively.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Design a vacuum cleaner that doubles as an air purifier. While vacuuming, it could also filter and purify the air, capturing allergens, dust, and pet dander. This could be particularly beneficial for households with allergies or asthma, as it would provide a two-in-one cleaning solution.",
    "**Modular Attachments for Specific Tasks**: Introduce a line of modular attachments that can be easily swapped out for specific cleaning tasks. For example, a pet hair attachment with specialized bristles, a hard floor squeegee for wet cleaning, or a high-reach extension for ceiling fans and light fixtures. This would make the vacuum cleaner more versatile and tailored to individual cleaning needs.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Innovate a self-cleaning feature that automatically cleans the vacuum's filters and brushes after each use. This could involve a built-in mechanism that uses a combination of air pressure and vibrations to dislodge dirt and debris, ensuring that the vacuum maintains peak performance without the need for frequent manual maintenance.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Vacuum Cleaner**: Create a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and biodegradable components. It could also feature energy-efficient motors and be designed for easy disassembly to facilitate recycling at the end of its life cycle. Additionally, it could incorporate a refillable cleaning solution system that uses natural ingredients for enhanced cleaning power without harmful chemicals."
