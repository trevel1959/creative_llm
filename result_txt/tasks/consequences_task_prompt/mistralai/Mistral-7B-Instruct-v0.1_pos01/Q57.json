    "Food shortages: With water becoming scarce, agriculture would be severely impacted, leading to a decrease in crop yields and a shortage of food. This could result in higher food prices and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water is already limited.",
    "Economic impact: Industries such as manufacturing, mining, and energy production that rely heavily on water could be severely impacted, leading to a decline in economic output. This could result in job losses and a decrease in overall economic stability.",
    "Health hazards: Without access to clean water, people may be at risk of contracting waterborne illnesses such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. This could lead to an increase in healthcare costs and a decrease in overall public health.",
    "Environmental degradation: Water scarcity could lead to increased competition for water resources, which could result in the depletion of groundwater and surface water sources. This could lead to environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity.",
    "Social unrest: In areas where water scarcity is particularly acute, social tensions could arise as people compete for scarce resources. This could lead to social unrest and even violence, particularly in areas where access to clean water is already limited."
