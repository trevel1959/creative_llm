    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution to ensure enough light during the day without the sun's rays is to use solar-powered lanterns. These lanterns can be charged during the day using solar panels and provide a soft, warm light during the night. They can be placed in various areas of the home or office, providing ample lighting without the need for electricity from the grid.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Another option is to use mirrors to reflect light from other sources. By placing mirrors strategically around the room, the light from lamps, windows, or other sources can be reflected and amplified, creating a brighter and more evenly lit space. This method can be especially effective in smaller spaces where natural light is limited.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Some plants, such as certain species of algae, have the ability to produce their own light. By incorporating these plants into your home or office decor, you can create a natural and sustainable source of light. These plants can be placed near windows or in other areas where they can receive adequate sunlight and produce their glow.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Paint: A creative and fun solution to provide light during the day is to use glow-in-the-dark paint. By painting walls, ceilings, or furniture with this special paint, a soft, blue-green light can be emitted, providing a subtle and unique lighting effect. This method can be especially effective in children's bedrooms or play areas.",
    "Sun-Powered Windows: If the sun doesn't rise, it's unlikely that it will shine through windows. However, there are special windows that can harness the sun's energy even on cloudy days. These windows use a thin layer of liquid crystals that can be oriented to reflect or transmit light, providing a source of natural light even on overcast days. By installing these special windows, you can ensure that your home or office remains well-lit, even without the sun's rays."
