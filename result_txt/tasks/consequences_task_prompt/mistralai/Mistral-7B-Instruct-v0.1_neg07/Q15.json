    "The world would face a major energy crisis: If oil were to run out, it would have a significant impact on global energy production, transportation, and economic systems. This could lead to widespread power outages, shortages of food and water, and increased conflict over resources.",
    "The cost of living would increase: The demand for oil is high, and without it, many industries would be forced to shut down or reduce production. This would lead to higher prices for goods and services, making it more expensive for individuals and families to live.",
    "Alternative energy sources would be developed: The need for oil would drive innovation in alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. This could lead to a more sustainable energy future and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "The global economy would collapse: Oil is a key component of many industries, including transportation, construction, and manufacturing. Without it, the global economy would suffer a major shock, leading to widespread job losses, business failures, and a decline in economic growth.",
    "Governments would have to make difficult decisions: Governments would need to make tough decisions about how to allocate resources and manage their economies without oil. This could lead to changes in trade policies, taxation, and government spending, as well as potential conflicts between countries over resources."
