    "Water Corrosion: The underwater environment is highly corrosive due to the presence of salt and other minerals. This can cause equipment to rust and deteriorate over time, making it difficult to maintain and repair.",
    "Limited Visibility: The water at the bottom of the ocean can be dark and murky, making it difficult for the crew to navigate and observe their surroundings. This can increase the risk of getting lost or disoriented.",
    "Cold Water: The temperature at the bottom of the ocean can be extremely cold, which can cause hypothermia and other cold-related injuries to the crew.",
    "Oxygen Supply: The availability of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean is limited, which can make it difficult to breathe and maintain a safe oxygen level for the crew.",
    "Pressure Changes: The pressure at the bottom of the ocean can change rapidly, which can cause decompression sickness or \"the bends\" if not managed properly."
