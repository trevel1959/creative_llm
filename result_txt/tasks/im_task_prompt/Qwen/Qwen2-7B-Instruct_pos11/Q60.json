    "**Eco-Friendly Towel Subscription Service**: Launch a subscription service that sends eco-friendly towels made from sustainable materials like bamboo, organic cotton, or recycled fibers to customers on a monthly basis. The service could emphasize the environmental benefits of using these towels over conventional ones, such as lower water usage, reduced carbon footprint, and biodegradability. Additionally, the company could plant trees for every subscription purchased, contributing to reforestation efforts and promoting a greener planet."
