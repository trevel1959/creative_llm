The financial planning and management phase is critical to the success of the film. If the budget is blown or underestimated, it can affect production value and limit the director's creative vision.",

Delays in securing these essentials can lead to disruptions and increase the production budget.",
    "**Technical Issues and Obstacles** The technical aspects of filming, such as camera and sound equipment, can present challenges if they malfunction or if the director is not satisfied with the quality. This can force re-shoots, which require additional time and resources.",
    "**Script Changes and Adaptations** Late in the pre-production phase, script changes or adaptations may occur due to various reasons, like actor availability, changes in the director's vision, or test screenings. These changes could delay the production schedule and increase costs.",
    "**Scheduling Conflicts with Actors** High-profile actors are in demand, and scheduling them accordingly can be a challenge. Their conflicting commitments to other films, TV shows, or events can lead to production delays and affect the project's overall success."
