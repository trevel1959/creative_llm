    "**Aesthetic Disputes**: The visual impact of solar panels can be a contentious issue within neighborhoods. Some residents may feel that solar panels detract from the architectural beauty of their homes or the overall aesthetic of the community. This could lead to disputes between neighbors, especially in areas with strict homeowner association rules regarding exterior modifications.",
    "**Electrical Grid Capacity**: The local electrical grid may not be equipped to handle the influx of energy produced by numerous solar panels. If too many homes generate excess energy simultaneously, it could overwhelm the grid, leading to outages or necessitating costly upgrades to the infrastructure. This situation would require careful planning and coordination with utility companies.",
    "**Financial Barriers**: While solar panels can reduce energy costs over time, the initial investment can be a significant barrier for many homeowners. Even with incentives or financing options, some residents may struggle to afford the upfront costs, creating disparities in who can benefit from the solar initiative. This could lead to socio-economic divides within the community.",
    "**Maintenance and Longevity Issues**: Solar panels require maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of the ongoing costs associated with cleaning, repairs, or eventual replacement of panels after their lifespan (typically 25-30 years). This lack of understanding could lead to disillusionment with solar energy and frustration if homeowners face unexpected expenses.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Manufacturing**: The production of solar panels involves mining for raw materials and manufacturing processes that can have significant environmental impacts. If the community does not consider these factors, they may inadvertently contribute to environmental degradation elsewhere, undermining the green intentions of installing solar panels."
