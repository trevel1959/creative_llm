    "**Modular Design**: Create a table with interchangeable components that can be customized based on the userâ€™s needs. For instance, the table could have removable sections that can be added or taken away to accommodate different group sizes or purposes, such as work, dining, or crafting. Each section could also have built-in storage for supplies related to the specific activity.",
    "**Interactive Surface**: Develop a table with a digital touch-sensitive surface that allows users to draw, take notes, or play games directly on the table. This could be paired with an app that saves drawings or notes, allowing for easy sharing and collaboration. The surface could also display interactive games or educational content for children.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light or a specialized coating to eliminate bacteria and stains. This would be particularly useful for dining tables, ensuring hygiene without the need for constant manual cleaning. The table could have a built-in timer for automatic cleaning cycles after meals.",
    "**Adjustable Height and Shape**: Design a table with adjustable height and shape capabilities, allowing it to transform from a dining table to a coffee table or even a standing desk. This versatility would cater to various activities and preferences, making it suitable for both casual and formal settings.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Focus on sustainability by using recycled materials or sustainably sourced wood in the construction of the table. Additionally, incorporate solar panels into the design to power small devices or charge phones, making it an eco-conscious choice for modern households."
