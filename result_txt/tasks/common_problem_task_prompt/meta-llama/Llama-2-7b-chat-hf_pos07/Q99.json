    "Braille Display with Artificial Intelligence: Develop a braille display that can interpret and display digital content, such as emails, messages, and web pages, in real-time. The device would use AI algorithms to recognize and translate text from the user's digital environment, and then raise or lower braille bumps on a display to represent the content. This would enable visually impaired individuals to access and interact with digital information in a more intuitive and efficient manner.",
    "Smart Canes with Sensory Feedback: Create a smart cane that provides sensory feedback to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. The cane would be equipped with sensors that detect obstacles and vibrate or provide haptic feedback to alert the user of potential hazards. The cane could also have a built-in GPS system to help the user navigate unfamiliar areas.",
    "Augmented Reality Magnification Glasses: Develop augmented reality (AR) magnification glasses that can enhance the visual acuity of visually impaired individuals. The glasses would use a see-through display and AI algorithms to magnify objects and text in the user's field of view, while also providing voice-to-text or text-to-speech functionality. This would enable visually impaired individuals to read and interact with printed materials more easily.",
    "Portable Eye-Tracking Device: Create a portable eye-tracking device that can be worn on the user's head or held in their hand. The device would use machine learning algorithms to track the user's eye movements and convert them into digital commands. This would enable visually impaired individuals to interact with digital devices, such as computers or smartphones, without the need for a mouse or touchscreen.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-Powered Personal Assistant: Develop an AI-powered personal assistant that can assist visually impaired individuals with daily tasks and activities. The assistant could be integrated into a smartphone or tablet, and use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to understand and respond to voice commands. The assistant could also provide information on the user's surroundings, such as the time, weather, and nearby points of interest, and offer suggestions for navigating unfamiliar areas."
