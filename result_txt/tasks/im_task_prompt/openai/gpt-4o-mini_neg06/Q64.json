    "**Mood-Based Wake-Up Lighting**: Integrating smart lighting technology, the alarm system could simulate a natural sunrise by gradually increasing the brightness of connected smart bulbs in the user’s room. Additionally, users could choose specific colors or light patterns that match their mood for the day, creating a more uplifting and energizing start.",
    "**Sleep Cycle Analysis**: The alarm system could incorporate advanced sleep tracking technology that analyzes the user’s sleep cycles through wearable devices or bed sensors. By determining the optimal wake-up time during the lightest sleep phase, the system would wake the user feeling more refreshed and less groggy.",
    "**Interactive Morning Routine**: The alarm could be integrated with a smart assistant that guides users through a personalized morning routine. Upon waking, the system could provide reminders for important tasks, suggest breakfast recipes based on dietary preferences, and even offer a brief weather update, making mornings more productive and enjoyable.",
    "**Social Alarm Features**: Users could connect with friends or family members who also use the alarm system. This feature would allow for “wake-up calls” where friends can set alarms for each other, share motivational messages, or even have a group wake-up challenge. It would create a sense of community and accountability in maintaining a healthy sleep schedule.",
    "**Home Security Integration**: The alarm system could be enhanced with home security features, such as monitoring for unusual sounds or movements. If the system detects potential intrusions while the user is asleep, it could wake them with a gentle alert, providing peace of mind and safety without being overly intrusive."
