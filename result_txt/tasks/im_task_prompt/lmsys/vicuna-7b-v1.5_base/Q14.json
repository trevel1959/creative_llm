    "Creating an alarm clock that can be controlled via voice commands would make it more accessible for people with disabilities or those who have trouble using their hands. This could be done through the use of a smart speaker or a dedicated app.",
    "Incorporating a smart assistant, such as Siri or Google Assistant, into the alarm clock would allow users to set multiple alarms, schedule events, and control other smart home devices with ease. This would make the alarm clock a more versatile and useful tool.",
    "Adding a sleep tracking feature to the alarm clock would allow users to monitor their sleep patterns and get more restful sleep. This could be done through the use of sensors that track things like heart rate, breathing, and movement.",
    "Creating an alarm clock that can be worn as a bracelet or necklace would make it more convenient for people who want to keep their alarm clock with them at all times. This could be done through the use of a small, discreet display and a battery or wireless charging option.",
    "Adding a built-in projector to the alarm clock would allow users to set up a virtual alarm clock on any surface, making it easier to see in low light or dark environments. This could be especially useful for people who have trouble seeing or for those who want to create a more immersive alarm clock experience."
