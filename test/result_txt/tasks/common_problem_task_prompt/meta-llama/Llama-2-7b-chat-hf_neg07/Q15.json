    "Edible Landscaping: Incorporate edible plants into your garden design to create a beautiful and functional space. Use herbs, vegetables, and fruit trees to add flavor and nutrition to your outdoor space. Consider using a vertical garden or a \"fruit wall\" to maximize space and create a focal point.",
    "Solar-Powered Irrigation System: Harness the power of the sun to water your garden. Install a solar-powered irrigation system that uses photovoltaic panels to pump water from a nearby source, such as a well or a rainwater collection system, to your garden. This will not only save water but also reduce your carbon footprint.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting System: Collect and store rainwater in a large container or tank to use for irrigation. This will reduce your reliance on municipal water supplies and help to conserve water during times of drought. You can also use a first-flush device to remove debris and contaminants from the water, making it safe for use in your garden.",
    "Composting Toilet: Install a composting toilet in your backyard to reduce your water usage and create a nutrient-rich compost that can be used in your garden. Composting toilets use a natural process to break down waste, eliminating the need for water and producing a valuable resource for your garden.",
    "Living Wall: Create a living wall in your backyard using a variety of plants, such as succulents, herbs, and flowers. Living walls can provide insulation, reduce noise pollution, and add a touch of beauty to your outdoor space. You can also incorporate a trellis or arbor to provide support for climbing plants, such as beans or peas, and create a vertical garden."
