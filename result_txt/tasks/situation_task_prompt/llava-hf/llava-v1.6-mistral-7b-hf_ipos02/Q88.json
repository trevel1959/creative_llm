    "**Underground Tunnels**: Another solution could be the development of an extensive network of underground tunnels. These tunnels would allow for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods, bypassing the impassable roads above ground. They could be powered by a combination of electric and solar energy, making them eco-friendly and sustainable.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Trains**: A third option could be the use of magnetic levitation trains. These trains would hover above the ground, using magnetic forces to propel themselves forward. They could be powered by a combination of electricity and magnetic energy, allowing for high-speed travel without the need for roads.",
    "**Waterways**: If all roads are impassable, waterways could become a primary mode of transportation. This could involve the development of canals and waterways, which could be used for the movement of people and goods. Boats and ships could be used for long-distance travel, while smaller watercraft could be used for local transportation.",
    "**Bicycle Infrastructure**: In areas where roads are impassable, bicycle infrastructure could be expanded. This could involve the development of dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing programs, and the promotion of cycling as a viable mode of transportation.",
    "**Pedestrian Pathways**: Another option could be the development of pedestrian pathways. These pathways could be built above or below ground level, allowing people to travel safely and efficiently without the need for roads. They could be designed to accommodate people with mobility issues, making them accessible to all."
