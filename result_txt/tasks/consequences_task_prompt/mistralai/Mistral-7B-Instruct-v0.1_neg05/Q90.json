    "The first consequence of erasing all world debt would be an immediate boost to the global economy. With less debt burden, people and businesses would have more disposable income to invest in new ventures and growth opportunities. This could lead to increased innovation, job creation, and overall economic prosperity.",
    "The second consequence would be a shift in global power dynamics. Countries with large amounts of debt would lose their ability to leverage their debt as a bargaining chip in international negotiations. This could lead to a more balanced distribution of power and influence among nations.",
    "The third consequence would be a significant reduction in interest rates. With less debt, central banks would have more flexibility to lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and more accessible. This could lead to increased consumer spending, business investment, and economic growth.",
    "The fourth consequence would be a reduction in inequality. Many countries with high levels of debt are also plagued by income inequality. By erasing debt, governments could redistribute wealth more equitably, reducing the gap between the rich and poor.",
    "The fifth consequence would be a shift in government policies. Many countries with high levels of debt have implemented austerity measures to reduce spending and pay down debt. By erasing debt, governments could shift their policies towards more progressive spending, such as investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure."
