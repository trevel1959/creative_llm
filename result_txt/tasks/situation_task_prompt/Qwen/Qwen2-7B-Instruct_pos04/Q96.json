This could include activities like snorkeling, tidepool exploration, or bird watching.",
    "**Soundscapes and Music Festivals**: Utilize the quietness of the beach without sand for immersive sound experiences.

Attendees could also create their own sounds using various instruments or objects found on the beach.",
    "**Cultural Workshops**: Leverage the beach's new setting as a backdrop for cultural workshops. Offer sessions on traditional crafts such as weaving, pottery, or basket making using materials commonly found at the beach. These workshops not only educate participants about different cultures but also provide a unique experience in a non-traditional setting.",
    "**Stargazing and Astronomy Nights**: With the absence of sand, the beach offers an unobstructed view of the night sky. Host astronomy nights with telescopes and educational talks on celestial bodies.
