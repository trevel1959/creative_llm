    "**Sunscreen-Infused Head Wraps**: Create a head wrap that is infused with sunscreen. This fabric would be made from a lightweight, breathable material that not only protects the scalp from UV rays but also contains micro-encapsulated sunscreen that activates with movement. This way, the head wrap would continuously provide sun protection while being fashionable and functional.",
    "**Smart Scalp Monitor**: Develop a wearable device that attaches to the scalp and monitors UV exposure. This smart scalp monitor would alert the user when they are at risk of sunburn and suggest when to reapply sunscreen or seek shade. The device could be paired with a mobile app that tracks sun exposure over time, helping users manage their sun safety effectively.",
    "**DIY Sun Protection Kits**: Create DIY kits that include everything needed to protect a bald head from the sun. The kit could include a high-SPF sunscreen, a stylish cap, and a set of colorful bandanas. The instructions could also provide tips on how to apply sunscreen effectively to the scalp and how to incorporate sun protection into daily routines.",
    "**Sunscreen Spray for Scalp**: Innovate a lightweight, non-greasy sunscreen spray specifically designed for bald heads. This spray would be quick-drying, water-resistant, and formulated to leave no white residue. It could come in a variety of scents and be packaged in a travel-friendly size, making it easy to carry and reapply throughout the day.",
    "**Cooling Scalp Gel**: Develop a gel specifically for the scalp that combines sun protection with a cooling effect. This gel would be infused with soothing ingredients like aloe vera and menthol to provide instant relief from heat while protecting against UV rays. It could be marketed as a refreshing option for outdoor activities, especially during the summer months."
