    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and the influx of visitors can lead to significant environmental degradation. Issues such as increased waste production, water pollution, and habitat destruction may arise. To address these concerns, host cities could implement sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials for construction, promoting public transportation, and creating green spaces around venues to offset carbon emissions.",
    "**Security Threats**: High-profile events like the Olympics can attract not only sports fans but also potential security threats, including terrorism. This can create a complex security environment that requires extensive planning and resources. To counteract this, organizers could collaborate with local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to develop comprehensive security protocols, including surveillance technology and emergency response strategies.",
    "**Cultural Clashes**: The Olympics brings together athletes and spectators from diverse cultures, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. Issues such as differing social norms, language barriers, and cultural insensitivity may arise. To promote inclusivity, host cities could offer cultural training programs for volunteers and staff, ensuring they are equipped to handle diverse situations and promote cross-cultural understanding.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can boost local economies, it can also exacerbate existing economic disparities. Local businesses may be overshadowed by large corporations involved in the event, and residents might face increased living costs due to the influx of tourists. To combat this, organizers could prioritize local businesses in contracts and offer incentives for them to participate in the event, ensuring that economic benefits are more evenly distributed.",
    "**Athlete Well-being**: The pressure to perform at the Olympics can lead to mental health issues among athletes, including anxiety and burnout. This is compounded by the potential for injuries due to the intense competition. To support athlete well-being, organizers could provide mental health resources, such as counseling services and workshops on stress management, ensuring that athletes have access to the support they need."
