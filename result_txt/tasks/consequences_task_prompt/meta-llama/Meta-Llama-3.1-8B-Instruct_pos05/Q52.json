    "**Atmospheric Consequences**: The Earth's rotation is responsible for the Coriolis force, which influences global wind patterns and ocean currents. Without rotation, the atmosphere would become stagnant, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations and severe weather events. This would disrupt global climate patterns, potentially causing widespread droughts or floods.",
    "**Disruption of Natural Cycles**: The Earth's rotation regulates the timing of natural cycles, such as the day-night cycle, tides, and the sleep-wake cycle of living organisms. Without rotation, these cycles would be severely disrupted, affecting the behavior and physiology of plants and animals. This could have a ripple effect throughout entire ecosystems.",
    "**Increased Risk of Asteroid Impacts**: The Earth's rotation helps to deflect asteroids and comets through gravitational interactions. Without rotation, the planet's gravity would be less effective at deflecting these objects, increasing the risk of catastrophic impacts.",
    "**Effects on Human Health**: The lack of rotation would lead to extreme variations in daylight and darkness, disrupting the human circadian rhythm. This could result in widespread sleep disorders, digestive problems, and other health issues. Prolonged exposure to intense sunlight or darkness could also lead to increased rates of skin cancer and other diseases.",
    "**Impact on Satellite Technology**: Many satellites rely on the Earth's rotation to maintain their orbits and communicate with ground stations. Without rotation, these satellites would need to be redesigned or replaced, leading to significant technological and economic challenges. This could disrupt global communication networks, GPS systems, and weather forecasting services. "
