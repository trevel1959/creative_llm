    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Can with Built-in Composting System**: Design a trash can that incorporates a built-in composting system, allowing users to compost food waste and turn it into nutrient-rich fertilizer for their gardens. The can would have separate compartments for recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclable waste, making it easy for users to sort their trash and reduce their environmental impact. The composting system would use microorganisms to break down organic matter, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and creating a valuable resource for gardeners.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with AI-Powered Waste Sorting**: Develop a smart trash can that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to sort waste into different categories, such as recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclable waste. The can would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the type of waste and sort it accordingly. This would help reduce contamination rates and increase the amount of recyclable materials collected.",
    "**Trash Can with Integrated Recycling Station**: Design a trash can that doubles as a recycling station, complete with a built-in recycling sorter and a compartment for collecting recyclables. The can would have a user-friendly interface that guides users through the recycling process, making it easy for them to sort their recyclables and reduce their environmental impact.",
    "**Solar-Powered Trash Can with Energy Harvesting**: Create a trash can that harnesses energy from the sun and converts it into electricity, powering a built-in LED light or other features. The can would have a solar panel on top, which would charge a battery during the day and provide power at night. This would reduce the need for batteries and make the trash can more sustainable.",
    "**Modular Trash Can with Interchangeable Compartments**: Design a modular trash can with interchangeable compartments that can be customized to meet the needs of different users. The can would have a central core with removable and interchangeable compartments for different types of waste, such as recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclable waste. This would make it easy for users to adapt the trash can to their specific needs and reduce waste."
