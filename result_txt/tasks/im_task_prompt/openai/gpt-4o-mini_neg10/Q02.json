    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular bicycle that allows users to customize their ride with interchangeable accessories. For instance, users could easily swap out handlebars, seats, or storage compartments depending on their needsâ€”whether commuting, exercising, or leisurely riding. This system could also include add-ons like a solar-powered battery pack for charging devices on the go or a portable speaker for music while riding.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a bicycle made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled aluminum, that not only reduces environmental impact but also offers unique aesthetics. This bike could feature a sleek, modern design that emphasizes sustainability, potentially incorporating solar panels for powering lights or other accessories. Additionally, a built-in compost bin could allow riders to contribute to local gardening efforts by collecting organic waste during their rides.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker**: Transform the bicycle into a fitness hub by integrating a comprehensive fitness tracker that monitors heart rate, calories burned, distance traveled, and even offers workout suggestions. The data could sync with a companion app, allowing users to set goals, track progress, and participate in challenges with friends. The bike could also provide real-time feedback on riding posture and techniques to enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Introduce an advanced suspension system that automatically adjusts based on the terrain and riding style. This technology would enhance comfort and stability, allowing the bike to adapt seamlessly from city streets to rugged trails. Riders could also have the option to manually adjust settings for a personalized experience, ensuring optimal performance whether they're commuting or mountain biking.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Safety Features**: Equip the bicycle with AR technology that projects essential information onto the rider's field of vision. This could include navigation prompts, speed, distance, and even alerts for approaching vehicles or pedestrians. By using a lightweight visor or smart glasses, riders could stay informed without taking their eyes off the road, enhancing safety and overall riding experience."
