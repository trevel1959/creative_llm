    "Internal Compactness: Optimize the internal organs and bones by compacting them, reducing the overall size of the body. This would allow for a more efficient use of space and resources, as well as enabling easier movement and less wear and tear on the body. Additionally, this could potentially lead to increased lifespan due to reduced stress on the body.",
    "Extensible Limbs: Develop extensible limbs, similar to those of an octopus or an elephant, allowing for greater dexterity and flexibility. This would enable the human body to adapt to a wider range of environments and tasks, making it more versatile and adaptable.",
    "External Energy Storage: Incorporate external energy storage systems, such as small solar panels or fuel cells, into the body. This would allow the body to harness and store energy from its surroundings, enabling it to function more efficiently and for longer periods without the need for food or water.",
    "Self-Healing Mechanisms: Enhance the body's natural healing abilities by incorporating self-healing mechanisms. This could involve the development of regenerative tissues or the ability to repair damaged cells and organs more quickly. This would significantly reduce the risk of injury and illness, as well as increase the overall lifespan of the body.",
    "Implantable Sensors and Devices: Integrate small, implantable sensors and devices into the body, allowing for constant monitoring of vital signs, environmental conditions, and other important data. This would enable early detection of potential health issues and allow for more proactive and personalized healthcare."
