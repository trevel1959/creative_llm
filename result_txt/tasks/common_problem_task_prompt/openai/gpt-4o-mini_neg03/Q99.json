    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Device**: Create a wearable device that uses haptic feedback to communicate information about the surroundings. This device could be worn on the wrist or as a belt and would vibrate in different patterns to indicate the proximity of objects, changes in elevation, or even the presence of other people. By translating visual information into tactile sensations, users could gain a better understanding of their environment without needing to rely on sight.",
    "**Smart Cane with Object Recognition**: Design a smart cane equipped with sensors and a camera that can recognize objects, text, and even faces. The cane could use AI to analyze the environment and provide audio descriptions through a connected smartphone app or built-in speaker. This would not only help users navigate but also enhance their social interactions by identifying people they know in their vicinity.",
    "**Voice-Activated Home Assistant**: Develop a home assistant device specifically tailored for visually impaired users. This device would feature advanced voice recognition and natural language processing capabilities, allowing users to control home appliances, get information about their surroundings, or even receive updates about their schedule. It could also integrate with smart home devices to enhance the user's independence and comfort at home.",
    "**Interactive Braille E-Book Reader**: Create a digital e-book reader that combines traditional Braille with modern technology. This device would have a dynamic Braille display that can change the text being displayed, allowing users to read a wide variety of books without the need for physical copies. The reader could also feature audio playback options, enabling users to switch between Braille and audio formats seamlessly.",
    "**Social Interaction Companion App**: Develop an app that connects visually impaired users with sighted volunteers or friends for real-time assistance. Users could request help for various tasks, such as navigating public spaces, shopping, or even socializing. The app would use location tracking and scheduling features to facilitate connections and ensure that help is readily available when needed."
