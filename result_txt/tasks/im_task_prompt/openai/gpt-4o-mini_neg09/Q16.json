    "**Temperature-Controlled Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush that incorporates temperature control technology. The bristles could be made from heat-conductive materials that allow the brush to either heat up or cool down based on user preference. Heated bristles could help in styling hair by making it more pliable, while cooling settings could help set styles or soothe the scalp. This feature would be particularly beneficial for individuals with thick or curly hair.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush with Hair Health Monitor**: Develop a smart hairbrush that connects to a mobile app to monitor hair health. The brush could be equipped with sensors to measure hair moisture levels, breakage, and scalp health. The app could provide personalized hair care recommendations, such as the best products to use or when to trim split ends, and track changes over time to help users improve their hair care routine.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Grip**: Redesign the hairbrush to feature an ergonomic handle that adapts to the user's grip style. This could involve a flexible, moldable material that conforms to the user's hand shape for optimal comfort. Additionally, the brush could include interchangeable grips that can be swapped out based on the user's preference, making it suitable for various hair types and brushing techniques.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hairbrush**: Create a hairbrush that combines multiple hair care tools into one device. For instance, the brush could feature a detachable section that transforms into a comb, a detangler, or even a small hairdryer. This all-in-one design would save space and be perfect for travel, allowing users to carry fewer tools while still having everything they need for their hair care routine.",
    "**Aromatherapy Hairbrush**: Introduce a hairbrush that releases essential oils during brushing. The bristles could be infused with microcapsules of essential oils that burst upon contact with hair, providing a soothing aroma as users brush. This feature could help reduce stress and promote relaxation, making hair care a more enjoyable and therapeutic experience."
