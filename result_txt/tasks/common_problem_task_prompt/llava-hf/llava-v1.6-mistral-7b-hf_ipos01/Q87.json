    "**Motion Sickness**: Another potential problem is the risk of motion sickness. Some individuals may experience discomfort or nausea when using virtual reality headsets, which could hinder their ability to complete the training program effectively. This could be particularly problematic for individuals who are prone to motion sickness.",
