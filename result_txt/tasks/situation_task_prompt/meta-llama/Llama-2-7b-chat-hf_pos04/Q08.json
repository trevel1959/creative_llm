    "Build a desalination plant: One option for obtaining clean drinking water in a world where all water sources are polluted is to build a desalination plant. A desalination plant uses reverse osmosis or other technologies to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it suitable for drinking. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it could provide a reliable source of clean water for communities near the coast or in areas with access to seawater.",
    "Create a water-collecting dome: Another idea for obtaining clean drinking water in a polluted world is to create a water-collecting dome. This would involve building a large, transparent dome over a body of water, such as a lake or reservoir, and using a special membrane to filter out impurities. The water collected under the dome could then be channeled into a distribution system for use as drinking water. This idea would require significant advances in technology and engineering, but it could provide a sustainable source of clean water in the right location.",
    "Develop a water-purifying bacteria: A third option for obtaining clean drinking water in a polluted world is to develop bacteria that can purify water on a large scale. Scientists could genetically engineer bacteria to break down impurities in water, such as heavy metals and other pollutants, and then use these bacteria to purify water. This could involve creating bacteria that can survive in a wide range of water conditions and can break down a variety of impurities. Once the bacteria are developed, they could be used to purify water in large-scale systems, such as water treatment plants or even in individual homes.",
    "Create a water-collecting tower: A fourth idea for obtaining clean drinking water in a polluted world is to create a water-collecting tower. This would involve building a tall tower over a body of water, such as a river or lake, and using a system of pipes and filters to collect and purify the water. The tower could be designed to collect water from a wide area, making it a more efficient and sustainable option for providing clean drinking water to a large population.",
