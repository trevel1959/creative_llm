    "Inflation: A universal basic income could lead to inflation if the government prints too much money to fund it. This could lead to a decrease in the value of the currency and make it harder for people to buy goods and services.",
    "Disincentive to work: A universal basic income could lead to a disincentive to work, as people would have a guaranteed income regardless of whether they were employed. This could lead to a decrease in the labor force and a decrease in productivity.",
    "Inequality: A universal basic income could exacerbate existing inequalities, as it would not address the root causes of poverty and inequality. People who already have a good income could benefit from the program, while those who are already struggling may not receive enough to make a meaningful difference.",
    "Difficulty in administering: Implementing a universal basic income would require a significant amount of administrative resources, which could be challenging to allocate and manage.",
    "Difficulty in targeting: A universal basic income could be difficult to target to those who need it most, as it would be a blanket payment to all citizens regardless of their income or circumstances."
