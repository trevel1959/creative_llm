    "Use a sharp rock or piece of glass to make incisions.",
    "Use a toothbrush: If you need to cut small pieces of material, you could use a toothbrush as a cutting tool. Simply scrape the bristles across the material to create a small incision.",
    "Use a magnifying glass: By focusing sunlight through a magnifying glass, you can create a concentrated heat source that will melt through certain types of materials.",
    "Use a blowtorch: Similar to a magnifying glass, a blowtorch can be used to create a concentrated heat source that will melt through certain types of materials. However, this method requires more skill and caution than using a magnifying glass.",
    "Use a bow and arrow: If you're looking for a more traditional approach to cutting, you could try using a bow and arrow. Simply aim the arrow at the material you want to cut and pull back the string to release it. The arrow will penetrate the material and leave behind a small hole, which you can then widen with your fingers or a knife. However, this method requires significant practice and skill to master."
