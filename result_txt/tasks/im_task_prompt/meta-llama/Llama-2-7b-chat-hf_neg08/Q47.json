    "Robotics and Navigation: Design a vacuum cleaner with built-in robotics and navigation capabilities, allowing it to move around and clean on its own without human intervention. This would save time and energy, as well as provide a more comprehensive cleaning.",
    "Multi-Surface Cleaning: Develop a vacuum cleaner that can clean multiple surfaces, such as floors, walls, and furniture, with ease. This would eliminate the need for multiple cleaning tools and reduce cleaning time.",
    "Air Purification: Incorporate an air purification system into the vacuum cleaner, which can remove allergens, dust, and other pollutants from the air, providing a healthier cleaning environment.",
    "Energy Efficiency: Develop a vacuum cleaner that is energy efficient, using eco-friendly batteries or solar power to reduce energy consumption and minimize environmental impact.",
    "Customizable Attachments: Create a line of interchangeable attachments for the vacuum cleaner, allowing users to customize the cleaning experience based on their specific needs."
