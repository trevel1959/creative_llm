    "**Vase-plant hybrid**: Design a vase that is also a small indoor garden. The vase could be made of transparent material to showcase the growth of plants within it. It could be equipped with an internal irrigation system that waters the plants automatically when needed, reducing the frequency of manual watering. This idea combines the traditional use of vases as decorative items with the practicality of having a living green space in one's home.",
    "**Vase as a sound diffuser**: Transform a vase into a functional acoustic device by incorporating materials that can absorb or reflect sound waves. This would make it useful for enhancing sound quality in a room, particularly in areas where aesthetics are important. The design could include a range of patterns and colors to match different interior styles.",
    "**Interactive vase**: Create a vase that changes its appearance based on the type of flowers or plants placed inside. For example, the vase could light up or change color depending on the moisture level of the soil or the amount of sunlight received. This could be controlled through a smartphone app, offering a personalized experience for the user.",
    "**Vase as a digital photo frame**: Combine the classic look of a vase with modern technology by integrating a small digital display inside it. This display could show rotating photos or videos uploaded by the owner, turning the vase into a unique piece of wall art. The photos could be themed according to seasons, events, or personal preferences.",
    "**Recycled glass vase**: Design a vase using recycled glass bottles or jars from local businesses. Each vase could be uniquely decorated with designs inspired by the history or logo of the contributing business. This not only reduces waste but also promotes community involvement and awareness about environmental sustainability. These vases could be sold as eco-friendly gifts or as part of a community recycling initiative."
