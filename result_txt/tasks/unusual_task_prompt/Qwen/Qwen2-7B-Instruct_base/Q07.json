    "**Smart Closet Organizer:** Create a smart closet organizer using coat hangers that can track items you've worn recently and remind you to rotate your clothes more frequently. Each hanger could be equipped with a small RFID chip or NFC tag that communicates with a smartphone app. The app would then suggest which clothes to wear next based on your preferences, weather conditions, and frequency of wear.",
    "**Interactive Art Installation:** Design an interactive art installation where each coat hanger represents a person in a community. When someone interacts with their \"hanger\" (e.g., by touching it, moving it), it triggers a sound, light, or video response that reflects the individual's story or personality. This could be a way to bring communities together through shared stories and experiences.",
    "**Recycling Art Project:** Turn old coat hangers into unique, sculptural pieces of art. By bending, twisting, and connecting multiple hangers, you can create intricate designs or shapes. This project not only transforms discarded materials into something beautiful but also raises awareness about recycling and sustainability.",
    "**Portable Speaker Stand:** Create a portable speaker stand using coat hangers. Attach a small speaker to one end of a long, sturdy hanger and hang it from a hook or wall bracket. The speaker can play music while hanging from any space, like a door handle or a window frame, making it perfect for outdoor gatherings or impromptu parties.",
    "**Customizable Clothing Rack:** Build a clothing rack using coat hangers that can be easily customized to fit various spaces and styles. Use adjustable hangers that can hold different types of garments, from shirts and pants to dresses and jackets. Add wheels or a locking mechanism to make the rack mobile or stationary as needed. Customize the rack's appearance with paint, fabric, or other decorative elements to match your personal style or room decor."
