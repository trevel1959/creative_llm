    "Peter Pan - I would bring Peter Pan to life in a world where we can never grow up. This would be a place where people can fly, never age, and always have adventures.

    "Alice in Wonderland - I would bring Wonderland to life in a world that defies logic and reason. This world would be a place where animals talk, and everything is not what it seems. Alice would be a young girl who falls into this strange world and discovers that the rules do not apply here. In this world, animals and people would work together to uncover the secrets of Wonderland.",
    "The Lion King - This fairy tale would come to life in Africa, where lions rule and the animals work together as a family.
