    "Increased productivity: Without the need for sleep, people could work around the clock without experiencing fatigue or burnout. This would likely lead to increased productivity in many industries, as well as a shift towards more flexible work schedules.",
    "Improved mental health: Lack of sleep has been linked to various mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. If humans no longer needed to sleep, they may experience less stress and better mental health overall.",
    "Changes in social behavior: Sleep plays an important role in regulating social behavior. Without it, people may become more irritable, argumentative, and difficult to communicate with. This could lead to changes in how we interact with one another, potentially leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.",
    "Environmental impact: The energy consumption required to power lights and other devices used during sleep could significantly decrease if humans no longer needed to sleep. This could have positive environmental implications, reducing our carbon footprint and reliance on non-renewable resources.",
    "Evolutionary implications: The loss of the need for sleep could potentially lead to evolutionary changes in humans. For example, we may evolve to have different physical characteristics that allow us to function without the need for rest. Alternatively, we may evolve to have new ways of conserving energy and using our time more efficiently."
