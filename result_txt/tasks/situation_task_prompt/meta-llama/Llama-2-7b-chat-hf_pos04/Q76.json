    "Carrier Pigeons: In a world without phones, carrier pigeons could be used as a reliable means of long-distance communication. Trained pigeons could be sent with messages attached to their legs, and they could fly between locations, delivering the messages to their intended recipients. This method would be slower than phone calls but would provide a reliable and secure means of communication.",
    "Semaphore Flags: Semaphore flags are a visual communication system that uses a series of flags to convey messages. This method would be ideal for long-distance communication as it could be used to convey messages over long distances without the need for any technology. Semaphore flags could be used to convey messages by using a series of predetermined flag positions and sequences, allowing for complex messages to be communicated.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Homing pigeons could be trained to fly between locations and carry messages attached to their legs. This method would be similar to using carrier pigeons but would be faster and more efficient. Homing pigeons could be trained to fly between specific locations, such as between two cities or countries, and could be used to convey urgent messages.",
    "Optical Signals: Optical signals could be used to communicate over long distances using a series of mirrors or lenses to reflect or focus light signals. This method would be similar to using a flashlight to signal a message, but could be used to convey more complex messages by using different patterns of light. Optical signals could be used to communicate between two locations, or even between different countries.",
    "Beacons: Beacons are small devices that emit a signal that can be detected by other devices. In a world without phones, beacons could be used to communicate over long distances by emitting a signal that can be detected by other beacons. This method would be similar to using a series of relay stations to transmit a message, but would be more reliable and secure. Beacons could be used to convey messages between different locations, or even between different countries."
