    "**Multifunctional Cooking Surface**: A cooking surface that can transform between a stovetop, griddle, and induction cooktop at the touch of a button. This gadget would use advanced technology to change its surface properties to suit the cooking method selected. Problems could arise with durability (the surface may wear down over time), energy consumption concerns, and ensuring safety features to prevent overheating or accidental activation.",
    "**Smart Waste Separator**: A kitchen gadget that not only helps in composting but also separates recyclables from regular waste. Users would place their waste into a bin, and the gadget would automatically sort the items using sensors and a small conveyor system. Issues could include malfunctioning sensors that misidentify waste, the need for regular maintenance, and user resistance to adopting new waste disposal habits.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Projector**: A compact projector that displays step-by-step cooking instructions on the kitchen counter or wall. It could include voice commands for hands-free operation and interactive features like timers and ingredient substitution suggestions. Problems might involve compatibility with various kitchen layouts, potential technical issues like poor image quality or connectivity problems, and the challenge of ensuring the projector is safe around water and food.",
    "**Temperature-Controlling Utensils**: A set of cooking utensils that can maintain a specific temperature to help in tasks like melting chocolate or keeping sauces warm. Each utensil would have built-in sensors and heating elements. Challenges could include ensuring consistent temperature control, managing battery life for wireless versions, and the risk of overheating if not used correctly.",
    "**Flavor Infuser**: A gadget that allows users to infuse flavors into liquids or foods quickly. For example, a chamber where herbs, spices, or fruits can be added to a pot of water or oil, which would then circulate and heat the mixture to speed up infusion. Potential issues could include difficulty cleaning the infusion chamber, user errors in timing and temperature settings, and the risk of flavor contamination if not properly maintained."
