    "**Financial Management**: Operating a zoo requires substantial investment for maintenance, staffing, and animal care. Budget constraints could lead to underfunding in areas like habitat improvements, animal nutrition, or staff training, potentially compromising the quality of care. For instance, if funds are limited, the zoo might struggle to purchase high-quality food for its animals or maintain the necessary infrastructure for their wellbeing.",
    "**Zoo Safety and Security**: Ensuring the safety of both visitors and animals is crucial. Issues might involve inadequate fencing, security personnel, or emergency protocols. A breach in security could lead to escapes, which pose risks to public safety and endanger the animals. Additionally, the zoo must manage potential threats from wildlife, such as predators or pests, that could harm the animals or disrupt their environment.",
    "**Education and Outreach Programs**: While educational programs are essential for raising awareness about conservation and animal welfare, implementing effective programs can be challenging. Funding, staff expertise, and visitor engagement are key factors. For example, a lack of resources might limit the number of interactive exhibits or educational materials, affecting the zoo's ability to educate the public on important environmental issues.",
    "**Conservation Efforts**: Zoos play a significant role in conservation by breeding endangered species and conducting research. However, challenges in this area might include limited breeding success, inadequate funding for conservation projects, or ethical concerns regarding captive breeding practices. For instance, a zoo might struggle to achieve high survival rates for endangered species due to genetic issues or insufficient environmental stimuli.",
    "**Zoo Visitors' Expectations vs Reality**: Meeting visitor expectations while maintaining animal welfare can be a delicate balance. High visitor numbers might lead to overcrowding, stress on animals, and degraded habitats. Moreover, visitors might have unrealistic expectations about the level of interaction they can have with animals, leading to disappointment and dissatisfaction. For example, a zoo might need to limit access to certain exhibits to prevent animals from being overly stressed by constant human presence."
