    "Virtual Reality Cinemas: In a world without movies or theaters, a new form of cinematic experience could emerge: virtual reality (VR) cinemas. Viewers could don VR headsets and enter immersive, interactive worlds, complete with 360-degree visuals, spatial audio, and even tactile sensations. With VR, audiences could become a part of the story, interacting with characters and environments in ways that feel real and engaging.",
    "Augmented Reality Walk-Throughs: Another option would be to create augmented reality (AR) walk-throughs, where visitors could explore and interact with cinematic scenes in a real-world setting. Using AR technology, scenes could be projected onto the environment around them, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. For example, a group of friends could walk through a virtual forest, encountering characters and creatures from their favorite movies along the way.",
    "Mobile App Cinematic Experiences: A mobile app could offer a new way to experience cinematic storytelling on the go. Users could download an app that offers interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style stories, with branching narratives that adapt to their choices. Each scene could be rendered in stunning 3D graphics, with voice acting and immersive sound design to bring the story to life.",
    "Interactive Theatre Performances: To create a more traditional cinematic experience, theatres could adopt an interactive approach to storytelling. Rather than simply watching a play or musical, audiences could participate in the performance, making choices that affect the outcome of the story. This could be achieved through a combination of technology and old-fashioned audience participation, such as voting buttons or interactive prompts.",
    "Immersive Storytelling Retreats: For a more intimate and immersive experience, a new type of retreat could emerge: immersive storytelling retreats. These retreats would bring together writers, directors, and actors to create and perform original stories, with a focus on interactive and immersive techniques. Participants could take part in workshops, attend performances, and even contribute to the creative process, creating a truly collaborative and transformative cinematic experience."
