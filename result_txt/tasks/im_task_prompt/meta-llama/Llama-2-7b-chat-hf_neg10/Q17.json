    "Smart Washing Machine: Develop a washing machine that can automatically detect the type of fabric being washed and adjust the wash cycle, water temperature, and detergent dosage accordingly. This would save users time and energy by ensuring their clothes are properly cleaned without overloading the machine.",
    "Compact Washing Machine: Design a washing machine that is compact enough to fit in small apartments or homes with limited space. This could be achieved by using a vertical or spiral design, allowing for a more efficient use of space.",
    "Energy-Efficient Washing Machine: Create a washing machine that uses advanced energy-saving technologies, such as a heat pump or solar power, to reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills. This could also include a smart energy management system that adjusts the machine's energy usage based on the user's laundry needs.",
    "Noise-Reducing Washing Machine: Develop a washing machine with advanced noise-reducing technology, such as sound-absorbing materials or a unique acoustic design. This would make the machine less disruptive during use, allowing users to focus on other tasks while their laundry is being cleaned.",
    "Automated Washing Machine: Create a washing machine that can automatically load and unload clothes, eliminating the need for users to physically handle the laundry. This could be achieved through the use of robotic arms or other automated systems, making the process of doing laundry more convenient and efficient."
