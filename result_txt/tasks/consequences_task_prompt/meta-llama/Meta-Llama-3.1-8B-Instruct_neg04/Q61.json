    "**Bartering Economy**: With the disappearance of currency, people would need to rely on bartering as a means of exchange. This would lead to a significant shift in the way businesses operate, as they would need to adapt to trading goods and services directly. For example, a bakery might exchange bread for a mechanic's repair services. This system would require a high degree of trust and cooperation among individuals and businesses.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: In the absence of currency, resources would become the primary means of exchange. People would need to rely on access to essential resources like food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This would lead to a more equitable distribution of resources, as those who have access to these resources would have a higher social status. For instance, a community might establish a system where everyone has access to a certain amount of food and water, regardless of their occupation or social status.",
    "**Time-Based Economy**: With the disappearance of currency, people would need to rely on their time and skills to exchange goods and services. This would lead to a more personalized and community-driven economy, where people would trade time and expertise for other people's time and expertise. For example, a person might offer their cooking skills in exchange for a friend's graphic design services. This system would require a high degree of trust and reciprocity among individuals.",
    "**Skill-Based Economy**: In the absence of currency, people would need to rely on their skills and expertise to exchange goods and services. This would lead to a more specialized and efficient economy, where people would focus on developing their unique skills and exchanging them with others. For instance, a community might establish a system where people trade their skills, such as carpentry, electrical work, or medical services, for other people's skills.",
    "**Gift Economy**: With the disappearance of currency, people would need to rely on gifts and altruism to exchange goods and services. This would lead to a more compassionate and community-driven economy, where people would focus on giving and receiving without expecting anything in return. For example, a community might establish a system where people give food, clothing, or other essential items to those in need, without expecting anything in return. This system would require a high degree of trust and empathy among individuals.
