    "**Personalized Content Curator**:    A smart TV that learns your preferences over time and curates a personalized channel for you. Utilizing AI, it would analyze your viewing habits, mood (possibly through facial recognition), and time of day to suggest content tailored to your interests. It could also integrate with streaming services to offer a seamless viewing experience without needing to browse multiple platforms.",
    "**Mood Lighting and Aromatherapy Integration**:    This TV would be equipped with ambient lighting and aroma dispensers that sync with the content being viewed. For example, watching a nature documentary could trigger soft green lights and fresh forest scents, while a horror movie might dim the lights and emit a chillier aroma. This multisensory experience would enhance emotional engagement and create a more immersive environment.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay**:    An AR feature that allows viewers to see additional information or interactive elements while watching a program. For instance, during a sports game, viewers could see player stats, historical comparisons, or even interactive polls right on their screen. This would transform passive viewing into an engaging experience, allowing viewers to delve deeper into the content.",
    "**Health Monitoring and Recommendations**:    A TV that integrates health monitoring technology, using sensors to track viewersâ€™ heart rates, stress levels, and even eye strain. Based on this data, it could recommend specific types of content (e.g., calming shows after a long day) or suggest breaks to reduce screen fatigue. This would promote healthier viewing habits and make the TV experience more beneficial.",
    "**Social Viewing Experience**:    A built-in feature that allows for simultaneous viewing with friends and family, regardless of their location. This could include live video chat, synchronized playback, and shared reactions. Viewers could host virtual watch parties, complete with interactive games or quizzes related to the show, fostering a sense of community and connection despite physical distance."
