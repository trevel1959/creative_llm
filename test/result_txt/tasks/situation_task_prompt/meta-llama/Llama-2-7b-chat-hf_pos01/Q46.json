    "Community-Led Waste Management Initiative: In a world without trash cans, communities could come together to establish their own waste management systems. Each neighborhood could create a designated area for collecting and sorting waste, such as a centralized composting site or a recycling hub. This would encourage neighbors to work together and take ownership of their waste management, fostering a sense of community and environmental responsibility.",
    "Portable Waste Containers: To address the lack of trash cans, individuals could use portable waste containers that can be easily carried and stored in homes or offices. These containers could be made of durable materials such as plastic or metal and have a tight-fitting lid to prevent litter. This would allow for easy disposal of waste without relying on centralized trash cans.",
    "Wearable Waste Bags: In the absence of trash cans, people could use wearable waste bags that can be attached to clothing or backpacks. These bags could be made of waterproof material and have a discreet design to avoid drawing attention. This would allow individuals to carry their waste with them wherever they go, making it easier to dispose of waste in a responsible manner.",
    "Mobile Trash Collection Services: To address the lack of trash cans, a mobile trash collection service could be established to collect waste from homes and businesses. This service could be powered by electric or hybrid vehicles and equipped with specialized containers for different types of waste. This would ensure that waste is collected regularly and efficiently, without relying on centralized trash cans.",
    "Biodegradable Waste Packaging: In a world without trash cans, companies could switch to biodegradable packaging materials that can decompose quickly and easily. This would reduce the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of and minimize the impact on the environment. Biodegradable materials such as plant-based plastics, bamboo, or recycled paper could be used for packaging, reducing the need"
