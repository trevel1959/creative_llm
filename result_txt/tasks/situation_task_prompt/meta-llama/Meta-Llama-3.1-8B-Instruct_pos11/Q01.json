    "**Visual Messaging through Art**: Utilize visual art forms like painting, drawing, or even street art to convey messages across international borders. For instance, a person in New York could create a mural with a hidden message, and a person in Tokyo could replicate the mural with the same message, effectively communicating across continents. This method would rely on the creativity of the artists and the recognition of the symbols or images used.",
    "**International Radio Broadcasts**: Leverage the power of radio waves to send messages across the globe. Although radio broadcasts might not be as frequent or reliable as electronic communication, they could serve as a backup method. A person could use a shortwave radio to broadcast a message, which could be received by others with the right equipment. This method would require a good understanding of radio frequencies and technology.",
    "**Physical Letter Carriers**: In the absence of electronic communication, physical messengers could become a crucial means of contact. A network of trusted messengers could be established to carry handwritten letters or messages between countries. This method would rely on the reliability and discretion of the messengers, as well as the safety of the message-carrying routes.",
    "**Symbolic Language through Music**: Utilize music as a universal language to convey messages. A person could create a unique melody or song with a hidden message, and another person could recognize and replicate the melody, effectively communicating the message. This method would rely on the recognition of the melody and the cultural context in which it is used.",
    "**Humanitarian Networks**: Establish a network of humanitarian organizations and volunteers who could serve as messengers between countries. These organizations could use their existing infrastructure and resources to facilitate communication between people in need. This method would rely on the goodwill and cooperation of the humanitarian organizations and their volunteers."
