    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can pose challenges in communication, potentially leading to frustration for both the host family and the student. To address this, families can set up a language buddy system, where family members pair with the student to practice conversational skills. Additionally, using translation apps and encouraging the student to engage in language classes can help improve communication over time.",
    "**Homesickness**: The foreign exchange student may experience homesickness, leading to emotional distress and difficulty adjusting to their new environment. To support the student, families can create a cozy space that reminds them of home, encourage them to share their feelings, and maintain regular communication with their family back home through video calls. Organizing activities that highlight local culture can also help the student feel more connected to their new surroundings.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: The exchange student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences that the host family is unaware of, leading to uncomfortable situations at mealtimes. To prevent this, families should communicate with the student about their dietary needs before arrival. Creating a shared meal plan that incorporates both local cuisine and the student’s preferences can ensure everyone enjoys mealtime together.",
    "**Integration into Family Life**: The student may struggle to integrate into the family dynamic, feeling like an outsider or not knowing how to participate in family activities. To facilitate inclusion, families can create a schedule of family activities that encourages participation, such as game nights or outings. Establishing a \"family meeting\" tradition can also provide a platform for the student to express their thoughts and feelings, helping them feel more at home.",
    "**Academic Challenges**: The foreign exchange student may face academic challenges due to differences in educational systems or language proficiency. To help them succeed, host families can communicate with the student’s teachers to understand their academic needs and seek additional tutoring if necessary. Creating a study schedule that balances academic responsibilities with social activities can also promote a healthy adjustment to their new school environment."
