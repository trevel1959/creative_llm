    "**Integrated Transportation Network**: The city would feature a multi-modal transportation system that combines electric public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian pathways. A network of autonomous electric shuttles would provide on-demand transport, reducing reliance on personal vehicles. Elevated bike highways would connect neighborhoods, while underground pedestrian walkways would ensure safe and pleasant commuting. The entire system would be app-based, allowing residents to plan their journeys efficiently.",
    "**Smart Waste Management System**: Utilizing advanced IoT technology, the city would have a smart waste management system that includes waste sorting bins equipped with sensors to monitor fill levels. This data would optimize collection routes and schedules, reducing emissions and improving efficiency. Additionally, composting stations would be scattered throughout the city, encouraging residents to recycle organic waste, which would be transformed into fertilizer for community gardens.",
    "**Cultural and Artistic Hubs**: The city would prioritize creativity and expression by incorporating dedicated cultural and artistic hubs. These spaces would include galleries, performance venues, and artist studios, all interconnected by public art installations. Monthly cultural festivals would celebrate local talent, and residents would be encouraged to participate in workshops and art classes. This emphasis on the arts would foster community spirit and inclusivity.",
    "**Community Energy Grids**: Each neighborhood would operate its own community energy grid powered by renewable sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal energy. Residents could contribute excess energy back to the grid, earning credits that could be used for community services or reduced utility bills. This decentralized approach would empower neighborhoods to become self-sufficient while promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Wellness Zones**: The city would incorporate designated wellness zones designed to promote physical and mental health. These areas would feature open-air gyms, meditation gardens, and walking trails surrounded by nature. Wellness programs would be available, offering classes in yoga, tai chi, and mindfulness. Additionally, the city would have a network of health clinics focused on holistic care, providing accessible mental health services and preventive care."
