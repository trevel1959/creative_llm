    "**Eco-Friendly Printing Mode**: Introduce a printing mode that optimizes ink usage and paper consumption. This could include features like automatic double-sided printing, the ability to print in draft mode to save ink, and suggestions for alternative printing layouts that reduce paper waste. Additionally, the printer could be designed to use biodegradable ink cartridges, promoting environmental sustainability.",
    "**Multi-Material Printing Capability**: Create a printer that can handle a variety of materials beyond just paper, such as fabric, cardboard, and even 3D printing filaments. This would allow users to print custom designs on T-shirts, create prototypes, or craft personalized gifts, making the printer a versatile tool for both personal and professional projects.",
    "**Integrated Scanner and Copier with AI**: Enhance the printer by integrating a high-quality scanner and copier that utilizes AI to automatically adjust settings for optimal image quality. The AI could recognize different document types (e.g., photos, text, diagrams) and adjust color, brightness, and contrast accordingly. This feature would streamline the scanning and copying process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Incorporate voice recognition technology into the printer, allowing users to command it to print documents or photos simply by speaking. This would make printing more accessible, especially for individuals with disabilities or those who prefer hands-free operation. Users could also ask the printer for updates on ink levels or paper availability.",
    "**Personalized Print Profiles**: Develop a feature that allows users to create personalized print profiles based on their printing habits. Users could set preferences for quality, speed, and paper type, and the printer would automatically adjust settings based on the selected profile. This would save time and ensure that each print job meets the userâ€™s specific needs."
