    "Once, in a small village nestled between two mountains, there was a river that flowed backward. The villagers were puzzled; fish swam upstream, and boats glided against the current. One day, a curious girl named Elara followed the river to its source. There, she discovered a magical spring where time itself flowed backward. Elara realized that the river granted wishes, but only if one was brave enough to let go of their past. She returned to the village, inspiring others to cast their burdens into the water. As they did, the river shimmered with hope, and the village flourished anew.",
