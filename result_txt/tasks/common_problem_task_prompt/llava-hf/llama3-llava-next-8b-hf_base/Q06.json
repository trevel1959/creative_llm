    "Limited resources: Mars is a very inhospitable planet, and it is not easy to obtain the necessary resources to sustain a human settlement. This can make it difficult to build and maintain a sustainable habitat, and can also limit the ability to conduct scientific research.",
    "Lack of gravity: Mars has only about one-third of the gravity of Earth, which can make it difficult to move around and can also affect the body's ability to regulate temperature.",
    "Isolation: Living on Mars means being far away from Earth, which can make it difficult to communicate with loved ones and can also make it difficult to receive medical care or other support in case of an emergency.",
    "Psychological effects: The isolation and harsh environment of Mars can take a toll on the mental health of the astronauts, and can also make it difficult to maintain a sense of normalcy and routine.",
    "Radiation exposure: Mars has no atmosphere to protect against harmful radiation, which can pose a risk to the health of the astronauts."
