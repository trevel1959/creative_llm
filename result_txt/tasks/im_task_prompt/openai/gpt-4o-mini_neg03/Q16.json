    "**Smart Hairbrush with Hair Analysis**: Imagine a hairbrush equipped with sensors that analyze the health of your hair while you brush. It could measure factors like moisture levels, breakage, and scalp health, providing real-time feedback via a connected app. The app could suggest personalized hair care routines, products, and tips based on the analysis, helping users achieve healthier hair over time.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hairbrush**: This hairbrush could combine several grooming tools into one. For instance, it could feature a built-in detangler, a sectioning clip, and a mini mirror on the back of the handle. This would make it a convenient all-in-one tool for styling, allowing users to quickly switch between detangling, sectioning, and checking their look without needing to grab multiple items.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Hairbrush**: A hairbrush that can heat up or cool down could help with styling. For example, heated bristles could help to smooth out frizz and enhance shine, while a cooling feature could set styles in place. Users could adjust the temperature settings via a small touch interface on the handle, making it a versatile tool for various hair types and styles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: This hairbrush could be made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, and designed for longevity. Additionally, it could feature replaceable bristle heads, allowing users to switch out worn bristles without needing to buy a whole new brush. This would reduce waste and promote a more environmentally friendly approach to personal care.",
    "**Personalized Hairbrush with Customizable Bristles**: This concept involves a hairbrush where users can change the bristle type according to their hair type and styling needs. For instance, the brush could come with different sets of bristles (boar, nylon, silicone) that can be easily swapped out. An accompanying app could guide users on which bristle type to use for their specific hair needs, making it customizable and versatile."
