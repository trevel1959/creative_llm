    "**Scent-Based Sleep Therapy**: In a world without night, our bodies might need alternative cues to signal sleep. A device could be developed that releases calming scents—like lavender or chamomile—at specific times of the day to trigger the brain's relaxation response. This device would work in conjunction with wearable technology that monitors stress levels and fatigue, adjusting the scent intensity and timing to help users unwind and prepare for sleep, even in continuous daylight.",
    "**Virtual Reality Dreamscapes**: To escape the perpetual brightness, users could wear VR headsets that transport them to dreamlike environments designed for relaxation and sleep. These virtual worlds could feature soothing landscapes, gentle soundscapes, and guided meditations. Users could select different themes—such as a tranquil forest, a serene beach, or a cozy cabin in the mountains—to help them mentally detach from the surrounding brightness and drift into a restful state.",
    "**Bioluminescent Sleep Masks**: Taking inspiration from nature, sleep masks could be created with bioluminescent materials that glow softly, simulating the calming effects of moonlight. These masks would not only block out light but also emit a gentle glow that mimics the natural transition from day to night. The light would be designed to fade gradually as the wearer falls asleep, providing a comforting visual cue that signals the body it's time to rest.",
    "**Soundscape Sleep Stations**: In lieu of nighttime, dedicated sleep stations could be set up in homes or public spaces, equipped with immersive sound systems that produce ambient sounds associated with night—like crickets chirping, gentle rain, or soft wind rustling through trees. Users could visit these stations to relax and prepare for sleep, effectively creating a psychological association with these sounds and promoting better sleep hygiene.",
    "**Cognitive Behavioral Sleep Apps**: Mobile applications could be developed to help users manage their sleep patterns through cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. These apps would provide personalized sleep plans, relaxation exercises, and guided imagery sessions to help users cope with the challenges of sleeping in a world without night. The app could also offer reminders to practice good sleep hygiene, encouraging users to establish routines that signal their bodies when it’s time to wind down."
