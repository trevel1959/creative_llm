    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared is to convert to solar power. This could involve equipping cars with solar panels on their roofs or hoods, which would convert sunlight into electricity to power the vehicle. This would provide a clean and renewable source of energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing the impact on the environment.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option would be to transition to hydrogen fuel cells, which use hydrogen as a fuel source to generate electricity. Hydrogen can be produced from various sources, including renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Hydrogen fuel cells would provide a clean and efficient source of energy for vehicles, with only water vapor and heat as emissions.",
    "Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by batteries could also become the primary mode of transportation. EVs would be charged using renewable energy sources like wind, solar, or hydroelectric power. This would reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and lower emissions, making transportation cleaner and more sustainable. With advancements in battery technology, EVs could potentially have a longer driving range, making them a viable option for long-distance travel as well.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are another alternative to oil for powering vehicles. These fuels are derived from organic matter like plants, algae, or agricultural waste. Biofuels can be produced sustainably and can be used in conventional internal combustion engines, making them a potential transition fuel for the transportation sector.",
    "Advanced Nuclear Power: Advanced nuclear power sources, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), could provide a reliable and clean source of energy for powering vehicles. SMRs are designed to be smaller, safer, and more efficient than traditional nuclear reactors, making them more suitable for localized power generation. This would reduce the need for long-distance transmission lines and centralized power generation, while providing a consistent source of energy for transportation."
