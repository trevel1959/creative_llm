    "**Toothpaste Alternative**: In a world without dentists, people would have to rely on natural remedies for oral health. I'd use a mixture of baking soda, activated charcoal, and essential oils like peppermint and tea tree oil to create a paste that's both antibacterial and abrasive. The baking soda would help neutralize acids and remove plaque, while the activated charcoal would whiten teeth and absorb toxins. The essential oils would provide a refreshing flavor and antibacterial properties. I'd apply this paste to my teeth using a soft-bristled brush or a finger, making sure to cover all surfaces. Regularly rinsing with water and using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria would complete my oral hygiene routine.",
    "**DIY Dental Prosthetics**: Without dentists, people would have to get creative with replacing missing teeth. I'd use 3D printing technology to create custom dental prosthetics using biocompatible materials like titanium or zirconia. I'd design the prosthetics to match the shape and color of my natural teeth, ensuring a seamless integration. To attach the prosthetics, I'd use dental cement or a strong adhesive like cyanoacrylate. Regular maintenance would involve cleaning the prosthetics with a soft brush and mild soap, and storing them in a protective case when not in use.",
    "**Oral Health Subscription Box**: In a world without dentists, people would need access to affordable and convenient oral health solutions. I'd start an oral health subscription box service, delivering a monthly package of natural toothpaste, dental floss, and mouthwash to customers' doorsteps. Each box would include a personalized oral health plan, tailored to the customer's specific needs and concerns. The subscription box would also feature educational content, such as videos and articles, on proper oral hygiene techniques and the importance of regular check-ups.",
    "**Community Dental Clinic**: Without dentists, communities would need to come together to provide oral health care. I'd establish a community dental clinic, where volunteers and professionals would work together to provide free or low-cost dental services. The clinic would offer a range of services, from routine cleanings and fillings to more complex procedures like extractions and crowns. To make the clinic more accessible, I'd offer flexible scheduling, including evening and weekend appointments, and provide transportation assistance for those in need.",
