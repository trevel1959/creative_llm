    "Harness the power of fireflies: Fireflies are known for their bioluminescence, which could be harnessed to light up a room. By capturing fireflies and placing them in a special enclosure, you could create a magical, twinkling light display.",
    "Create a crystal grid: By arranging crystals in a specific pattern, you could create a grid of light that would illuminate a room at night. Different crystals have different properties, so you could experiment with different combinations to create the desired effect.",
    "Use phosphorescent materials: Phosphorescent materials absorb light and then emit it back out over time, creating a soft, glowing effect. You could use these materials to create a variety of objects, such as phosphorescent paint, that could be used to light up a room at night.",
    "Develop a luminescent plant: By cross-breeding certain plants, you could develop a new species that has a natural ability to glow in the dark. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly source of light for a room at night."
