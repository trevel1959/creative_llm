    "**Personalized Laser Technology**: In a world without glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would rely on a revolutionary technology that uses lasers to correct their vision. This technology would involve a painless, non-invasive procedure where a laser is used to reshape the cornea, allowing light to focus correctly on the retina. The procedure would be performed by trained professionals in a medical setting, and the results would be immediate. People with myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism could all benefit from this technology, which would eliminate the need for corrective eyewear.",
    "**Enhanced Human Vision**: Humans would develop the ability to see in low light conditions, much like animals do. This would be achieved through a series of genetic mutations that would allow the human eye to produce more light-sensitive cells, making it possible to see in dimly lit environments. This adaptation would be a gradual process, occurring over several generations, and would be triggered by the need for humans to adapt to a world without corrective eyewear.",
    "**Virtual Reality Contact Lenses**: In a world without traditional contact lenses, people with poor vision would turn to virtual reality contact lenses. These lenses would be embedded with tiny screens and sensors that would project images and provide real-time feedback to the wearer. They would be controlled by a smartphone app, allowing users to customize their vision to suit their needs. These lenses would also have built-in health monitoring capabilities, tracking the wearer's eye health and providing alerts for potential issues.",
    "**Advanced Optics**: The disappearance of glasses and contact lenses would lead to a surge in innovation in optics. People with poor vision would use advanced optical devices, such as portable holographic projectors, to see the world around them. These devices would use advanced algorithms and machine learning to create a 3D representation of the environment, allowing users to navigate and interact with their surroundings in a way that is both intuitive and immersive.",
    "**Biometric Vision Enhancement**: In a world without corrective eyewear, people with poor vision would rely on biometric implants that enhance their natural vision. These implants would be tiny, surgically inserted devices that use advanced biometric sensors to monitor the wearer's eye health and provide real-time feedback to improve their vision. They would be powered by a small, implantable battery and would be controlled by a wearable device that the user could program to suit their needs. These implants would be a game-changer for people with vision impairments, allowing them to see the world in a way that is both natural and"
