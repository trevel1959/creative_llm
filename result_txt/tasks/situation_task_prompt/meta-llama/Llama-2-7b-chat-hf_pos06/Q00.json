    "Build a network of interconnected skate parks: With cars no longer an option, people could use skate parks as a means of transportation. By connecting these skate parks, a network of interconnected routes could be created, allowing for efficient travel between cities. This idea could be further enhanced by adding electric skateboards or scooters to the network, providing a more sustainable and eco-friendly option. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop a system of underground tunnels: Building a network of underground tunnels could provide a safe and efficient means of transportation. These tunnels could be equipped with electric trains or maglev trains, which would be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. This idea could also include the use of autonomous vehicles, ensuring a safe and comfortable journey. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Create a system of personal airships: In a world without cars, personal airships could become a viable mode of transportation. These airships could be powered by electricity or solar energy, and could be equipped with amenities such as comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, and entertainment systems. This idea could also include the use of autonomous navigation systems, ensuring a safe and efficient journey. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Establish a network of hyperloops: Hyperloops are high-speed transportation systems that use vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers in pods at speeds of up to 700 mph. By establishing a network of hyperloops, travel between cities could become faster and more efficient than ever before. This idea could be further enhanced by using renewable energy sources to power the hyperloops, reducing their environmental impact. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Develop a system of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft: In a world without cars, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft could become a viable mode of transportation. These aircraft could be powered by electricity or solar energy, and could be equipped with amenities such as comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, and entertainment systems. This idea could also include the use of autonomous navigation systems, ensuring a safe and efficient journey. Confidence Score: 0.8"
