    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to transition to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which would then power an electric motor. This would eliminate the need for gasoline or diesel fuel, making transportation more sustainable and environmentally friendly.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option would be to use hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles would use hydrogen as a fuel source, which would be converted into electricity through a fuel cell. The only byproduct of this process would be water vapor and heat, making it a much cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels.",
    "Electric Bicycles: Electric bicycles are another creative solution to power vehicles without oil. These bicycles use rechargeable batteries to power an electric motor, which would provide the power for propulsion. This would be a great option for short distances, and could be a fun and environmentally friendly way to get around.",
    "Gravity-Powered Vehicles: A more unconventional solution would be to use gravity-powered vehicles. These vehicles would use the force of gravity to generate power, either through a system of weights and pulleys or through the use of a gravitational hill. By harnessing the power of gravity, these vehicles could potentially be powered indefinitely, without the need for any external energy sources.",
    "Bio-Electric Vehicles: Finally, another creative solution to power vehicles without oil would be to use bio-electric vehicles. These vehicles would use organic matter, such as plant or animal waste, to generate electricity. This electricity would then be used to power an electric motor, providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels. This could be especially useful in areas where access to sunlight or other renewable energy sources is limited."
