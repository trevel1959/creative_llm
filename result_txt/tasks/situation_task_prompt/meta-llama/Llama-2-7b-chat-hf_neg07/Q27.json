    "Thermal Mass Design: Utilize thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. Buildings with these materials can maintain a more consistent temperature as external temperatures fluctuate. For example, during the day, the building would absorb heat from the sun, and at night, it would release heat back into the space, keeping it warmer.",
    "Natural Ventilation: Design buildings with large windows, openings, or vents that allow natural airflow. During the day, warm air rises, and cooler air enters through windows or vents, maintaining a consistent temperature. At night, the process reverses, and cool air is pushed out, keeping the space cooler.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Utilize phase change materials like paraffin wax or molten salt to store thermal energy. These materials change phase (i.e., melt or solidify) based on temperature, allowing for efficient storage and release of heat. For example, during the day, the material would absorb heat and melt, storing thermal energy. At night, it would solidify and release heat back into the space.",
    "Greenhouses: Build greenhouses with thermal mass materials like earth or concrete, and incorporate vegetation like plants or trees. During the day, the greenhouse absorbs heat from the sun, and at night, the vegetation releases heat back into the space, maintaining a consistent temperature.",
    "Passive Radiative Cooling: Use materials with high radiative cooling coefficients, such as dark-colored paints or coatings, to absorb heat from the environment and release it back into space. For example, a building could be coated with a dark-colored paint that absorbs heat from the sun during the day and releases it at night, maintaining a consistent temperature."
