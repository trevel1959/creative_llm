    "**Eco-Resonance Oasis**: This habitat is designed to mimic and enhance the natural ecosystem of a rainforest. It would feature towering artificial trees that house various species of birds, monkeys, and insects. The canopy area would be filled with mist and artificial rainfall to maintain high humidity levels, essential for many tropical species. The floor would be made of biodegradable materials that support plant growth, creating a living floor. Waterways would run throughout, providing a water source for drinking and swimming.",
    "**Sustainable Seacrest Sanctuary**: For aquatic animals, a habitat that focuses on sustainability would be beneficial. This sanctuary would use solar power and incorporate energy-efficient systems for filtration and heating. It would feature large, transparent domes to simulate open ocean conditions, allowing sunlight in while protecting the inhabitants from predators. Artificial coral reefs would provide hiding spots and habitats for smaller marine life, promoting biodiversity.",
    "**Frozen Fjord Habitat**: For colder climates, an Arctic habitat could include glaciers, icebergs, and polar landscapes. It would be equipped with a snow-making system to ensure a constant supply of snow and ice. The environment would mimic the harsh conditions of the Arctic, with low temperatures and high winds. It would house polar bears, arctic foxes, and other cold-adapted species, along with artificial lakes and ponds for aquatic life.",
    "**Desert Dunes Oasis**: To cater to desert-dwelling animals, this habitat would focus on water conservation and temperature management. It would include vast sand dunes, cacti, and other desert flora. The environment would have a built-in water recycling system and a cooling mechanism to handle the extreme heat during the day and the cold at night. Animals like camels, snakes, and lizards would thrive in this environment, which also includes artificial pools for water storage and bathing.",
    "**Sky-Spanning Lagoon**: This innovative habitat would be suspended in the air, perhaps from a series of platforms or floating structures. It would be filled with water and feature a variety of aquatic plants and fish. The design would incorporate wind and solar power for energy needs and could even be designed to move slightly with the wind, mimicking the natural movement of water bodies. It would be accessible to different species that require water but can't survive in traditional aquatic environments due to pollution or lack of space."
