    "Day-Sleeping Pods: With no nighttime, people could use special day-sleeping pods that mimic the effects of sleeping during the night. These pods would use advanced technology to simulate the darkness, quiet, and temperature conditions of nighttime, allowing people to get a good night's rest during the day.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Adjustment: Since the lack of nighttime would disrupt the natural circadian rhythm, people could use special devices that adjust their internal clocks to match the new day-night cycle. These devices would monitor the user's sleep patterns and adjust the light and darkness exposure accordingly, helping the user feel more rested and refreshed.",
    "Artificial Night Sky: To provide a sense of familiarity and comfort, communities could create artificial night skies using projectors and specialized lighting. These skies would mimic the appearance of a real night sky, complete with stars, constellations, and even the changing colors of the sky during different times of day.",
    "Dreamwalking: In a world without nighttime, people could use special techniques to enter a state of lucid dreaming, allowing them to experience the sensation of dreaming during the day. This could be achieved through meditation, brain stimulation, or other means, and could provide a way for people to experience the dream world without the need for sleep.",
    "Time-Shifting: To cope with the lack of nighttime, people could use advanced technology to shift their internal clocks, effectively turning back the hands of time. This would allow them to experience the nighttime hours during the day, providing a sense of normalcy and familiarity. However, this would require a significant adjustment to the user's daily routine and could have unintended consequences on their overall well-being."
