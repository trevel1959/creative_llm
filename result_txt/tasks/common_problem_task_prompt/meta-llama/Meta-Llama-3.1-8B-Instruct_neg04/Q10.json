    "**Mood Lighting Maze**: Design a floor plan with a maze-like layout, incorporating mood lighting that adjusts based on the time of day and the occupants' preferences. The walls and ceiling would be adorned with a fiber-optic \"starlight\" effect, creating a sense of being in a celestial environment. The maze would have different sections with distinct lighting schemes, such as a calming blue for relaxation or a vibrant red for energy.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Water Feature**: Create a stunning water feature that incorporates natural elements, such as a living wall or a water-inspired sculpture. The water would be filtered and recycled, reducing waste and creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. The feature could be designed to change colors or patterns based on the surrounding environment, creating a unique and dynamic visual effect.",
    "**Smart Glass Walls**: Implement smart glass walls that can change from transparent to opaque with the touch of a button. This would allow for seamless transitions between indoor and outdoor spaces, creating a sense of continuity and flow. The smart glass could also be programmed to change colors or patterns to match the occupants' mood or the surrounding environment.",
    "**Acoustic Oasis**: Design a room with a unique acoustic design that creates a sense of calm and relaxation. The room would be lined with sound-absorbing materials, such as acoustic panels or a green wall, to reduce echo and create a peaceful atmosphere. The room could also incorporate sound-emitting materials, such as a water feature or a wind chime, to create a soothing soundscape.",
    "**Interactive Art Gallery**: Create an interactive art gallery where the walls and ceiling are covered in a high-resolution display screen. The screen would be programmed to display a variety of artwork, from traditional paintings to digital installations. The occupants could interact with the artwork by using gesture recognition technology or voice commands, allowing them to engage with the art in a more immersive and dynamic way. The gallery could also be designed to respond to the occupants' emotions, creating a unique and personalized experience. [/INST] "
