    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge food particles from the blades and container. After blending, users can simply add water and a drop of soap, press a button, and the blender will clean itself. This would save time and effort, making it easier for users to maintain hygiene.",
    "**Modular Blending System**: Create a modular blender with interchangeable blending containers and blades for different purposes. For example, users could swap out a standard blending jug for a personal-sized cup, a food processor bowl, or a smoothie attachment. Each module would come with specific blade designs optimized for various tasks like chopping, whipping, or emulsifying.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide and Scale**: Incorporate a touchscreen display that features a built-in recipe guide, allowing users to browse and select recipes directly from the blender. The blender could include an integrated scale that weighs ingredients as they are added, automatically adjusting the blending time and speed based on the recipe selected, thus minimizing prep time and waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Develop a blender made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics, and include energy-efficient motors that reduce power consumption. Additionally, the blender could feature a solar charging option for outdoor use, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-canceling technology that dampens the sound of the motor while blending. This could involve acoustic insulation and a specially designed motor casing that reduces vibrations. A quieter blender would be especially appealing for those who live in shared spaces or have young children."
