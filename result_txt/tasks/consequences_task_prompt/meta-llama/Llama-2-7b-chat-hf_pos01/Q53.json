    "Microorganisms would consume plastic, breaking it down into simpler organic compounds, just like they do with paper. This process would happen much faster, as plastic is more readily available to microorganisms than paper.",
    "The rate of biodegradation would depend on the type of plastic, with more biodegradable plastics breaking down more quickly than less biodegradable ones. For example, bioplastics made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane would break down faster than traditional plastics made from fossil fuels.",
    "The decomposition process would release methane and other greenhouse gases, potentially contributing to climate change. However, this could be mitigated by designing plastics that produce fewer greenhouse gases during the biodegradation process.",
    "Biodegradable plastics could become a valuable resource for soil fertility, as they would add organic matter and nutrients to the soil as they break down. This could lead to healthier soil and more productive crops.",
    "With plastic biodegrading as quickly as paper, there may be less need for plastic recycling facilities, as more plastic waste could be composted instead. This could reduce the energy and resources required for recycling, as well as the environmental impacts of plastic production."
