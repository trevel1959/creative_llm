    "**Dietary Restrictions:** A large family is likely to have a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, allergies, or gluten intolerance. Preparing a menu that caters to everyone's needs can be difficult and time-consuming. To minimize the risk of dissatisfaction, it's essential to gather dietary requirements ahead of time and plan dishes that accommodate everyone's needs, or label each dish with ingredient information so guests can make informed choices.",
    "**Seating Arrangements:** Arranging seating for a large family can be complicated, especially if there are guests with mobility issues or those who prefer to sit next to family members. Proper seating arrangements should be planned ahead of time to ensure everyone's comfort and enjoyment during the meal. It might be helpful to create a seating chart or ask guests about their preferences ahead of time.",
    "**Inadequate Table Space:** A large family meal may consume substantial amounts of table space, making it challenging to serve and share the different dishes. For a smooth dining experience, it might be necessary to bring in an extra table or utilize foldable tables to create additional surface area.",
    "**Spillage and Mess:** The holidays are often associated with a large number of ingredients, cooking utensils, and beverages. Ensuring that everything is kept organized and that spillage is minimized can prevent accidents and ensure a pleasant atmosphere. Using paper towels, serving platters, and setting up a clean-up and food service station can help in this task.",
    "**Entertainment for Children:** If the event includes children, it's crucial to have some form of entertainment to keep kids engaged and well-behaved during the dinner. This could include organizing games or activities, providing arts and crafts materials, or hiring a face painter or magician."
