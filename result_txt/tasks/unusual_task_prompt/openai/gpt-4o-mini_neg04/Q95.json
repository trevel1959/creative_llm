    "**Screen for Straining**: Use coffee filters as a makeshift strainer for small particles. For example, when making homemade broths or sauces, place a coffee filter over a bowl and pour the mixture through it. This will catch any solids while allowing the liquid to pass through, resulting in a smooth consistency.",
    "**Lens Cleaner**: Coffee filters are soft and lint-free, making them perfect for cleaning glasses, camera lenses, or screens. Instead of using paper towels that can leave scratches or lint, use a coffee filter to gently wipe away smudges and dirt.",
    "**Craft Projects**: Coffee filters can be transformed into beautiful art pieces. They can be dyed with food coloring or watercolor paint to create colorful flowers, butterflies, or even hanging decorations. Simply fold, cut, and glue them together to create unique crafts for home decor or gifts.",
    "**Odor Absorber**: Place baking soda or activated charcoal in a coffee filter, fold it up, and secure it with a rubber band. This homemade sachet can be placed in shoes, refrigerators, or closets to absorb unwanted odors, providing a natural and effective solution.",
    "**Travel Snack Holder**: When packing snacks for a trip, use coffee filters to portion out items like nuts, candies, or popcorn. They can be used as individual wrappers that keep snacks fresh without taking up much space. This is a great eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags."
