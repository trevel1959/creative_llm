    "A Virtual Reality Experience: Create a VR experience that allows users to journey through the life cycle of a raindrop, from its birth in a cloud to its eventual landing on the ground. Users could navigate through different environments, such as a cloud, a forest, and a city, and interact with other elements of nature, such as birds, trees, and buildings.",
    "A Augmented Reality Game: Develop an AR game that tracks the movement of the user's smartphone and projects a virtual raindrop onto the screen. The user must navigate the raindrop through different obstacles, such as birds, trees, and buildings, while avoiding getting caught in puddles or evaporating.",
    "A Short Film: Create a stop-motion animated short film that tells the story of a raindrop's journey from the sky to the ground. The film could be narrated by a voiceover and feature a catchy musical score.",
    "A Interactive Web App: Develop an interactive web app that allows users to simulate the journey of a raindrop through different environments, such as a forest, a city, and a desert. Users can click on different elements of the environment to learn more about the process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.",
    "A Immersive Theater Performance: Create an immersive theater performance that brings the audience into the world of a raindrop's journey. The performance could feature actors, projection mapping, and interactive elements, such as rain sensors that trigger different effects when the audience gets wet."
