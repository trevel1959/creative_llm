    "The cloning of extinct animals could lead to the revival of ecosystems that were once thriving with the presence of these species. This could help to restore the balance of nature and prevent the extinction of other species.",
    "Cloning extinct animals could also lead to the development of new medicines and treatments. For example, the study of extinct animals could reveal new genes and proteins that could be used to treat diseases.",
    "Cloning extinct animals could also have a significant impact on the entertainment industry. Imagine being able to see a real-life T-Rex or a Woolly Mammoth in a zoo or a theme park.",
    "The cloning of extinct animals could also have a significant impact on our understanding of evolution and the history of life on Earth. By studying the genetic makeup of extinct animals, we could gain new insights into how species evolved over time.",
    "Cloning extinct animals could also raise ethical questions about the use of technology and the preservation of nature. If we are able to clone extinct animals, should we be allowed to do so? And what are the implications of bringing back species that were once extinct?"
