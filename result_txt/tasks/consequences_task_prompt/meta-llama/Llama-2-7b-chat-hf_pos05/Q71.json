    "Overpopulation and resource depletion: If people were immortal, the population would continue to grow indefinitely, leading to overcrowding, resource depletion, and strain on the environment. This could result in a significant decrease in the quality of life for future generations.",
    "Loss of meaning and purpose: Immortality would eliminate the natural cycle of life and death, leading to a lack of meaning and purpose in life. People may struggle to find significance in their existence without the ability to leave a lasting legacy or make a difference in the world.",
    "Social and economic upheaval: The discovery of immortality could lead to a massive shift in societal values and structures. The traditional notion of retirement, inheritance, and succession would be rendered obsolete, causing economic and social disruption.",
    "Psychological impact: Living forever would be a profound psychological experience, and people may struggle to cope with the monotony and boredom of an endless existence. This could lead to mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and suicide.",
    "Ethical considerations: Immortality would raise complex ethical questions, such as who should have access to it, how it should be distributed, and the potential for exploitation. The wealthy and powerful may use their immortality to maintain their dominance over the rest of society, leading to a widening of the wealth gap."
