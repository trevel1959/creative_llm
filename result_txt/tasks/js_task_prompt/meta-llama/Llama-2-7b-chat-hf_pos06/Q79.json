    "Hoverbikes: A new form of transportation that combines the thrill of motorcycles with the convenience of personal airplanes. These vehicles would use magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground, allowing riders to travel quickly and smoothly over long distances without the need for roads or traffic. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Water-Walking: A transportation system that allows people to walk on water. This technology would use advanced hydrodynamics and pressure-sensitive pads to create a stable and safe surface for pedestrians to walk on, eliminating the need for roads or sidewalks. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Teleportation Tubes: A futuristic transportation system that uses advanced quantum entanglement technology to transport people from one location to another instantly. Users would step into a sealed tube and be teleported to their destination, eliminating the need for travel time or infrastructure. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Cloud Cars: A new form of transportation that harnesses the power of air currents to lift and propel vehicles. These vehicles would be lightweight and aerodynamic, allowing them to glide through the air with minimal effort. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "Gravity-Defying Bicycles: A transportation system that uses advanced gravitational technology to create a stable and smooth ride. These bicycles would use gravitational waves to counteract the forces of gravity, allowing riders to travel long distances without feeling any fatigue. Confidence Score: 0.9"
