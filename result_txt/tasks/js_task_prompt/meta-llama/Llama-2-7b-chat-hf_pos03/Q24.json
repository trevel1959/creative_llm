    "Floating Gardens: The city would have floating gardens that cover a significant portion of its surface. These gardens would provide a natural and sustainable source of food, oxygen, and beauty. The gardens would be designed to mimic the natural ecosystem, with diverse plant species, trees, and wildlife. The floating gardens would also help to purify the air and water, creating a healthier environment for the city's inhabitants.",
    "Vertical Farming: The city would have vertical farming structures that would allow for maximum space utilization. These structures would be designed to mimic the natural growth patterns of plants, with trees, shrubs, and crops growing in a symbiotic relationship. The vertical farming structures would also be equipped with advanced hydroponic and aeroponic systems, allowing for maximum crop yields and minimal water consumption.",
    "Solar-Powered Energy: The city would be powered entirely by solar energy, with solar panels integrated into the city's architecture. The solar panels would be designed to maximize energy production, with energy storage systems in place to ensure a stable and consistent power supply. The city would also have a smart grid system that would manage energy distribution and consumption, ensuring that energy is used efficiently and effectively.",
    "Water Recycling and Management: The city would have a comprehensive water recycling and management system. The system would involve the collection and treatment of rainwater, greywater, and blackwater, and their reuse in various ways throughout the city. The system would also include advanced water-saving technologies, such as low-flow toilets and showerheads, to minimize water waste.",
    "Bioluminescent Streets: The city would have bioluminescent streets that would provide a unique and sustainable source of lighting. The streets would be designed with a special type of concrete that would emit a soft, blue-green glow when exposed to light. This would eliminate the need for traditional streetlights, reducing energy consumption and creating a more peaceful and aesthetically pleasing environment."
