    "**Multi-Functional Table Surface**: Design a table assistant with a surface that doubles as a digital touchscreen. This touchscreen could display interactive elements such as calendars, reminders, or even virtual board games. It could also serve as a drawing pad for brainstorming sessions or note-taking. The surface could be pressure-sensitive, allowing users to draw or write with a stylus, and could connect to other devices for seamless integration.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Capabilities**: Incorporate AR technology into the table assistant, allowing users to project virtual images or information onto the table surface. For example, during a meal, users could project a menu or nutritional information about the food being served. During meetings, they could visualize data or 3D models relevant to their discussions, enhancing collaboration and engagement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Sources**: Develop the table assistant using sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, integrate solar panels into its design to power the device using renewable energy. This would not only reduce its carbon footprint but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Users could also receive notifications about their energy usage, encouraging them to adopt greener habits.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring Features**: Equip the table assistant with health monitoring sensors that can track users' vitals, such as heart rate or stress levels, through touch. This could be particularly useful during meals, where the assistant could provide insights into dietary choices or suggest stress-relief techniques. The data could sync with a health app, providing users with comprehensive health analytics over time.",
    "**Customizable Modular Design**: Create a table assistant with a modular design that allows users to customize its features based on their needs. For example, users could choose modules for different functions, such as a coffee maker, a wireless charger, or a mini fridge. This flexibility would cater to various lifestyles, whether for home use, office environments, or entertainment purposes, making it a versatile addition to any space."
