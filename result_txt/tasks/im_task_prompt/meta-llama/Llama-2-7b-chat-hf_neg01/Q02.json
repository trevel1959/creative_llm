    "Bicycle-Powered Generator: Create a bicycle that generates electricity as you pedal. This can be achieved through a small turbine or dynamo mechanism attached to the frame, which converts the kinetic energy of pedaling into electrical energy. This can be used to power small devices such as lights, phones, or even a portable charging station.",
    "Bicycle-Shaped Sunscreen: Design a bicycle-shaped sunscreen that provides maximum protection from the sun's harmful rays. The bicycle shape can be molded from a lightweight, flexible material that can be easily applied to the skin. The bicycle design can also include features such as a built-in fan to keep the sunscreen cool and comfortable to wear.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: Create a bicycle helmet with advanced safety features such as a built-in GPS tracker, collision detection system, and communication device. This helmet can help cyclists stay safe while riding by providing real-time location tracking, alerting emergency services in case of an accident, and allowing cyclists to communicate with other road users.",
    "Bicycle-Powered Food Processor: Design a bicycle-powered food processor that uses the pedaling motion of the bicycle to grind, chop, or blend food. This can be achieved through a gear system that converts the rotational motion of the pedals into a rotational motion of a food processing blade or grinder. This can be a great tool for campers, outdoor enthusiasts, or those who live in areas without access to electricity.",
    "Bicycle-Shaped Planter: Create a bicycle-shaped planter that can be used to grow herbs, vegetables, or flowers. The bicycle shape can be molded from a durable, water-resistant material such as plastic or metal, and can include features such as drainage holes, soil pockets, and a built-in irrigation system. This can be a unique and functional gardening tool that can be easily moved around the garden or yard."
