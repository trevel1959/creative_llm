    "**Innovative Corkscrew Design**: Create a new design for a corkscrew that integrates an adjustable arm which can adapt to different bottle sizes and shapes. This could be particularly useful for bottles with irregular shapes or larger bottles of wine. The adjustable arm would be designed with a locking mechanism to secure it in place at various lengths. Additionally, you could incorporate a built-in bottle opener for versatility.",
    "**Corkscrew as a Multi-Tool**: Develop a corkscrew that doubles as a tool for opening bottles as well as a tool for removing labels. The handle could have a detachable section that contains a blade for slicing through labels easily. This would save time and effort for those who frequently open multiple bottles of wine or other beverages, ensuring a clean, label-free bottle every time.",
    "**Portable Wine Opener System**: Design a compact, lightweight corkscrew that is perfect for travel or outdoor use. It could feature a retractable design, where the screw retracts back into the body of the corkscrew when not in use, making it easy to carry around. Additionally, the system could include a small, reusable foil cutter integrated into the handle, making it a complete solution for wine lovers on the go.",
    "**Smart Corkscrew with Technology Integration**: Create a corkscrew that pairs with a smartphone app to provide personalized wine recommendations based on the type of cork being used. The corkscrew could scan the cork using a QR code or RFID chip embedded within it, then relay the information to the app, which could suggest pairings, serving temperatures, and even recipes based on the specific wine. This would offer a unique and engaging experience for wine enthusiasts.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Corkscrew**: Design a corkscrew that utilizes sustainable materials and reduces waste. For example, the screw could be made from biodegradable plastic or bamboo, while the handle could be constructed from reclaimed wood. Additionally, the corkscrew could come with a refillable cartridge for the cork remover part, reducing the need for disposable parts. This would appeal to environmentally-conscious consumers looking for both functionality and sustainability in their products."
