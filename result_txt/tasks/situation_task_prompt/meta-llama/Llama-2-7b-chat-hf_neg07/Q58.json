    "Create a Bug Hotel: Build a multi-level habitat for insects using recycled materials like wood, bamboo, and straws. This would provide them with a safe and comfortable space to live, and help regulate their population.",
    "Insect-Friendly Gardens: Plant a variety of insect-attracting plants like lavender, marigolds, and basil in your garden. These plants would provide a food source for insects, and help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
    "Insect-Repelling Clothing: Develop clothing made from natural fabrics like cotton, wool, and silk that repel insects. This could be achieved by incorporating natural insect-repelling compounds like citronella, lemongrass, and lavender into the fabric.",
    "Bug-Bot Robotics: Develop small, autonomous robots that can hunt and remove pests from your home and garden. These robots could be equipped with sensors and AI algorithms that allow them to identify and target specific insects.",
    "Insect-Inspired Architecture: Design buildings and homes that incorporate natural elements like ventilation, lighting, and temperature control to create an environment that discourages pests. For example, homes with large windows and skylights could provide natural light and ventilation, making it less hospitable for insects."
