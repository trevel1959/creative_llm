    "**Bioluminescent Architecture**: Design a house that incorporates bioluminescent organisms like glowing mushrooms or plankton to create a sustainable and radiant lighting system. The walls and ceiling could be made of a specialized, transparent material that allows the organisms to thrive, while also providing a unique and mesmerizing ambiance. The bioluminescent organisms would not only reduce the need for artificial lighting but also create a natural, pulsing glow that responds to the surroundings.",
    "**3D-Printed Aerogel Structure**: Utilize 3D printing technology to create a house using aerogel, a lightweight, ultra-insulating material that is often used in space exploration. The aerogel structure would be printed layer by layer, allowing for complex geometries and a high level of customization. The aerogel's exceptional insulation properties would make the house extremely energy-efficient, and its lightweight nature would minimize the need for traditional building materials.",
    "**Self-Healing Concrete**: Develop a self-healing concrete that can repair cracks and damages autonomously. This could be achieved by incorporating microorganisms that produce calcite, a natural cement that fills in cracks and strengthens the concrete over time. The self-healing concrete would not only reduce maintenance costs but also provide a durable and long-lasting building material that adapts to changing environmental conditions.",
    "**Geodesic Dome with Inflatable Panels**: Design a geodesic dome structure with inflatable panels that can be made from a variety of materials, such as Kevlar or advanced polymers. The dome's unique shape would provide exceptional strength and stability, while the inflatable panels would allow for easy expansion and contraction. This design would be ideal for areas with extreme weather conditions, as the inflatable panels could be easily deflated during strong winds or storms.",
    "**Living Wall and Roof**: Create a house with a living wall and roof, covered in a lush, verdant ecosystem. The living wall would be composed of a variety of plants, trees, and microorganisms that work together to purify the air, regulate the climate, and provide insulation. The roof would be designed to mimic a natural forest canopy, with plants and trees that provide shade, reduce wind resistance, and create a habitat for local wildlife. This design would not only reduce the need for traditional building materials but also create a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem. [/INST] "
