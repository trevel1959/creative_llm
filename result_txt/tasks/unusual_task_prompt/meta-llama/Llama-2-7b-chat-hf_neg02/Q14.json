    "A smart stapler that uses AI to optimize stapling: This stapler would use sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect the type of paper being stapled and adjust the stapling pressure and angle accordingly. It would also be able to recognize when multiple sheets of paper are being stapled together and adjust the stapling pattern accordingly.",
    "A stapler with a built-in paper cutter: This stapler would have a small built-in paper cutter that would allow users to trim excess paper from their stapled documents. This would save time and effort compared to using a separate paper trimmer.",
    "A stapler with a built-in binder: This stapler would have a small built-in binder that could hold multiple stapled documents. This would allow users to easily organize and store their stapled documents in one place.",
    "A stapler that uses solar power: This stapler would use solar panels to generate electricity, allowing it to staple documents without the need for batteries or electricity. This would make it a great option for users who need to staple documents in remote or outdoor locations.",
    "A stapler that can staple multiple types of materials: This stapler would be able to staple a variety of materials, including paper, cardstock, and even lightweight fabrics. This would make it a versatile tool for users who need to staple a variety of materials for different projects."
