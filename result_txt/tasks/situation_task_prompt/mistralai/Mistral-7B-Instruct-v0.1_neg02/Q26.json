    "Use your sense: I would use my sense of smell to navigate. I would follow the scent of a river or a stream to determine my location. I would also use my sense of touch to feel the terrain and determine my direction.",
    "Use technology: If all maps and navigation systems disappeared, I would use technology to find my way. I would use my phone's GPS to get an idea of my location, and then use apps like Google Maps or Waze to find my way to my destination."
