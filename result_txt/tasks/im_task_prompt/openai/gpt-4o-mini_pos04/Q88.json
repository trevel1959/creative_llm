    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Foam Grip**: Design ski poles that can adjust their length with a simple twist mechanism. This would allow skiers to customize the height of the poles for different types of skiing (downhill, cross-country, or backcountry). Additionally, incorporating a memory foam grip would provide enhanced comfort, reducing hand fatigue during long runs and improving overall grip even in cold, wet conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Create ski poles made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This eco-friendly approach would not only appeal to environmentally conscious skiers but also reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional ski pole manufacturing. The design could include modular components that can be replaced easily if damaged, extending the life of the product.",
    "**Built-in Shock Absorption System**: Introduce ski poles with an integrated shock absorption system that helps reduce the impact on the wrists and arms during hard turns or jumps. This could involve a small hydraulic or spring mechanism that absorbs shock, making skiing more comfortable and less straining on the body, especially for beginners or those with prior injuries.",
    "**LED Lighting for Night Skiing**: Equip ski poles with built-in LED lights that illuminate the path ahead, making night skiing safer and more enjoyable. The lights could be adjustable in brightness and even have a flashing mode for visibility to others. This feature would enhance safety and allow skiers to enjoy the slopes even after sunset.",
    "**Interchangeable Tips for Different Terrains**: Design ski poles with interchangeable tips that can be swapped out based on the terrain. For instance, poles could come with tips specifically designed for hard-packed snow, soft powder, or even rocky terrain. This versatility would make the poles more functional and appealing to a wider range of skiers, from casual to extreme."
