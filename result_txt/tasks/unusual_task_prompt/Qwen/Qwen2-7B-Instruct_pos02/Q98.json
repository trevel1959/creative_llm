    "**Smart Power Strip for Energy Efficiency:** Design a power strip that integrates with smart home technology, allowing users to control and monitor the power usage of each connected device remotely through an app. This could help in saving energy by automatically turning off devices when not in use or scheduling power usage based on specific needs. ",
    "**Safety-Enhanced Surge Protector:** Create a power strip with added safety features such as child-proof switches, over-current protection, and fire-resistant materials. It could also include a warning system that alerts users when the strip is overloaded or when there's a surge in voltage, preventing potential damage to electronic devices.",
    "**USB Charging Hub with Built-in Wi-Fi Booster:** Develop a power strip that combines the functionality of a USB charging hub with that of a Wi-Fi signal booster. The strip would have multiple USB ports for charging devices and built-in antennas to amplify Wi-Fi signals. This idea is particularly useful for office spaces or large homes where Wi-Fi coverage might be weak.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip:** Incorporate wireless charging capabilities into the power strip design, allowing users to charge their compatible devices without the need for cables. The strip could have one or more wireless charging pads alongside traditional power outlets, making it convenient for people who frequently use multiple electronic devices.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring Power Strip:** Design a power strip that includes sensors capable of monitoring the health status of connected devices, like computers or medical equipment. This could provide real-time data on usage patterns, potential hardware issues, or energy consumption trends. The information could be displayed on a companion app, helping users manage their devices more efficiently and proactively."
