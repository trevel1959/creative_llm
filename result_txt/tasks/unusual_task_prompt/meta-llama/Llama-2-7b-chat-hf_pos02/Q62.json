    "\"Fresh Picks\" Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox that double as a mini-garden, allowing users to grow their own herbs, microgreens, or small vegetables. This lunchbox would come with a built-in watering system, a small container for the seeds, and a transparent lid for easy monitoring.",
    "Smart Lunchbox: Develop a lunchbox that can track the user's food intake and nutrient levels. This lunchbox would come with a built-in scanner that scans the barcodes of the food items placed inside, and provides real-time data on the user's nutrient intake. It could also suggest healthy alternatives or recipes based on the user's dietary needs.",
    "Temperature-Control Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox that can maintain a consistent temperature, whether it's hot or cold. This lunchbox would come with a built-in heating or cooling element, and a temperature control system that ensures the food inside stays at the desired temperature throughout the day.",
    "Modular Lunchbox: Design a lunchbox that allows users to customize their meals by swapping out different modules. For example, a user could start with a base module that includes a container for a main dish, and then add additional modules for sides, snacks, or even dessert. This would allow users to create a customized meal that meets their dietary needs and preferences.",
    "Augmented Reality Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox that utilizes augmented reality technology to provide an interactive and engaging meal experience. This lunchbox would come with a built-in screen and a companion app that displays fun and educational content, such as animated recipes, nutritional information, or games. The app could also allow users to interact with their food in new and creative ways, such as virtually \"tasting\" different ingredients or creating customized meal combinations."
