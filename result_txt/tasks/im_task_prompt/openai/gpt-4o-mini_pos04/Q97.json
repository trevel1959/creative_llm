    "**Multi-Function Leash with Built-in Storage**: Design a leash that features built-in compartments for storing essentials like poop bags, treats, and a collapsible water bowl. This would eliminate the need for carrying extra items while walking the dog. The storage compartments could be waterproof and easily accessible, ensuring that everything is organized and handy during walks.",
    "**Adjustable Length and Tension Control**: Create a leash that can easily adjust its length with a simple mechanism, allowing for quick changes between short and long lengths depending on the environment (e.g., crowded areas vs. open parks). Additionally, incorporate a tension control feature that allows owners to adjust the resistance based on the dogâ€™s pulling strength, promoting better control and comfort.",
    "**Reflective and Light-Up Leash**: Enhance safety during nighttime walks by integrating reflective materials and LED lights into the leash. The lights could be programmable to flash or stay steady, making the dog and owner visible to passing cars and pedestrians. The reflective materials would ensure visibility even in low-light conditions, providing an added layer of safety.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Shock Absorption**: Design an ergonomic handle that fits comfortably in the hand, featuring a shock absorption mechanism. This would help reduce strain on the owner's wrist and arm when the dog pulls or lunges. The handle could also include a grip-enhancing texture for better control, especially in wet conditions.",
    "**Training Leash with Clicker and Sound Feedback**: Develop a leash that includes an integrated clicker and sound feedback system to assist with training. When the owner clicks the button on the leash handle, it produces a sound that can be used for positive reinforcement during training sessions. This feature would allow for hands-free training cues while walking, enhancing the training experience for both the dog and owner."
