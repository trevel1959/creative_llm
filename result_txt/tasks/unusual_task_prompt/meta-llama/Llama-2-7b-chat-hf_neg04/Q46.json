This feature can provide relief for people who suffer from hot or cold flashes during the night.",
    "Pillowcase with aromatherapy properties: Create a pillowcase infused with essential oils that can provide a calming or invigorating scent during sleep.

This can help improve the quality of sleep and provide a more relaxing sleeping environment.",
    "Pillowcase with a built-in alarm clock: Design a pillowcase with a built-in alarm clock that can be set to wake the sleeper at a specific time.

When the alarm goes off, the display can light up to wake the sleeper.",
    "Pillowcase with a built-in massage function: Create a pillowcase with built-in massage nodes that can provide a gentle massage to the sleeper's neck and shoulders.

This can help relieve tension and improve the overall comfort of the sleeper."
