    "**Aquatic Forest**: This unique habitat would be a combination of a dense forest and a large, deep aquatic environment. The trees would be made of durable materials that can withstand water and provide shade for the inhabitants. These trees would be interconnected by bridges and platforms that allow animals to move freely between land and water. The aquatic part would have different zones - a clear section for swimming and playing, a murky area for hiding and hunting, and an underwater forest with sunken trees providing shelter and food sources. This habitat would be perfect for amphibious or semi-aquatic animals like otters, hippos, or even giant pandas adapted to swim.",
    "**Sky-Cliff Habitat**: For flying and climbing animals, this habitat would be built on a high cliff face, offering breathtaking views. The cliff would have ledges and overhangs that mimic natural rock formations. Suspended platforms, ropes, and nets would connect different levels, providing a vertical playground. The habitat would also include areas with high winds for gliding practice, and smaller spaces for rest and nesting. Birds, squirrels, and monkeys could thrive in such an environment.",
    "**Mimic Rainforest**: This habitat would be designed to mimic the lush, humid environment of a rainforest. It would have a complex network of tall, towering plants with vines and branches for climbing. The floor would be covered with rich soil and various types of plants to support a diverse ecosystem. Waterfalls, streams, and ponds would be included to simulate the natural environment, providing water sources and habitats for fish, frogs, and other aquatic creatures. The canopy would be home to birds, insects, and small mammals, while the ground level would support larger animals like deer or rhinos.",
    "**Ice Age Adventure**: This habitat would be set in a cold climate, featuring glaciers, ice caves, and snow-covered landscapes. Animals adapted to the cold, such as polar bears, penguins, and arctic foxes, would find this habitat ideal. The habitat would include areas for ice climbing, frozen lakes for swimming and playing, and caves for shelter. There would also be a special zone for teaching and training young animals to survive in the harsh conditions.",
    "**Subterranean Maze**: For burrowing and digging animals, this habitat would be constructed underground. It would feature vast tunnels and chambers connected by passageways. The habitat would be designed with different terrains, from sandy deserts to muddy swamps, to mimic the natural habitats of these animals. It would"
