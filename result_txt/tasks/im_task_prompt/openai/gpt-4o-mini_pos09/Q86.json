    "**Modular Design for Customization**:    Develop a modular wheelchair design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their needs. For instance, users could choose between different types of seating, wheels for various terrains (e.g., rough, smooth, or all-terrain), and accessories like storage compartments or sunshades. This would provide a personalized experience and improve comfort and functionality.",
    "**Wearable Exoskeleton Integration**:    Create a hybrid wheelchair that can integrate with a wearable exoskeleton. This would allow users to transition between sitting and standing positions effortlessly. The exoskeleton could assist with mobility when the user wants to walk short distances or perform daily activities, promoting independence and physical health.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Sources**:    Design wheelchairs using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites, to minimize environmental impact. Additionally, integrate solar panels into the wheelchair frame to power electronic components or charge devices, making it eco-friendly and self-sustaining.",
    "**Enhanced Comfort Features**:    Introduce smart seating technology that adapts to the userâ€™s body temperature and pressure points. This could involve using materials that regulate heat or provide massage functions to reduce discomfort during long periods of sitting. Sensors could monitor posture and provide feedback or alerts to encourage proper alignment.",
    "**Integrated Communication and Entertainment System**:    Equip wheelchairs with a built-in communication system that includes voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. This would allow users to communicate with others hands-free. Additionally, integrate entertainment options like a tablet mount, speakers, and streaming services to provide leisure activities while on the go."
