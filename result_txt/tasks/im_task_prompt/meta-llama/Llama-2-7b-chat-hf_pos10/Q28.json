    "Bicycle Helmet with Built-In Airbags: Design a helmet with inflatable airbags that deploy in the event of a crash, providing extra protection for the rider's head and brain. The airbags would be integrated into the helmet's design, hidden within compartments until needed. This innovative feature would give riders an added layer of safety and peace of mind while on the road.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet with Navigation and Safety Features: Create a helmet with a built-in GPS and navigation system, allowing riders to navigate their route and stay on course without having to look at their phone. Additionally, the helmet could include features like collision detection, automatic emergency alerts, and road hazard warnings to help keep riders safe.",
    "Customizable Bicycle Helmet Designs: Design a helmet that allows riders to customize their helmet's design with interchangeable shells, decals, and colors. This would allow riders to personalize their helmet to match their personality and style, while still providing the same level of safety and protection.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Speaker System: Create a helmet with a built-in speaker system that allows riders to listen to music or take hands-free calls while riding. The speakers could be integrated into the helmet's design, with controls located on the handlebars or on the helmet itself. This would allow riders to enjoy their favorite tunes or stay connected with friends and family without having to stop or remove their helmet.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Energy Harvesting Technology: Design a helmet that harnesses the energy generated from the rider's movement and converts it into electrical energy, which could be used to charge the rider's phone or other devices. This innovative feature would not only provide a convenient way to charge devices on the go, but it would also help reduce the environmental impact of the helmet by reducing the need for batteries."
