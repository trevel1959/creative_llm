    "Develop a network of bike lanes: If all roads disappeared, the most efficient way to move around would be to develop a network of bike lanes. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it would allow people to travel quickly and easily throughout the town or city. The bike lanes could be designed to be as safe and convenient as possible, with features like bike stations, bike stops, and bike bumpers to prevent accidents.",
    "Create a system of underground tunnels: Another option would be to create a system of underground tunnels that would allow people to travel quickly and easily throughout the town or city. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it would provide a safe and convenient way to move around. The tunnels could be designed to be as comfortable as possible, with features like stations, bike bumpers, and air conditioning.",
    "Implement a shuttle service: A shuttle service could be implemented to transport people around the town or city. This could be done using electric or hybrid vehicles, which would be more environmentally friendly than traditional gas-powered vehicles. The shuttle service could be designed to be as efficient as possible, with routes that cover the major areas of the town or city.",
    "Develop a network of pedestrian bridges: If all roads disappeared, the most efficient way to move around would be to develop a network of pedestrian bridges. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it would allow people to travel quickly and easily throughout the town or city. The pedestrian bridges could be designed to be as safe and convenient as possible, with features like pedestrian bumpers, pedestrian stops, and pedestrian signals.",
    "Implement a system of autonomous vehicles: Autonomous vehicles could be implemented to transport people around the town or city. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, but it would provide a safe and convenient way to move around. The autonomous vehicles could be designed to be as efficient as possible, with routes that cover the major areas of the town or city. Additionally, the vehicles could be designed to be more environmentally friendly than traditional gas-powered vehicles."
