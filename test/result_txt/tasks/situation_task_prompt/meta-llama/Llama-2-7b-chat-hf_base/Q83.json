    "Sleeping Pods: With no nighttime, people could use sleeping pods that are similar to tiny capsules. These pods would be equipped with a special lighting system that mimics the natural light-dark cycle, allowing for a restful sleep. The pods could also be equipped with a sound system that plays calming music or nature sounds to help people relax.",
    "Artificial Daylight: To simulate daylight, cities could use artificial lighting systems that mimic the natural light of the sun. This could be achieved through the use of LED lights that change color and intensity to simulate the different times of day. This would allow people to maintain a normal sleep schedule and avoid the disruptions caused by the absence of nighttime.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Regulation: With the absence of nighttime, people could use special devices that regulate their circadian rhythms. These devices would use light and sound to help the body's internal clock adjust to the new sleep schedule. This could involve using a special light therapy that mimics the natural light-dark cycle, or using sound therapy that plays specific frequencies to help the body relax and fall asleep.",
    "Sleeping in Virtual Reality: With the absence of nighttime, people could use virtual reality technology to simulate the experience of sleeping. This could involve wearing a VR headset that creates a virtual environment that mimics the feeling of sleeping, complete with the sounds and sensations of a peaceful night's rest. This could be especially helpful for people who have trouble sleeping due to noise or other environmental factors.",
    "Community Sleeping Areas: In the absence of nighttime, communities could come together to create shared sleeping areas. These areas could be designed to mimic the natural environment, with comfortable beds and soft lighting. This would allow people to sleep in a social setting, while still getting the rest they need. This could also provide an opportunity for social interaction and community building, as people would be able to talk and relax together before sleeping."
