    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes ultrasonic waves or a specialized cleaning solution that can be added to the kettle. Once activated, the kettle would vibrate at specific frequencies to break down mineral deposits and other residues, making maintenance effortless. This would not only extend the life of the kettle but also ensure that every brew tastes fresh without the buildup of limescale.",
    "**Built-in Infuser for Herbal Teas**: Design the kettle with a detachable built-in infuser that can steep herbal teas or loose-leaf teas directly in the kettle. Users can add their desired herbs or tea leaves into the infuser, set the steeping time and temperature, and let the kettle do the work. This would simplify the brewing process, allowing users to enjoy freshly steeped tea without the need for separate teapots or infusers.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Implement an interactive LED display on the kettle that provides real-time information about the water temperature, brewing time, and even educational content about different types of teas and their optimal brewing conditions. Users could tap on the display to access tips, recipes, or even a countdown timer for steeping their favorite teas. This feature could enhance the user experience by making it more engaging and informative.",
    "**Multi-Functional Base Station**: Create a base station for the kettle that serves multiple functions. This base could include a wireless charging pad for smartphones, a built-in speaker for playing music or podcasts while waiting for the water to boil, and a digital clock with alarms for reminders to brew. This all-in-one solution would declutter kitchen counters and provide added convenience for users.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Source**: Develop a version of the electric kettle that can be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels. Users could have the option to connect the kettle to a solar charger, allowing them to boil water using clean energy. This feature would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainable living practices."
