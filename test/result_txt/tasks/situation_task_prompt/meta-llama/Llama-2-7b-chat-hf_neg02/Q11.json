    "Use Handwritten Notes and Diagrams: In the event of a global computer crash, I would rely on my trusty notebook and pen to jot down important information and ideas. I would take detailed handwritten notes during meetings, lectures, and brainstorming sessions, and use diagrams and mind maps to organize my thoughts. This approach would allow me to continue working and learning without relying on technology.",
    "Utilize Memory Techniques: I would use various memory techniques such as repetition, visualization, and association to commit important information to memory. For example, I could repeat key phrases or concepts out loud, visualize them in my mind, or associate them with familiar objects or events. This would enable me to retain knowledge and information even if computers are unavailable.",
    "Collaborate with Others: In the absence of computers, I would turn to my colleagues and peers for assistance. I would work with them to brainstorm solutions, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. This would allow us to leverage our collective knowledge and skills to overcome the challenges posed by a global computer crash.",
    "Use Analog Tools and Devices: I would seek out analog tools and devices to help me continue my work and studies. For instance, I could use a whiteboard or chalkboard to create diagrams and illustrate concepts, or a flipchart to organize notes and ideas. I could also use a calculator or abacus to perform calculations and computations, or a typewriter or pen and paper to write and edit documents.",
    "Develop Alternative Forms of Expression: In the event of a global computer crash, I would explore alternative forms of expression to communicate my ideas and thoughts. For example, I could use storytelling, poetry, or music to convey my ideas and emotions. I could also use visual art, such as drawing, painting, or sculpture, to express myself. By embracing these alternative forms of expression, I could continue to create and communicate in a world without computers."
