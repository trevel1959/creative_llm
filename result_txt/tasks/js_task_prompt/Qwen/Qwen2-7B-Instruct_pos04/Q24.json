    "**Sustainable Ecosystem Integration**: Design a city that seamlessly integrates sustainable ecosystems into its infrastructure. This includes green roofs, vertical gardens, and urban farms that produce food for the community. The city's buildings are designed to maximize natural light, reducing energy consumption, and are constructed using eco-friendly materials. Rainwater harvesting systems are integrated to supply water for irrigation and toilet flushing, minimizing the use of potable water.",
    "**Transportation Network**: Implement a multi-modal transportation system that prioritizes public transport, cycling, and pedestrian paths over private vehicles. High-frequency buses, dedicated bike lanes, and extensive footpaths encourage low-carbon commuting options. The city is also equipped with a comprehensive network of charging stations for electric vehicles and drones for local deliveries, reducing congestion and air pollution.",
    "**Digital Accessibility and Inclusion**: Create a digital infrastructure that enhances accessibility for all residents, regardless of age or disability. This includes smart homes that can be controlled by voice commands, accessible public spaces with technology that aids the visually impaired, and an AI-powered customer service center for immediate assistance. The city's Wi-Fi network is omnipresent, ensuring everyone has equal access to information and services.",
    "**Cultural and Educational Hub**: Establish the city as a vibrant cultural and educational center, promoting creativity and lifelong learning. This involves integrating art into public spaces, creating museums that showcase local history and global cultures, and fostering innovation through tech parks and startup incubators. Schools and universities are at the heart of the city, offering a blend of traditional and digital education methods to prepare citizens for the future workforce.",
    "**Resilient Infrastructure**: Design the city to withstand natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and extreme weather conditions. This includes building earthquake-resistant structures, implementing flood management systems, and creating green belts that act as windbreaks during storms. The city's critical infrastructure, like power grids and communication networks, is redundant and resilient, ensuring continuous service during emergencies. Additionally, emergency response plans are integrated into daily city operations, making the city proactive rather than reactive in disaster situations."
