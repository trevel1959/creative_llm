    "Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience that simulates the sensation of having a rubber hand. Users can put on a VR headset and be transported to a virtual environment where they see a digital representation of their own hand, but it's made of rubber. They can then perform various actions with the virtual rubber hand, such as picking up objects or waving goodbye, and feel a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual limb. This can help people with body integrity identity disorder (BIID) or those who have experienced hand amputations to better understand and accept their own bodies.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Design an interactive art installation that incorporates a rubber hand as the central element. Visitors can walk up to a large, transparent box with a rubber hand inside, and use sensors to manipulate the hand's movements. As they move the hand, the installation responds by creating a corresponding movement in the real-life rubber hand, creating a disorienting and immersive experience. The installation can also include sounds, lights, and other sensory elements to enhance the overall experience.",
    "Sensory Deprivation Tank: Develop a sensory deprivation tank that uses a rubber hand as the primary element. The tank would be designed to isolate the user's senses, creating a state of deep relaxation and sensory deprivation. The rubber hand would be placed inside the tank, and users would be able to interact with it through a series of sensors and actuators. As they touch, move, and manipulate the rubber hand, they would experience a range of sensations, including temperature changes, pressure, and vibrations, which can help to induce a meditative state.",
    "Interactive Toy: Create an interactive toy that allows children to play with a rubber hand. The toy could take the form of a rubber hand puppet that can be manipulated by the child through a series of strings or sensors. As the child moves the puppet, the rubber hand would respond with corresponding movements, creating a fun and engaging way for children to learn about the concept of body ownership and self-awareness.",
    "Therapeutic Tool: Develop a therapeutic tool that utilizes a rubber hand as a central element. The tool could be used to"
