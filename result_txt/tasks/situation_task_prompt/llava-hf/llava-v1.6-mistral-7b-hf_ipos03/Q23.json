    "**Voice Recording**: If you're in a meeting or need to jot down quick notes, you could use a voice recorder app on your smartphone. You can dictate your thoughts, and the app will transcribe them into text for you.",
    "**Corded Notebook**: If pens and pencils have disappeared, you could use a corded notebook. This would allow you to write with a pen that doesn't require ink, and you could carry a spare cord for the pen.",
    "**Inkless Pen**: In a world without ink, an inkless pen would be a valuable tool. These pens use a special type of ink that doesn't dry out, allowing you to write for extended periods without needing to refill.",
    "**Chalkboard and Chalk**: In a pinch, you could use a chalkboard and chalk. Chalk is not a writing instrument, but it can be used to write on a chalkboard. This could be a traditional chalkboard or a dry-erase board.",
    "**Stencils and Paint**: You could use stencils and paint to create your notes. This would require a surface to paint on, such as a canvas or a piece of paper, but it would allow you to create detailed drawings and designs."
