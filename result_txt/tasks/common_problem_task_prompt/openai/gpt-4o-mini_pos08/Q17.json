    "**Budget Overruns**: Organizing the Olympics can strain a cityâ€™s finances, leading to potential budget overruns. This could arise from unforeseen expenses related to construction delays, security enhancements, or operational costs. To address this issue, the organizing committee could adopt a transparent budgeting process and allocate a contingency fund to manage unexpected costs. Additionally, they could seek sponsorships and partnerships to share financial responsibilities.",
    "**Security Threats**: The Olympics attract a global audience, making them a potential target for security threats, including terrorism. The host city must develop a comprehensive security plan that includes collaboration with national and international law enforcement agencies. This could involve advanced surveillance systems, thorough screening processes at venues, and increased presence of security personnel to ensure the safety of participants and spectators.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of Olympic venues and infrastructure can have a significant environmental impact, including habitat destruction, increased pollution, and waste generation. To combat this, the host city could implement sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials for construction, creating green spaces, and promoting recycling and waste reduction initiatives during the games. They could also commit to offsetting carbon emissions generated by the event.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: The Olympics bring together diverse cultures, and misunderstandings or insensitivity can lead to tensions among participants and spectators. To foster a respectful environment, the organizing committee could develop cultural awareness programs for volunteers and staff, highlighting the importance of inclusivity and respect for different traditions. Additionally, they could showcase local culture through events and exhibitions to promote understanding.",
    "**Health Concerns**: Large gatherings pose health risks, especially in the wake of pandemics or outbreaks of diseases. The host city must have a robust health and safety plan that includes measures for disease prevention, emergency medical services, and clear communication about health protocols. This could involve regular health screenings for athletes, vaccination drives, and the establishment of quarantine protocols if necessary."
