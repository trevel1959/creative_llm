    "Organizational complexities: Coordinating a global fundraising campaign involves multiple stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare professionals, donors, and volunteers. Ensuring that all parties are coordinated and informed can be a logistical nightmare. This may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which could negatively affect the success of the campaign.",
    "Language barriers: A global fundraising campaign needs to be accessible to people from all around the world. This may require materials and communications to be translated into multiple languages, which could be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, language barriers may make it challenging to reach some potential donors and volunteers.",
    "Fraudulent activity: With large amounts of money being raised, there is always the risk of fraudulent behavior from donors or volunteers. This is another challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure that the funds are being used ethically and effectively.",
    "Competition with other causes: There are many worthy causes competing for donations, which may make it challenging to gain attention and support for a cancer research fundraising campaign. This could lead to a lack of funding or public interest.",
    "Political and regulatory challenges: Different countries have different laws and regulations around fundraising and charitable activities. Navigating these differences can be another challenge, as failure to comply with local laws may result in penalties or other negative consequences."
