    "**Inflatable Pillow Alternative:** You could use an inflatable device or mattress as a pillow substitute. These devices can be easily deflated for storage and inflated when needed. They provide the necessary support to rest your head and neck comfortably, similar to a pillow.",
    "**Custom-Fitted Head Rest:** Utilize a custom-fitted headrest designed to support the head and neck. This could be made from a variety of materials such as foam, memory foam, or even a soft, pliable material that conforms to the shape of your head. It should be adjustable in height and angle to suit individual preferences.",
    "**Water Bottle Pillow:** An innovative solution would be to use a water bottle filled with water as a makeshift pillow. The weight of the water bottle provides adequate support, while the flexible plastic allows it to mold slightly to the shape of your head. To prevent leakage, ensure the bottle is securely sealed and consider wrapping it in a towel or cloth for added comfort.",
    "**Foam Board Pillow:** Cut a piece of thick foam board to the desired size and shape of a pillow. This can be easily cut using a utility knife or a hot wire cutter. Cover the foam board with a soft, breathable fabric, such as cotton or fleece, to make it more comfortable against your skin. This DIY pillow is lightweight, portable, and can be customized to fit your needs.",
    "**Wearable Pillow:** Design a wearable pillow that fits around your neck like a collar. This could be made from a stretchy, breathable material, such as neoprene or spandex. Inside the collar, place a cushion or foam insert to provide support for the head. This design allows you to sleep comfortably without worrying about rolling onto your back and losing your pillow. Additionally, it keeps the pillow close to your body, preventing it from being kicked off during the night."
