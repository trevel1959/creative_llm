    "Carrier Pigeons: Using carrier pigeons as a means of long-distance communication would be a unique and nostalgic approach. Trained pigeons could be equipped with small messages or documents, and released at designated locations to deliver the messages to their intended recipients. This method would be reliable and secure, as pigeons are known to be fast and agile flyers, able to cover long distances with ease.",
    "Telegraph Poles: In the era of non-functional phones, a new form of communication could emerge using telegraph poles as a means of transmitting messages over long distances. This method would involve attaching small, lightweight message containers to the telegraph poles, which could be pulled or pushed by hand to transmit messages. The containers could be designed with a simple pulley system, allowing multiple messages to be transmitted simultaneously, and the system could be expanded to include a network of telegraph poles across a region or even a country.",
    "Homing Pigeon Network: Building on the idea of using pigeons for communication, a homing pigeon network could be established, where trained pigeons are used to carry messages between different locations. The network would involve a series of pigeon stations, each equipped with a team of pigeons and a system for receiving and dispatching messages. The pigeons would be trained to fly between the stations, carrying messages in small containers attached to their legs. This method would provide a reliable and efficient means of communication, as pigeons are known to be able to fly long distances and find their way back home.",
    "Smoke Signals: In a world without phones, smoke signals could become a popular means of communication. Different types of smoke signals could be used to convey different messages, such as a puff of smoke to indicate a short message or a longer trail of smoke to convey more complex information. This method would be simple, yet effective, as smoke signals can be seen from a distance and are difficult to ignore.",
    "Mirror Signals: Another creative method of communication in a world without phones would be to use mirrors to reflect light signals between locations. This method would involve positioning mirrors in strategic locations to reflect light signals between them, allowing messages to be transmitted over long distances. The mirrors could be arranged in a network, with each mirror reflecting the"
