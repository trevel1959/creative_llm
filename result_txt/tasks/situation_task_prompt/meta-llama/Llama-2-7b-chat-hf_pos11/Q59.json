    "Build a Solar Panel Array: Create a network of solar panel arrays across the sky to harness the energy of the sun. These panels could be designed to rotate and adjust their angle to maximize exposure to sunlight, ensuring a consistent and reliable source of energy.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a system of cloud-based lighting that can mimic the effects of sunlight. This could involve using advanced LED technology to create a soft, diffuse glow that can illuminate the sky and provide sufficient light for daily activities.",
    "Sun-Gathering Drones: Deploy a fleet of drones equipped with solar panels to gather sunlight from across the sky. These drones could be programmed to fly in a grid pattern, covering the entire sky and providing a consistent source of energy.",
    "Sky-Based Reflectors: Create a network of reflective surfaces in the sky that can concentrate sunlight onto specific areas. This could involve using a combination of mirrors and lenses to focus sunlight onto designated areas, providing a more targeted and efficient source of energy.",
    "Time-Shifted Sunlight: Develop a technology that can store and release sunlight at a later time. This could involve using advanced batteries or other energy storage devices to capture sunlight during periods of peak sunlight and release it during periods of cloud cover, providing a consistent source of energy."
