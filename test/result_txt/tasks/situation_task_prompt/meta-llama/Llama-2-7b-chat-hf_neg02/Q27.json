    "Window Ventilation System: One creative solution to regulate indoor temperature without heaters or air conditioners is to install a window ventilation system. This system involves installing specialized windows that can open and close automatically to control airflow and temperature. When the temperature inside the building gets too hot or too cold, the windows can open to allow fresh air to enter or hot air to escape, respectively. This system can be powered by solar panels or a small fan to ensure energy efficiency.",
    "Thermal Mass Storage: Another creative solution is to use thermal mass storage, which involves using materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete or brick, to absorb and release heat. These materials can be placed in strategic locations throughout the building, such as in walls or floors, and can help to regulate the indoor temperature. When the temperature drops, the thermal mass can release heat, and when it rises, it can absorb heat, providing a stable and consistent temperature.",
    "Greenhouse Effect: A third creative solution is to create a greenhouse effect within the building by using plants and other materials to trap heat. This can be done by placing plants with large leaves, such as ferns or ivy, in areas of the building that receive the most sunlight. The plants can absorb heat during the day and release it at night, providing a stable and consistent temperature. Additionally, materials with high thermal mass, such as soil or gravel, can be placed around the plants to further trap heat.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Evaporative cooling is a creative solution that involves using water to cool the air. This can be done by placing a wet cloth or sponge in a fan to blow air over it, causing the water to evaporate and cool the air. This process can be repeated throughout the building to provide a cooling effect without the need for heaters or air conditioners. Additionally, this system can be powered by solar panels to ensure energy efficiency.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Finally, a passive solar design can be used to regulate indoor temperature without the need for heaters or air conditioners. This involves designing the building to take advantage of natural sunlight and temperature fluctuations. For example, windows can be placed on south-facing walls to allow sunlight to enter during the winter months, while north-f"
