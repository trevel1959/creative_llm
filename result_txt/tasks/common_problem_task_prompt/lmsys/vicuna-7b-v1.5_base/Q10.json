    "Design disagreements: Another common problem that can arise during a remodeling project is design disagreements between the homeowner and the contractor or designer. This can occur when the homeowner has a specific vision in mind, but the contractor or designer has a different approach. To mitigate this problem, homeowners can hire a designer or contractor with a similar aesthetic and communicate their vision clearly from the start.",
    "Unforeseen complications: Remodeling a home can also involve unforeseen complications, such as structural issues or unexpected plumbing or electrical problems. To mitigate this problem, homeowners can hire a contractor with experience in the specific type of remodeling they are undertaking and conduct a thorough inspection of the property before beginning the project.",
    "Schedule delays: Schedule delays can be a common problem during a remodeling project, particularly if the project involves working around other tenants or occupants of the property. To mitigate this problem, homeowners can hire a contractor with a proven track record of completing projects on time and create a detailed schedule with clear milestones and deadlines.",
    "Permitting and zoning issues: Remodeling a home can also involve permitting and zoning issues, particularly if the project involves changing the use of a property or making significant changes to the structure. To mitigate this problem, homeowners can hire a contractor with experience in obtaining permits and working with local zoning boards and create a detailed plan that complies with all relevant regulations.",
    "Material shortages: Material shortages can be a common problem during a remodeling project, particularly if the project involves a lot of custom or specialty materials. To mitigate this problem, homeowners can work with their contractor to create a detailed materials list and order materials in advance to avoid delays."
