    "Take the escalators: If there are escalators within the skyscraper, they could be used as an alternative means of transportation. Escalators are usually located on the same floor as the elevators and can be used to ascend or descend.",
    "Use the fire escape: Fire escapes are usually located on the outside of the building and can be used to access higher floors if the elevators are not working. Fire escapes are typically designed to provide a safe and stable means of evacuation in case of an emergency, so they would still be functional.",
    "Ride out the elevator malfunction: If the elevator malfunction is temporary, it may be possible to wait for the issue to be resolved before attempting to use the elevator again. This could involve finding a nearby place to sit or lie down, such as a nearby bench or desk, until the elevator is back in working order.",
    "Ask for help: If the elevator malfunction is severe or if the individual is unable to safely navigate the stairs or escalators, it may be necessary to ask for help from a colleague or security personnel. They may be able to assist in finding an alternative means of transportation or guiding the individual to their destination.",
    "Use a portable staircase: In some cases, portable staircases or scaffolding may be available to assist in accessing higher floors if the elevators are not working. These can be rented or purchased and set up by trained professionals to provide a safe and stable means of transportation."
