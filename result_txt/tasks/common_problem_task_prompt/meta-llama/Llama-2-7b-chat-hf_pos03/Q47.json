    "Modular Design: Create a computer from scratch by designing and building individual modules, such as the motherboard, CPU, memory, and storage, and then connecting them to form a complete system. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization, as users can choose the specific components they want and need.",
    "3D Printed Case: Design and print a custom case for the computer using 3D printing technology. The case can be tailored to fit the specific components and provide optimal cooling and aesthetics. This approach allows for a unique and personalized design that is both functional and visually appealing.",
    "Open-Source Hardware: Design and build a computer from scratch using open-source hardware, which allows users to access and modify the source code and design files. This approach fosters collaboration and innovation, as users can contribute to the development and improvement of the hardware.",
    "Solar Powered: Build a computer that runs entirely on solar power, using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity and store it in a battery. This approach provides a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for computing, reducing the reliance on traditional power sources and minimizing the carbon footprint of the computer.",
    "Shape-Shifting Design: Design a computer that can change its shape and form to adapt to different environments and tasks. For example, the computer could have a flat, compact design for portability, but then expand into a more complex and powerful configuration when in use. This approach allows for greater versatility and adaptability in the design of the computer."
