    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**:    - Design a paintbrush with a magnetic system that allows artists to easily switch between different brush heads (flat, round, filbert, etc.) without needing multiple brushes. This would save space and allow for seamless transitions between different techniques. The handle could also have an adjustable grip to cater to various hand sizes and preferences.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Paintbrush**:    - Develop a paintbrush that features a built-in cleaning mechanism. After use, the artist can simply place the brush in a special container that uses ultrasonic waves to clean the bristles without damaging them. This would eliminate the hassle of cleaning brushes manually, allowing artists to spend more time creating rather than cleaning.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Pressure Sensitivity**:    - Create a paintbrush that has an ergonomic handle designed for comfort during extended use, along with pressure sensitivity technology. This would allow artists to control the thickness of their strokes based on how hard they press the brush against the canvas. The brush could also vibrate slightly to provide tactile feedback, enhancing the painting experience.",
    "**Multi-Functional Paintbrush with Built-in Palette**:    - Imagine a paintbrush that has a small, retractable palette integrated into its handle. Artists could store a small amount of paint within the handle, allowing for quick access to colors without needing a separate palette. The palette could have a mixing area, and the brush could feature a small spatula on the opposite end for mixing paints or applying texture.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Paintbrush**:    - Develop a paintbrush that incorporates temperature control to help artists work with different types of paint more effectively. For example, the brush could warm up to maintain the fluidity of acrylics or cool down to thicken oil paints. This would allow for better control over the paint's consistency and drying time, leading to more precise applications."
