    "**Smart Lawn Mower with Augmented Reality Guidance**: Develop a smart lawn mower that uses AR technology to guide the user through the mowing process. The mower would be equipped with a camera and a display screen that projects a virtual representation of the lawn, highlighting areas that need attention. The user can then use their smartphone or tablet to view a virtual representation of the lawn, receive real-time feedback on their mowing progress, and even receive suggestions for improvement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Lawn Mower with Integrated Composting System**: Design a lawn mower that not only cuts the grass but also collects and composts the clippings, reducing waste and creating a nutrient-rich fertilizer for the lawn. The mower would have a built-in composting system that breaks down the clippings into a fine powder, which can then be spread evenly across the lawn.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Built-in Weather Station**: Create a lawn mower that also functions as a portable weather station, providing users with real-time weather data and forecasts. The mower would be equipped with sensors that measure temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental factors, allowing users to make informed decisions about their lawn care.",
    "**Robotic Lawn Mower with AI-Powered Navigation**: Develop a robotic lawn mower that uses AI to navigate and map the lawn, ensuring a precise and efficient mowing experience. The mower would be equipped with sensors and cameras that detect obstacles, slopes, and other features, allowing it to adapt its path and avoid any potential hazards.",
    "**Lawn Mower with Integrated Solar Panel and Battery**: Design a lawn mower that runs on solar power, reducing the user's carbon footprint and operating costs. The mower would be equipped with a solar panel that charges a built-in battery, allowing users to mow their lawn without the need for fossil fuels. The mower would also have a regenerative braking system, capturing energy generated during braking and storing it in the battery for later use."
