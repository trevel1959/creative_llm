    "Communication issues: Deep-sea exploration missions can be extremely remote, and communication with the surface can be challenging. If communication equipment malfunctions or there is a loss of signal, it can be extremely dangerous for the divers.",
    "Navigation difficulties: Deep-sea exploration missions require precise navigation to avoid hazards and find the desired location. If the navigation equipment malfunctions or the divers get lost, it can lead to dangerous situations.",
    "Weather conditions: Deep-sea exploration missions are often affected by unpredictable weather conditions. Strong currents, storms, and high waves can make it difficult for divers to complete their tasks and return safely.",
    "Limited visibility: Deep-sea exploration missions often have limited visibility due to the depth and water pressure. This can make it difficult for divers to see potential hazards and navigate safely.",
    "Diver health issues: Deep-sea exploration missions can expose divers to extreme conditions, such as high pressure and cold temperatures. These conditions can lead to health issues, such as decompression sickness or hypothermia, which can be life-threatening."
