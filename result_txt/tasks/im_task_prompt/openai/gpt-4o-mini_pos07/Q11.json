    "**Flavor Infuser with Smart Sensors**: Design a water bottle that includes a built-in flavor infuser compartment. Users can add fruits, herbs, or tea leaves to enhance the taste of their water. Smart sensors could monitor the infusion process and send notifications to the user's smartphone when the flavor reaches its optimal level, allowing for a perfectly flavored drink every time.",
    "**Temperature Control System**: Develop a water bottle that incorporates a double-walled vacuum insulation with an embedded temperature control system. Users could set their desired temperature (cold or hot) via a mobile app, and the bottle would maintain that temperature for hours. This feature could be particularly appealing for those who want their drinks at a specific temperature throughout the day.",
    "**Integrated Hydration Tracker**: Create a water bottle that tracks hydration levels through an embedded sensor. This sensor would measure the amount of water consumed and sync with a smartphone app to provide personalized hydration goals and reminders. The app could also analyze activity levels and weather conditions to adjust hydration recommendations accordingly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Modular Design**: Introduce a modular water bottle made from biodegradable materials. This bottle would consist of separate parts that can be replaced individually, such as the lid, body, and straw. This approach not only reduces waste but also allows users to customize their bottle with different colors and designs, promoting sustainability and personal expression.",
    "**Built-in Water Purification System**: Equip the water bottle with a portable water purification system that uses a combination of filtration and UV sterilization. Users could fill the bottle from any water source, and with the push of a button, the built-in system would purify the water in a matter of minutes, making it safe to drink. This feature would be ideal for travelers, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts."
