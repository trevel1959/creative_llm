    "**Self-Cleaning Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that utilizes UV-C light technology within the handle to sanitize the bristles after each use. Users would simply place the toothbrush in a charging dock that also functions as a cleaning station, ensuring that the bristles remain germ-free without the need for manual cleaning or replacement.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refillable Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush with a replaceable head and a biodegradable handle made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. The heads would come in various bristle types (soft, medium, hard) to cater to different user preferences, and the handle would feature a stylish design to encourage sustainability without sacrificing aesthetics.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Flosser**: Develop a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser feature. With a small reservoir in the handle, users could switch between brushing and flossing with a simple button press. This dual-functionality would encourage better oral hygiene by making it easier to incorporate flossing into the daily routine.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**: Innovate bristles that change color to indicate when itâ€™s time to replace the toothbrush. The bristles could start as one color (e.g., blue) and gradually fade to another color (e.g., white) after a certain number of uses or when they become worn out. This visual cue would remind users to replace their toothbrush regularly, promoting better oral health.",
    "**Personalized Brushing Modes**: Introduce customizable brushing modes based on individual dental needs. Users could select modes such as \"sensitive,\" \"whitening,\" \"gum care,\" or \"deep clean,\" which would adjust the speed, pressure, and pulsation of the brush accordingly. This feature would cater to various dental conditions and preferences, ensuring a more effective and comfortable brushing experience."
