    "**Resource Management**: Resources like water, food, and air must be carefully managed due to the high cost of transporting supplies from Earth. Developing sustainable methods for producing these resources on Mars (like recycling water and growing food using hydroponics) would be crucial to sustaining life.",
    "**Healthcare**: Medical facilities on Mars would be limited, requiring advanced medical technologies and training for astronauts. Immediate access to Earth-based medical expertise would also be necessary in case of serious illnesses or injuries.",
    "**Communication Delays**: With Mars being approximately 140 million miles away from Earth, communication delays could range from 5 minutes to over 24 hours, depending on the position of both planets. This delay would affect everything from daily routines to emergency responses, necessitating the development of robust contingency plans.",
    "**Engineering Challenges**: Building habitats and infrastructure on Mars would require overcoming significant engineering hurdles, including dealing with the planet's harsh environment, developing materials that can withstand Martian conditions, and ensuring the structures are safe against potential meteor impacts.",
    "**Societal Issues**: Living in close quarters with a small group of people for long periods can lead to interpersonal conflicts and social tensions. Establishing clear rules, norms, and a democratic process for decision-making would be essential to maintain harmony among crew members."
