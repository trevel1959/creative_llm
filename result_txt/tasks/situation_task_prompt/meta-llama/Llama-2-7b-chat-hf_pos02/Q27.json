    "Thermal Mass Storage: Utilize thermal mass materials such as concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat during the day. For example, you could build walls with these materials, and during the day, the walls will absorb the heat from the sun and release it at night, maintaining a consistent temperature.",
    "Natural Ventilation: Design buildings with strategic openings and ventilation systems to take advantage of natural air currents and temperature gradients. For example, you could create a \"breathing wall\" that opens and closes depending on the outside temperature, allowing hot air to escape during the day and cool air to enter at night.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Use phase change materials (PCMs) to store thermal energy. These materials can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. For example, you could fill walls with PCMs, and during the day, the walls will absorb heat from the sun and release it at night, maintaining a consistent temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Utilize evaporative cooling systems that use water to cool the air. For example, you could create a misting system that sprays water into the air, causing the water to evaporate and cool the surrounding air. This method is particularly effective in dry climates where the air is already hot and dry.",
    "Geothermal Systems: Utilize the natural heat of the earth to regulate indoor temperature. For example, you could install a geothermal heat pump system that uses pipes buried in the ground to transfer heat from the earth to the building. This system can provide consistent and efficient heating and cooling, even in areas with extreme temperatures."
