    "**Solar Water Purification**: With the sun's energy, water could be purified through solar distillation or solar stills. These systems work by heating the air, causing water vapor to rise and condense on a cooler surface, where it can be collected.",
    "**Fog Collection**: Fog collection systems could be used to capture fog and dew, which can then be collected and stored for use. These systems typically involve a mesh material that catches the water droplets as they pass through.",
    "**Condensation Systems**: Building materials with condensation properties, such as certain types of concrete or brick, could be used to collect water from the air. This water can then be collected and used for various purposes.",
    "**Water Recycling**: In a world without rain, water recycling would become an essential practice. This could involve collecting and purifying wastewater for reuse in various applications, such as flushing toilets or irrigating crops.",
    "**Underground Water Wells**: Drilling into the ground to access underground water sources could be a viable option for collecting water. This method would require careful consideration of water quality and sustainability."
