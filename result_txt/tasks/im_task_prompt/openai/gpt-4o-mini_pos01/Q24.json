    "**Smart Pen Compatibility**: Design the notebook with special dot patterns or grids that work with a smart pen. This pen could digitize notes as they are written, sending them to a cloud service for easy access and organization. The notebook could also include an embedded rechargeable battery to power the pen, making it an all-in-one solution for tech-savvy users.",
    "**Modular Pages**: Create a notebook with removable and interchangeable pages that cater to different needs, such as lined, blank, graph, or even dotted pages. Users could customize their notebook based on their tasks for the day, and the pages could be held together with a durable, magnetic binding system that allows for easy rearrangement.",
    "**Built-in Reminder System**: Integrate a subtle reminder system into the notebook, where each page has a small QR code or NFC chip that can link to a calendar or task management app. Users can scan the code with their phone to set reminders or to-do lists related to the notes on that page, helping them stay organized without losing the handwritten aspect.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a notebook made from sustainable materials that can be composted or recycled. Additionally, each notebook could come with a seed paper cover that users can plant after use, allowing them to grow flowers or herbs, thereby promoting environmental consciousness while still providing a useful product.",
    "**Interactive Learning Features**: Create a notebook specifically for students that includes augmented reality (AR) features. By using a smartphone app, students can scan their notes to access additional resources like videos, quizzes, or interactive diagrams related to the subject matter, enhancing their learning experience beyond traditional note-taking."
