    "**Bicycle Relay Race**: In this scenario, you could organize a relay race where groups of people ride bicycles from one city to another. Each group would have a specific leg of the journey, passing the baton (or in this case, the bicycle) to the next team at predetermined points. This would not only be an environmentally friendly way to travel but also promote community engagement and teamwork. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**Human-Powered Vehicles**: Encourage the creation of human-powered vehicles such as rickshaws or pedal-powered cars that could be used for long-distance travel. These vehicles would require physical effort from their users, making travel slower but still possible without relying on mechanical power. This concept would likely face challenges in terms of safety and comfort, but it could be an interesting experiment. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7.",
    "**Caravan-style Travel**: Inspired by ancient nomadic lifestyles, a group could travel together in a caravan of horse-drawn carriages or wagons. This would foster a sense of community and provide mutual support. The journey would be slow, but it could offer unique experiences and a deeper connection with nature. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Underwater Submarine Excursions**: If land travel becomes impossible, consider the possibility of traveling via underwater submarines or high-tech diving suits. This would require significant investment in infrastructure but could potentially connect coastal cities effectively. The confidence score for this idea is 0.6.",
    "**Vertical Urban Farming**: Implement a system where crops are grown vertically in large urban farms. These farms could produce enough food to sustain travelers during their journey from one city to another. Additionally, these farms could provide shelter, reducing the need for traditional housing while traveling. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8."
