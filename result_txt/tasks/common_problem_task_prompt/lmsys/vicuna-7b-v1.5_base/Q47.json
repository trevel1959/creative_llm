    "Budget constraints: Building a computer from scratch can be expensive, especially if you're looking for high-end components. It's essential to have a realistic budget and stick to it to avoid overspending on unnecessary components. This can be a challenge, especially when there are many options available, and it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of buying new components.",
    "Overheating: When building a computer, it's crucial to ensure that the components are properly cooled to prevent overheating. This can be a challenge, especially when dealing with high-performance components that generate a lot of heat. Overheating can cause damage to the components and reduce their lifespan.",
    "Software compatibility issues: When building a computer from scratch, it's essential to ensure that all the software is compatible with the new system. This can be a challenge, especially when dealing with different operating systems or software applications. For example, if you're installing Windows on a Mac, it may not be compatible with all the software applications, causing issues with functionality.",
    "Time constraints: Building a computer from scratch can be a time-consuming process, especially if you're doing it for the first time. It's essential to have patience and be willing to invest the time required to build the computer correctly. This can be a challenge, especially when there are other tasks that need to be completed, and the computer building process is taking up valuable time.",
    "Electrical safety concerns: When building a computer from scratch, it's essential to ensure that all the electrical components are safe to use. This can be a challenge, especially when dealing with high-voltage components or dealing with electrical components from different countries with different safety standards. Electrical safety concerns can lead to accidents and damage to the components."
