    "**Eco-Tourism and Education Hub**: Create an eco-tourism destination that not only showcases the beauty of nature but also educates visitors about environmental conservation. The park can have guided tours that include workshops, interactive exhibits, and lectures led by experts in ecology, wildlife management, and sustainable living. The proceeds from these activities could fund ongoing conservation efforts within the park.",
    "**Sustainable Living Demonstration Area**: Designate specific areas within the park where sustainable living practices are demonstrated. This could include off-grid homes powered by renewable energy sources, organic farming methods, and water recycling systems. Visitors could interact with these setups and learn about how to implement such solutions in their own lives, promoting a lifestyle that is less harmful to the environment.",
    "**Research and Conservation Center**: Establish a center within the park for scientific research and conservation initiatives. Researchers can study local flora and fauna, conduct experiments to improve habitat restoration techniques, and develop new conservation strategies. The data and knowledge gained can be shared with the public and used to guide future conservation efforts.",
    "**Volunteer and Internship Program**: Launch a program that invites volunteers and interns to contribute to the park's conservation efforts. Participants can engage in tasks like planting native species, monitoring wildlife populations, or cleaning up litter. This program would not only aid in the conservation efforts but also provide educational opportunities and hands-on experience in environmental stewardship.",
    "**Themed Nature Trails and Interpretive Stations**: Develop nature trails with different themes (e.g., wildlife corridors, ancient ecosystems, biodiversity hotspots) and set up interpretive stations along the way. Each station could feature interactive displays, informative signs, and audio guides that explain the significance of the area, its biodiversity, and the threats it faces. This approach would make learning about conservation engaging and accessible to all visitors."
