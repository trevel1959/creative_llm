    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR)**: Design sunglasses that incorporate AR technology, allowing users to see information overlaid on their field of vision. This could include navigation prompts, fitness tracking data, or notifications from their smartphones. The lenses could have a transparent display that only activates when needed, ensuring that the sunglasses remain stylish and not overly bulky.",
    "**Interchangeable Lenses with Magnetic Attachment**: Create a sunglasses frame with a magnetic lens attachment system, allowing users to easily swap out lenses for different colors, tints, or functionalities (e.g., polarized, blue light blocking, or prescription). This would provide versatility for various activities, such as driving, sports, or reading, without the need for multiple pairs of sunglasses.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Customization Options**: Introduce a line of sunglasses made from sustainable materials, such as recycled ocean plastics or biodegradable materials. Additionally, offer a customization platform where customers can design their frames and lenses, choosing colors, patterns, and even engraving their names or messages. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and those looking for personalized accessories.",
    "**Built-in UV and Temperature Sensors**: Equip sunglasses with sensors that monitor UV exposure and temperature, providing real-time feedback to the wearer via a companion app. The app could suggest when to seek shade, apply sunscreen, or hydrate, promoting skin health and safety while enjoying outdoor activities. This feature would be especially useful for athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, and families.",
    "**Comfort Fit Technology**: Innovate a sunglasses frame that features adjustable nose pads and temple arms made from a memory foam-like material. This would allow users to customize the fit for maximum comfort, reducing pressure points and ensuring the sunglasses stay securely in place during physical activities. The frames could also be lightweight and flexible, making them ideal for extended wear."
