    "**Smart Trash Can with Recycling Functionality**: Design a trash can that not only collects waste but also sorts recyclable items like paper, plastic, glass, and metal. It could use sensors to identify different materials, and then compact the non-recyclable waste into smaller volumes for efficient disposal. The recyclables would be sorted and stored separately within the can, making it easier for waste management services to process them.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can for Education**: Create an educational trash can that teaches users about the environmental impact of their waste. This can include a touch screen interface where users input what they are disposing of, and the can displays facts about recycling, composting, and the effects of pollution. It could even suggest alternatives or provide tips on reducing waste.",
    "**Trash Can as a Social Media Hub**: Design a trash can that allows people to connect through social media while disposing of their waste. Users could scan a QR code on the can to access a platform where they can post about their daily activities, share photos, or engage in community challenges related to sustainability. This could foster a sense of community and encourage eco-friendly behaviors.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with Air Quality Monitoring**: Integrate air quality sensors into the trash can. As trash accumulates, the can could monitor and display real-time data about air quality inside the bin. If the air quality reaches unhealthy levels due to decomposing waste, the can could alert users to empty it or offer suggestions on how to reduce harmful emissions.",
    "**Compostable Trash Can Liners**: Develop a trash can with compostable liners made from biodegradable materials like cornstarch or cellulose. These liners would break down quickly after use, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. The can could also come with a subscription service that delivers new liners regularly, promoting a circular economy model for waste management."
