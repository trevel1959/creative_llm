    "Diverse Cultural Norms: Cancer research is a sensitive topic, and different cultures have diverse beliefs about the causes and treatment of cancer. It could be challenging to raise funds from communities that believe cancer is caused by superstitions or that reject the standard treatments.",
    "Limited Reach: Depending on the global reach and resources of the campaign, it might be difficult to contact all the people who are affected by cancer or willing to contribute to the research. This could limit the amount of funds collected.",
    "Difficulty in Coordination: Since cancer research is a global issue, involving multiple organizations, researchers, and funding sources, coordinating everyone and ensuring that everyone is working towards the common goal could be a challenge.",
    "Inefficient Fund Distribution: Even if enough funds are raised, they might not be distributed effectively. There are many deserving cancer research projects, and it could be challenging to ensure that the money reaches the most effective projects.",
    "Lack of Awareness: The success of a global fundraising campaign heavily relies on raising awareness among the general public. Cancer is a common illness, but many people may not be aware of the symptoms or the advancements in cancer research."
