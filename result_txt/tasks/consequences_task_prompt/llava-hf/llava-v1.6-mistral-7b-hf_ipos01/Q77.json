    "Environmental impact: The increased number of people flying would have a significant impact on the environment. The noise pollution from millions of people flying would be overwhelming, and the emissions from the flights would be catastrophic. The Earth's atmosphere would become polluted, leading to a rise in global temperatures and potentially exacerbating climate change.",
    "Infrastructure strain: The infrastructure needed to support the mass flight of humans would be monumental. Runways, airports, and other necessary infrastructure would have to be expanded and upgraded to accommodate the demand. This would be an enormous undertaking and would require significant investment.",
    "Economic changes: The economy would have to adapt to this new reality. Industries such as aviation, travel, and tourism would see a significant boom, but other industries, such as automotive and transportation, would suffer as fewer people would need to drive or use other forms of transportation.",
    "Changes in urban planning: Cities would have to redesign their layouts to accommodate for the increased number of people flying. This could lead to a significant shift in urban planning, with cities becoming more vertical and buildings designed to accommodate the needs of flying residents.",
    "Security concerns: The ability to fly would raise significant security concerns. Governments would have to implement strict regulations and surveillance to ensure that people are not using their flying abilities for malicious purposes. This could lead to a loss of privacy and increased surveillance."
