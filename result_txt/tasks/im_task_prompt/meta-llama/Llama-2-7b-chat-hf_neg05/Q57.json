    "Smart Tail: Design a computer mouse with a built-in tail that can be used to navigate through menus and windows. The tail can be programmed to perform different actions, such as scrolling, clicking, and dragging, with just a simple flick of the wrist. This innovative design would revolutionize the way we interact with our computers, making it easier and more intuitive than ever before.",
    "3D Haptic Feedback: Develop a computer mouse that provides 3D haptic feedback, allowing users to feel tactile sensations in the virtual world. The mouse would use small motors to vibrate and create resistance, providing a more immersive experience for gamers and virtual reality users. This technology could also be used to enhance the user experience for graphic designers, architects, and other professionals who rely on precise movements and tactile feedback.",
    "Personalized Ergonomics: Create a computer mouse designed to fit each user's unique hand shape and grip style. The mouse would use advanced 3D scanning technology to capture the user's hand dimensions and adjust the shape of the mouse accordingly. This personalized fit would reduce strain and discomfort, leading to improved productivity and reduced risk of repetitive stress injuries.",
    "Gesture Recognition: Develop a computer mouse that can recognize and interpret hand gestures, allowing users to control their computer without touching the mouse. The mouse would use advanced computer vision technology to detect and interpret hand movements, allowing users to navigate through menus, switch between applications, and perform other tasks with simple hand gestures. This technology could be especially useful for people with disabilities or limited mobility.",
    "Quantum Energy Harvesting: Design a computer mouse that harnesses the power of quantum energy to provide a never-ending supply of power. The mouse would use advanced nanotechnology to convert the quantum energy of the user's movements into electrical energy, which would be stored in a tiny onboard battery. This innovative design would eliminate the need for battery replacements, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for computer users."
