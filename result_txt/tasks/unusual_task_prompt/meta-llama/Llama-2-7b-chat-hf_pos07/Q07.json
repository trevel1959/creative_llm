    "Smart Hanger: Create a smart coat hanger that can detect when a garment is placed on it and automatically adjust its shape to provide maximum space utilization in the closet. The hanger can also use sensors to monitor the weight and temperature of the garment, providing real-time data to help users make informed decisions about cleaning and caring for their clothes.",
    "Mirror Hanger: Design a coat hanger with a built-in mirror that allows users to check their appearance without having to walk to a separate mirror. This can be especially useful for people who are in a hurry or have limited mobility. The mirror can also be equipped with augmented reality features, such as virtual try-on capabilities, to help users see how their clothes will look without having to physically try them on.",
    "Air-Dry Hanger: Create a coat hanger with built-in air-drying capabilities, allowing users to hang their clothes and have them dry naturally without the need for a clothes dryer. The hanger can be equipped with a small fan or heating element to speed up the drying process and prevent wrinkles. This can be especially useful for people who live in areas with limited access to laundry facilities or who want to reduce their energy consumption.",
    "Smart Organizer: Design a coat hanger with a built-in organizer that can help users keep their clothes organized and easy to find. The organizer can include pockets or compartments for different types of clothes, such as dresses, shirts, and pants, as well as hooks for belts and scarves. The hanger can also be equipped with sensors that can detect when a garment is placed in the wrong pocket or compartment and alert the user.",
    "Grip Hanger: Create a coat hanger with a special grip coating that makes it easier to hang and remove clothes without damaging them. The grip coating can be especially useful for delicate or heavy garments, such as silk or fur coats, that can be easily damaged if not handled properly. The hanger can also be designed with a unique shape that makes it easier to maneuver and hang clothes in tight spaces, such as narrow closets or small dressing rooms."
