    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and the influx of visitors can lead to environmental degradation, including increased pollution, habitat destruction, and waste generation. A creative approach could involve implementing a “Green Olympics” initiative that prioritizes sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources, establishing strict waste management protocols, and creating green spaces that can be enjoyed long after the games have concluded.",
    "**Economic Disparity**: While the Olympics can bring in significant revenue, the costs can disproportionately affect local communities, leading to gentrification and displacement of residents. A solution could be to establish a fund that allocates a portion of the revenue generated from the Olympics to support local businesses and community projects, ensuring that the economic benefits are distributed more equitably.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events like the Olympics can attract security threats, from terrorism to cyber-attacks. To mitigate these risks, cities can invest in advanced technology for surveillance and crowd management, as well as develop a robust emergency response plan that includes collaboration with local law enforcement and international security agencies. Additionally, hosting community safety workshops can help educate residents on how to respond to potential threats.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity and Representation**: The Olympics can sometimes overlook the cultural significance of the host city, leading to misrepresentation or disrespect towards local customs and traditions. To address this, organizers can create a cultural committee that includes local artists, historians, and community leaders to ensure that the games celebrate and showcase the host city’s heritage through art, music, and ceremonies.",
    "**Health Risks**: Large gatherings can pose health risks, especially in light of pandemics or outbreaks of disease. To counter this, organizers can implement health and safety protocols, such as vaccination requirements, regular health screenings for athletes and staff, and improved sanitation measures in public areas. Additionally, developing a health awareness campaign can help educate attendees about hygiene practices and available medical resources."
