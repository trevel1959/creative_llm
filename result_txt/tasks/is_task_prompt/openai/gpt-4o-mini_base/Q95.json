    "Deep in the jungle, Tigris the tiger ruled with strength and grace, yet he had a secret: he was terrified of mice. One sunny afternoon, while basking in a sunbeam, a mischievous mouse named Pip scurried by, causing Tigris to leap in fright. Pip, noticing the tiger's reaction, devised a plan to teach him a lesson. The next day, he gathered all the jungle animals for a grand feast, and as Tigris approached, Pip squeaked loudly, startling him again. Instead of running away, Tigris laughed, realizing how silly his fear was. From that day on, Tigris embraced his little friends, no longer afraid.",
