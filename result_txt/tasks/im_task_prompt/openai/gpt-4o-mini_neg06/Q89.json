    "**Interchangeable Plates for Versatility**: Design the waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create not only traditional waffles but also pancakes, hash browns, or even grilled sandwiches. Each plate would have a unique texture and shape, giving users the freedom to experiment with various recipes. The plates could be easily swapped out and cleaned in the dishwasher for convenience.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide and Timer**: Include a built-in digital recipe guide that offers a variety of waffle recipes, cooking times, and tips for perfect results. The iron could have a timer that counts down for each specific recipe, alerting the user when the waffles are ready. Users could even input their own recipes and save them for future use, making the waffle iron a personalized cooking assistant.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam to clean the plates after use. By filling a small reservoir with water and pressing a button, the waffle iron would generate steam to loosen any stuck batter and then allow users to wipe it clean with a cloth. This would save time and effort in maintaining the appliance.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Built-in Blender**: Create a waffle iron that includes a built-in blender for making batter. Users could add their ingredients directly into the blender, blend them to the desired consistency, and then pour the batter into the waffle iron. This all-in-one appliance would streamline the cooking process and reduce the number of dishes to clean.",
    "**Waffle Art Creator**: Design a waffle iron that features interchangeable stencils and molds to create fun shapes and designs in the waffles. Kids would love waffles shaped like animals, hearts, or stars, and adults could impress guests with elegant designs. The molds could be easily placed in the waffle iron, and users could choose to make single or multi-shaped waffles at once."
