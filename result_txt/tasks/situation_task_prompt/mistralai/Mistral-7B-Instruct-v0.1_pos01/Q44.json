    "I would travel by bike. I would purchase a sturdy bike and use it to travel to work and other destinations. This would allow me to get some exercise while also being able to travel long distances.",
    "I would travel by foot. If public transport stopped working, I would walk or hike to my destination. This would allow me to explore new areas and get some exercise at the same time.",
    "I would travel by carpool. I would look for others who are also traveling long distances and offer to carpool with them. This would allow me to split the cost of gas and reduce my carbon footprint.",
    "I would travel by train. While public transport may not be available, trains are still a viable option for long-distance travel. I would research train routes and book tickets in advance.",
    "I would travel by boat. If all other options are exhausted, I would consider traveling by boat. This would allow me to see new sights and experience a different mode of transportation."
