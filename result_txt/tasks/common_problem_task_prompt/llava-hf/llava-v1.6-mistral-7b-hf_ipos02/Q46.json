    "**Capacity and Demand**: Another issue is managing the capacity of the public transportation system to meet the demand of passengers. A well-planned system should be able to handle peak hours without overcrowding and provide enough seating or standing space. This can be achieved by analyzing passenger data and optimizing routes and frequencies accordingly.",
    "**Accessibility**: Ensuring that the public transportation system is accessible to all citizens, including those with disabilities, is crucial. This can be achieved by installing ramps, elevators, and priority seating areas in buses and trains. Additionally, the city could consider offering specialized services like wheelchair-accessible vehicles or on-demand transportation services for people with mobility impairments.",
    "**Safety**: Safety is a major concern in public transportation. Implementing safety measures such as CCTV cameras, real-time passenger information displays, and regular maintenance checks can help reduce the risk of accidents and incidents.",
    "**Integration with Other Modes of Transport**: To encourage people to use public transportation, the city should aim to integrate it with other modes of transport, such as cycling and walking. This can be achieved by creating dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly zones around transit stops.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Public transportation systems should have a minimal environmental impact. The city could consider using electric or hybrid vehicles, promoting the use of public transport to reduce overall emissions, and implementing a carbon offset program to further reduce the environmental impact."
