    "Hair-replacement helmet: Design a lightweight, breathable, and UV-resistant helmet that mimics natural hair follicles. This would provide a protective barrier for the head, while also giving the appearance of having hair.",
    "Solar-powered scalp shield: Develop a flexible, transparent, and waterproof shield that can be worn on the head like a hat. This shield would be embedded with solar panels, which would generate electricity to power a built-in fan that circulates cool air to keep the scalp cool and protected from sunburn.",
    "Nanotech sunscreen infusion: Create a specialized sunscreen that contains nanoparticles that can be infused into the skin and scalp. These nanoparticles would absorb UV rays and release antioxidants to protect the skin and scalp from damage. This sunscreen would also have a built-in cooling mechanism to prevent overheating.",
    "Smart scarf with UV sensors: Design a lightweight, breathable scarf with built-in UV sensors that detect the intensity of sunlight and adjust its color accordingly. When the scarf detects high levels of UV radiation, it would change color to indicate the need for protection. The scarf could also have a built-in cooling system to keep the scalp cool.",
    "Sun-protective headgear with built-in cooling: Create a lightweight, breathable headgear that covers the head and neck. This headgear would be made of a specialized fabric that absorbs UV rays and releases cooling vapor to keep the scalp cool. The headgear could also have built-in fans or a cooling system to enhance the cooling effect."
