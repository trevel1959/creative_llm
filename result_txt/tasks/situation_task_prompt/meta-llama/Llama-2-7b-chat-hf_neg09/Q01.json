    "Use Carrier Pigeons: With electronic communication down, pigeons could be trained to carry messages between countries. Trainers could be stationed at each country's border to receive and release the pigeons, ensuring messages are delivered promptly and efficiently.",
    "Use Satellites: Since satellites are not affected by electronic failures, they could be used to transmit messages between countries. Governments could establish a network of satellite communication stations to send and receive messages.",
    "Use Mirror Signals: During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union used mirrors to communicate with each other. A system of mirrors could be set up between countries to reflect laser beams, allowing for secure and reliable communication.",
    "Use Underground Tunnels: Building underground tunnels to connect countries could provide a physical path for communication. Messages could be delivered through the tunnels using runners or through a network of messengers.",
    "Use Smoke Signals: In the absence of electronic communication, smoke signals could be used to convey messages. Different smoke patterns could be used to convey specific messages, such as a vertical line of smoke for \"yes\" and a horizontal line for \"no.\""
