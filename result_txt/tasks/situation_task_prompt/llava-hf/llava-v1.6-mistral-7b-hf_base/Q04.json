    "Vertical Forests: Building vertical forests in urban areas using skyscrapers with green spaces on their facades. These structures would not only provide a habitat for various plant and animal species but also help in improving air quality and reducing the heat island effect in cities.",
    "Indoor Forests: Creating indoor forests in buildings, such as malls, offices, and homes, using a combination of artificial and natural plants. These indoor forests would not only provide a natural environment for people but also help in improving indoor air quality and reducing stress levels.",
    "Bio-based Materials: Developing bio-based materials, such as biodegradable plastics and paper, using renewable resources like plant-based materials. These materials would not only replace the lost natural resources but also help in reducing plastic waste and pollution.",
    "Urban Farming: Encouraging urban farming by providing people with the necessary resources and knowledge to grow their own food in cities. This would not only help in replacing the lost natural resources but also promote a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.",
    "Reforestation: Implementing large-scale reforestation programs to restore degraded forests and create new ones. This would not only help in replacing the lost natural resources but also provide a habitat for various plant and animal species and help in mitigating climate change."
