    "**Ski Poles with Built-in Navigation**: Integrate GPS and compass technology into the ski poles, allowing skiers to navigate through unmarked trails and find their way back to the lodge. The poles could also display real-time weather forecasts, slope conditions, and even offer turn-by-turn directions to help skiers avoid congestion.",
    "**Ski Poles with Enhanced Grip**: Design ski poles with interchangeable grip covers made from various materials (e.g., rubber, foam, or even a textured surface). This would allow skiers to customize the grip to their liking, providing a secure hold in different snow conditions. The grip covers could also be color-coded to indicate the skier's skill level or preferred terrain.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Communication**: Develop ski poles with a built-in speaker and microphone, enabling skiers to communicate with their ski buddies or even receive real-time voice updates from ski resort staff. This feature could be especially useful for skiers with hearing impairments or those who prefer not to use their phone while on the slopes.",
    "**Ski Poles with Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Incorporate shock-absorbing materials into the ski poles to reduce the impact of falls or bumps. This could be achieved through the use of advanced polymers or materials like silicone. The poles could also be designed with a flexible tip to absorb shock and distribute the force of impact more evenly.",
    "**Ski Poles with Environmental Sensors**: Develop ski poles that include environmental sensors to monitor air quality, temperature, and humidity. This data could be displayed on a small screen or sent to a companion app, allowing skiers to track their exposure to pollutants and adjust their skiing schedule accordingly. The sensors could also detect signs of altitude sickness or other environmental hazards."
