    "**Scalp Sunscreen Gel**: Develop a lightweight, non-greasy scalp sunscreen gel specifically formulated for bald heads. This gel would be easy to apply, absorb quickly, and provide high SPF protection without leaving a white residue. Infused with soothing ingredients like aloe vera and chamomile, it would also help to hydrate the scalp and prevent irritation from sun exposure.",
    "**UV-Protective Bandanas**: Create a line of stylish bandanas made from UV-blocking fabric. These bandanas could be designed to be worn in various styles, such as head wraps or neck gaiters, and would provide excellent protection while allowing for breathability. Additionally, they could feature moisture-wicking technology to keep the scalp dry and comfortable during outdoor activities.",
    "**Portable Shade Canopy**: Invent a compact, portable shade canopy that can be easily set up in parks, beaches, or outdoor events. This lightweight structure would provide ample shade for the head and body, allowing for relaxation without the risk of sunburn. The canopy could be designed with adjustable heights and angles, making it versatile for different settings and group sizes.",
    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Scalp Shields**: Design a pair of sunglasses that come with detachable scalp shields. These shields would attach to the sides of the sunglasses, extending outward to provide extra protection from direct sunlight. The shields could be made from lightweight, transparent materials that do not obstruct the view but effectively block UV rays, making them a stylish and functional accessory.",
    "**Cooling Scalp Masks**: Create a line of cooling scalp masks infused with SPF protection. These masks would be made from breathable, stretchy fabric that fits snugly over the head, providing sun protection while also cooling the scalp. The fabric could be treated with a special cooling technology that activates upon contact with sweat, making it ideal for hot, sunny days."
