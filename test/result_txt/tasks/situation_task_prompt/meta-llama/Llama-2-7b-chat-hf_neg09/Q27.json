    "Window Ventilation System: Create a window ventilation system that utilizes natural air currents to regulate indoor temperature. Install large windows on opposite sides of a room to create a thermal buffer zone. By opening windows on opposite sides, the temperature difference between the two windows creates a convection current that helps maintain a consistent temperature inside.",
    "Thermal Mass Storage: Utilize thermal mass storage materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. Build a large wall or structure in the room that incorporates these materials. During the day, the wall absorbs heat from the sun and stores it, releasing it at night to maintain a consistent temperature.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Use phase change materials like paraffin wax or graphite to absorb and release heat. These materials can be integrated into building materials like walls, ceilings, or floors. When heated, the materials melt and release heat, and when cooled, they solidify and absorb heat again. This process can help regulate indoor temperature.",
    "Greenhouse Effect: Create a greenhouse effect within the room by using translucent materials like plastic or polycarbonate to cover windows and walls. This will trap heat from the sun during the day and release it at night, maintaining a consistent temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Develop an evaporative cooling system that utilizes water to cool the air. Install a series of pipes or a water-filled mattress in the room that absorbs heat from the air as water evaporates. The cooled air can then be circulated through the room using fans or vents."
