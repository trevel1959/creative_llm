    "**Eco-Friendly Print Mode**: Develop a printer mode that prioritizes eco-friendliness by optimizing ink usage and paper consumption. This mode could use advanced algorithms to reduce ink density in non-essential areas of a document, or suggest digital alternatives for certain types of documents, such as sharing files electronically instead of printing them.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Incorporate AR technology into the printing process. Users could scan printed documents with a mobile device to view additional content, such as videos, 3D models, or interactive elements. This would enhance the value of printed materials, especially for educational or marketing purposes.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular printer design that allows users to customize their printer with various attachments or upgrades. For example, users could add a scanner, a photo printer, or a specialized paper feeder for different printing needs. This would cater to diverse user requirements and extend the printer's lifespan.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Implement a voice recognition system that allows users to print documents hands-free. By connecting to smart home devices, users could simply say, “Print my meeting agenda” or “Print my travel itinerary,” making the printing process more convenient and accessible, especially for busy individuals.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or a special cleaning solution to maintain print heads and rollers automatically. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning, minimize maintenance efforts, and ensure consistently high print quality over time."
