    "Develop new pesticides: Another option would be to develop new pesticides that are more specific to the target pests, reducing the impact on non-target species. This could involve using targeted delivery systems that only release the pesticide in areas where the pests are present, or using genetically modified crops that produce the pesticide.",
    "Develop new agricultural practices: In the absence of animals, new agricultural practices would need to be developed to control pests. This could involve using physical barriers to prevent pests from reaching the crops, or using crop rotation to break the life cycle of the pests.",
    "Develop new crop varieties: Another option would be to develop new crop varieties that are resistant to pests. This could involve breeding crops that produce natural pesticides, or developing crops that are more resistant to pest infestations.",
    "Use beneficial microorganisms: Beneficial microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi can be used to control pests. These microorganisms can be introduced into the soil or on the surface of the plants to help control the pests.",
    "Develop new farming systems: In the absence of animals, new farming systems would need to be developed to control pests. This could involve using vertical farming, where crops are grown in vertically stacked layers, reducing the surface area exposed to pests."
