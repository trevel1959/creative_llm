    "**Security Threats**: High-profile international events often attract unwanted attention, including protests, terrorism, or other security threats. This could jeopardize the safety of attendees and disrupt the summit. Organizers should coordinate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to develop a comprehensive security plan, including background checks for all attendees and secure transportation options.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and transportation for numerous international delegates can be a logistical nightmare. Delays in flights, lost luggage, or inadequate accommodation can lead to frustration and impact attendance. To address this, organizers should establish a dedicated logistics team to manage travel arrangements and provide real-time updates, as well as have contingency plans for transportation and accommodation.",
    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication and understanding among participants. Misinterpretations could lead to misalignment on key issues. To solve this, organizers should provide professional interpreters and translation services, ensuring that all materials and discussions are accessible in multiple languages. Additionally, offering language workshops prior to the summit could facilitate smoother interactions.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Priorities**: Different countries may have conflicting priorities or agendas, making it challenging to reach a consensus on peace initiatives. This could lead to frustration and lack of engagement from delegates. To counter this, organizers should conduct pre-summit surveys to gauge the priorities of participating nations and create a balanced agenda that addresses the most pressing issues while allowing room for negotiation.",
    "**Technological Failures**: In todayâ€™s digital age, reliance on technology for presentations, communications, and remote participation can lead to problems if systems fail. Technical glitches can disrupt discussions and presentations, undermining the summit's effectiveness. To prevent this, organizers should conduct thorough testing of all technology in advance, have backup systems in place, and ensure that technical support is readily available during the event."
