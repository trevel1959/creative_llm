    "**Innovative Driving Experience:** Design a steering wheel that uses haptic feedback technology. The wheel would not only provide tactile sensations to simulate different road conditions (like bumps, turns, or slippery surfaces) but also give vibrations when it senses potential accidents or obstacles. This would enhance driver awareness and reaction time, potentially reducing accidents.",
    "**Ergonomic Health Wheel:** Create a steering wheel that adapts to the driver's body movements and driving style. Using sensors and AI algorithms, the wheel can adjust its shape, size, and position to optimize comfort and reduce strain on the driver. For instance, if the driver leans more towards the left, the wheel might tilt slightly in that direction, or if the driver prefers a tighter grip, the wheel could expand in size.",
    "**Virtual Reality Driving Simulator:** Integrate a steering wheel into a VR system for immersive driving simulation experiences. Users could choose from various driving scenarios (urban, rural, mountain roads, etc.) and vehicle types. The steering wheel would respond according to the simulationâ€™s inputs, offering a realistic experience for those who wish to practice or learn new driving skills without the need for real-world practice.",
    "**Smart Wheel for Electric Vehicles:** Develop a steering wheel that integrates with electric vehicle systems, such as regenerative braking, energy management, and autonomous driving features. The wheel could display real-time data like battery level, power usage, and vehicle speed. It might also allow for voice commands or touch controls to operate these features, enhancing the overall driving experience.",
    "**Emergency Response Steering Wheel:** Design a specialized steering wheel for emergency vehicles like ambulances or fire trucks. The wheel could include additional buttons or switches for quick access to critical functions like sirens, lights, and medical equipment controls. It might also have a built-in GPS and communication system to help navigate through traffic and coordinate with other emergency services during a crisis. "
