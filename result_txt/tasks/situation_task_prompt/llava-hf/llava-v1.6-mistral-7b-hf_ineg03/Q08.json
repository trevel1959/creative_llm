    "**Rainwater Harvesting**: Rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing rainwater for later use. This can be done by installing rainwater harvesting systems on rooftops or other elevated surfaces. The collected water can then be filtered and stored in tanks or other containers for use as drinking water.",
    "**Underground Aquifers**: Underground aquifers are layers of water-bearing rock or soil that can be accessed through wells. If all surface water sources were polluted, drilling deep wells into these aquifers could provide a clean and reliable source of drinking water.",
    "**Water Recycling**: Water recycling involves treating wastewater and reusing it for various purposes, including drinking. This can be achieved through advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as membrane filtration, UV disinfection, and reverse osmosis. If all water sources were polluted, wastewater treatment plants could be expanded to produce clean drinking water.",
    "**Cloud Seeding**: Cloud seeding involves injecting chemicals into clouds to induce precipitation. If all water sources were polluted, cloud seeding could be used to increase rainfall in a specific area, providing a clean source of drinking water.",
    "**Water Delivery Systems**: If all water sources were polluted, water delivery systems could be established to transport clean drinking water from a remote location to the affected area. This could be done using trucks, trains, or pipelines."
