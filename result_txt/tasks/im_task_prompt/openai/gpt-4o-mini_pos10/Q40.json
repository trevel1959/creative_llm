    "**Adaptive Tinting**: Develop sunglasses with photochromic lenses that can change tint not just based on UV exposure but also on the wearerâ€™s environment and preferences. For example, if a user is in a dimly lit area but wants to protect their eyes from glare, the lenses could adapt to a lighter tint. This could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to customize their tint levels for different activities like driving, reading, or sports.",
    "**Built-in UV and Pollution Sensors**: Incorporate sensors into the sunglasses that measure UV exposure and air quality. The sunglasses could alert the wearer when UV levels are high or when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds, encouraging them to seek shade or avoid outdoor activities. This feature could promote better health awareness and environmental consciousness.",
    "**Interchangeable Style Elements**: Create a modular sunglasses design where users can easily swap out different parts such as frames, arms, and lenses. This would allow for customization based on personal style, activity, or mood. Users could mix and match colors, materials, and shapes, making their sunglasses unique and adaptable to different occasions.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design sunglasses using biodegradable or recycled materials, such as ocean plastics or bamboo. Not only would this reduce environmental impact, but the sunglasses could also feature a take-back program where customers can return old pairs for recycling, creating a closed-loop system. Additionally, the branding could emphasize eco-friendliness, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**: Develop a special coating for the lenses that utilizes nanotechnology to repel dirt, water, and fingerprints. This would keep the lenses cleaner for longer and reduce the need for frequent cleaning. The self-cleaning feature could be activated with a simple spray of water or exposure to sunlight, making maintenance effortless for users."
