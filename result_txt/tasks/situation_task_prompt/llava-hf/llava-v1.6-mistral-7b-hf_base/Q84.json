    "Electric scooter: As an alternative to a wheelchair, I could use an electric scooter. This would give me the ability to move quickly and easily and navigate crowded spaces with ease.",
    "Powered wheelchair: I could also use a powered wheelchair, which has built-in motors that allow for more dynamic movement, such as changing direction and climbing stairs.",
    "Roll board or skateboard: If standing up isn't an option, I would consider using a roll board, also known as a kayak-like wheel-assisted vehicle, or a skateboard that is adapted with wheels for more stability and ease of use.",
    "Voice-controlled mobility aid: If none of the above are feasible, I could look into mobility aids that use voice controls to move around, such as the IndyGO, a hands-free, foot-free wheelchair.",
    "Adaptive bikes or tricycles: If I could still perform some level of movement, an adaptive bike or tricycle could be another option for getting around."
