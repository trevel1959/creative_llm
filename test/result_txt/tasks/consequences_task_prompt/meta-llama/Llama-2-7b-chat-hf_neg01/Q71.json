    "Overpopulation and Resource Depletion: If immortality were discovered, the population would grow exponentially, leading to overcrowding and resource depletion. With an endless supply of people, the demand for food, water, shelter, and other essential resources would skyrocket, causing shortages and conflict. This could lead to a catastrophic collapse of societies and ecosystems.",
    "Loss of Personal Identity and Purpose: Immortality would remove the finite nature of life, which gives individuals a sense of urgency and purpose. Without the fear of death, people might lose their drive to achieve, innovate, or pursue their passions. This could lead to a stagnant society with little progress or growth.",
    "Ethical Dilemmas and Moral Conflicts: Immortality would raise complex ethical dilemmas and moral conflicts. For example, how would society handle the distribution of limited resources among an endless supply of people? Would immortal individuals be entitled to the same rights and privileges as mortal ones? How would immortality impact social structures, such as marriage, family, and community? These questions would need to be addressed to maintain social order and justice.",
    "Psychological Impact on Mental Health: Living forever would take a toll on mental health. The constant awareness of time, the loss of loved ones, and the monotony of life could lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Immortal individuals might also experience a sense of isolation or disconnection from society, leading to social withdrawal or reclusive behavior.",
    "Unforeseen Consequences and Paradoxes: Immortality would likely lead to unforeseen consequences and paradoxes. For instance, if people were immortal, would they still age? Would they experience physical changes, such as wrinkles or gray hair? How would immortality impact the aging process and the concept of time itself? These questions would need to be addressed to ensure that immortality aligns with our understanding of the world and the universe."
