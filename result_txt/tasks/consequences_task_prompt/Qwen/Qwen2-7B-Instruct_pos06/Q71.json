    "**Global Population Explosion**: The most immediate consequence would be an exponential increase in population due to the absence of aging or death. Without the natural limit imposed by life expectancy, birth rates would likely soar, leading to unprecedented growth. This could strain resources, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability globally.",
    "**Economic Transformation**: Immortality would significantly alter economic structures and policies. With people living much longer, retirement systems and pension plans would need major adjustments. New industries might emerge focusing on longevity research, healthcare, and personal development as people continue to age but do not die.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: The psychological effects on individuals would be profound. People would face existential questions about purpose and legacy since they would have potentially unlimited time to live. Societal norms around family dynamics, relationships, and even death rituals might change dramatically.",
    "**Technological Advancements**: The pursuit of immortality would spur rapid technological progress, particularly in medical science and biotechnology. Innovations in gene editing, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence could revolutionize how we understand and manipulate biological processes.",
    "**Sociopolitical Challenges**: Issues of equity and access to immortality would become critical. If the ability to achieve immortality were limited to those who can afford it, it could exacerbate existing social inequalities. Governments might struggle to implement policies that ensure a fair distribution of this technology or its benefits."
