    "**Smart Leash with AI-powered Navigation**: Design a leash with a built-in GPS, accelerometer, and camera that uses AI to navigate the dog through the neighborhood. The leash would detect potential hazards, such as other dogs, pedestrians, or cars, and adjust its route accordingly. The AI system would also learn the dog's behavior and preferences over time, allowing it to optimize the walking route for the dog's comfort and safety.",
    "**Emotional Intelligence Leash**: Develop a leash that tracks the dog's emotional state, such as stress levels, excitement, or calmness, using wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. The leash would then provide real-time feedback to the owner, suggesting adjustments to the walk, such as slowing down or taking a break, to help the dog feel more comfortable and relaxed.",
    "**Interactive Leash with Augmented Reality**: Create a leash with a built-in AR display that superimposes virtual objects, games, or challenges onto the real world. The leash would use the dog's location and movement to trigger interactive experiences, such as virtual fetch or agility training, making walks more engaging and fun for both the dog and the owner.",
    "**Social Leash with Community Building**: Design a leash that connects dog owners in the neighborhood, allowing them to share information, photos, and stories about their dogs. The leash would use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to enable communication between nearby leashes, creating a community of dog owners who can support and connect with each other.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Leash with Biodegradable Materials**: Develop a leash made from biodegradable and compostable materials, such as plant-based plastics or recycled materials. The leash would be designed to break down naturally in the environment, reducing waste and minimizing the impact on the ecosystem. The leash could also include a built-in recycling program, allowing owners to return the leash for proper disposal and recycling."
