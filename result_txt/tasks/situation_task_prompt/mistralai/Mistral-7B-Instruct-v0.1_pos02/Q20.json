    "Teleportation: If planes were no longer available, one could the possibility of teleportation. This technology has been explored in science fiction for decades and is based on the idea of instantaneously transporting matter from one location to another. With teleportation, you could travel to another continent in a matter of seconds, without the need for any physical transportation.",
    "Space travel: Another possibility could be space travel. If planes were no longer available, one could the possibility of traveling to another continent via space. This would require the development of advanced space travel technology, but it would allow for the possibility of traveling to any location on Earth or beyond.",
    "Magnetic levitation: Magnetic levitation, or maglev, is a form of transportation that uses magnetic fields to levitate vehicles. This technology has been used in some countries to create high-speed trains, but it could also be used to create a form of transportation that could travel to another continent.",
    "Hyperloop: The Hyperloop is a proposed form of transportation that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers at extremely high speeds. If planes were no longer available, the Hyperloop could be used to travel to another continent.",
    "Underwater transportation: If planes were no longer available, one could the possibility of underwater transportation. This could involve the development of advanced submarines or other underwater vehicles that could travel to another continent via the ocean."
