    "Create a coffee filter that doubles as a mood tracker. The coffee filter would have different colors or symbols on it that represent different moods, such as a smiley face for happiness and a frowny face for sadness. As you pour your coffee through the filter, the colors or symbols would change based on the strength and temperature of the coffee, giving you a visual representation of your mood for the day.",
