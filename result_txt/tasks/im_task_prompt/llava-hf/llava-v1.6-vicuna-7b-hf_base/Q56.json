    "Motion-sensitive bell: Unlike the conventional push-and-pull bell, this innovation could be a motion-sensitive bell that automatically sounds when the cyclist starts pedaling. This would make it even more helpful as it would alert pedestrians and other cyclists without the rider having to break their stride.",
    "Personalization feature: Bike bells could be made with interchangeable parts that allow cyclists to customize their bells with their own unique designs or even with their favourite brands logo.",
    "Rearview mirror: Integrating a small rear-view mirror into the design of the bicycle bell could enable cyclists to see around corners and monitor traffic behind them, making the bell a multifunctional device.",
    "Waterproof feature: For cyclists who ride in rainy or wet conditions, the bell could be designed to be waterproof to avoid malfunctioning due to water damage.",
    "Attachment system: The bell could come with an adjustable and secure attachment system that allows it to be attached to the bicycle in multiple positions, making it always visible and easy to locate when needed."
