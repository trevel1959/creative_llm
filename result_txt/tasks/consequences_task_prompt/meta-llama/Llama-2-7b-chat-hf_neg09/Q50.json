    "A new industry could emerge: The sudden disappearance of guns could create a new industry focused on developing and promoting alternative methods of self-defense, such as martial arts, pepper spray, or other non-lethal forms of protection. This could lead to new job opportunities and innovations in safety technology.",
    "Society would re-evaluate its values: The absence of guns would force society to re-examine its values and beliefs about violence, self-defense, and personal safety. This could lead to a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to these issues, and a greater emphasis on non-violent conflict resolution and community safety."
