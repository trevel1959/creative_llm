Customers could \"travel\" through time by visiting different areas of the shop, enjoying coffee and pastries that fit each era's flavor profiles.",
    "**The Coffee Alchemist**: Develop a coffee shop that focuses on experimentation and innovation.

The atmosphere would be sophisticated and intimate, with a focus on exceptional service and expertly crafted drinks.",
    "**The Coffee Co-Lab**: Create a coffee shop that serves as a collaborative workspace and innovation hub.
