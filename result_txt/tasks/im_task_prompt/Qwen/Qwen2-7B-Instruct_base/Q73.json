    "**Smart Locking Mechanism**: Design car keys that include a smart locking mechanism. The key automatically locks the vehicle doors when it is more than a certain distance away from the ignition, preventing accidental unlocking. This could be enhanced with Bluetooth technology, where the key only unlocks the car when it's within range of the vehicle. This not only ensures safety but also provides convenience by reducing the risk of losing or forgetting the keys.",
    "**Emergency Service Integration**: Create car keys that can instantly connect to emergency services in case of an accident. By pressing a specific button on the key, the system can automatically send the car's GPS location, vehicle information, and the driver's personal data (like name, contact number, medical conditions) to pre-defined emergency contacts or services. This feature can significantly improve response times during critical situations.",
    "**Biometric Authentication**: Integrate biometric authentication into car keys for added security. Instead of traditional keys or fobs, use fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to unlock the vehicle. This eliminates the need for physical keys and reduces the risk of theft or unauthorized access. It also enhances user experience by providing quick and secure entry without the need to carry additional devices.",
    "**Vehicle Maintenance Alerts**: Develop car keys that monitor the vehicle's health and send alerts when maintenance is due or if there are any issues detected. For example, if the key senses unusual engine sounds or low fluid levels, it can notify the owner via their smartphone or through the key itself. This proactive approach helps prevent breakdowns and ensures that vehicles are serviced at optimal intervals.",
    "**Virtual Key System**: Implement a virtual key system that allows users to share access to their cars with others digitally. This can be done through a mobile app that generates temporary digital keys for family members, friends, or service providers. The keys can be set with specific permissions (e.g., driving vs. just unlocking the doors), and they expire after a certain period or when no longer needed. This system offers flexibility and security, as physical keys are not required to be shared, and access can be easily revoked or updated."
