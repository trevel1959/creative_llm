    "Smart Soap Dispenser with Voice Control: Create a soap dispenser that can be controlled using voice commands. Integrate Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing users to easily dispense soap without touching the dispenser. This would be particularly useful for people with disabilities or those who want to maintain good hygiene practices without compromising on convenience.",
    "Interactive Soap Dispenser with Games: Design a soap dispenser that incorporates interactive games and quizzes to make hand-washing more engaging and fun. For example, users can play a game of \"Soap Bingo\" or \"Soap Trivia\" while washing their hands. This would encourage kids and adults alike to wash their hands more frequently and for a longer duration, promoting good hygiene practices.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Built-in Sanitizer: Create a soap dispenser that comes with a built-in sanitizer. This would eliminate the need for users to carry separate sanitizers, making it more convenient and practical. The dispenser could have a small compartment for the sanitizer, which would be automatically dispensed when the user dispenses soap.",
    "Motion-Sensing Soap Dispenser: Design a soap dispenser that uses motion sensors to detect when a user is approaching. When the user waves their hand in front of the dispenser, the soap dispenses automatically. This would be particularly useful in public restrooms where users may not want to touch the dispenser with their hands.",
    "Soap Dispenser with Air Purifying Technology: Create a soap dispenser that incorporates air purifying technology. The dispenser could use a small fan or air purifier to circulate clean air in the restroom, promoting a fresher and healthier environment. This would be particularly useful in restrooms with poor ventilation, where odors and bacteria can accumulate quickly."
