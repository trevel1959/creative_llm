    "**Biometric Payment Systems**: In a cashless society, biometric payment systems could become mainstream. Users could make purchases using their fingerprints, facial recognition, or even retinal scans. This would enhance security and convenience, as no physical cards or devices would be needed. Retailers would install biometric scanners at checkout points, allowing for quick and secure transactions.",
    "**Barter-Based Apps**: In the absence of traditional currency, people might turn to barter systems facilitated by mobile applications. These apps would allow users to trade goods and services directly, creating a community-based economy. For example, someone could offer their skills in gardening in exchange for homemade baked goods. The app would track the value of items traded, helping users maintain equitable exchanges.",
    "**Time Banking**: Communities could implement time banking systems where individuals earn credits for the hours they work and can spend those credits on services offered by others. For instance, if someone spends two hours tutoring a child, they earn two time credits that can be used to receive two hours of help with house cleaning or other services. This system emphasizes community engagement and the value of time over monetary value.",
    "**Social Media Currency**: Platforms like Facebook or Instagram could introduce their own social currencies, where users earn credits through engagement, such as posting, sharing, or promoting products. These credits could be used to purchase goods or services within partnered businesses. This approach would integrate social media and commerce, encouraging users to participate in the economy through their online presence.",
    "**Community Credit Systems**: Local communities could develop their own credit systems, where residents can earn credits by participating in community projects, volunteering, or shopping locally. These credits could be used at participating local businesses, fostering a sense of community and encouraging local spending. This system would promote economic resilience by keeping money circulating within the community."
