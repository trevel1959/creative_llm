    "Complex Network Infrastructure: Another potential problem is the complexity of the company's network infrastructure. A multinational company typically has a complex network infrastructure with multiple subsidiaries, branches, and offices spread across the globe. This complexity makes it difficult to implement a single cyber security solution that can effectively protect the entire network. The solution must be able to integrate with the existing infrastructure and be scalable to accommodate future growth.",
    "Limited IT Resources: A multinational company may have limited IT resources, which can make it difficult to implement and maintain a comprehensive cyber security solution. The solution must be cost-effective and easy to deploy and manage, even in remote locations.",
    "Cyber Security Talent Shortage: A cyber security talent shortage is a major challenge for many organizations, and a multinational company is no exception. The company may struggle to find skilled cyber security professionals who can design, implement, and maintain the solution.",
    "Lack of Awareness and Training: Many employees within a multinational company may not be aware of the cyber threats facing the organization or may not have received adequate training on how to identify and prevent cyber attacks. The solution must include education and training programs to raise awareness and improve employee cyber security practices.",
    "Vendor Management: A multinational company may have a large number of vendors and third-party service providers, each with their own cyber security measures in place. Managing the cyber security of these vendors and ensuring that they do not pose a risk to the company's network can be a significant challenge."
