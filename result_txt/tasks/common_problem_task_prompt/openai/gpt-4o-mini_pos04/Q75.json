    "**Invasive Species Proliferation**: Invasive plant and animal species can disrupt the local ecosystem, outcompeting native species for resources. This could lead to a decline in biodiversity, affecting the overall health of the park. A comprehensive monitoring program can be implemented to track invasive species and facilitate regular removal efforts, alongside public workshops on the importance of native species.",
    "**Visitor Overcrowding**: Increased tourism can lead to overcrowding, which may result in environmental degradation, such as soil erosion, littering, and habitat destruction. Implementing a reservation system for popular trails and areas, along with timed entry passes, could help manage visitor flow and protect sensitive environments.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change can alter weather patterns, affecting the flora and fauna within the park. Increased temperatures and altered precipitation can lead to droughts or flooding, impacting wildlife habitats. A climate resilience plan could be developed, focusing on adaptive management strategies for both wildlife and vegetation, alongside habitat restoration projects to enhance ecosystem stability.",
    "**Limited Funding for Conservation**: Budget constraints can hinder conservation efforts, leading to inadequate staffing, maintenance, and resources for park programs. To counter this, a fundraising initiative could be launched, involving local businesses and community members in sponsorship programs or volunteer days, aimed at enhancing park facilities and conservation efforts.",
    "**Pollution and Waste Management**: Increased visitor numbers can lead to litter and pollution, which negatively impacts the park's natural beauty and wildlife. Establishing a \"Leave No Trace\" educational campaign, coupled with increased waste disposal facilities and regular clean-up events, can help mitigate this issue. Engaging local schools and organizations in clean-up initiatives can foster a sense of community ownership and responsibility."
