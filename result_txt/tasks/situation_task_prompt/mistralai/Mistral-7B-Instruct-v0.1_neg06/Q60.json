    "Bartering: In the absence of currency, people would need to rely on bartering to trade goods and services. This would involve exchanging goods or services directly, without the use of money. For example, a farmer could trade fresh produce for a piece of furniture or a mechanic's services.",
    "Gift Economy: Another way to trade goods and services without currency would be to establish a gift economy. In this system, people would give and receive gifts as a form of exchange. For example, a person could offer to bake a cake for someone in exchange for a piece of artwork.",
