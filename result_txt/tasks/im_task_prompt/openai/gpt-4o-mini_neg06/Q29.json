    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Lawn Mower with Solar Charging**: Design a lawn mower that operates on electric power but includes solar panels on its body to recharge its batteries while mowing. This would reduce reliance on grid electricity and promote sustainability. The mower could also feature a battery swap system, allowing users to have a second battery ready for longer mowing sessions without downtime.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lawn Mower with Attachments**: Create a modular lawn mower that allows users to attach different tools for various yard tasks. For example, it could come with attachments for mulching, leaf blowing, edging, or even a mini tiller for garden prep. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices and save storage space while providing versatility for homeowners.",
    "**Self-Adjusting Cutting Height Technology**: Innovate a lawn mower that automatically adjusts its cutting height based on the type of grass and its growth stage. By using sensors to detect grass height and health, the mower can raise or lower its blades accordingly, ensuring an optimal cut every time and promoting healthier grass growth.",
    "**Noise-Canceling Lawn Mower**: Develop a lawn mower that incorporates noise-canceling technology to significantly reduce operational noise. This could involve soundproofing materials, quieter motor designs, and innovative blade designs that minimize sound during operation. This would be especially appealing for suburban homeowners who want to mow their lawns without disturbing neighbors or waking up early on weekends.",
    "**Augmented Reality Lawn Care Assistant**: Create a lawn mower that integrates augmented reality (AR) technology. By wearing AR glasses or using a smartphone, users can see virtual overlays that provide information about their lawn's health, areas needing attention, and even real-time mowing statistics. This feature could enhance the mowing experience and educate users on proper lawn care practices."
