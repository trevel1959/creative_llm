    "**Self-Cleaning Microwave Interior**: Develop a microwave with a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and specialized cleaning agents. When activated, the microwave would generate steam that loosens food particles and grime, while an internal mechanism would scrub the surfaces. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and keep the microwave hygienic and odor-free.",
    "**Multi-Functional Microwave with Air Fryer Capabilities**: Combine microwave technology with air frying capabilities in one appliance. This would allow users to not only heat and cook food quickly but also achieve crispy textures without the need for a separate air fryer. The microwave could have adjustable settings for different cooking methods, providing versatility in meal preparation.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Microwave with Solar Charging**: Design a microwave that can be powered by solar energy. Incorporating solar panels on the exterior or using a detachable solar charger would allow the appliance to harness renewable energy, making it more eco-friendly. This could be particularly beneficial for outdoor use, such as camping or picnics.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen with Recipe Integration**: Equip the microwave with a large, interactive touchscreen interface that displays a variety of recipes. Users could browse recipes, select cooking modes, and even watch instructional videos while cooking. The microwave could also sync with a mobile app, allowing users to send cooking instructions directly to the appliance.",
    "**Customizable Interior with Modular Shelving**: Create a microwave with a customizable interior that includes modular shelving. Users could adjust the height and configuration of the shelves to accommodate different sizes of dishes and containers. This would maximize space and improve usability, especially for larger meals or multi-tier cooking."
