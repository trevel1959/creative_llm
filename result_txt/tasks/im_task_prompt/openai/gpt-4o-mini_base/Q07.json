    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, that breaks down naturally over time. This toothbrush could feature replaceable heads to minimize waste and could be packaged in compostable materials. This initiative would cater to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainable dental hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Filter**: Design a toothbrush that includes a small, built-in water filtration system. This would allow users to brush their teeth with filtered water on the go, particularly useful in areas where tap water quality is questionable. The toothbrush could have a compact design, making it easy to carry and use while traveling.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**: Create a toothbrush specifically designed for children that incorporates gamification elements. The toothbrush could have a built-in timer that plays music or sounds, encouraging kids to brush for the recommended two minutes. Additionally, it could connect to a mobile app that rewards children with points or virtual badges for consistent brushing habits.",
    "**Toothbrush with UV Sanitizer**: Innovate a toothbrush that features a UV-C light compartment that sanitizes the bristles after each use. This would eliminate harmful bacteria and ensure a cleaner brushing experience. The toothbrush could have a sleek design with a charging dock that activates the UV light when the toothbrush is placed inside, promoting better oral hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Flavor Pods**: Develop a toothbrush that incorporates flavor pods that release different flavors while brushing. Users could select their preferred flavor (mint, strawberry, etc.), which would enhance the brushing experience and make it more enjoyable, especially for children. The pods could be made from natural ingredients and designed to dissolve during brushing."
