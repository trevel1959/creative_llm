    "Virtual Reality Training: Develop a virtual reality training program for construction workers to practice and perfect their skills before working on the high-rise building. This will ensure that they are well-equipped and prepared for the challenges they may face on site.",
    "Modular Construction: Use modular construction techniques to build the high-rise building. This involves breaking down the building into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be constructed off-site and then assembled on location. This will allow for more precise and efficient construction.",
    "Green Building: Incorporate green building practices into the design and construction of the high-rise building. This includes using sustainable materials, energy-efficient systems, and green roofs to reduce the building's environmental impact.",
    "Augmented Reality: Use augmented reality technology to provide real-time information to construction workers on the site. This can include information on building plans, material specifications, and safety protocols, allowing for more accurate and efficient construction.",
    "Artificial Intelligence: Use artificial intelligence to optimize the construction process of the high-rise building. This can include predictive maintenance, scheduling, and resource allocation, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective construction."
