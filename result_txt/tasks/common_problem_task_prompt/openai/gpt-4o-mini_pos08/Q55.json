    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the conservation park can be challenging. Issues may arise in balancing the budget for infrastructure, staff salaries, conservation efforts, and educational programs. To address this, a tiered funding model could be developed, including government grants, private donations, and partnerships with local businesses that benefit from the parkâ€™s presence.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Gaining the support of the local community is crucial for the park's success. However, there may be resistance from residents who fear changes to their land use or who do not see the immediate benefits of the park. To foster community engagement, the park could host regular open forums, involve local schools in conservation projects, and create volunteer opportunities that allow residents to participate in park maintenance and activities.",
    "**Environmental Impact Assessment**: Before establishing the park, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is necessary to identify potential negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem. Issues may arise if the assessment reveals significant risks, such as habitat destruction or water quality degradation. To mitigate this, the park planners could incorporate sustainable practices into the park's design, such as creating buffer zones and utilizing eco-friendly materials in construction.",
    "**Visitor Management and Education**: Once the park is established, managing visitor numbers and educating them about conservation practices can be a challenge. Overcrowding can lead to environmental degradation, while lack of awareness may result in harmful behaviors. Implementing a reservation system for certain areas, along with interactive educational exhibits and guided tours, can help manage visitor impact and enhance their understanding of conservation efforts.",
    "**Wildlife Safety and Human Interaction**: The establishment of a conservation park may lead to increased human-wildlife interactions, which can pose risks to both parties. Animals may become accustomed to human presence, leading to dangerous situations or altering their natural behaviors. To address this, the park could implement strict guidelines on wildlife viewing, create designated observation areas, and provide educational signage that informs visitors about maintaining a safe distance from wildlife."
