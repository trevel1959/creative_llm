    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: Law enforcement could utilize this power to enhance public safety. Officers could monitor suspicious activities in real-time without needing to compromise privacy or safety. For instance, they could observe potential break-ins or domestic disputes without needing to intervene directly. During investigations, they could gather evidence from crime scenes without disturbing the area, leading to quicker resolutions and more accurate cases. This capability would be invaluable in high-crime areas, allowing for proactive measures to prevent crime before it happens.",
    "**Medical Diagnostics**: Medical professionals could greatly benefit from the ability to see through walls in hospitals and clinics. Surgeons could visualize the internal anatomy of patients before performing operations, allowing for more precise and less invasive procedures. Additionally, this power could aid in the diagnosis of diseases by revealing hidden abnormalities in organs or tissues, enabling earlier and more effective treatments. This would ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in healthcare costs.",
    "**Enhanced Home Security**: Homeowners could use this ability to enhance their security systems. By being able to see through walls, they could identify vulnerabilities in their homes and reinforce them accordingly. They could also monitor the movements of intruders without alerting them, allowing for a strategic response. This power could extend to neighborhood watch programs, where residents could collectively monitor their surroundings, fostering a stronger sense of community and safety.",
    "**Historical Exploration**: Archaeologists and historians could use this power to explore ancient ruins and historical sites without excavation. They could visualize what lies beneath the surface, uncovering artifacts and structures that would otherwise remain hidden. This would allow for a more respectful approach to archaeology, preserving sites while still gathering valuable information about past civilizations. The insights gained could lead to a deeper understanding of human history and culture.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental scientists could utilize this ability to assess ecosystems without disturbing them. They could see through layers of soil and vegetation to understand the health of habitats, track animal movements, and monitor pollution levels. This power would allow for more effective conservation efforts, as researchers could identify critical areas needing protection and understand the impacts of human activity on the environment. It could also facilitate the study of climate change by providing real-time data on how ecosystems respond to environmental shifts."
