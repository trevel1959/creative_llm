    "**Sun Dial:** You could create a makeshift sundial by marking a spot on a flat surface and placing a stick or rod vertically into it. The shadow cast by the rod would indicate the time of day. This method relies on sunlight, so it's only accurate during daylight hours.",
    "**Water Clock (Clepsydra):** Build a simple water clock using a container with a small hole at the bottom. The amount of water that flows out in a given period can be used to estimate time. You might need to calibrate it by measuring the flow rate over several days and comparing it to known durations.",
    "**Compass and Stars:** If you're outdoors, you can use the position of the stars to determine time. For example, Polaris (the North Star) is directly overhead at midnight. However, this requires knowledge of the night sky and its constellations, which not everyone has.",
    "**Pulse Rate Method:** Measure your pulse rate once every hour. Since an average resting heart rate is around 60-100 beats per minute, you can estimate the time by counting the number of beats and dividing by your average rate. This is less accurate but provides a rough approximation.",
    "**Burning Candle:** Create a candle with markings on its side indicating the height corresponding to a certain time interval. As the candle burns down, you can estimate the passage of time based on the remaining length. This method requires a consistent fuel source and a way to maintain the candle in an upright position. "
