    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: One potential solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to adopt hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This clean and efficient energy source could power electric vehicles, reducing the need for oil and minimizing emissions. To facilitate the transition, governments could invest in infrastructure development, providing hydrogen fueling stations and incentivizing the production of hydrogen-powered vehicles.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: Another creative solution is to harness the power of the sun to fuel vehicles. Solar panels could be integrated into the body of the vehicle, converting sunlight into electricity to power electric motors. This technology already exists in the form of solar-powered cars, but with further development, it could become a viable alternative to oil-based transportation. To make this solution more practical, advancements in battery technology could be crucial in storing enough energy for extended driving ranges.",
    "Bio-Ethanol: Bio-ethanol is a renewable energy source derived from organic matter such as agricultural waste, algae, or even garbage. This alternative fuel could be used to power vehicles, reducing reliance on oil and lowering emissions. The production of bio-ethanol could also create new industries and jobs, contributing to a more sustainable economy. Governments could encourage the adoption of bio-ethanol by offering incentives for producers and investing in infrastructure to support its distribution.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles (EVs) are already gaining popularity as a cleaner alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. However, their limited driving ranges remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. To overcome this limitation, EVs could be equipped with advanced batteries that offer higher energy density and longer lifetimes. This could involve the development of new battery chemistries or the optimization of existing ones. Additionally, governments could invest in the creation of more charging stations to facilitate long-distance travel with EVs.",
