    "**Integrated Smart Technology**: Incorporate smart technology into the coat rack, such as a built-in Bluetooth speaker or charging station for devices. The coat rack could also feature a smart sensor that detects when someone enters the room, automatically lighting up a small LED strip for visibility. Additionally, an app could track how often items are used, providing insights on which coats or bags are worn most frequently.",
    "**Multi-Functional Storage**: Design a coat rack that includes hidden storage compartments for items like gloves, hats, or shoes. This could be achieved by integrating a small bench at the bottom with lift-up seats or drawers, allowing for a neat and organized entryway. This design would help minimize clutter while providing a convenient place to sit while putting on or taking off shoes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Plant Integration**: Use sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled wood to create an eco-friendly coat rack. Additionally, integrate planters into the design, allowing users to add greenery to their space. This not only beautifies the entryway but also improves air quality, creating a more inviting atmosphere.",
    "**Artistic and Sculptural Elements**: Transform the coat rack into a piece of art by collaborating with local artists to create unique, sculptural designs. This could involve using unconventional shapes or colors that reflect the user's personality or home decor. By elevating the coat rack to a decorative element, it becomes more than just a functional item; it serves as a conversation starter and enhances the aesthetic of the space.",
    "**Magnetic and Interchangeable Panels**: Design a coat rack with magnetic panels that can be easily changed or rearranged. Users could purchase panels with different colors, patterns, or textures to match their seasonal decor or mood. This feature would allow for a dynamic and ever-evolving entryway that reflects the user's style over time."
