    "Ergonomics and Comfort: In a tiny house, every individual object counts and should be optimized for both utility and comfort. Choosing furniture and fixtures that are appropriately sized for the room while ensuring they meet ergonomic principles is another tricky task. For example, a wall-mounted bed with built-in storage drawers could efficiently utilize vertical space.",
    "Heating and Cooling: Managing temperature and humidity in a tiny house can be difficult due to the lack of space for traditional furnaces and air conditioning systems. Utilizing energy-efficient technologies, like solar panels or geothermal heating and cooling systems, will be crucial to maintain comfort while minimizing energy consumption.",
    "Plumbing and Electrical Systems: The design should ensure that the plumbing and electrical systems are up to code and do not interfere with each other. Opting for minimalistic fixtures and utilizing vertical space can help optimize the available room for plumbing and electrical installations.",
    "Privacy and Sound Insulation: Due to the compact nature of a tiny house, the absence of walls or solid barriers may compromise privacy and cause noise disturbances. Using acoustic foam or incorporating wall panels with built-in sound-dampening features could help minimize sound travel between different areas of the tiny house.",
    "Lighting and Aesthetics: To avoid a cramped and cluttered appearance, the design needs to focus on natural and artificial lighting to create a visually appealing and well-lit environment. Installing skylights and LED lighting fixtures can greatly improve the interior's ambiance."
