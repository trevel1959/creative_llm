    "**Solar Window Film**: I'd use a special solar window film that harnesses and stores solar energy during the day. At night, it would convert the stored energy into a soft, warm glow, illuminating the room. The film would be a thin, transparent sheet that can be applied to any window, making it a versatile and energy-efficient solution.",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optics**: I'd use a network of glowing fiber optics to create a radiant and futuristic ambiance. These fibers would be woven into the walls, ceiling, or even furniture, emitting a soft, ethereal light. The fibers could be programmed to change colors and patterns, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: I'd cultivate bioluminescent plants that absorb energy during the day and emit a soft, blue-green light at night. These plants would be placed strategically around the room, creating a natural and enchanting glow. The plants could be genetically engineered to thrive in indoor environments, making them a sustainable and low-maintenance option.",
    "**Holographic Displays**: I'd use holographic displays to project light and images into the room. These displays would be thin, lightweight, and energy-efficient, making them perfect for indoor use. They could be programmed to display a wide range of colors, patterns, and even interactive graphics, creating a dynamic and engaging atmosphere.",
    "**LED Weaving**: I'd use a specialized LED weaving technique to create a fabric-like material that can be draped over furniture or walls. This material would be woven with tiny LEDs that emit a soft, warm light, creating a cozy and inviting ambiance. The LED weaving could be customized to fit any room's style or theme, making it a unique and creative solution."
