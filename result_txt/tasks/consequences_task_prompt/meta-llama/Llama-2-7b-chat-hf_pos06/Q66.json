    "The oceans would start to heal: With the reduction of greenhouse gases, the oceans would begin to regain their clarity, and marine life would flourish. Coral reefs would regrow, and fish populations would increase, restoring the ocean's ecosystem. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Forests would regrow: With the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, forests would start to regrow, and the biodiversity of flora and fauna would increase. This would also help to purify the air and stabilize the climate. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Weather patterns would stabilize: As the Earth's temperature stabilizes, weather patterns would become more predictable, reducing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Ice caps would regrow: As the Earth's temperature cools, ice caps would start to regrow, and sea levels would decrease. This would help to protect coastal communities from flooding and erosion. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "New species would emerge: As the climate changes, new species would emerge, adapting to the new conditions. This would lead to a greater diversity of life on Earth, which would be an exciting discovery for scientists. Confidence Score: 0.5"
