    "Utilize the island's natural resources: To survive on a deserted island, the first thing to do is to assess the resources available on the island. Look for coconuts, fruit trees, and other edible plants that can provide food and water. Identify sources of fresh water, such as streams, rivers, or rainwater collection systems. Harness the sun's energy by building a solar still to purify seawater or collect dew for drinking.",
    "Build a shelter: Create a shelter using natural materials found on the island, such as palm fronds, leaves, and branches. Use these materials to construct a lean-to or a hut that provides protection from the elements. Make sure the shelter is sturdy enough to withstand wind, rain, and other weather conditions.",
    "Create a signal fire: To signal for help, build a fire on a hill or a high point on the island. This will help rescuers locate you more easily. Use greenery and other flammable materials to create a signal fire that can be seen from a distance. Keep the fire burning throughout the day and night to increase visibility.",
    "Fish and gather seafood: The island's coastline can provide a bounty of seafood. Learn to fish using makeshift tools like rocks, sticks, or even coconut shells. Gather shellfish, crabs, and other seafood from the beach or by snorkeling in the nearby waters. Be cautious when handling seafood to avoid getting sick from bacteria or toxins.",
    "Create a makeshift boat: To escape the island, you'll need a boat. Use materials found on the island to create a makeshift boat. Look for fallen trees, branches, and vines that can be used as planks and supports. Use coconuts or other buoyant materials to create a float. Once the boat is built, test it in shallow waters to ensure it's seaworthy before attempting to sail to safety."
