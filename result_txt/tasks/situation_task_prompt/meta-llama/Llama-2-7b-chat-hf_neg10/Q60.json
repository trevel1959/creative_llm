    "Bartering System: In the absence of currency, people could adopt a bartering system where they exchange goods and services directly without using money. For example, a farmer could exchange fresh produce for a haircut or a carpenter could exchange wooden furniture for a painting. This system would promote mutual exchange and help people acquire what they need without relying on money.",
    "Time-Based Exchange: Another option is to introduce a time-based exchange system where people trade goods and services based on the amount of time they spend on each task. For instance, a doctor could spend 30 minutes treating a patient and then ask for 30 minutes of someone's time to help with a household chore. This system would encourage people to be more mindful of their time and the value they bring to each exchange.",
    "Skill-Sharing Networks: People could create skill-sharing networks where they exchange skills and knowledge with each other. For example, a person who is skilled in cooking could teach others how to prepare a certain dish in exchange for someone else teaching them a new language. This system would promote lifelong learning and help people develop new skills.",
    "Community-Based Currencies: Communities could create their own currencies that are tied to local goods and services. For instance, a community could create a \"fresh produce\" currency that can be used to buy fresh produce from local farmers. This system would encourage people to support local businesses and promote sustainable living.",
    "Collaborative Consumption: People could adopt a collaborative consumption model where they share goods and services collectively. For example, a group of people could pool their resources to buy a shared vehicle or a community garden. This system would reduce waste and promote a sense of community."
