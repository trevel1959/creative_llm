    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Urban Cyclists:** Design an umbrella specifically tailored for urban cyclists. The umbrella would be integrated into a helmet or a cap to provide protection from rain while ensuring visibility to vehicles. The design would include LED lights on the edges of the umbrella and a reflective strip to increase visibility in low light conditions. The material used for the umbrella would be waterproof and breathable to ensure comfort during rainy rides.",
    "**Umbrella-Integrated Smart Home System:** Create an umbrella that doubles as a remote control for smart home devices. The umbrella handle would contain Bluetooth connectivity, allowing users to control their smart lights, thermostats, or other connected appliances using voice commands or simple gestures. The umbrella could also display notifications and reminders through its built-in screen, making it a convenient and stylish device management tool.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Umbrella:** Develop an eco-friendly umbrella made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or organic cotton. The umbrella would come in various sizes and colors, catering to different needs and preferences. It could also feature solar-powered LED lights for added safety during night walks. By promoting reusable products, this umbrella would help reduce waste and contribute to environmental conservation efforts.",
    "**Umbrella-Embedded Personal Health Monitor:** Design an umbrella with embedded sensors that monitor the user's health parameters, such as heart rate, temperature, and humidity. The data collected by these sensors would be transmitted to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. This would enable users to track their health status in real-time and receive personalized advice based on their current conditions. The umbrella would also have a built-in air purifier to improve air quality, particularly useful in polluted environments.",
    "**Umbrella-Integrated Portable Power Bank:** Create an umbrella with a hidden power bank inside, allowing users to charge their smartphones, tablets, or other electronic devices while staying protected from the rain. The power bank would be easily accessible via a small compartment on the umbrella's handle, and its capacity would be sufficient to charge multiple devices. Additionally, the umbrella could be equipped with a USB-C port, enabling faster charging times compared to traditional USB ports."
