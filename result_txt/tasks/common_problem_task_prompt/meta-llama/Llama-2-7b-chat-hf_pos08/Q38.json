To make the story more compelling, incorporate actual historical events and figures to add depth and authenticity.",
    "Develop a superhero movie with a unique twist. Instead of a typical origin story, the movie begins with the superhero already established and struggling to balance their dual identities.

To add complexity to the character, give them a personal stake in the conflict and explore the psychological toll of being a superhero.",
    "Create a coming-of-age movie set in a small town where a group of teenagers must navigate the challenges of growing up and finding their place in the world.

To add depth to the story, explore the psychological motivations of the characters and the supernatural forces they encounter."
