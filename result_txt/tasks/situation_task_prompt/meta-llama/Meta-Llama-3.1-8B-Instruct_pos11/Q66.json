    "**Bamboo and Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Composite**: In a world without natural materials, I would use bamboo as a primary building material. Bamboo is a highly renewable resource, and its unique properties make it an excellent substitute for wood. To enhance its structural integrity, I would use a Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite to create a strong and durable exterior shell. This composite material would be made from a combination of bamboo fibers, a polymer matrix, and other additives, providing exceptional strength, stiffness, and resistance to environmental factors like moisture and temperature fluctuations.",
    "**3D-Printed Houses with Recycled Materials**: With the disappearance of natural materials, I would focus on developing advanced 3D printing technology to create houses using recycled materials. This approach would involve collecting and processing plastic waste, which would then be converted into a usable building material. The 3D printing process would allow for the creation of complex structures with minimal waste and a high level of precision. The houses would be designed to be energy-efficient, sustainable, and adaptable to different environments.",
    "**Modular, Inflatable Structures**: In a world without natural materials, I would design and build modular, inflatable structures that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. These structures would be made from advanced, lightweight materials such as high-strength plastics or advanced composites. The inflatable design would provide exceptional insulation, flexibility, and resistance to extreme weather conditions. The modular nature of these structures would enable easy relocation and reconfiguration, making them ideal for temporary or permanent housing solutions.",
    "**Bioluminescent, Living Walls**: If natural materials were to disappear, I would focus on creating bioluminescent, living walls that provide a unique and sustainable building solution. These walls would be grown using microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that emit a soft, ethereal glow. The living walls would not only provide light but also help purify the air, regulate temperature, and create a natural, immersive environment. This innovative approach would redefine the concept of building materials and challenge traditional notions of architecture.",
    "**Geodesic Domes with Aerogel Insulation**: In a world without natural materials, I would design and build geodesic domes using advanced materials like aerogel, a lightweight, ultra-insulating material. The geodesic dome structure would provide exceptional strength, stability, and energy efficiency. The aerogel insulation would minimize heat transfer, keeping the interior"
