    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Monitoring**: This toothbrush is equipped with sensors that can monitor the user's brushing habits, pressure applied, duration of brushing, and even the effectiveness of the brushing technique. It connects to a smartphone app through Bluetooth where users can track their oral health over time, receive personalized feedback on areas that need improvement, and get reminders for dental check-ups.

    "**Toothbrush with Built-in LED Light**: This innovative toothbrush features an LED light in its handle which turns on when the brush is turned on, allowing the user to see exactly where they are brushing in the dark or low-light environments. This ensures that all parts of the mouth, including hard-to-reach areas like the back teeth and gum line, are properly cleaned.",
    "**Biodegradable Toothbrushes**: This idea involves producing toothbrushes from biodegradable materials such as bamboo, cornstarch, or plant-based plastics. These materials not only reduce environmental waste but also offer a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastic toothbrushes. They are compostable and break down naturally within months, reducing the impact on landfills and oceans.",
    "**Customizable Toothbrush Heads**: Users can choose from different types of toothbrush heads based on their specific dental needs (e.g., sensitive gums, plaque control, whitening). Each head could be designed with unique bristle patterns, stiffness, and materials to provide tailored oral care experiences. This concept would allow for more personalized and effective oral hygiene practices.",
    "**Heated Toothbrush**: This toothbrush is equipped with a heating element that can be adjusted to different temperatures. The heated toothbrush can help stimulate blood flow, reduce sensitivity, and promote relaxation during brushing. It offers an additional sensory experience that can make the daily oral hygiene routine more enjoyable and beneficial for overall oral health."
