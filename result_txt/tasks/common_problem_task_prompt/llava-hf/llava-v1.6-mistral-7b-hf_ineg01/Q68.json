These include not only daily necessities but also spares for repairs and maintenance of the boat in case of any issues. A well-organized inventory helps in managing supplies efficiently and minimizing waste.",
    "Mental well-being and coping mechanisms: Sailing across the Atlantic can be a mentally challenging experience for many, and stress can lead to a decline in overall well-being. To cope with the isolation, it's crucial for the sailor to implement healthy coping strategies, such as having a regular routine or hobbies, maintaining contact with friends and family, or even keeping a daily journal.",
    "Scheduling and communication: Communication with external sources, like shore support or family, can be critical for safety and reassurance during a transatlantic voyage.
