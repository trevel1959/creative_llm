    "Water-Saving Technologies: Investing in technologies that conserve water, such as water-efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting systems, could help reduce the demand on the water supply. This could include innovations like self-cleaning water filters, which could remove impurities from water, making it safer and more efficient to use.",
    "Desalination: Another solution could be to desalinate seawater or brackish water, making it suitable for human consumption. This could involve using advanced technologies like reverse osmosis or electrodialysis, which could remove salt and other impurities from water, making it safe and clean for drinking.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Cloud seeding involves injecting substances like silver iodide or dry ice into clouds to enhance precipitation. This could help increase the amount of water available for human consumption, particularly in areas with low rainfall. This could be done through the use of specialized aircraft or drones, which could be equipped with advanced seeding technology.",
    "Water-Efficient Agriculture: Implementing water-efficient agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation or precision irrigation, could help reduce the amount of water used in agriculture. This could involve using sensors and data analytics to optimize irrigation schedules and reduce waste.",
    "Water Recycling: Recycling wastewater could provide an additional source of water for human consumption. This could involve treating wastewater to remove impurities and contaminants, then using it for non-potable purposes like irrigation or toilet flushing. Advanced technologies like membrane bioreactors or advanced oxidation processes could be used to treat wastewater, making it safe for reuse."
