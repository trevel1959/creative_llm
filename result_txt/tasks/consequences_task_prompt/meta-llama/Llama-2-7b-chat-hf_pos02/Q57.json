    "Water-based currency: In a water-scarce world, people might start trading water like a currency. This could lead to a new economy based on water distribution, where those who have more water can trade it for goods and services. This could create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses to fill the gap in the water market.",
    "Water-efficient infrastructure: With water becoming scarce, there would be a high demand for infrastructure that can conserve and manage water resources efficiently. This could lead to the development of new technologies and materials that can harvest and store water, reducing waste and increasing water availability.",
    "Water-based agriculture: In a water-scarce world, agriculture would need to adapt to survive. This could lead to the development of new crops and farming techniques that are more water-efficient, such as hydroponics or aquaponics. These methods could increase food production while reducing water usage.",
    "Water-based energy: With water becoming scarce, there would be a need for alternative sources of energy. This could lead to the development of new technologies that harness the power of water to generate energy, such as tidal or wave power. This could provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and reduce the strain on water resources.",
    "Water-based transportation: In a water-scarce world, transportation would need to adapt to conserve water. This could lead to the development of new water-based transportation systems, such as hydrofoils or water-based public transportation systems. These systems could reduce the need for fossil fuels and conserve water resources."
