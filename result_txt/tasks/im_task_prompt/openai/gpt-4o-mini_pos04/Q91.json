    "**QR Code with Digital Profile**: Create a luggage tag that features a QR code linking to a digital profile of the traveler. This profile could include emergency contact information, travel itinerary, and even a photo of the traveler. In case of lost luggage, airport staff can quickly scan the QR code to access vital information and return the bag to its owner.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**: Develop luggage tags made from biodegradable or recycled materials that can be composted at the end of their life cycle. Additionally, offer customizable designs that allow travelers to express their personality while being environmentally conscious. This could include designs that represent different cultures or local artists.",
    "**Built-in RFID Blocking Technology**: Incorporate RFID blocking technology into the luggage tag to protect travelers from identity theft. This would prevent unauthorized scanning of personal information stored in RFID chips embedded in passports or credit cards, adding an extra layer of security during travel.",
    "**Multi-Functional Luggage Tag**: Design a luggage tag that doubles as a portable phone charger. The tag could have a small battery compartment and USB port, allowing travelers to charge their devices on the go. This would be particularly useful during long layovers or when access to power outlets is limited.",
    "**Interactive Luggage Tag with NFC**: Equip the luggage tag with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, allowing users to tap their smartphones to the tag for quick access to travel details. The tag could provide information such as the ownerâ€™s contact details, travel itinerary, and even special instructions for baggage handlers (e.g., \"Fragile\" or \"Keep Upright\")."
