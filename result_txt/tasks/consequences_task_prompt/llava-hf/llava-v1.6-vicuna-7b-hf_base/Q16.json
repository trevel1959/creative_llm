    "Ecosystem Imbalance: Insects also serve as pollinators for many plant species, helping them reproduce and spread. Without insects, plants may struggle to pollinate, leading to a decline in plant diversity and potential ecosystem imbalances.",
    "Soil Health Decline: Large numbers of insects can help break down organic matter in the soil, promoting healthy soil fertility. If all insects disappeared, soil processes would be disrupted, leading to reduced nutrient cycling and overall soil degradation.",
    "Economic Impact: Insects also contribute to the economy through industries such as agriculture, tourism, and research. A decline in insect populations could negatively impact these industries and the livelihoods of those depending on them.",
    "Erosion Control: Many insects help control soil erosion by burrowing and aerating the soil. Without these actions, soil erosion could increase, leading to habitat loss and reduced biodiversity.",
    "Fungal Parasite Balance: Insects, as a food source for many birds, also play a role in balancing fungal populations. If all insects disappeared, fungal populations could grow out of control, potentially leading to more severe infections for other organisms."
