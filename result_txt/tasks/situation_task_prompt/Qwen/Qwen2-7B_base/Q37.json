    "Backwards Tractor - This device works on the principle of a regular tractor, only in reverse. It uses power generated by one or more engines to push the vehicle backwards. It can be used in farming areas as well as construction sites to remove or transport materials in a novel way.",
    "Backward Cycles - Regular bicycles or tricycles with their wheels in the front and handlebars, brakes and pedaling mechanism towards the rear. Pedaling generates movement in reverse. They can be used in urban settings where there is a high volume of traffic and a lower speed of travel is necessary.",
    "Reverse E-Scooter - An E-scooter designed with motors and batteries to only provide propulsion in reverse. Riders can shift control to forward by a switch or another control mechanism. The reverse-engineered E-scooter can be used for fun and exercise in parks and pedestrian-friendly areas where there is minimal foot traffic.",
    "Inverted Rovers - These are autonomous robots that use propellers or jet thrusters to move backwards. They can be used for inspection, construction, and even leisure purposes, like exploring new environments or performing stunts.",
    "Backward Segway - An inverted version of the Segway with a handlebar mechanism and a kick-start mechanism for forward motion. Propulsive power is generated by pushing the boot against the ground and, due to the physics of inertia, moves in reverse. They can be used by individuals for leisure, transportation and security purposes."
