    "Trials and Testing: Another potential problem is the time and resources required for trials and testing. The vaccine must be tested on a large number of people to ensure its safety and effectiveness. This process can be lengthy and expensive, and there is always the risk that the vaccine may not be effective or may cause harmful side effects.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Developing a vaccine for a new disease also raises ethical considerations. For example, who should have access to the vaccine first? Should it be prioritized for certain groups, such as healthcare workers or older adults? And what happens if the vaccine is found to be unsafe or ineffective?",
    "Intellectual Property: Another potential problem is the issue of intellectual property. Companies that develop a vaccine for a new disease may seek to protect their intellectual property rights, which could make it difficult for other companies to produce the vaccine or create similar vaccines.",
    "Distribution and Access: Distribution and access to the vaccine can also be a problem. The vaccine must be distributed to healthcare providers and other organizations that will administer it to the public. Additionally, there may be logistical challenges in getting the vaccine to remote or underserved areas.",
    "Public Perception: Developing a vaccine for a new disease can also be affected by public perception. There may be concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as concerns about the potential side effects. This can make it difficult to convince people to get vaccinated."
