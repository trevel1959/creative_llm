    "**Recipe Database Integration**: Create an app that connects to the waffle iron via Bluetooth, allowing users to access a vast database of waffle recipes. The assistant can suggest recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences (like vegan or low-carb), and even offer step-by-step cooking instructions. Users can save their favorite recipes and share them with friends, creating a community around waffle-making.",
    "**Customizable Waffle Shapes**: Design interchangeable plates that allow users to create waffles in various shapes and sizes. From classic squares to hearts, stars, or even seasonal shapes like pumpkins or snowflakes, these plates could be easily swapped out. The assistant could recommend specific recipes for each shape, enhancing the fun of making waffles for special occasions or holidays.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes steam to clean the waffle iron after use. The assistant could guide users through a simple process of adding water and activating the cleaning cycle, which would loosen any stuck batter and make it easier to wipe down. This feature would significantly reduce the hassle of cleaning, making waffle-making a more enjoyable experience.",
    "**Integrated Timer and Reminder System**: Equip the waffle iron with an integrated timer and reminder system that alerts users when their waffles are ready. The assistant could offer customizable alerts, such as sounds or notifications through a connected app. This feature would help users multitask in the kitchen without worrying about overcooking their waffles.",
    "**Ingredient Dispenser**: Add a built-in ingredient dispenser that measures and dispenses batter automatically. Users could select the desired portion size through the assistant, which would then mix and pour the batter into the waffle iron. This would eliminate the mess of pouring batter manually and ensure consistent waffle sizes, making it ideal for families or brunch gatherings."
