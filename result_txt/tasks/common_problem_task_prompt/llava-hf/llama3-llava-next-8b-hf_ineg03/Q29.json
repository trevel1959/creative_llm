    "Environmental Impact: Deep-sea exploration can have a significant impact on the environment, including the potential for damage to ecosystems, the release of pollutants, and the disruption of marine life. It is important for the crew to follow proper protocols to minimize the environmental impact of their mission.",
    "Psychological Stress: The deep-sea environment can be mentally and emotionally challenging, with long periods of isolation and the potential for claustrophobia. The crew must be prepared to handle the psychological stress of the mission and have support systems in place to deal with any issues that may arise.",
    "Weather and Sea Conditions: Deep-sea exploration missions are often affected by weather and sea conditions, including storms, rough seas, and strong currents.
