    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. This innovative battery would use a special solar panel to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Clothing: Create clothing that can harness the energy of movement and convert it into electricity. This could include special fabrics that are woven with conductive materials, allowing them to capture and store energy from the wearer's movements.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Charging: Develop a charging system that uses magnetic levitation to transfer energy between devices. This would eliminate the need for physical contact between the charging device and the device being charged, making it faster and more efficient.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Create a system that stores energy in the form of heat, which can then be used to power devices. This could involve using a special heat-absorbing material that can store energy from a variety of sources, such as solar panels or even body heat.",
    "Biometric Energy Harvesting: Develop a system that harnesses the energy of the body to power devices. This could involve using special sensors that can detect and convert the energy generated by the body's natural processes, such as heart rate or muscle movement, into electrical energy."
