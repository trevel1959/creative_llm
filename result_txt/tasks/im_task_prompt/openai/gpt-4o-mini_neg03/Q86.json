    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Develop a wheelchair with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their specific needs. For example, users could choose different seat cushions for comfort, armrests for support, or wheels designed for various terrains (indoor, outdoor, rough surfaces). This would make the wheelchair more adaptable to individual lifestyles and preferences.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Incorporate sensors into the wheelchair that can monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced with a mobile app that provides users and caregivers with insights into their health, alerts for irregularities, and reminders for medication or doctor appointments, enhancing the overall well-being of the user.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Options**: Design a wheelchair that utilizes solar panels or kinetic energy to power its electric components. This sustainable approach would reduce reliance on traditional batteries and promote environmental consciousness. The wheelchair could have built-in solar panels on the backrest or footrests, and it could convert energy generated from the user's movements into power for lights or electronic devices.",
    "**Enhanced Safety Features**: Equip the wheelchair with advanced safety features such as automatic braking systems, collision detection sensors, and LED lights for visibility. Additionally, integrating a panic button that can alert emergency services or caregivers in case of an emergency would provide users with peace of mind and enhance their safety while navigating public spaces.",
    "**Social Connectivity Platform**: Create a built-in tablet or screen that connects users with a community of fellow wheelchair users. This platform could facilitate social interactions, support groups, and access to resources or events tailored for individuals with mobility challenges. It could also include features like video calls, messaging, and forums to foster a sense of community and belonging."
