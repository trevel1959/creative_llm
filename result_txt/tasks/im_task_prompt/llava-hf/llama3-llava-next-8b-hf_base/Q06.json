    "Windproof Windbreak: The umbrella could include a collapsible windbreak at the top to protect itself and the user from backdrafts while it is opened. This would increase its wind-tolerance and reliability in stormy conditions.",
    "Retractable Cable: A retractable cable could attach to a carabiner and be clipped to a bike helmet or backpack, allowing the umbrella to be secured and easily transported to and from the vehicle. This would be particularly useful for bike commuters.",
    "Waterproof Pocket: A compartment on the inside of the umbrella could provide a means of storing wet items, such as a phone or wallet, keeping them dry and protected when not in use.",
    "Solar Charging: An integrated solar panel could be installed on the umbrella to allow it to charge a battery, providing power for features such as a LED light or GPS navigation. This would be particularly useful for outdoor adventures and emergency situations.",
    "Automatic Collapse: An accelerometer in the umbrella would detect when it is being carried and would automatically retract and collapse the umbrella to prevent damage or entanglement."
