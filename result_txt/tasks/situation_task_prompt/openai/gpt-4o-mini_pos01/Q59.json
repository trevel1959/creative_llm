    "**Solar-Powered Light Wells**: Develop a network of solar-powered light wells that capture and concentrate sunlight from the rare moments it breaks through the clouds. These wells would use reflective materials to funnel sunlight into homes and public spaces. During cloudy days, these light wells would store energy and release it as artificial light, creating a bright atmosphere indoors.",
    "**UV-Reflective Clothing**: Design a line of UV-reflective clothing that absorbs and reflects ultraviolet light. This clothing could be made from special materials that capture and convert UV rays into visible light, allowing wearers to experience a semblance of sunlight while they go about their day. The clothing could also include embedded LED lights that activate when natural sunlight is scarce.",
    "**Light Therapy Community Centers**: Establish community centers focused on light therapy that utilize specialized lamps emitting full-spectrum light to simulate natural sunlight. These centers could offer various activities, from yoga and meditation to art classes, all while providing a healthy dose of light exposure. The centers could also host workshops on the importance of light for mental and physical well-being.",
    "**Holographic Sun Projectors**: Invent holographic sun projectors that can create the illusion of a sunny sky indoors. These devices would project realistic images of a clear blue sky with sun rays, helping to alleviate feelings of gloom and boosting mood. They could be used in homes, offices, and public spaces to create an uplifting environment.",
    "**Sunlight Harvesting Drones**: Deploy drones equipped with photovoltaic cells that can fly above the cloud cover to capture sunlight. These drones would then return to designated locations and release stored energy as artificial light or deliver concentrated sunlight through fiber optic cables to homes and businesses below."
