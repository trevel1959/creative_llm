    "Space Tourism: With no more planes, space tourism could become the go-to mode of intercontinental travel. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are already working on commercial spacecraft, and it's only a matter of time before they become available for public use. Imagine blasting off into orbit and witnessing the curvature of the Earth from a distance!",
    "Submarine Travel: Submarines are already used for underwater exploration, but they could also be repurposed for intercontinental travel. Imagine a luxury submarine equipped with all the amenities you need for a comfortable journey, including a restaurant, bar, and entertainment lounge. You could travel from the coast of Europe to the shores of Africa or Asia in a matter of weeks.",
    "High-Speed Trains: While high-speed trains are already available for short distances, they could be upgraded to travel across continents. Imagine a train that could reach speeds of over 300 mph, connecting major cities across the globe. This would be an environmentally friendly and efficient way to travel long distances, with minimal stops along the way.",
    "Hydrofoil Boats: Hydrofoil boats are already used for short distances, but they could be scaled up for intercontinental travel. Imagine a luxury hydrofoil boat that could travel at speeds of over 100 mph, cutting through the waves and connecting major coastal cities. This would be an exhilarating and adventurous way to travel, with breathtaking views of the ocean along the way.",
    "Tunnel Network: One radical idea for intercontinental travel is a network of tunnels that stretch beneath the ocean. Imagine a series of underwater tunnels that connect major continents, allowing you to travel from Europe to Asia or North America to South America without ever leaving the water. This would be an engineering marvel, with advanced transportation systems and amenities for a comfortable journey."
