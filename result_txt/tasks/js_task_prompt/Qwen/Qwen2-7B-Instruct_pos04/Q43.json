    "**Security and Surveillance**: Utilizing the ability to see through walls for security purposes, individuals or organizations can conduct covert surveillance on properties without being detected. This could be particularly useful in high-security areas such as government buildings, banks, or private residences. By setting up hidden cameras behind walls, security personnel could monitor activities without alerting potential intruders, providing a significant advantage in maintaining safety.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis and Treatment**: Doctors could potentially diagnose conditions that are not immediately visible on the surface, such as internal injuries or diseases, by scanning the body wall-to-wall. This would allow for earlier detection and treatment of illnesses, potentially saving lives. Additionally, it could assist in non-invasive surgical procedures where visualizing the internal structures in real-time would greatly enhance precision and reduce risks.",
    "**Urban Planning and Infrastructure**: City planners could use this power to inspect underground infrastructure without causing disruptions above ground. They could easily identify issues with pipelines, cables, and other essential services, allowing for proactive maintenance and timely upgrades. This could lead to more efficient urban management and reduced costs associated with emergency repairs.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental scientists could use this power to monitor ecosystems beneath the surface of the earth. They could observe plant roots, soil composition, and water flow patterns in real-time, which is currently challenging due to the complexity of accessing underground environments. This could provide valuable insights into environmental health, helping in conservation efforts and sustainable resource management.",
    "**Cultural Preservation**: Archaeologists and historians could utilize this ability to uncover ancient artifacts and structures buried beneath the earth's surface without the need for invasive excavation. This would enable a more thorough exploration of historical sites, allowing for a deeper understanding of past civilizations. It could also help in preserving cultural heritage by avoiding the destruction of original contexts during the discovery process."
