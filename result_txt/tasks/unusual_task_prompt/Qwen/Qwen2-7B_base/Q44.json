    "DIY bath bombs: Mix baking soda, citric acid, essential oils, and food coloring together in a mixing bowl until well combined. Fill each compartment of the ice cube tray halfway with the mixture, and then press the remaining mixture into each compartment. Allow the bath bombs to dry and harden in the tray, then pop them out and store them in a jar or container until ready to use.",
    "DIY cold packs: To make a cold pack, freeze water or a non-toxic saltwater mixture in the ice cube tray. Once frozen, place the cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a towel or cloth. The cold pack can then be used to soothe sore muscles or reduce swelling and inflammation.",

    "DIY seed starters: Fill each compartment of the ice cube tray with potting soil, then plant a few seeds in each compartment.
