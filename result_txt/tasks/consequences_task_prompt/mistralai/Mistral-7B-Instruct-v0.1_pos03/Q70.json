    "Time dilation: If the speed of light was reduced by half, time would pass slower for objects moving at the reduced speed of light. This is known as time dilation.",
    "Length contraction: If the speed of light was reduced by half, objects moving at the reduced speed of light would appear shorter in the direction of motion. This is known as length contraction.",
    "Gravitational effects: The reduced speed of light would have gravitational effects on objects in the universe, as the force of gravity would be affected by the speed of light.",
    "Communication problems: If the speed of light was reduced by half, communication systems that rely on the speed of light, such as satellites and fiber optic cables, would become less efficient and more prone to errors.",
    "Energy conversion: The reduced speed of light would also affect the conversion of energy from one form to another, such as the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. This could have significant implications for the functioning of the universe."
