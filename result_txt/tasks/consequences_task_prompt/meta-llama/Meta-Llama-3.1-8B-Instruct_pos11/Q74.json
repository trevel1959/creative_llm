    "**Urban Sprawl and Overcrowding**: The city would expand exponentially, with skyscrapers touching the sky and streets becoming congested. The infrastructure would struggle to accommodate the massive influx of people, leading to a decrease in quality of life. The city would become a dense, labyrinthine metropolis with a severe lack of personal space.",
    "**Resource Depletion**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the demand for resources such as food, water, and energy would skyrocket. The city would need to rely heavily on sustainable practices, renewable energy sources, and advanced agricultural systems to meet the needs of its inhabitants. However, the pressure on these resources would lead to scarcity and competition, potentially sparking social unrest.",
    "**Loss of Biodiversity**: The city would become a self-contained ecosystem, potentially leading to the loss of biodiversity as natural habitats and ecosystems are destroyed or replaced. The city's infrastructure would need to incorporate green spaces, parks, and wildlife reserves to maintain some level of biodiversity, but this would be a significant challenge.",
    "**Social Hierarchy and Inequality**: With the entire world living in a single city, social hierarchies and inequalities would become more pronounced. The wealthy would likely reside in luxury skyscrapers, while the poor would be relegated to cramped, lower-level apartments. This would exacerbate existing social and economic disparities, potentially leading to social unrest and conflict.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Living in a single city would have a profound psychological impact on individuals. The constant exposure to crowds, noise, and stress would lead to increased anxiety, depression, and mental health issues. The lack of natural environments and the homogenization of culture would also contribute to a sense of disconnection and disorientation."
