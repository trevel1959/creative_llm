    "**Heating and Cooling Difficulties**: In extreme weather conditions, living without electricity can pose serious health risks. In winter, homes may become uncomfortably cold, leading to hypothermia, while in summer, the lack of air conditioning can result in heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Alternative heating methods, such as wood stoves or fireplaces, would need to be utilized, requiring access to wood and proper ventilation.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many homes rely on electric pumps for water supply. Without electricity, accessing clean water becomes a challenge, especially in urban areas where municipal water systems may fail. Residents would need to find alternative sources of water, such as rainwater harvesting or manual hand pumps, which can be labor-intensive and may not provide sufficient water for daily needs.",
    "**Communication Barriers**: The absence of electricity would disrupt communication methods, making it difficult to access the internet, charge devices, or use landline phones. This could hinder emergency communication and limit access to information, leaving individuals isolated. Alternative communication methods, such as two-way radios or signal flares, would need to be developed.",
    "**Limited Mobility and Transportation**: Electric vehicles and public transportation systems often rely on electricity to operate. Without it, individuals may find it challenging to travel long distances or commute for work. This could lead to a reliance on bicycles or walking, which may not be feasible for everyone, particularly those with mobility issues or in rural areas.",
    "**Impact on Education and Work**: Students and professionals may struggle to complete assignments or conduct work without access to computers, the internet, or even basic lighting for reading and writing. This could lead to a decline in educational performance and productivity, necessitating alternative learning methods such as community study groups or outdoor classes during daylight hours."
