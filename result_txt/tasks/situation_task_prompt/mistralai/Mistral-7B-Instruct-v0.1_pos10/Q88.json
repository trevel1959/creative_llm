    "Invent a flying machine: If all roads become impassable, one could create a flying machine to travel. This could be done by using materials such as lightweight metal, propellers, and a powerful engine. The flying machine could be designed to carry a small group of people or cargo and would provide a new mode of transportation.",
    "Build a boat: If all roads become impassable, another option would be to build a boat. This could be done by using materials such as wood, metal, and a motor. The boat could be designed to carry a small group of people or cargo and would provide a new mode of transportation.",
    "Develop a teleportation device: If all roads become impassable, one could develop a teleportation device. This could be done by using technology such as quantum physics and particle physics. The teleportation device could be designed to transport a small group of people or cargo from one location to another.",
    "Create a network of tunnels: If all roads become impassable, one could create a network of tunnels. This could be done by using materials such as concrete and steel. The tunnels could be designed to carry a small group of people or cargo and would provide a new mode of transportation.",
    "Build a network of bridges: If all roads become impassable, one could build a network of bridges. This could be done by using materials such as concrete and steel. The bridges could be designed to carry a small group of people or cargo and would provide a new mode of transportation."
