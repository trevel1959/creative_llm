These lanterns are then hung from trees, creating a breathtaking display of light and color. The festival would involve music, dance, and storytelling, all centered around the theme of transformation and renewal. Participants would be encouraged to share their personal stories of growth and change, symbolized by the leaves' transition from green to golden.",

The map would be displayed publicly, serving as a reminder of the beauty and mystery of the universe. The project would also involve storytelling and educational sessions, where participants could learn about the history and mythology behind different constellations.",
    "**The Time Capsule Exchange**: A tradition that encourages people to reflect on their past, present, and future. Every year, individuals would create a time capsule containing items that represent their personal growth, accomplishments, and goals. The capsules would be sealed and exchanged with a stranger, who would then open it a year later. The twist? The stranger would also include their own time capsule, which the original creator would open a year later. This would create a ripple effect of self-reflection and connection, as people would be inspired by the stories and experiences of others.",
    "**The Soundscapes of Memories**: A tradition that celebrates the power of sound to evoke emotions and memories.
