    "**Aquaponics System**: Set up an aquaponics system where fish and plants coexist in a symbiotic environment. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, while the plants help purify the water for the fish. This closed-loop system can significantly reduce the need for additional water while ensuring that both the plants and fish thrive.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting with Bio-Filters**: Install a rainwater harvesting system that includes bio-filters to clean and store any available rainwater. The bio-filters can use natural materials like sand, gravel, and charcoal to purify the water, making it safe for plants. This system can also be augmented with a smart sensor that monitors moisture levels in the soil, releasing water only when needed.",
    "**Hydrogel Soil Amendments**: Use hydrogel crystals that absorb water and swell, releasing moisture slowly over time. These crystals can be mixed into the soil to retain water more effectively. They can also be infused with nutrients, providing a slow-release feeding mechanism that keeps plants hydrated and nourished.",
    "**Greywater Recycling System**: Implement a greywater recycling system that collects water from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This water can be filtered and treated for use in watering plants. Creating a designated greywater irrigation system can help conserve fresh water while providing a sustainable solution for plant care.",
    "**Plant Companion Drones**: Design drones equipped with water tanks that can fly over gardens and deliver precise amounts of water directly to plants. These drones can be programmed to follow a watering schedule based on plant needs, soil moisture levels, and weather conditions, ensuring efficient water use without waste."
