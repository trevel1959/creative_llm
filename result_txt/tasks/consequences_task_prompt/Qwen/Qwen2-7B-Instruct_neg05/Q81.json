Cultures might evolve to value different life stages more equally, promoting a more holistic view of aging that includes wisdom, experience, and personal growth rather than solely associating it with decline or loss of capabilities.",
    "**Healthcare and Biomedical Advancements**: With the ability to control biological age, there would be a significant push for advancements in biomedical research aimed at slowing down or reversing the aging process. This could lead to breakthroughs in treating age-related diseases and extending human lifespan, potentially leading to a population where the average life expectancy is significantly increased.",

People might struggle with how to define themselves in an era where aging is no longer a natural, inevitable process. This could lead to discussions around what it means to grow old, how to maintain personal identity, and the role of societal norms in shaping these perceptions. It might also challenge traditional concepts of generational roles and relationships, leading to a more fluid and interconnected society."
