    "Personal Air Vehicles: With all roads disappearing, people could utilize personal air vehicles, such as hoverbikes or jetpacks, to move around their town or city. These vehicles would provide a convenient and efficient means of transportation, allowing individuals to travel long distances quickly and easily.",
    "Maglev Train Networks: Another option would be to develop maglev train networks that operate on magnetic levitation technology. These trains would float above the ground, eliminating the need for roads and providing a smooth, quiet, and efficient means of transportation.",
    "Waterways and Canals: In coastal towns or cities, people could use waterways and canals to move around. This would involve building a network of canals and waterways that connect different parts of the town or city, allowing people to travel by boat or kayak.",
    "Personal Drone Fleets: With the disappearance of roads, individuals could use personal drone fleets to transport themselves and goods around their town or city. These drones could be equipped with specialized cargo pods or passenger seats, allowing for efficient and convenient transportation.",
    "Gravity-Defying Cars: Finally, people could use gravity-defying cars that operate on anti-gravity technology. These cars would be able to hover above the ground, allowing people to travel around their town or city without the need for roads. This would provide a unique and futuristic means of transportation that would be both fun and practical."
