    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Furniture**: Furniture could be designed with integrated glow-in-the-dark materials. For example, chairs, tables, and shelves could be made from a special resin that glows when the lights go out. This would not only provide illumination but also create a unique aesthetic, turning the furniture itself into a source of light and a conversation piece.",
    "**Firefly-inspired LED Orbs**: Create small, portable LED orbs that mimic the flickering light of fireflies. These orbs could be scattered around the room, giving off a soft, warm glow. They could be solar-powered, charging during the day and providing light at night. Their whimsical design would add a touch of nature indoors and make the room feel alive.",
    "**Mood-enhancing Crystal Lamps**: Use crystals that naturally refract light to create a stunning ambient glow. By placing small LED lights beneath or around these crystals, the light would scatter and create a rainbow of colors across the room. This not only provides illumination but also enhances the room's energy, promoting relaxation and creativity.",
    "**Interactive Shadow Play Panels**: Design panels that can be installed on walls, featuring cut-out shapes or patterns. By using a simple candle or a small flame behind these panels, the flickering light would cast intricate shadows on the walls, creating a dynamic and artistic lighting experience. This method would transform the ambiance of the room, allowing for customizable shadow displays.",
    "**Herbal Incense Glow**: Imagine a series of incense holders that not only emit fragrant smoke but also glow when lit. By embedding phosphorescent materials into the holders, the soft glow from the burning incense would illuminate the room while also providing a calming aroma. This combination of light and scent would create a multi-sensory experience that enhances relaxation and tranquility."
