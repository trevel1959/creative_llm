    "**Modular Design for Versatility**: Create a modular table that can be reconfigured for different purposes. The table can have interchangeable parts, such as removable tabletops or adjustable legs that can be transformed into a coffee table, dining table, or work desk. Each module could also come with storage compartments for easy organization of items like books, games, or office supplies.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Table with Recycled Materials**: Design a table made entirely from recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood, recycled glass, or upcycled metal. This not only reduces environmental impact but also provides a unique aesthetic with a story behind each piece. Additionally, the table could be finished with non-toxic, sustainable varnishes to ensure safety and longevity.",
    "**Interactive Projection Table**: Innovate a table that incorporates a projection system to create an interactive surface. This could allow users to play games, watch videos, or even visualize designs directly on the tabletop. The projection system could respond to touch or gestures, making it an engaging centerpiece for social gatherings or creative brainstorming sessions.",
    "**Built-In Heating and Cooling Features**: Enhance comfort by integrating heating and cooling elements into the table. This could be particularly beneficial for outdoor dining or workspaces. Users could adjust the temperature of the table surface, making it comfortable during both hot summer days and chilly winter evenings. The system could be powered by solar panels installed on the tableâ€™s surface.",
    "**Artistic Customization with 3D Printing**: Offer a table that allows for artistic customization through 3D printing. Customers could design their own table legs or decorative elements that can be printed and attached to the table. This would encourage personal expression and allow users to create a piece that truly reflects their style and personality."
