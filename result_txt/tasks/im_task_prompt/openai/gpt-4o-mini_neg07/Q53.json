    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Post-it Notes**: Develop a line of Post-it Notes made from a special material that can be written on with erasable markers. Once youâ€™re done with the note, you can wipe it clean and reuse it multiple times. This would significantly reduce paper waste and cater to environmentally conscious consumers. They could come in various colors and sizes, appealing to different preferences.",
    "**Post-it Note Organizer with QR Codes**: Create a sticky note organizer that includes a small QR code on each note. Users can scan the code with their smartphones to automatically save the note's content to a digital platform, like a task manager or note-taking app. This would bridge the gap between physical and digital note-taking, allowing users to keep their notes organized and easily accessible.",
    "**Mood Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Design Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or light exposure. For instance, when you write a note in bright sunlight, the note might turn a vibrant yellow, while in a cooler environment, it could turn a calming blue. This would not only add a fun visual element but could also be used to convey urgency or importance based on the color displayed.",
    "**Post-it Note Wall Calendar**: Create a giant wall-mounted Post-it Note calendar that can be customized. Each note would represent a day, and users could write reminders, events, or tasks on them. The calendar could be designed to allow easy swapping of notes, making it interactive and flexible for changing schedules. Additionally, it could include magnetic backing for easy attachment and removal.",
    "**Post-it Note with Built-in Sticky Tape**: Develop a Post-it Note that comes with a thin strip of double-sided tape on the back. This would allow users to stick the note to various surfaces securely without the fear of it falling off. It would be particularly useful for people who want to display their notes on walls, windows, or even in their cars without leaving residue behind."
