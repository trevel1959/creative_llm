    "Sonic Squirrels: Imagine a swarm of high-pitched, squeaky squirrels scurrying around your room in the morning, chirping and squealing to wake you up. You could train them to nudge your bed or tickle your face with their bushy tails to signal it's time to rise and shine.",
    "Sunrise Symphony: In a world without birds, the sunrise could become the new morning alarm. As the sky gradually lightens, a symphony of instruments could play a gentle, soothing melody to signal the start of a new day. You could install solar-powered speakers on your windowsills to amplify the sound and create a peaceful wake-up call.",
    "Morning Mantras: In a world without birds, you could adopt a personal morning mantra to help you wake up. This could be a series of uplifting words or phrases that you repeat to yourself as you open your eyes. You could record yourself reciting the mantra and play it back to you every morning, or you could use a smart speaker to chant it for you.",
    "Dream-Inspired Art: Instead of relying on birds to wake you up, you could use your dreams to inspire your morning routine. Keep a dream journal by your bed and write down any vivid or memorable dreams you have each night. When you wake up, use those dreams as inspiration for your morning art project. This could be anything from painting to sculpture to digital art â€“ the possibilities are endless.",
    "Wake-Up Walks: In a world without birds, you could embrace the beauty of nature by taking a morning walk. Set aside 15-30 minutes each day to step outside and explore your surroundings. Take in the sights, sounds, and smells of the natural world, and let the fresh air invigorate you for the day ahead. As you walk, you could listen to a guided meditation or nature sounds to help you relax and focus."
