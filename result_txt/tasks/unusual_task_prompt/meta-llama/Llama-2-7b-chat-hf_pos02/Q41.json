    "Pencil Sharpener with a Twist: Design a pencil sharpener that incorporates a unique twist mechanism. Instead of simply sharpening the pencil, the device can also serve as a desk organizer. The sharpener can have multiple compartments to store pens, pencils, and other office supplies, keeping them within easy reach.",
    "Smart Pencil Sharpener: Create a pencil sharpener that can detect the type of pencil being inserted and automatically adjust the sharpening angle and speed accordingly. This would ensure that the pencil is sharpened to the optimal point for the specific type of pencil being used, resulting in a cleaner and more consistent sharpening job.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with Built-in Eraser: Design a pencil sharpener that incorporates a built-in eraser. The eraser can be located at the base of the sharpener and can be used to remove any graphite or lead residue left behind during the sharpening process. This would eliminate the need for a separate eraser and make the device more convenient to use.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with a Folding Design: Create a pencil sharpener that has a folding design, allowing it to be easily stored and transported. The sharpener can have a compact, flat design when folded and can be opened up to reveal the sharpening mechanism. This would make it ideal for artists, writers, and students who need to travel with their sharpening tools.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with a Motorized Sharpening System: Develop a pencil sharpener that utilizes a motorized sharpening system. The device can have a rotating drum or disc with multiple cutting edges, which are driven by a small motor. This would ensure a faster and more efficient sharpening process, and the motorized system can be powered by batteries or a USB connection."
