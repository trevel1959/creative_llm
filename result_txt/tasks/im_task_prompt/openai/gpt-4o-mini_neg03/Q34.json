    "**Mood-Reflecting Mirror**: Develop a mirror that changes its tint or hue based on the user’s mood. Using sensors to analyze facial expressions and body language, the mirror could adapt its color and brightness to promote relaxation, energy, or focus. For example, a warm, soft glow could help calm a user during stressful moments, while bright, invigorating colors could boost energy levels during morning routines.",
    "**Interactive Fitness Mirror**: Create a mirror that doubles as a personal trainer. It would display workout routines and track user performance in real-time, offering feedback on form and technique through motion sensors. This mirror could also connect to fitness apps, providing personalized workout plans and tracking progress over time, making home workouts more engaging and effective.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mirror with Energy Efficiency**: Design a mirror that incorporates solar panels or energy-efficient lighting to minimize energy consumption. The mirror could use LED lights that adjust brightness based on the ambient light in the room, reducing energy use while still providing optimal lighting for tasks like makeup application or shaving. Additionally, the frame could be made from recycled materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Mirror with Built-in Aromatherapy**: Integrate an aromatherapy diffuser within the mirror frame. Users could select different scents based on their mood or the time of day, with the mirror releasing calming lavender in the evening or invigorating citrus in the morning. This feature would create a multi-sensory experience, enhancing the user’s routine and promoting relaxation or energy as needed.",
    "**Mirror with Soundscapes and Music**: Incorporate a high-quality sound system into the mirror that can play ambient sounds or music to enhance the user's experience. Users could choose from a library of soundscapes, such as ocean waves or forest sounds, to create a calming atmosphere while getting ready. The mirror could also connect to music streaming services, allowing users to enjoy their favorite playlists or podcasts while they prepare for the day."
