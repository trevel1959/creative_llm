    "Build an Atmospheric Water Generator: Develop a device that can extract water vapor from the air and condense it into clean drinking water. This technology already exists, but with further research and development, it could be scaled up for mass production.",
    "Create a Water Filtration System: Develop a system that can filter out pollutants and contaminants from any water source. This could involve using a combination of chemical and biological processes to remove impurities and produce clean drinking water.",
    "Use Solar-Powered Water Purification: Develop a system that uses solar energy to power a water purification process. This could involve using ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and viruses, or using heat from the sun to evaporate pollutants from the water.",
    "Build a Vertical Water Farm: Create a system that can grow plants in a controlled environment, using hydroponics or aeroponics to produce clean drinking water. This would involve using nutrient-rich water to feed the plants, which would then release clean water through their roots.",
    "Develop a Water-Harvesting System: Create a system that can collect and store rainwater for use as clean drinking water. This could involve building large reservoirs or using smaller, portable systems that can be placed in urban areas."
