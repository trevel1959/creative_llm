    "**Wearable Washing Machine**: Imagine a washing machine that can be worn like a backpack. It utilizes ultrasonic technology for gentle cleaning, perfect for delicate fabrics or when dealing with smaller items. This portable device could be particularly useful for people living in small spaces, students who frequently change their locations, or those who often travel. The design would also incorporate solar panels to harness energy from sunlight, reducing reliance on electricity.",
    "**Smart Washing Machine with AI**: Develop a smart washing machine equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities. This machine would learn your laundry habits over time, suggesting optimal wash cycles based on fabric type, color, and dirt level. It could even connect to your smartphone, allowing you to start a wash cycle, check status, or receive notifications when your laundry is done, all through an app.",
    "**Automated Laundry Delivery Service**: Partner with local laundromats and dry cleaners to create a service where your washing machine sends your dirty clothes to a nearby facility for cleaning, then delivers them back home. The machine could have a built-in scanner that identifies the type of fabric and send this information to the nearest compatible laundry service provider. This idea could save users time and effort, especially for those who live in areas without convenient access to laundry services.",
    "**Vertical Washing Machine for High-Rise Living**: For those living in high-rise apartments with limited space, a vertical washing machine could be a game-changer. This machine operates in a vertical axis, significantly reducing its footprint while maintaining full-size washing capacity. It might use advanced water-saving technologies and compact drying systems to ensure efficient use of space and resources.",
    "**Biodegradable Detergent Pods**: Develop a line of biodegradable detergent pods that are designed to dissolve completely in both cold and hot water, making them compatible with any washing machine. These pods could contain enzymes that target specific types of stains more effectively, resulting in cleaner clothes with less environmental impact. They could be marketed as a sustainable alternative for environmentally-conscious consumers, potentially increasing sales among eco-friendly shoppers."
