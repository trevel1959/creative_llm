    "Pest control: Organic farming methods may not be as effective in controlling pests as chemical-based methods. This can lead to crop damage and reduced yields.",
    "Disease management: Organic farming may be more susceptible to diseases, as there are fewer chemical-based treatments available. This can lead to crop losses and reduced yields.",
    "Soil health: Maintaining soil health is crucial for organic farming. Poor soil health can lead to reduced crop yields and lower the quality of the produce.",
    "Weather conditions: Adverse weather conditions, such as drought or extreme heat, can significantly impact crop yields and the overall success of the farm.",
    "Labor costs: Organic farming methods may require more manual labor, which can increase labor costs and make the farm less profitable."
