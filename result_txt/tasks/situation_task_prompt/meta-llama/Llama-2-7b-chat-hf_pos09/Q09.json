    "Build a natural shelter: With all clothes gone, you could use natural materials like leaves, branches, and rocks to build a shelter. You could create a lean-to structure or even a dome-shaped shelter using a frame of branches covered with leaves and other vegetation. This would provide you with protection from wind, rain, and sun.",
    "Create a debris hut: Another option would be to gather debris like cardboard, plastic, and other materials to create a makeshift hut. You could use these materials to create walls and a roof, providing you with some protection from the elements.",
    "Use a tarp or plastic sheeting: If you have access to a tarp or plastic sheeting, you could use it to create a makeshift shelter. You could attach the tarp to branches or rocks to create a sloping roof, or use it as a ground cloth to protect yourself from the elements.",
    "Make a debris blanket: If you don't have any other materials to create a shelter, you could use debris like leaves, grasses, and other vegetation to create a debris blanket. You could pile the debris together and use it to create a makeshift bed, providing you with some protection from the cold and wind.",
    "Use a space blanket: If you have a space blanket, you could use it to keep warm and protect yourself from the elements. Space blankets are lightweight and compact, making them easy to carry, and they can reflect up to 90% of your body heat back to you, keeping you warm in cold temperatures."
