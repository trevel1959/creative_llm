    "Global Economic Boost: If all world debt were erased, it would likely lead to a significant economic boost as individuals, businesses, and governments would no longer be burdened by debt payments. This could result in increased spending, investment, and innovation, leading to a surge in economic growth and job creation.",
    "Redistribution of Wealth: With the erasure of debt, the wealth that was previously concentrated among creditors and financial institutions would be redistributed among the population. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, reducing income inequality and improving the standard of living for many people.",
    "Decreased Financial Instability: The erasure of debt could also lead to a decrease in financial instability, as the risk of debt crises and bankruptcies would be greatly reduced. This could result in a more stable financial system, with less likelihood of widespread economic disruption.",
    "Shift in Global Power Dynamics: The erasure of debt could lead to a shift in global power dynamics, as countries that were previously beholden to creditors would gain more independence and autonomy. This could result in a more balanced global economy, with less influence held by wealthy nations and financial institutions.",
    "Potential for Inflation: One potential consequence of erasing all world debt is an increase in inflation. Without the burden of debt payments, governments and businesses could increase spending and production, leading to a surge in demand and prices. This could result in a decrease in the value of currency, leading to inflation."
