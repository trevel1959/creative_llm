    "Floating Wind Turbine Farms: Create a power plant that harnesses the power of wind energy by placing turbines on floating platforms in the ocean. This innovative solution addresses the limited land availability for traditional wind farms while utilizing the consistent and abundant ocean winds. The platforms can be designed to rotate to optimize energy production and equipped with advanced technology for efficient energy transmission.",
    "Solar-Powered Hydroelectric Dams: Develop a hybrid power plant that combines the advantages of solar energy and hydroelectric power. By building dams with integrated solar panels, the energy generated from the sun can be stored and released as hydroelectric power when needed. This approach can help optimize energy production and reduce the intermittency of renewable energy sources.",
    "Biomass-Fueled Power Plants: Construct a power plant that utilizes waste biomass as a fuel source. This can include agricultural waste, forestry waste, and even food waste. The waste is converted into a fuel source through a gasification process, which produces a synthetic gas (syngas) that can be used to generate electricity. This approach reduces waste disposal issues while providing a sustainable energy source.",
    "Geothermal Power Plants with Carbon Capture: Design a geothermal power plant that captures and utilizes the heat from underground geothermal reservoirs to generate electricity. This approach can provide a reliable and consistent source of renewable energy while minimizing the environmental impact of geothermal energy production. Additionally, the captured carbon can be used for enhanced oil recovery, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Artificial Photosynthesis Power Plants: Develop a power plant that mimics the process of photosynthesis, using sunlight to convert CO2 into organic compounds that can be used as energy sources. This innovative approach leverages the natural process of photosynthesis to generate electricity, reducing the need for fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. The organic compounds produced can be used as fuels or converted into other energy-rich molecules, providing a sustainable and virtually limitless energy source."
