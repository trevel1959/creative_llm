    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: Develop a paintbrush with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different hand sizes and grips. The handle could be made from a flexible material that conforms to the user's grip style, providing comfort during long painting sessions. Additionally, the brush could have interchangeable grips that cater to different painting techniques, such as detailed work or broad strokes.",
    "**Integrated Cleaning System**: Create a paintbrush with an integrated cleaning system that uses a small reservoir of water or cleaning solution. The user can press a button to release the cleaning fluid, which would flow through the bristles, flushing out paint residue. This feature would save time and reduce the mess associated with cleaning brushes, allowing artists to focus more on their creative process.",
    "**Brush with Built-in Palette**: Design a paintbrush that has a small, retractable palette built into its handle. This palette could be used for mixing colors on-the-go, allowing artists to carry fewer supplies. The palette could feature a silicone surface for easy cleaning and could be removable for washing or replacement. This would be particularly useful for plein air painters who need to minimize their equipment.",
    "**LED Light for Precision Work**: Incorporate a small LED light at the tip of the paintbrush to illuminate the painting area. This feature would be especially beneficial for artists working in dimly lit environments or for detailed work where precision is key. The light could be adjustable in brightness and color temperature, helping to reduce eye strain and improve color accuracy.",
    "**Digital Connectivity for Technique Tracking**: Develop a paintbrush that connects to a digital platform via Bluetooth. This brush could track the artist's strokes, pressure, and speed, providing feedback on their technique and suggesting improvements. The data could be visualized in an app, allowing artists to analyze their work and progress over time. This feature would be particularly appealing to art students and hobbyists looking to refine their skills."
