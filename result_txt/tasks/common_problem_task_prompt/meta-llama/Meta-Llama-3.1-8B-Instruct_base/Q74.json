    "**Solar Sail Spacecraft**: Design a satellite that uses a massive solar sail to harness the momentum of solar photons. As the sail is exposed to the sun's radiation pressure, it can accelerate the satellite to high speeds, potentially reaching escape velocities from Earth's orbit. The sail could be made of a thin, reflective material such as Mylar or aluminum, and would need to be carefully designed to maximize its surface area while minimizing its mass. This concept could enable a satellite to reach distant destinations in the solar system, such as the outer planets or even interstellar space, without the need for traditional propulsion systems.",
    "**Inflatable Space Habitat**: Develop a satellite that can inflate a large, inflatable space habitat to provide a comfortable living space for astronauts. The habitat could be made of a lightweight, durable material such as Kevlar or polyurethane, and would need to be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures and radiation. The inflatable habitat could be equipped with life support systems, airlocks, and other essential systems to sustain human life for extended periods. This concept could enable long-duration space missions, such as lunar or Mars expeditions, by providing a safe and comfortable living space for astronauts.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power Collector**: Design a satellite that can collect solar energy in orbit and beam it back to Earth as a microwave beam. The collector could be made of a large, flat panel of photovoltaic cells, and would need to be designed to maximize its surface area while minimizing its mass. The collected energy could be converted into a microwave beam and transmitted back to Earth using a high-gain antenna. This concept could provide a clean and reliable source of energy for Earth, and could potentially help to mitigate climate change by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Artificial Gravity Spacecraft**: Develop a satellite that can generate artificial gravity through rotation. The spacecraft could be designed to rotate around its central axis, creating a centrifugal force that simulates gravity. This could be achieved through a combination of rotation and gravity simulation, allowing astronauts to experience a gravitational force similar to that on Earth. The spacecraft could be equipped with a rotating section, a gravity simulator, and other essential systems to sustain human life for extended periods. This concept could enable long-duration space missions by providing a safe and comfortable living space for astronauts, and could potentially help to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the human body.",
    "**Swarm Spacecraft**: Design a satellite that can be composed of multiple smaller spacecraft, each"
