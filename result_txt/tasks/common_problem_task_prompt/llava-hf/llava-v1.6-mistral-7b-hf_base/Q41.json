    "Another potential problem is the propulsion system. The spaceship needs to be able to travel at high speeds and navigate through space, which requires a powerful and efficient propulsion system. However, this can be challenging to design and implement, as it needs to be able to withstand the extreme conditions of space travel.",
    "The third potential problem is the life support system. Spaceships need to be able to provide a safe and comfortable environment for the crew, which requires a reliable and efficient life support system. This includes the air supply, temperature control, and waste management systems.",
    "The fourth potential problem is the communication system. Spaceships need to be able to communicate with other spaceships, as well as with Earth, in order to coordinate missions and receive updates on the latest developments. However, this can be challenging due to the vast distances between spaceships and the potential for interference from other celestial bodies.",
    "The fifth potential problem is the navigation system. Spaceships need to be able to navigate through space and avoid potential hazards, such as asteroids or other space debris. This requires a sophisticated navigation system that can accurately predict the spaceship's trajectory and make adjustments as needed.",
    "The sixth potential problem is the power supply system. Spaceships need to be able to generate enough power to operate all of their systems, including the propulsion, life support, and communication systems. This requires a reliable and efficient power supply system, which can be challenging to design and implement."
