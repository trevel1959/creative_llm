    "Nature's Rhythm: Without watches and clocks, people would rely on the natural rhythm of the environment to dictate their daily schedule. They could use the position of the sun, the phases of the moon, and the patterns of birdsong to determine the time of day. For example, people could set their daily schedule based on the time of sunrise and sunset, or use the position of the moon to mark the passage of time.",
    "Community Timekeeping: In a world without watches and clocks, communities could come together to create a shared timekeeping system. This could involve setting a standard time based on natural phenomena, such as the rotation of the Earth or the passage of the seasons. Community members could then use this shared timekeeping system to coordinate their daily activities, such as farming, trading, or social events.",
    "Body Clocks: People could use their own internal body clocks to keep track of time. This could involve paying attention to the natural rhythms of the body, such as the circadian rhythm that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. By aligning their daily activities with their internal body clock, people could create a more natural and sustainable schedule.",
    "Time through Touch: In a world without watches and clocks, people could use touch to keep track of time. For example, they could use the weight of a stone or the texture of a piece of wood to measure the passage of time. They could also use the sensation of the wind on their skin or the sound of running water to mark the time of day.",
    "Mindfulness Timing: People could use mindfulness practices to cultivate a deeper awareness of time. By focusing on the present moment and letting go of their reliance on external timekeeping devices, they could create a more fluid and flexible schedule. This could involve paying attention to the breath, the body, or the natural environment to create a sense of timing that is more intuitive and natural."
