    "**Cyberbullying**: The prevalence of social media and online communication increases the risk of cyberbullying. Children may encounter bullying that extends beyond the schoolyard into their homes, affecting their mental health and self-esteem. Parents may find it challenging to monitor their child's online interactions and may not be aware of the signs of cyberbullying until significant harm has occurred.",
    "**Privacy Concerns**: In a world where personal information is often shared online, children may not fully understand the implications of their digital footprint. Parents may struggle to teach their children about privacy settings, data protection, and the permanence of online actions. This lack of understanding can lead to oversharing personal information, making children vulnerable to predators or identity theft.",
    "**Digital Dependency**: As children grow up surrounded by technology, there is a risk of developing a dependency on digital devices for entertainment and social interaction. This can lead to issues such as decreased creativity, diminished problem-solving skills, and a lack of interest in non-digital activities. Parents may find it difficult to encourage outdoor play and other hobbies when children are more inclined to seek entertainment through screens.",
    "**Misinformation and Exposure to Inappropriate Content**: The internet is rife with misinformation and inappropriate content that can confuse or harm children. Parents may struggle to filter what their children are exposed to online, leading to potential misinterpretations of facts or exposure to harmful ideologies. Teaching critical thinking skills and media literacy becomes essential, yet challenging in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.",
    "**Social Skills Development**: With the rise of virtual interactions, children may miss out on developing crucial social skills that are typically honed through in-person experiences. Parents might find that their children struggle with empathy, communication, and conflict resolution when faced with real-world social situations. Balancing digital communication with opportunities for face-to-face interactions becomes a key challenge."
