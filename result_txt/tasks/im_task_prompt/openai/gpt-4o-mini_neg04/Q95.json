    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Incorporate an odor-neutralizing feature using activated charcoal or ozone technology within the basket. This would help keep the laundry smelling fresh even before washing, especially useful for items that may sit for a while before being laundered, such as gym clothes or towels.",
    "**Built-in Scale**: Design the laundry basket with a built-in weight scale that allows users to measure the weight of their laundry. This feature could provide feedback on whether the basket is full enough for a wash load, helping users optimize their laundry routine and avoid overloading their washing machine.",
    "**Foldable Design with Compartments**: Create a collapsible laundry basket that can expand into multiple compartments for sorting laundry but can also be folded flat for easy storage when not in use. This design would be ideal for small living spaces and could feature individual sections for delicates, colors, and whites, making it easier to sort laundry before washing.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Integrated Dryer Functionality**: Develop a laundry basket that has a built-in drying feature. After washing, clothes can be placed in the basket, which would then use gentle heat and airflow to dry the items without the need for a separate dryer. This would be particularly useful for those living in apartments with limited space for laundry appliances.",
    "**Interactive App Connectivity**: Equip the laundry basket with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity that links to a mobile app. The app could track laundry loads, send reminders for washing, suggest optimal washing settings based on the contents, and even provide a virtual wardrobe feature to help users plan outfits based on whatâ€™s clean."
