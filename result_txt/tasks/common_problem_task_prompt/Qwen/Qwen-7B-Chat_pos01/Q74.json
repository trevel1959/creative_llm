    "Develop a unique propulsion system that utilizes renewable energy sources such as solar power or kinetic energy to reduce reliance on traditional rocket fuel.",
    "Create a modular satellite design that allows for easy assembly and disassembly in orbit, reducing the amount of waste generated during launch and operation.",
    "Integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the satellite's operations to improve efficiency and accuracy. For example, AI could be used to predict weather patterns or monitor changes in the Earth's atmosphere.",
    "Collaborate with international partners to develop a network of satellites that can work together to solve global problems such as climate change or poverty.",
    "Design a satellite that is specifically designed to explore the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the reach of traditional spacecraft."
