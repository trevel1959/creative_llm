    "If all sand disappeared, how would you enjoy the beach?",
    "Go for a swim in the ocean: The beach is not just about the sand, it's also about the water. If sand is no longer available, we can still go for a swim in the ocean. This can be a great way to cool off and have fun in the water.",
    "Explore the beach without sand: If all sand disappears, we can still explore the beach without sand. We can take a walk along the shore, enjoy the views, and discover new things. This can be a great way to relax and unwind.",
    "Build a bonfire on the beach: If all sand disappears, we can still build a bonfire on the beach. This can be a great way to spend an evening with friends and family, and it can also be a great way to cook food and enjoy a camping-like experience.",
    "Take a boat ride: If all sand disappears, we can still take a boat ride on the ocean. This can be a great way to explore the coastline and enjoy the scenery. We can also go fishing or snorkeling while we're on the boat."
