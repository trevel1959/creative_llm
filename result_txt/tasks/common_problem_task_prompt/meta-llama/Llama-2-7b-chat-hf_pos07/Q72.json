    "Solar-Powered Flying Drones: The drone would fly over a vast area, capturing solar energy from the sun and storing it in batteries for use in the power plant. The drones could also be used to inspect and maintain the power plant, reducing the need for human intervention and increasing efficiency.",
    "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC): The power plant could utilize the temperature difference between the warm surface waters and cold deep waters of the ocean to generate electricity. This renewable energy source would be particularly effective in coastal areas with consistent ocean currents.",
    "Bioluminescent Microorganisms: Genetically engineered microorganisms could be used to produce a bioluminescent reaction that would generate electricity. This innovative approach would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly source of renewable energy.",
    "Hydrokinetic Power: The power plant could harness the kinetic energy of moving water, such as ocean currents or river flows, to generate electricity. This technology would be particularly effective in areas with consistent water flow.",
    "Floating Solar Panels: The power plant could utilize floating solar panels that are placed on a body of water, such as a lake or reservoir. These panels would capture solar energy from the sun and convert it into electricity, providing a sustainable and efficient source of renewable energy."
