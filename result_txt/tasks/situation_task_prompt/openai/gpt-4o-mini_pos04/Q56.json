    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: Develop augmented reality (AR) glasses that can project a digital reflection of the wearer. These glasses would use cameras to capture the surroundings and display a virtual mirror image of the user on the lenses. This technology could also incorporate fun filters and enhancements, allowing users to experiment with their appearance in real-time.",
    "**Smartphone Apps**: Create an app that uses the front-facing camera of smartphones to simulate a mirror. The app could provide additional features, such as lighting adjustments, beauty filters, and the ability to freeze the image for a closer look. This idea merges technology with personal grooming, making it accessible and practical for daily use.",
    "**Self-Reflective Surfaces**: Design furniture or walls with self-reflective materials that mimic the properties of mirrors. For example, a wall covered in iridescent tiles or a piece of furniture with a reflective finish could serve as a functional design element while allowing individuals to see their reflection in a unique way.",
    "**Virtual Reality Experience**: Create a virtual reality (VR) environment where users can see their avatars and manipulate their appearances. This immersive experience would allow individuals to explore different looks and styles in a fully interactive space, offering a new dimension to self-reflection and personal expression.",
    "**Bioluminescent Reflection**: Innovate with bioluminescent materials that glow and reflect light. Imagine a room or a wearable item that incorporates these materials, creating a soft glow that can highlight the contours of a person's face and body, providing a unique way to \"see\" oneself without traditional mirrors."
