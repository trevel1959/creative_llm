    "**Economic Impact**: An anti-aging breakthrough could radically alter the economy. With longer lifespans, the workforce would expand, potentially leading to increased productivity. However, this could also strain social services, healthcare systems, and pension funds as populations age without the natural decline that typically occurs. Governments would need to rethink taxation and social security structures, potentially shifting towards a system that supports longer work lives and continuous contributions to society.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The ability to stop aging raises profound ethical questions. Who would have access to this technology? If it is expensive, it could exacerbate existing inequalities, creating a divide between those who can afford to remain youthful and those who cannot. Additionally, the implications of overpopulation and resource depletion would need to be addressed. Society would need to grapple with whether it is ethical to prolong life indefinitely when it may lead to suffering or environmental degradation.",
    "**Cultural Shifts**: Cultural attitudes towards life, death, and legacy would undergo a transformation. The significance of milestones like marriage, childbirth, and retirement might diminish as people live for centuries. Artistic expressions, literature, and philosophy would evolve to reflect a new understanding of existence. People might focus more on the quality of life rather than the quantity of years lived, leading to new cultural movements centered around mindfulness, experiences, and personal fulfillment.",
    "**Scientific and Technological Advancements**: The pursuit of anti-aging solutions would likely accelerate advancements in related fields, such as genetics, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine. This could lead to breakthroughs that not only stop aging but also enhance human capabilities, such as cognitive function and physical health. However, this raises concerns about the ethical implications of 'designer' humans and the potential for a new class of genetic inequality.",
    "**Interpersonal Relationships**: The nature of relationships could change dramatically. With the potential for prolonged youth, the dynamics of friendships, family ties, and romantic partnerships might shift. Long-term relationships could become more complex as individuals evolve over centuries, potentially leading to a greater emphasis on compatibility and adaptability in relationships. Additionally, the concept of legacy might change, with individuals focusing more on mentoring and knowledge transfer to younger generations rather than simply passing on material wealth."
