    "**Eco-Centric Democracy**: This type of government places a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and conservation. Each community or region would have its own elected representatives, who are chosen based on their commitment to eco-friendly policies. These representatives would then work together in a decentralized system, where decisions are made based on collective agreements that promote environmental health and sustainability. To ensure transparency and accountability, citizens would have access to real-time data on their local environment's health and the effectiveness of implemented policies.",
    "**Participatory Autonomous Zones (PAZ)**: Under this system, citizens would form autonomous zones based on shared interests or geographic proximity. These zones would have their own governance structures, which are democratically elected by their members.

This rotation would prevent any single group from dominating politics and ensure that diverse perspectives are considered in policy-making. Additionally, there could be periodic elections where citizens vote on major issues, allowing for direct input on significant changes.",
    "**Transhumanist Federation**: This government combines elements of advanced technology and human enhancement to create a more equitable and efficient society. Citizens would have access to personalized genetic modifications, cognitive enhancements, and AI integration to improve their abilities and quality of life. The government would focus on developing and regulating these technologies to ensure they benefit everyone equally.
