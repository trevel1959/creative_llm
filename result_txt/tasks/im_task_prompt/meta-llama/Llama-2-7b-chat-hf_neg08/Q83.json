    "Smart Cart: Develop a smart shopping cart with built-in sensors and AI technology. The cart can detect the items placed inside and automatically calculate the total cost, eliminating the need for manual scanning or weighing. It can also suggest products based on the user's purchase history or provide personalized recommendations based on their preferences.",
    "Multi-Purpose Cart: Design a cart that can serve multiple purposes, such as a grocery cart, a pet carrier, or a stroller. This would eliminate the need for multiple carts and make shopping more convenient.",
    "Self-Stabilizing Cart: Create a cart with built-in stabilizers that keep the cart balanced and upright, even when it's fully loaded. This would be especially useful for elderly or disabled individuals who may have difficulty maneuvering a cart.",
    "Solar-Powered Cart: Design a cart that runs on solar power, eliminating the need for batteries or charging stations. This would make the cart more environmentally friendly and reduce the need for maintenance.",
    "Personalized Cart: Develop a cart with customizable features, such as different color schemes, storage compartments, or even a built-in cooler for perishable items. This would allow users to personalize their cart to suit their individual needs and preferences."
