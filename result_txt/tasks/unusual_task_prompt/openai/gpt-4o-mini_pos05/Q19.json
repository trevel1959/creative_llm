    "**DIY Lubricant**: The wax from a candle can be used to lubricate squeaky hinges, drawers, or any other mechanisms that require a bit of smooth operation. Just rub the candle on the parts that are sticking, and it will reduce friction and eliminate the noise.",
    "**Scented Drawer Freshener**: Instead of traditional air fresheners, place a small candle in your drawers or closets to keep your clothes smelling fresh. As the candle warms up, it will release a subtle fragrance that will permeate the space without overwhelming it.",
    "**Temporary Waterproofing**: If you need to waterproof small items temporarily, like matches or a small piece of paper, dip them in melted candle wax. Once cooled, the wax will create a barrier against moisture, making them suitable for outdoor adventures or camping trips.",
    "**Candle Wax Crayons**: Melt down leftover candle stubs and pour the wax into molds (like ice cube trays) to create colorful wax crayons. You can add natural pigments or dyes to customize the colors. These homemade crayons are perfect for kids' art projects and provide a unique texture.",
    "**Sealing Wax for Letters**: For a personal touch to your correspondence, use melted candle wax as a sealing wax.
