    "**DIY Modular Computer System**: Design a modular computer system where each component (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage) can be upgraded or replaced individually without affecting others. This could be achieved by creating standardized slots for components, which can easily be swapped out like LEGO blocks. The idea is to make the computer highly customizable and easy to maintain.",
    "**3D Printed Personalized Desktop**: Instead of using traditional pre-fabricated desktop cases, design and print custom desktop cases using 3D printing technology. This allows for unique shapes and designs, and also enables personalization in terms of size, color, and material. Users can choose their preferred aesthetic or functional features, such as built-in cooling systems or integrated cable management solutions.",
    "**Sustainable Computing Components**: Develop computer components made from sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled plastics, or bio-composites. These materials have lower environmental impact than traditional plastics or metals. For instance, bamboo keyboards and mice can be designed for ergonomic comfort, while bio-composite cases can offer durability and resistance to environmental elements.",
    "**Voice-Activated DIY Computer Assembly Guide**: Create an interactive, voice-activated assembly guide app that walks users through the process of building a computer step-by-step. This app can use augmented reality to visualize the components and their placement within the case, providing real-time feedback and troubleshooting tips. It would cater to beginners who are interested in learning about computer hardware but may not know where to start.",
    "**AI-Driven Component Selection Tool**: Develop an AI-powered tool that helps users select the optimal components for their specific computing needs, whether it's gaming, video editing, or professional work. This tool would take into account factors like budget, performance requirements, and compatibility. By suggesting tailored components, it simplifies the decision-making process and ensures that users get the best possible configuration for their intended usage."
