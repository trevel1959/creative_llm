    "**Adaptive Suspension System**:    - Develop an advanced suspension system that adjusts automatically based on terrain. Using sensors to detect bumps and inclines, the system could change the stiffness and damping in real-time, providing a smoother ride on rough trails and better stability on smooth roads.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lighting and Charging**:    - Incorporate solar panels into the bike’s frame or fenders to power integrated LED lights for night riding and charge devices like smartphones or GPS units. This eco-friendly feature would ensure visibility in low-light conditions while also providing energy for essential gadgets during long rides.",
    "**Modular Storage Solutions**:    - Design a modular storage system that allows cyclists to easily attach and detach various storage compartments based on their needs. This could include bags for groceries, a compartment for a laptop, or a small cooler for food and drinks, all designed to fit seamlessly into the bike’s frame.",
    "**Ergonomic Handlebar Design**:    - Innovate the handlebar design to include adjustable grips that can be tailored to the rider’s hand size and preferred riding position. The grips could be made from a memory foam material for comfort, and the handlebars could be adjustable in height and angle to reduce strain during long rides.",
    "**Enhanced Safety Features**:    - Integrate smart safety features such as a rearview camera that displays on the dashboard, turn signals that activate when the rider indicates, and an automatic brake light that activates when slowing down. These features would significantly increase visibility and safety for cyclists in traffic."
