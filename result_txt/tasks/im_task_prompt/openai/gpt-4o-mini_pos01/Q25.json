    "**Multi-Function Stapler**: Design a stapler that also functions as a paper cutter and hole puncher. By incorporating interchangeable heads, users can switch between stapling, cutting, and punching holes with a simple mechanism, making it a versatile tool for organizing documents without needing multiple devices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler**: Create a stapler that uses biodegradable staples made from sustainable materials. Additionally, the stapler could be designed to have a built-in recycling compartment that collects used staples, encouraging users to recycle them properly.",
    "**Magnetic Stapler**: Develop a stapler that features a magnetic base, allowing it to stick to metal surfaces like filing cabinets or desks. This would make it easily accessible and reduce the chances of misplacing it. The magnetic feature could also allow for a modular design where multiple staplers can connect for easy transport.",
    "**Adjustable Stapling Force**: Introduce a stapler with an adjustable stapling force mechanism. Users can choose between light, medium, and heavy stapling depending on the thickness of the materials they are binding. This would enhance versatility and improve performance for different tasks, from delicate papers to thicker stacks.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Comfort Grip**: Redesign the stapler to feature an ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the hand, reducing strain during prolonged use. Include a soft, non-slip grip that conforms to the userâ€™s fingers, allowing for better control and less fatigue, especially in high-volume stapling situations."
