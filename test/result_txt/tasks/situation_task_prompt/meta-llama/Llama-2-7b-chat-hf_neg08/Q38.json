    "Create a community-based cleaning cooperative: In a world without soap and cleaning products, individuals could band together to form a cooperative where members contribute their time and skills to maintaining hygiene. Members could take turns providing cleaning supplies, labor, and expertise to ensure that everyone's living spaces are clean and safe. This cooperative could also provide an opportunity for socialization and community building.",
    "Utilize natural cleaning methods: With the absence of commercial cleaning products, people could turn to natural methods of cleaning such as using ash, clay, and plant-based substances to clean surfaces. For example, baking soda and vinegar could be used to clean and disinfect surfaces, while essential oils could be used for their antibacterial properties. This approach would not only be effective but also environmentally friendly.",
    "Develop innovative cleaning tools: In the absence of commercial cleaning products, individuals could create their own cleaning tools using everyday materials. For instance, a toothbrush could be used to clean hard-to-reach areas, while a used tea bag could be used to clean and disinfect surfaces. This approach would not only be creative but also reduce waste and promote sustainability.",
    "Implement a rotational cleaning system: In a world without soap and cleaning products, individuals could adopt a rotational cleaning system where each person takes turns cleaning their own space and the shared spaces in their community. This approach would ensure that everyone has access to clean living spaces and reduce the burden on any one person.",
    "Focus on prevention rather than cleaning: In a world without soap and cleaning products, individuals could focus on preventing dirt and germs from entering their living spaces in the first place. This could involve using natural barriers such as doormats and window screens, as well as practicing good hygiene habits such as washing hands frequently and covering food. By focusing on prevention, individuals could reduce the need for cleaning products and maintain a cleaner living environment."
