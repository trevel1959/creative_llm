    "Negative campaign tactics: Opposing candidates may resort to negative campaign tactics, such as attacking the candidate's personal or professional reputation, which can harm the campaign's reputation and discourage potential supporters.",
    "Media coverage: It can be challenging to secure favorable media coverage for the campaign, especially if the candidate is not well-known or has a controversial record. This can make it difficult to reach a wider audience and generate support.",

    "Inadequate campaign infrastructure: A lack of proper campaign infrastructure, such as a functional website, social media presence, and mobile app, can make it difficult to effectively communicate with supporters and volunteers, as well as to collect and analyze data on voter demographics and preferences.",
    "Volunteer burnout: Managing a large number of volunteers can be challenging, as they may become overwhelmed by the demands of the campaign and burn out. This can lead to a lack of engagement and a decrease in the effectiveness of the campaign."
