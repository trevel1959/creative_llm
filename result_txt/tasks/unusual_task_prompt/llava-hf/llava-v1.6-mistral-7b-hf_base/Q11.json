    "An impromptu table: Instead of relying on a traditional table, a chair can also be used as an impromptu table by placing a tray or flat surface on top. This can be especially useful in tight spaces or when there is a need for extra table space.",
    "A makeshift footrest or ottoman: To provide a simple, comfortable footrest, chairs can be elevated and cushioned with pillows or blankets, making them a convenient personal space for putting up one's feet after a long day. Alternatively, a chair can be reworked into an impromptu ottoman by adding decorative cushions and a tray.",
    "A vertical garden or vertical planter: Chairs with a minimalist design or stripped of their upholstery can be transformed into creative planters for plants, flowers, or small vegetables. To create a vertical garden or planter, affix plants or flowers to the backrest and frame of the chair, keeping them well-watered with a drip hose and soil substrate.",
    "A bike mount: A chair, with the wheels attached to the sides and a cargo rack or flat surface on top, can be converted into a makeshift bicycle trailer or bike mount to carry groceries, supplies, or even a pet.",
    "An accessible workspace: For individuals with limited mobility, chairs can be adapted as an accessible workstation by mounting a tablet or notebook holder on the backrest and attaching a pen or stylus holder on the armrest. This can accommodate left-handed or right-handed users, offering a convenient and ergonomic working setup."
