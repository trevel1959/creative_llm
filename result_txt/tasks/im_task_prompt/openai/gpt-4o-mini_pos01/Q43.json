    "**Multi-Zone Cooking Technology**: Design an oven with separate cooking zones that can operate at different temperatures simultaneously. This feature would allow users to bake a cake while roasting vegetables at a different temperature, all in the same oven. Each zone could be controlled independently via a smart interface, allowing for greater flexibility in meal preparation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning with Eco-Friendly Technology**: Improve the self-cleaning feature of ovens by incorporating eco-friendly materials and methods. For example, a steam cleaning option that uses water and natural cleaning agents to break down food residues without the need for harsh chemicals. This would make the cleaning process more environmentally friendly and less labor-intensive.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional knobs and buttons with a large, interactive touchscreen that provides a user-friendly interface. The screen could display cooking tutorials, recipes, and even a calendar for meal planning. Users could swipe through options, set timers, and monitor cooking progress visually, enhancing the cooking experience.",
    "**Built-In Air Fryer and Sous Vide Functionality**: Combine traditional oven capabilities with modern cooking techniques like air frying and sous vide. This multifunctional oven could come with adjustable racks and specialized cooking compartments, allowing users to air fry, bake, roast, or sous vide in one appliance, saving space and enhancing versatility in the kitchen.",
    "**Modular Oven Design**: Create a modular oven system where users can customize their ovens based on their cooking habits. For instance, users could add or remove compartments like a pizza oven, a smoker, or a dehydrator, depending on their needs. This flexibility would cater to different culinary preferences and make the oven a more versatile kitchen appliance."
