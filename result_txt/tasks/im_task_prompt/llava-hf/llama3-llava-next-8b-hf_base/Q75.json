    "Reheat feature: Add a reheating function to the sandwich toaster, so that users can easily reheat a previously toasted sandwich. This function can be activated by pressing a button on the control panel, which activates the heating coils to reheat the sandwich.",
    "Sandwich wrapper dispenser: Incorporate a built-in dispenser for sandwich wrappers, making it a convenient and sanitary way to hold the sandwich while it toasts. The dispenser can also be removable and reusable.",
    "Variable heat settings: Offer different heat settings for toasting, allowing users to adjust the level of toasting to their preference. For example, a light setting can provide a lightly toasted base, while a heavy setting can ensure the bread becomes nice and crisp.",
    "Energy-saving mode: Adding an energy-saving mode that reduces power consumption when the toaster is not in use. This can be activated by a button, and will lower the power output while keeping the toaster toast and bread crispy.",
    "Sandwich toasting timer: Create a timer on the toaster that automatically turns off once the sandwich reaches the appropriate level of toasting. This can be helpful for people who get distracted and forget if their sandwich is done."
