The proceeds from these events could be donated to a charity that supports peace initiatives worldwide.",
    "**Global Youth Leadership Conference**: Introduce a parallel event focusing on youth leadership. This conference would allow young people from all participating countries to share their perspectives on global issues and potential solutions. It encourages them to take an active role in peace-building, potentially fostering future leaders who will carry forward the spirit of cooperation established at the summit.",
    "**Artistic Peace Collaborations**: Organize art exhibitions featuring works from artists across all participating countries. These could include paintings, sculptures, installations, and performances. The art should reflect themes of peace, unity, and shared human experiences. A live auction could raise funds for peace initiatives, and the final exhibition could travel to various cities after the summit, spreading its message globally.",
    "**Technology for Peace Hackathon**: Host a virtual hackathon focused on developing innovative technologies that promote peace. Participants could work on projects ranging from apps that facilitate cross-cultural communication to platforms that monitor and prevent conflicts. This event would not only contribute to technological advancements but also highlight the role of innovation in promoting peace and understanding.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Workshops**: Incorporate workshops that allow participants to engage directly with cultural practices such as martial arts, dance, or traditional storytelling. These sessions could be led by experts from each country and serve as a form of cultural diplomacy. Attendees would leave with a deeper appreciation for other cultures and skills that can help bridge divides. The knowledge gained could be used to promote peace and understanding in their home countries. "
