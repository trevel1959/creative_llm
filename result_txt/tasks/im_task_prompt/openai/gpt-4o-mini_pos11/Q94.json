    "**Aromatherapy Layering**:    Design candles with multiple layers of different scents, each layer designed to be released at various burn stages. As the candle burns down, it transitions through various aromatic profilesâ€”starting with a refreshing citrus layer, moving to a calming lavender, and finishing with a warm vanilla. This approach would create a multi-sensory experience, allowing users to enjoy different fragrances throughout the candle's lifespan, enhancing relaxation or energizing their environment as needed.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Candle Refills**:    Introduce a candle system with reusable containers and eco-friendly wax refill packs. Customers can purchase refill packs that come in biodegradable packaging, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The refill process could be made easy with a simple pour-and-set method, allowing users to switch scents without needing to buy a whole new candle each time. This not only minimizes waste but also encourages users to experiment with different scents.",
    "**Smart Candles with App Integration**:    Develop smart candles that connect to a mobile app, allowing users to control burn time, scent intensity, and even create custom scent blends. The app could also include a timer feature for automatic shut-off, reminders for when to replace the candle, and mood-setting playlists that sync with the candle's lighting effects. This integration would cater to tech-savvy users looking for a more personalized and convenient candle experience.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Sound Candles**:    Combine candles with built-in Bluetooth speakers that play soothing sounds or music while the candle burns. The candle could have a hidden compartment containing a small speaker that emits sounds like crackling fire, ocean waves, or calming melodies, enhancing the relaxation experience. Users could connect their devices to the candle to play their favorite tunes, creating a cozy atmosphere perfect for unwinding or entertaining.",
    "**Candle Subscription Box**:    Launch a subscription service that delivers unique, limited-edition candles to customers each month. Each box could include a themed candle (e.g., seasonal scents, holiday specials, or inspired by different cultures) along with information about the scent's origins, suggested pairings (like teas or wines), and even DIY projects. This would not only introduce customers to new fragrances but also create a community around candle lovers who can share their experiences and ideas."
