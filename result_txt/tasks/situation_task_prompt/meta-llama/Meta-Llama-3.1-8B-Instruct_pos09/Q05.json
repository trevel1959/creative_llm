    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Develop a portable, compact solar panel integrated into an umbrella that can harness and store energy during the day. This would provide a reliable source of light during nighttime or cloudy conditions. The umbrella could be equipped with a LED light system, ensuring a consistent and efficient light source.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Installation**: Create a unique urban garden featuring bioluminescent plants that absorb light during the day and emit a soft, ethereal glow at night. This innovative solution would not only provide light but also contribute to a calming and visually stunning environment.",
    "**Reflective Roadway Coatings**: Design a special, reflective coating for roads that can be applied to existing infrastructure. This coating would reflect sunlight during the day, amplifying the available light, and could be reactivated with a special LED light system at night, providing a safer and more energy-efficient alternative to traditional streetlights.",
    "**Portable, Rechargeable Lanterns**: Develop a line of portable, rechargeable lanterns that can be powered by solar panels, hand-crank generators, or even kinetic energy harvesting technology. These lanterns would be lightweight, durable, and easy to use, making them an ideal solution for emergency situations or outdoor activities.",
    "**Smart Window Film**: Design a revolutionary smart window film that can absorb and store solar energy during the day, releasing it as a soft, warm glow at night. This film would be applied to windows, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional lighting solutions, while also enhancing the aesthetic appeal of buildings. [/INST] "
