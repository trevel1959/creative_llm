    "Adaptation: The first significant difference would be the adaptation to the underwater environment. Humans would need to develop gills or some other means of breathing underwater, which could be achieved through genetic engineering or technological advancements. This would allow for longer periods of time spent underwater without the need for breathing apparatuses.",
    "Lighting: Lighting would be a significant challenge in an underwater environment. Humans would need to develop specialized light sources that can produce enough light to illuminate the underwater environment without causing harm to marine life. This could include bioluminescent lighting or other sustainable options.",
    "Communication: Communication would be a major challenge in an underwater environment. Humans would need to develop new forms of communication that can travel through water, such as hydrophones or other underwater communication devices. This would allow for effective communication between individuals and communities living underwater.",
    "Transportation: Transportation would be a significant challenge in an underwater environment. Humans would need to develop new forms of transportation that can move through water without causing harm to marine life. This could include advanced submarines or other underwater vehicles.",
    "Energy: Energy would be a major challenge in an underwater environment. Humans would need to develop sustainable sources of energy that can power underwater communities. This could include harnessing energy from ocean currents, tidal power, or other renewable sources."
