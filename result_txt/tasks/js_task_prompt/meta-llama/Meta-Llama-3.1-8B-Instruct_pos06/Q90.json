    "**Bioluminescent Skin**: I would give humans the ability to produce their own light, similar to fireflies or glowworms. This would allow people to navigate in complete darkness, read in low-light environments, and even communicate through subtle changes in color and intensity. The skin would produce a soft, ethereal glow, making it a natural and mesmerizing phenomenon. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Regenerative Organs**: I would make human organs capable of regenerating themselves, similar to salamanders or some species of fish. This would eliminate the need for transplants, reduce the risk of organ failure, and potentially cure diseases that affect specific organs. The body would have a built-in repair mechanism, making it more resilient and adaptable. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Environmental Adaptation**: I would give humans the ability to adapt to extreme environments, such as high altitudes, intense heat, or freezing temperatures. This would allow people to thrive in a wider range of ecosystems, from the driest deserts to the deepest oceans. The body would be able to adjust its physiology to match the surrounding conditions, making it a true marvel of nature. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Neural Interface**: I would create a direct neural interface between the brain and the environment, allowing humans to perceive and interact with the world in entirely new ways. This would enable people to control technology with their minds, access vast amounts of information, and even share thoughts and emotions directly with others. The interface would be seamless and intuitive, revolutionizing the way we live and interact. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Self-Sustaining Energy**: I would give humans the ability to harness and store energy from their surroundings, such as sunlight, wind, or water. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and make energy independence a reality. The body would be able to convert energy into a usable form, making it a self-sustaining and eco-friendly system. (Confidence: 0.85)"
