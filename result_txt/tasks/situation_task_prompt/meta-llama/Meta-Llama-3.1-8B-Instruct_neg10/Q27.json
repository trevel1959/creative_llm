    "**Solar Window Panels**: I would install solar window panels on my windows to harness natural sunlight and heat during the day. These panels would be designed to capture and convert sunlight into thermal energy, which would be stored in a thermal mass material like concrete or brick. At night, the thermal mass would release the stored heat, maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "**Personalized Ventilation System**: I would design a personalized ventilation system that uses advanced algorithms to predict and adjust indoor temperature based on individual preferences, time of day, and external weather conditions. This system would utilize a network of sensors and actuators to regulate airflow, humidity, and temperature, ensuring a comfortable and healthy indoor environment.",
    "**Indoor Vertical Farm**: I would create an indoor vertical farm that not only provides fresh produce but also helps regulate indoor temperature. The farm would be designed with a closed-loop system, where plants absorb CO2 and release oxygen, while also absorbing heat and releasing cooling through transpiration. This would create a natural temperature regulation system, reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling.",
    "**Smart Window Treatments**: I would develop smart window treatments that can adjust to changing light and temperature conditions. These treatments would be equipped with sensors, motors, and advanced algorithms to optimize natural light, heat, and cooling. They would be able to adjust opacity, tint, and angle to regulate indoor temperature and reduce the need for artificial heating and cooling.",
    "**Biophilic Architecture**: I would design a home with biophilic architecture that incorporates natural elements and materials to regulate indoor temperature. The design would feature large overhangs, deep eaves, and strategically placed windows to capture natural light and heat during the day. At night, the building would be designed to release heat through a network of vents and chimneys, maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature while reducing energy consumption. [/INST] "
