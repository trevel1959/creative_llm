    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a table assistant that features a modular design, allowing users to customize the components according to their preferences. For example, it could include interchangeable sections like a mini refrigerator, a charging station for devices, or a compartment for storing utensils. This way, users can personalize their table assistant to fit their lifestyle.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Incorporate AR technology into the table assistant, enabling users to visualize different table arrangements or settings through a connected app. Users could point their smartphone or tablet at the table to see how various decorations, tableware, or layouts would look in real-time, enhancing their dining experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Focus on sustainability by constructing the table assistant from eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient features like solar panels to power any electronic components. This approach not only benefits the environment but also appeals to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**: Equip the table assistant with a touch-sensitive display that provides interactive cooking tutorials and recipes. Users can select a dish, and the assistant will guide them step-by-step, showing videos and adjusting timers automatically. This would make cooking more engaging and help users develop their culinary skills.",
    "**Multi-Functional Use Cases**: Design the table assistant to serve multiple purposes beyond just dining. For example, it could transform into a work desk, a crafting station, or even a game table with built-in storage for board games. This versatility would appeal to consumers with limited space, allowing them to maximize their table's utility."
