    "**Water Filtration System:** Create a filtration system to purify water from natural sources like rivers or lakes. The process involves using materials such as sand, gravel, charcoal, and biological filters. This system can be adapted to remove impurities and bacteria, providing clean water for washing.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Clothing:** Design and create clothing made of self-cleaning materials. These could be fabrics treated with antimicrobial agents that inhibit the growth of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The clothing would essentially clean itself after each use, eliminating the need for soap.",
    "**Biodegradable Soap Alternative:** Develop a biodegradable soap alternative using natural ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and baking soda. This product would not only be effective in cleaning but also environmentally friendly, breaking down naturally over time without causing harm to ecosystems.",
    "**Portable Solar Shower:** Invent a portable solar shower that harnesses the sun's energy to heat water. This device would allow individuals to collect water and heat it on the go, making it possible to wash themselves without relying on traditional soap and water sources.",
    "**Dry Cleaning Method:** Create an innovative dry cleaning method using dry ice (solid CO2) and ultrasonic waves. Dry ice would gently cleanse clothes by sublimating impurities, while ultrasonic waves would dislodge dirt particles. This method would provide a soap-free way to keep clothes clean and fresh."
