    "**Underwater Observatory**: To promote marine conservation and education, I would create an underwater observatory with large glass viewing areas that extend into the ocean. This facility would allow visitors to observe marine life up close without disturbing their natural habitat. Interactive displays would educate guests about the local ecosystem, and guided snorkeling tours would be available to explore coral reefs and underwater gardens.",
    "**Floating Farm and Orchard**: To ensure sustainability and self-sufficiency, the island would feature a floating farm and orchard. Hydroponic systems would grow vegetables and herbs, while fruit trees would thrive in floating gardens. This innovative farming method would minimize land use and provide fresh produce for island inhabitants. Workshops on sustainable farming practices would be offered to educate guests about eco-friendly agriculture.",
    "**Wellness Retreat Center**: The island would include a wellness retreat center focused on holistic health. This center would offer yoga and meditation classes on the beach, spa treatments using natural ingredients sourced from the island, and workshops on mindfulness and nutrition. Guests could also participate in guided nature walks, forest bathing sessions, and detox programs, all designed to promote relaxation and rejuvenation.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Hub**: To celebrate and share the islandâ€™s cultural heritage, a cultural exchange hub would be established. This space would host art exhibitions, music performances, and culinary workshops led by local artisans and chefs. Visitors could learn traditional crafts, participate in dance classes, and taste authentic island cuisine. The hub would foster connections between guests and local communities, encouraging cultural appreciation and understanding.",
    "**Adventure Sports Zone**: For thrill-seekers, the island would feature an adventure sports zone with activities like zip-lining, rock climbing, and surfing. An artificial wave pool could be created for surfing practice, while guided kayaking and paddleboarding tours would explore hidden coves and lagoons. Safety instructors would be on hand to ensure a fun and secure experience for all skill levels."
