    "**Bioluminescent Panels**: Imagine a ceiling or wall covered in bioluminescent panels. These could be custom-designed microorganisms that emit a soft glow, providing ambient lighting to the space. This solution is sustainable, as the organisms can regenerate and the energy they use is derived from natural processes.",
    "**Reflective Surface Panels**: Utilize highly reflective materials like polished aluminum or stainless steel on walls and ceilings. By placing a few strategically placed lamps, their light will be reflected throughout the room, creating an even and bright environment. This method requires fewer lights than traditional setups and can be aesthetically pleasing.",
    "**Invisible LED Lighting**: Develop a technology that allows LED lights to become almost invisible when not in use. These lights would be integrated into the furniture, floor, or walls themselves. When needed, they could be activated to provide gentle, focused illumination without the need for visible fixtures.",
    "**Solar-Powered Luminous Glass**: Create windows or skylights made of glass infused with phosphorescent materials that capture sunlight during the day and slowly release the stored light at night. This creates a continuous, natural light source without any electrical components, making it an environmentally friendly option.",
    "**Laser Light Art**: Use lasers to create intricate patterns and designs that illuminate a room in a unique way. By projecting laser beams onto surfaces, you can create an immersive, dynamic lighting experience. This could be controlled through software, allowing for different lighting scenarios based on the time of day or mood desired."
