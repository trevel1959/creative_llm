    "Atmospheric Water Generation: An atmospheric water generation system could be designed to extract water from the air, using a process that condenses the moisture in the air and collects it in a container.",
    "Water Recycling: A water recycling facility could be built to collect and filter used water from various sources, such as homes, businesses, and industrial facilities, and then reprocess it for reuse.",
    "Fog Collection: A fog collection system could be developed to capture fog and condense it into droplets, which would then be collected and stored for later use.",
    "Geothermal Water Generation: A geothermal power plant could be built to harness the heat generated by the Earth's core and use it to produce steam, which would then be used to generate electricity to power a water purification system.",
    "Water Desalination Using Reverse Osmosis: A reverse osmosis water desalination system could be built to remove salt and other impurities from seawater or brackish water, making it safe for drinking and other uses."
