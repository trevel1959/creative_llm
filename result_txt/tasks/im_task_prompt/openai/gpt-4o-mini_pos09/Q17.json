    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Develop a built-in, eco-friendly detergent dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules. Users can simply insert a capsule, and the machine will dissolve it in the wash cycle. This reduces plastic waste and ensures the right amount of detergent is used for each load, promoting more sustainable laundry practices.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and UV light to sanitize the drum and internal components after each wash cycle. This would help prevent the buildup of mold and bacteria, ensuring that clothes come out fresh and clean while reducing the need for manual cleaning of the washing machine.",
    "**App-Connected Maintenance Alerts**: Create a companion app that connects to the washing machine and provides real-time maintenance alerts. The app can notify users when it's time to clean the filter, check hoses for wear, or perform other maintenance tasks. This proactive approach would help prevent breakdowns and extend the life of the appliance.",
    "**Multi-Function Wash and Dry Combo**: Design a washing machine that can also function as a dryer without the need for a separate unit. By incorporating a heat pump drying system, the machine could wash and dry clothes in one cycle, saving space and energy. Additionally, users could select a wash-only or dry-only option based on their needs.",
    "**Customizable Wash Cycles**: Allow users to create and save their own wash cycles based on their specific preferences and needs. The interface could feature an intuitive touchscreen that lets users select variables like wash time, rinse cycles, and spin speeds, and save them for future use. This personalization would cater to unique fabric care requirements and user habits."
