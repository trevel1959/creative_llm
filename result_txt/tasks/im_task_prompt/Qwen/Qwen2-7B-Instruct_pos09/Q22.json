    "**Innovative Camping Tool**: Design a multi-functional flashlight that can be used as a portable power bank, a Bluetooth speaker, and an emergency SOS beacon. The power bank feature allows users to charge their electronic devices during camping trips, while the speaker can provide music or communication. The SOS function can alert rescuers in case of emergencies.",
    "**Emergency Preparedness Kit**: Create a flashlight that comes equipped with a compass, a whistle, and a small first aid kit. This design would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts who may find themselves in unfamiliar environments where they need to navigate and signal for help.",
    "**Educational Toy for Kids**: Develop a children's flashlight that doubles as a learning tool. It could have different colored lights that teach basic concepts like colors, shapes, or even simple science experiments (e.g., how light affects plants). The design could include interactive games that engage kids in STEM learning through play.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Smart Flashlight**: Design a smart flashlight that adjusts its brightness based on the user's environment and activity level. This can save energy and prolong battery life, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, it could connect to a smartphone app for remote control and customization options.",
    "**Personal Safety Device**: Create a personal alarm system that includes a high-intensity flashlight and a loud siren. When activated, the device not only provides a clear line of sight but also deters potential attackers by creating a loud, visible disturbance. This concept could be especially valuable for individuals walking alone at night or in low-light conditions."
