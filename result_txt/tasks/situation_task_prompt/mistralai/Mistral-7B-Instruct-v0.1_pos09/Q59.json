    "Utilize artificial lighting: If the sky were always cloudy, we would need to rely on artificial lighting to provide the necessary amount of sunlight. This could include installing solar panels or other renewable energy sources to generate electricity for lighting our homes and businesses.",
    "Incorporate green roofs and walls: Green roofs and walls can help to capture and store rainwater, while also providing a natural source of light. By planting tall trees or shrubs on these surfaces, we can create a microclimate that allows for the growth of plants and the absorption of sunlight.",
    "Implement reflective surfaces: Reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or metallic coatings, can help to bounce sunlight back into the atmosphere. By incorporating these surfaces into our buildings and urban landscapes, we can increase the amount of light that reaches the ground.",
    "Develop new materials: Scientists and engineers could work together to develop new materials that are capable of capturing and storing sunlight. These materials could be used to create new building materials or even new forms of transportation.",
    "Encourage the growth of trees: Trees are natural sources of light, and by planting more trees in urban areas, we can increase the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground. This could include planting trees along streets and in parks, as well as creating new green spaces in our cities."
