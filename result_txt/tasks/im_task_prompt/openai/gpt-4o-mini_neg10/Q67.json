    "Smart Paintbrush with Color Recognition:** Imagine a paintbrush equipped with sensors that can recognize colors from a palette or even from the environment. It could display the color code on a small screen on the handle, allowing artists to replicate colors accurately. Additionally, it could suggest complementary colors based on the selected hue, enhancing the artist's creative choices and helping them learn about color theory in a fun, interactive way."
