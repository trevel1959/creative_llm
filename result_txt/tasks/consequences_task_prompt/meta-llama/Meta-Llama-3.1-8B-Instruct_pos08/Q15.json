    "**Global Economic Shift**: The world running out of oil would lead to a significant shift in the global economy. As oil is a primary source of energy, its scarcity would impact various industries such as transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. This would result in a massive restructuring of the economy, with a focus on alternative energy sources and more sustainable practices. Companies that adapt to this new reality would thrive, while those that fail to innovate would struggle to survive.",
    "**Increased Focus on Renewable Energy**: The depletion of oil reserves would accelerate the development and adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Governments and corporations would invest heavily in research and development, leading to breakthroughs in technology and infrastructure. This would create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies, particularly in regions with abundant renewable energy resources.",
    "**Transportation Revolution**: The scarcity of oil would force the development of alternative modes of transportation, such as electric and self-driving vehicles. This would not only reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but also improve road safety and reduce congestion in urban areas. The transportation industry would undergo a significant transformation, with companies that adapt to this new reality leading the way.",
