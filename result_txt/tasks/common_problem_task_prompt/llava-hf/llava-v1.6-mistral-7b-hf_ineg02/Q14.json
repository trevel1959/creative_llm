    "**Safety Concerns**: High-rise building construction is inherently risky, with potential for accidents, such as falls, structural collapses, or chemical spills. Ensuring safety for the construction workers and the general public is a major challenge.",
    "**Accessibility**: Ensuring that the building has accessible features, such as elevators, ramps, and clear pathways, can be difficult, especially in the context of historical or preserved cityscapes.",
    "**Cost Overruns**: High-rise building projects can be very expensive, and unexpected issues during the construction process can often lead to cost overruns.",
    "**Aesthetics and Architectural Integration**: A high-rise building often stands out in the urban landscape, and as such, it must blend in with its surroundings harmoniously while reflecting the architectural style and the needs of the client.",
    "**Urban Planning and Infrastructure**: Before construction begins, there may be questions about how to integrate the new high-rise building into the existing urban landscape with regard to infrastructure, utilities, and zoning regulations."
