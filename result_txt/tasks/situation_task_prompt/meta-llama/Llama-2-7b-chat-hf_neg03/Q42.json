    "Build a shelter using natural materials: To survive on a deserted island, it's crucial to have a shelter that protects you from the elements. I would use fallen branches, palm fronds, and vines to construct a sturdy hut with a thatched roof. The shelter would provide shade, protection from wind and rain, and a sense of security. I would also create a ventilation system by cutting holes in the roof to allow for airflow and preventing the buildup of moisture.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Finding a reliable source of fresh water is essential for survival. I would explore the island to locate a stream, river, or a coconut tree with a hollow trunk. I would collect rainwater by placing a tarp under the shelter to channel the water into a storage container made from a hollowed-out coconut shell or a wooden bowl. I would also use a magnifying glass to focus sunlight onto a rock, creating steam that could be collected and used for drinking.",
    "Start a fire: Fire is crucial for survival, providing warmth, light, and a means of cooking food. I would use a piece of flint and steel to create sparks, igniting dry leaves and twigs. Once the fire is lit, I would use it to cook my food, purify water, and keep warm during the night. I would also use the fire to create a signal fire to alert any passing boats or planes of my presence on the island.",
    "Hunt for food: To sustain myself on the island, I would hunt for wildlife such as fish, crabs, and birds. I would use a makeshift fishing net made from vines and a coconut shell to catch fish in the nearby waters. I would also use a spear made from a tree branch to hunt for land animals. I would cook my food using the fire, making sure to avoid spoilage and contamination.",
    "Create a signal for rescue: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create a signal fire during the day and use a mirror to reflect sunlight towards any passing planes or boats during the night. I would also use a piece of fabric to create a makeshift flag, waving it high above the shelter to signal for"
