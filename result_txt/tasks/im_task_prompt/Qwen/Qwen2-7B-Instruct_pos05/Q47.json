    "**Smart Vacuum Cleaner with AI Integration**: This idea involves developing a vacuum cleaner equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The vacuum cleaner would be able to learn the layout of the house and the user's preferences over time, automatically adjusting its cleaning path and intensity. It could also connect to smart home systems, allowing users to control it through voice commands or their smartphones. Additionally, it might include features like real-time air quality monitoring and automatic dust disposal.",
    "**Portable Vacuum Cleaner for Upholstery and Small Spaces**: A compact, lightweight, and versatile vacuum cleaner specifically designed for cleaning upholstery, curtains, and small spaces like car interiors. This model could come with specialized attachments like upholstery brushes, narrow nozzles, and a crevice tool. Its battery-powered design would make it easy to carry around and use in various locations without needing an electrical outlet.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Vacuum Cleaner**: This innovative vacuum cleaner would feature an internal mechanism that cleans itself after each use. This could involve a built-in filter cleaning system that uses ultrasonic vibrations or a self-cleaning brush roll. Users would only need to empty the dirt bin and possibly replace the filters occasionally, making maintenance significantly easier and less frequent.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Vacuum Cleaner with Variable Speed Control**: An eco-friendly vacuum cleaner that adjusts its suction power based on the type of surface being cleaned. For instance, it could provide more power on carpets while using less on hardwood floors to save energy. This feature would not only help reduce electricity consumption but also extend the battery life of cordless models.",
    "**Vacuum Cleaner with Built-In Dust Collection System**: This idea focuses on creating a vacuum cleaner that collects and stores dust and debris internally instead of having an external bag or container. It could utilize a filtration system that captures particles down to microscopic sizes, reducing the risk of allergens spreading back into the air. The internal storage system would minimize the frequency of emptying the unit, potentially reducing the risk of dust escaping during the process."
