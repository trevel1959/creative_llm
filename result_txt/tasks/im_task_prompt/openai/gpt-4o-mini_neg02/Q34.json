    "**Self-Cleaning Mirror**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism using nanotechnology that prevents smudges and water spots from adhering to the mirror's surface. This could involve a coating that repels water and dirt, allowing users to maintain a crystal-clear reflection without regular cleaning. Additionally, a built-in UV light could help eliminate bacteria and viruses, promoting hygiene.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Color Changing Mirror**: Create a mirror that can change its frame's color or lighting based on the user's mood or the time of day. By using sensors to detect the ambient light and the user's emotional state (through facial recognition), the mirror could adjust its colors to create a calming or energizing atmosphere. For instance, it could emit soft blues and greens in the morning to promote wakefulness and brighter, warmer tones in the evening to help unwind.",
    "**Fitness Coach Mirror**: Design a mirror that integrates fitness technology, allowing users to see their form while exercising. With built-in cameras and motion sensors, it could analyze the user's movements and provide real-time feedback on their posture and technique. Additionally, it could display workout routines, track progress, and even connect to virtual fitness classes, making it a versatile home gym companion.",
    "**Personalized Reflection Mirror**: This mirror could utilize AI to analyze the user's skin and hair condition and provide personalized beauty tips or product recommendations. By scanning the user's face, it could identify issues like dryness or blemishes and suggest skincare routines, makeup techniques, or even specific products to use, all tailored to the individual's needs.",
    "**Mirror with Built-in Aromatherapy**: Integrate a subtle aromatherapy diffuser into the mirror that releases calming scents based on the time of day or the user's preference. For example, in the morning, it could emit energizing citrus scents, while in the evening, it could release soothing lavender. This feature would enhance the user's daily routine, promoting relaxation and well-being."
