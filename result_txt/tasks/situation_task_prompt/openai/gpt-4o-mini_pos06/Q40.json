    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Devices could be designed to capture kinetic energy from movement. For instance, wearable technology like smartwatches or fitness bands could incorporate piezoelectric materials that generate electricity when the wearer moves. This energy could then be used to power small devices or recharge a reserve that could be used later.",
    "**Thermoelectric Generators**: Utilizing temperature differences, thermoelectric generators could be implemented in various environments. For example, in homes, these devices could be installed near heat sources like radiators or ovens. The temperature gradient would generate electricity, which could be used to power devices in the vicinity, especially low-energy appliances.",
    "**Human-Powered Generators**: Create devices that can be powered by human activity, such as hand-crank generators or pedal-powered systems. For example, a bicycle that can charge devices while pedaling could become a popular solution for commuters. This would not only provide power but also promote physical fitness.",
    "**Microbial Fuel Cells**: This innovative technology harnesses the power of bacteria to generate electricity. By creating small microbial fuel cells that can be placed in compost heaps or even in wastewater treatment plants, we could use the natural processes of decomposition to produce energy. This energy could be harnessed to power small devices, contributing to a more sustainable energy cycle.",
    "**Wireless Power Transfer**: Develop infrastructure for wireless power transfer, similar to how Wi-Fi transmits data. This would involve embedding resonant inductive coupling technology into homes, offices, and public spaces. Devices could be designed to receive power wirelessly when within range of these transmitters, allowing them to function without traditional batteries."
