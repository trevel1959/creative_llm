    "**Insufficient Screen Space**: Another issue could be ensuring that there are enough screens to show all the films selected for the festival. This could lead to some films being shown multiple times or some films not being shown at all, which could impact the overall experience for the attendees.",
    "**Inadequate Seating**: If the venue doesn't have enough seating or if the seating is not comfortable, attendees may not have a pleasant experience, which could affect their satisfaction with the festival and discourage them from attending future events.",
    "**Lack of Accessibility**: The festival organizers must ensure that the venue is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. This could involve providing ramps, wheelchair spaces, and audio-descriptive services for the visually impaired.",
    "**Insufficient Catering**: If there isn't enough food and drink available, attendees may get hungry or thirsty during the festival, which could lead to them leaving the event early or feeling uncomfortable throughout the day.",
    "**Inadequate Lighting**: Poor lighting in the venue could make it difficult for attendees to see the screen, which could impact their enjoyment of the films and their overall experience at the festival."
