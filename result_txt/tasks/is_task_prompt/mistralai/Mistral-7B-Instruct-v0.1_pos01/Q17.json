    ": The of the: One idea for a story about an ocean that dried up could be that the ocean had been cursed by a group of angry sea creatures who were tired of humans polluting their waters and harming their ecosystem. The curse caused the ocean to slowly drain away until it was completely dry, leaving the sea creatures stranded on land and the humans without their source of water.",
    "The Great Blue: Another idea could be that the ocean had been taken over by a powerful blue, a mythical creature said to be the ruler of the sea. The blueve had decided that the ocean was no longer suitable for its inhabitants and had used its powers to drain the water away, leaving the sea creatures to find new homes.",
    "The Dry Divide: A third idea could be that the ocean had been divided into two separate oceans, one for the good sea creatures and one for the bad. The good sea creatures had been able to find a way to cross the divide and continue living in their ocean, but the bad sea creatures were stuck on the other side, unable to return to their home.",
    "The Last Wave: A fourth idea could be that the ocean had been hit by a massive wave that drained it completely. The wave had been caused by a group of scientists who had been experimenting with a new form of energy and had accidentally unleashed a wave of unimaginable power.",
    "The Sea of Sand: A fifth idea could be that the ocean had been replaced by a sea of sand. This could have been caused by a group of powerful sand creatures who had decided that the ocean was no longer their domain and had used their powers to turn the water into sand. The sea creatures would have to adapt to their new environment and find a way to survive in the sea of sand."
