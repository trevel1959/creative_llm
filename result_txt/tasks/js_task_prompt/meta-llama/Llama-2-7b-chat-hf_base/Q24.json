    "Energy-efficient buildings: In a perfect city, buildings would be designed to maximize energy efficiency. This could be achieved through the use of advanced insulation materials, solar panels, and wind turbines to generate electricity. The city could also have a centralized energy management system that optimizes energy use and reduces waste.",
    "Green spaces: A perfect city would have ample green spaces, including parks, gardens, and green roofs. These spaces would not only provide aesthetic beauty but also help to purify the air, reduce noise pollution, and provide habitat for local wildlife. The city could also have vertical gardens and green walls to maximize space usage.",
    "Self-sustaining water system: The city would have a self-sustaining water system that collects and treats rainwater, greywater, and blackwater. The water would be used for irrigation, toilets, and other non-potable purposes, reducing the demand on municipal water supplies and minimizing wastewater.",
    "Innovative transportation systems: The city would have a comprehensive network of transportation systems, including electric and self-driving vehicles, public bike sharing, and pedestrian-friendly streets. The city could also have underground tunnels and elevated walkways to reduce traffic congestion and promote walking and cycling.",
    "Smart waste management: The city would have a smart waste management system that uses sensors, AI, and data analytics to optimize waste collection and processing. The system would use data to identify the type and quantity of waste generated and to optimize collection routes, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact."
