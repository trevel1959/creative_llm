    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: Incorporate an odor-neutralizing mechanism into the trash can. This could involve a built-in air filtration system that uses activated charcoal or an essential oil diffuser to mask unpleasant smells. The system could automatically activate when the lid is closed, ensuring that any odors are contained and neutralized, making it ideal for kitchen or bathroom use.",
    "**Solar-Powered Compactor**: Create a solar-powered trash can that features a compaction system. This can would compress waste to maximize capacity, reducing the frequency of collection. The solar panel would power the compaction mechanism, making it eco-friendly and perfect for public spaces like parks or beaches where electricity access may be limited.",
    "**Interactive Recycling Education**: Develop a trash can with an interactive touchscreen interface that educates users on the importance of recycling. Users could scan items before disposal, and the screen would provide information on how to recycle the item properly or suggest alternatives to reduce waste. This would be particularly effective in schools and public areas to raise awareness about environmental responsibility.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Design a trash can that serves multiple purposes. For instance, it could include a built-in seat or a small table on top for outdoor use. This would be ideal for parks or community spaces where seating is limited. The trash can could also feature a small garden planter on the side, promoting green spaces and encouraging users to engage with nature.",
    "**Automated Bag Replacement System**: Innovate a trash can with an automated bag replacement system. When the can is full, it would automatically dispense a new trash bag, making it easier for users to manage waste without having to manually replace the bag. This could be particularly useful in high-traffic areas where waste accumulation is rapid."
