    "**Avian Adaptation**: Humans with wings would undergo significant physiological changes to support flight. Their skeletal system would become lighter and more flexible, with hollow bones and powerful muscles. Their respiratory system would adapt to extract oxygen more efficiently, and their circulatory system would need to pump blood more rapidly to supply oxygen to their muscles. This would lead to a new breed of humans with enhanced endurance and agility. **Confidence score: 0.8**",
    "**Winged Architecture**: Cities would be designed with wing-friendly infrastructure, featuring elevated walkways, wing-resting platforms, and wind-resistant buildings. Humans would need to adapt their daily routines to accommodate their new aerial abilities, leading to a renaissance in urban planning and architecture. **Confidence score: 0.7**",
    "**Flight-Based Economy**: The emergence of winged humans would revolutionize transportation, logistics, and commerce. Airlines would be replaced by human wingmen, offering personalized and flexible air travel. New industries would emerge, such as wing maintenance, aerobatics training, and wing-related tourism. **Confidence score: 0.9**",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With the ability to fly, humans would have a profound impact on the environment. They would be able to monitor and respond to natural disasters more effectively, but also risk disrupting ecosystems and polluting the air. Governments would need to establish regulations to mitigate these effects and ensure sustainable wing-use practices. **Confidence score: 0.85**",
    "**Social and Cultural Shifts**: The advent of winged humans would lead to a fundamental shift in societal values and norms. People would reevaluate their relationship with technology, nature, and each other. New forms of art, literature, and entertainment would emerge, inspired by the thrill of flight and the freedom it brings. **Confidence score: 0.95** [/INST] "
