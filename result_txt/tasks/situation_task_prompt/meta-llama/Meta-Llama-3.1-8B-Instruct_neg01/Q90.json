    "**Solar Still**: Design a solar still that uses the sun's heat to evaporate water from a shallow pool or container. As the water evaporates, it condenses on a cooler surface, such as a plastic sheet or a metal plate, and can be collected as clean drinking water. This method is particularly useful in arid regions where rain is scarce.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that can harvest water from the air, even in extremely dry environments. This device would use a combination of heat, humidity, and condensation to extract water vapor from the air, which can then be collected and purified.",
    "**Fog Collector**: Create a system that captures fog droplets from the air, allowing for the collection of water in areas where fog is a common occurrence. This could involve using mesh or screen-like materials to allow fog droplets to condense and collect on a surface, which can then be drained and purified.",
    "**Desalination**: Design a low-cost, energy-efficient desalination system that can remove salt and other minerals from seawater or brackish water, making it safe for human consumption. This could involve using a combination of membrane filtration, solar stills, or other technologies to remove impurities.",
    "**Aquaponics System**: Develop an aquaponics system that combines fish farming with hydroponics, where fish waste provides nutrients for plants, which in turn help to purify the water. This closed-loop system can be used to collect and recycle water, reducing the need for external water sources and minimizing waste.
