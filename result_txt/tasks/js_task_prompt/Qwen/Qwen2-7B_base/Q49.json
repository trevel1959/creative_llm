    "A time machine - I have always been fascinated by science fiction and the idea of time travel. If I could make anything I drew come to life, I would start with a time machine so I could go back and see historical events, travel to the future, and learn all about what the world would be like if things had gone differently.",
    "A robot servant - I would draw a robot servant that could do all the mundane tasks for me, such as cleaning, cooking, and shopping. It would be an awesome tool that would make my life much easier and more convenient.",
    "A set of superpowers - If I had a magic pen that could make anything I drew come to life, I would start by drawing a set of superpowers. I would have the ability to fly, super strength, and other powers that I have always dreamed of having, and I could use these powers to help people in need.",
    "A teleportation device - I would draw a device that could transport me to any location on Earth instantly. I could travel to any destination without ever having to worry about finding transportation, and I could be anywhere I wanted to be in a matter of seconds.",
    "A healing tool - I would draw a tool that could heal any injury or illness. This would be an incredibly useful tool that could help people all around the world, no matter where they are, to overcome their health challenges and live healthier, more fulfilling lives."
