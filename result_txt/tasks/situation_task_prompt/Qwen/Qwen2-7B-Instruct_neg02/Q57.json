    "**Underwater City:** In response to the threat of rising sea levels, one could imagine a city built beneath the waves. This concept involves creating an underwater metropolis that is self-sustaining and designed to thrive in a submerged environment. The city could feature advanced technologies for extracting energy from the ocean, cultivating food, and purifying water. It would also have systems to protect against tsunamis and other oceanic hazards.",
    "**Mountain Retreat:** If living under the sea is not your cup of tea, you might consider a mountain retreat. By selecting a mountain range that is less likely to be affected by rising sea levels, you can build a cozy, eco-friendly home. This option allows you to enjoy stunning views, cooler temperatures, and a more secluded lifestyle. Additionally, you could invest in renewable energy sources like solar or wind power to ensure a sustainable living environment.",
    "**Floating Communities:** Inspired by the traditional floating villages found in places like the Mekong Delta or Venice, these communities could be adapted for a future with higher sea levels. Using buoyant materials and modular design principles, floating homes could be constructed to move as needed, maintaining their position above the waterline. These structures would incorporate green roofs, rainwater harvesting systems, and solar panels to create energy-efficient, sustainable living spaces.",
    "**Subterranean Dwellings:** For those who prefer underground living, creating a subterranean home offers protection from both rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. By excavating a cave or building underground using advanced tunneling techniques, you can create a comfortable, secure space equipped with modern amenities. To maintain a healthy indoor environment, the design would include effective ventilation, lighting, and heating/cooling systems.",
    "**High-Altitude Farming:** Instead of focusing on residential areas, you could consider establishing a high-altitude agricultural community. By building a series of elevated greenhouses or vertical farms in mountainous regions, you can produce food and sustain yourself without relying on coastal resources. This approach would require innovative hydroponic systems, climate control technology, and careful planning to ensure the long-term viability of such an ecosystem."
