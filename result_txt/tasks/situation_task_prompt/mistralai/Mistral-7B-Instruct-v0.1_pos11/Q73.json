    "Use a parasol: If all trees disappeared, one could use a parasol to provide shade on a hot day. A parasol is a portable umbrella-like device that can be used to protect oneself from the sun. It is a simple and effective solution that can be carried around easily.",
    "Use a portable tent: Another option is to use a portable tent to provide shade on a hot day. A tent can be set up quickly and easily, and can provide a larger area of shade than a parasol. It is a great option for a day out at the beach or a picnic in the park.",
    "Use a reflective surface: A reflective surface, such as a mirror or a piece of reflective tape, can be used to reflect the sun's rays and create a cooling effect. This can be done by placing the reflective surface on the ground or on a nearby wall.",
    "Use a fan: A fan can be used to circulate air and provide a cooling effect. This can be done by placing the fan near a window or door to provide a breeze.",
    "Use a cooling vest: A cooling vest is a garment that is designed to keep the wearer cool. It works by using a special fabric that is able to absorb heat from the body and then release it slowly. This can be a great option for those who need to stay cool in a hot environment."
