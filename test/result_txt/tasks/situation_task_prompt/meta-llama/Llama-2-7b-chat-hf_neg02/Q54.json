    "Hydrofoils: One creative solution to travel across a large body of water without ships or boats is to use hydrofoils. Hydrofoils are boats that use wing-like foils to lift the hull of the boat out of the water, reducing drag and increasing speed. With no ships or boats to obstruct their path, hydrofoils could travel quickly and efficiently across the water.",
    "Airships: Another creative solution is to use airships, also known as blimps or rigid airships. Airships are lighter-than-air vessels that use helium or hydrogen to float above the water. They could travel across the water without the need for ships or boats, and could be steered using propellers or rudders.",
    "Submersibles: Submersibles are underwater vehicles that can travel through the water without surfacing. By using a submersible, people could travel across a large body of water without the need for ships or boats. Submersibles could be powered by electric motors or diesel engines, and could be equipped with specialized equipment such as sonar or underwater cameras.",
    "Personal Watercraft: Another creative solution is to use personal watercraft, such as jet skis or wave runners. These vehicles are small and agile, and can travel quickly and easily across the water. Without the need for large ships or boats, personal watercraft could be a viable means of transportation across a large body of water.",
    "Aquatic Bicycles: Finally, a more unconventional solution could be to use aquatic bicycles. These are bicycles that are designed to operate in the water, using flippers or paddles to propel the rider through the water. Aquatic bicycles could be a fun and unique way to travel across a large body of water, and could be a great option for short distances or for recreational purposes."
