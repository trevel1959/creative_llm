    "**Eco-Friendly Microwave**: Design a microwave oven that is energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. This could include features like energy-saving modes, a built-in timer that automatically shuts off when the food is ready, and the use of recyclable or biodegradable materials in the construction of the microwave.",
    "**Multifunctional Microwave**: Create a microwave oven that can also function as a conventional oven or an air fryer. This would reduce the need for multiple appliances in the kitchen and save space.",
    "**Microwave with a Display Screen**: Add a digital display screen to the microwave oven that can show cooking times, power levels, and other relevant information. This would allow users to easily monitor the cooking process and make adjustments as needed.",
    "**Microwave with a Built-In Camera**: Equip the microwave oven with a built-in camera that can take photos of the food as it cooks. This would allow users to share their cooking experiences on social media or use the images for recipe development.",
    "**Microwave with a Heating Element**: Add a heating element to the microwave oven that can be used to keep food warm after it's been cooked. This would be particularly useful for foods that need to be kept warm for an extended period, such as soups or stews."
