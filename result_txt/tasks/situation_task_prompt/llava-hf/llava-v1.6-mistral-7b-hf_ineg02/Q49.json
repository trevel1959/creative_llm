    "**Wet Cloth Fire Barrier**: Keep a damp cloth handy in case of a fire. If a fire breaks out, quickly grab the wet cloth and drape it over the flames to smother them and prevent them from spreading. This is a simple and effective way to slow down the spread of a fire until professional help arrives.",
    "**Fireproof Room**: Create a fireproof room in your home by sealing off one or more rooms and filling them with water. In case of a fire, you can retreat to this room and wait for help to arrive. The water will help to suppress the flames and protect you until the fire is extinguished.",
    "**Smoke Detectors and Fire Alarms**: Install multiple smoke detectors and fire alarms throughout your home. These devices will alert you to a fire and give you time to evacuate safely. Even without professional firefighting equipment, having a functioning smoke and fire detection system can be crucial in preventing a fire from spreading.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Materials**: Use fire-resistant materials in the construction of your home, such as fire-resistant paint, fire-resistant curtains, and fire-resistant furniture. These materials can help to slow down the spread of a fire and give you more time to escape.",
    "**Emergency Fire Escape Plan**: Have an emergency fire escape plan in place. This should include multiple escape routes, a meeting point for family members, and a plan for how to use the resources you have available to fight a fire."
