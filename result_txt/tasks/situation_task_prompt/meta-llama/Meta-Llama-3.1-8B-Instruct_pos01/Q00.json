    "**Hyperloop Network Expansion**: I would utilize the existing Hyperloop network, which is a high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes and magnetic levitation to propel vehicles at speeds of up to 700 mph. With the sudden failure of cars, the Hyperloop network could be rapidly expanded to connect major cities, providing a fast and efficient mode of transportation. This would require significant investment in infrastructure, but it would be a viable solution in the short term. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Solar-Powered Airships**: I would design and deploy a fleet of solar-powered airships that could travel long distances, carrying passengers and cargo. These airships would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, comfortable accommodations, and renewable energy sources. They could travel at speeds of up to 100 mph, providing a unique and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Underwater Tunnels**: I would propose the construction of underwater tunnels that connect major cities, allowing for fast and efficient travel by train or boat. These tunnels would be designed to withstand the pressure of the deep ocean and would provide a safe and reliable mode of transportation. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Maglev Rail Network**: I would develop a Maglev rail network that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel trains at speeds of up to 300 mph. This network would be designed to connect major cities, providing a fast and efficient mode of transportation. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Amphibious Aircraft**: I would design and deploy a fleet of amphibious aircraft that could travel on both land and water, providing a unique mode of transportation. These aircraft would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, comfortable accommodations, and renewable energy sources. They could travel at speeds of up to 200 mph, providing a fast and efficient mode of transportation. Confidence: 0.6"
