    "Create a \"Weatherproof\" Suit: Using advanced materials and technology, design a suit that can withstand extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, strong winds, and extreme heat or cold. The suit should have multiple layers of insulation, waterproof fabrics, and air-tight seals to keep out moisture and wind. Additionally, the suit could incorporate features like built-in lighting, communication devices, and emergency supplies.",
    "Design a Personalized Shelter: Create a portable shelter that can be customized to fit individual needs and preferences. The shelter could be made from lightweight, durable materials and come equipped with heating and cooling systems, power sources, and storage compartments. It could also be designed to be easily assembled and disassembled, making it easy to transport and store.",
    "Develop an Eco-Friendly Weather-Proofing Solution: Create a natural and sustainable way to weather-proof clothing and other materials. For example, use plants or fungi to create a bio-plastic that can be applied to fabrics to make them water-resistant and breathable. Alternatively, develop a method for creating waterproof fibers using renewable resources like wood pulp or algae.",
    "Invent a Portable Heated Blanket: Create a small, portable blanket that can be heated wirelessly using solar energy or electricity. The blanket could be designed to wrap around the user's body and provide warmth in cold temperatures. It could also be equipped with sensors that detect temperature changes and adjust the heat output accordingly.",
    "Design a Solar-Powered Water Purification System: Create a portable water purification system that uses solar energy to purify dirty or contaminated water. The system could include a filter that removes harmful bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants, as well as a distillation unit that removes salt and other minerals. This would allow people to access clean drinking water even in remote areas without access to electricity or running water."
