    "**Emergency Response and Rescue Operations**: First responders could utilize this power during emergencies, such as natural disasters or fires. By seeing through walls, they could locate trapped individuals or assess the situation inside a building without putting themselves at risk. This could significantly reduce response times and improve rescue efficiency, ultimately saving lives. For instance, in a collapsed building scenario, rescuers could pinpoint survivors and plan their approach to safely extract them.",
    "**Enhanced Security Systems**: Security professionals could employ this ability to monitor premises for unauthorized access or suspicious activity. By seeing through walls, they could identify intruders or assess potential threats in real-time, allowing for quicker responses to security breaches. This capability could be integrated into smart home systems, providing homeowners with peace of mind and allowing them to take preventive measures before a situation escalates.",
    "**Conflict Resolution and Mediation**: In situations where disputes arise—such as family conflicts or business negotiations—this power could help mediators and counselors understand underlying issues by observing interactions without bias. They could see how parties communicate and react to each other, facilitating a more informed and empathetic mediation process. This insight could help in resolving conflicts more effectively, as the mediator could address specific concerns that might not be openly discussed.",
    "**Artistic Exploration**: Artists could use this ability as a new medium for creative expression. For instance, they could create installations that visually represent the hidden aspects of a building or space, revealing stories and histories that are typically concealed. This could lead to innovative art forms that combine architecture and visual storytelling, inviting viewers to engage with the unseen layers of their environment.",
    "**Scientific Research and Archaeology**: Researchers and archaeologists could leverage this power to explore hidden structures and artifacts without excavation. This could lead to significant discoveries, as they could visualize layers of history within a site. For example, they could see ancient ruins beneath modern buildings or locate archaeological treasures without disturbing the ground, preserving the integrity of the site while advancing their research."
