    "**Eco-Friendly Upgrade**: Replace the traditional gasoline engine with a more environmentally friendly alternative, such as an electric or solar-powered motor. This would not only reduce carbon emissions but also decrease noise pollution.",
    "**Self-Propelled**: Add a self-propulsion system, allowing the user to walk alongside the mower while it does the cutting. This would be beneficial for those with mobility issues or for large lawns where the user needs to keep up with the mower.",

    "**Lawn Health Monitor**: Integrate a sensor system that monitors the lawn's health, providing real-time data on factors such as moisture levels, nutrient deficiencies, and pest activity. This would enable users to make informed decisions about their lawn care routine.",
    "**Foldable Design**: Create a lawn mower with a compact, foldable design, making it easier to store in small garages or sheds. This would be particularly useful for urban dwellers with limited storage space."
