    "**Modular Floating Bridge**: Create a modular floating bridge that can be assembled and disassembled quickly and easily. This bridge would consist of several interconnected modules that can be towed to the river and then linked together to create a bridge. The modules would be made from lightweight, buoyant materials and would be designed to support the weight of vehicles and pedestrians.",
    "**Underwater Tunnel**: Construct an underwater tunnel that can be used to cross the river. The tunnel would be built using a combination of underwater concrete and reinforced steel, and would be sealed to prevent water from entering. The tunnel would be accessible via ramps or stairs on either side of the river.",
    "**Cable Car System**: Develop a cable car system that would allow people to cross the river using a cable car that would be suspended from a cable stretched across the river. The cable car would be designed to carry multiple passengers and would be operated using an electric motor.",
    "**Ferries and Barges**: Establish a network of ferries and barges that can be used to transport people and vehicles across the river. The ferries and barges would be designed to accommodate a variety of vehicle types and would operate on a fixed schedule.",
    "**Hanging Walkway**: Build a hanging walkway that would span the width of the river. The walkway would be supported by a series of cables that would be anchored to the riverbanks. The walkway would be made from a lightweight, durable material and would be designed to support the weight of pedestrians."
