    "**Shelter Construction**: Finding or building a shelter is crucial for protection against the elements. However, without proper tools or materials, constructing a safe and comfortable shelter can be a significant challenge. You may face difficulties in finding sturdy materials like wood, leaves, or rocks, and without knowledge of building techniques, your shelter might not withstand storms or other environmental hazards.",
    "**Health Risks**: Living on a deserted island can expose you to various health risks. Insects may carry diseases, and the risk of injury while foraging or building shelter is high. If you suffer a cut or scrape, infections can occur without access to medical supplies. Additionally, consuming unfamiliar plants or animals can lead to food poisoning or allergic reactions.",
    "**Psychological Strain**: The isolation of a deserted island can lead to significant psychological challenges. Loneliness, anxiety, and despair may set in as you grapple with the uncertainty of rescue. Maintaining a positive mindset is essential, but without social interaction or stimulation, it can be difficult to keep morale high.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: If you plan to escape the island, navigation becomes a critical issue. Without a compass or maps, determining your location and direction can be challenging. You may risk getting lost while trying to find your way to safety, which could lead to further isolation or running out of resources.",
    "**Weather Variability**: The weather on a deserted island can be unpredictable. Sudden storms, extreme heat, or cold nights can complicate your survival efforts. If you're unprepared for these conditions, you may suffer from exposure, which can lead to hypothermia or heat exhaustion."
