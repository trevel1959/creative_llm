    "**Mobile Support Services**: Create a fleet of mobile units that provide essential services such as healthcare, mental health counseling, job training, and legal assistance directly to homeless individuals in various neighborhoods. These mobile units can operate on a rotating schedule, ensuring that support is accessible to those who may be hesitant to visit traditional service centers due to stigma or previous negative experiences.",
    "**Work-Integration Programs**: Develop a program that pairs homeless individuals with local businesses for paid work opportunities. This could include job training, mentorship, and transitional employment, allowing participants to gain skills and experience while earning a wage. The program could be supported by tax incentives for businesses that hire participants, creating a win-win situation for the community and the individuals involved.",
    "**Social Enterprises**: Launch social enterprises that provide goods or services while employing homeless individuals. For example, a mobile caf√© or food truck run by formerly homeless individuals could not only provide employment but also serve as a platform to raise awareness about homelessness. Profits from the enterprise could be reinvested into support services, creating a sustainable funding model.",
    "**Community Land Trusts**: Establish community land trusts (CLTs) that acquire and hold land for the benefit of the community, ensuring that housing remains affordable. CLTs can work with local governments to develop low-income housing projects while giving residents a voice in the development process. This approach helps prevent displacement and allows communities to have control over their housing needs.",
    "**Mental Health and Addiction Support Programs**: Create comprehensive mental health and addiction support services tailored to the unique needs of the homeless population. This could include peer support groups, access to therapy, and harm reduction strategies. By addressing underlying mental health and addiction issues, individuals may be better equipped to transition out of homelessness."
