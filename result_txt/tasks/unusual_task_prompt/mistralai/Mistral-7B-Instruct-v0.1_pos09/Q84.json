    "A smart trash can that uses AI technology to sort and recycle waste materials. It would use sensors and cameras to identify different types of waste and sort them accordingly, making it easier for households and businesses to reduce their environmental impact.",
    "A trash can that doubles as a compost bin. It would have a separate compartment for food waste and other organic materials, which would be broken down into nutrient-rich compost over time. This compost could then be used to fertilize plants and gardens, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.",
    "A trash can that uses kinetic energy to power itself. It would use the energy generated from the movement of waste being thrown into the can to power a small generator, which could then be used to charge a battery or power small electronic devices.",
    "A trash can that uses biodegradable materials to break down waste. It would be made from sustainable materials such as bamboo or cornstarch, which would break down over time, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.",
    "A trash can that uses solar power to operate. It would have solar panels on the roof or sides of the can, which would harness the power of the sun to operate a small motor that would open and close the lid. This would reduce the need for electricity and make the trash can more sustainable."
