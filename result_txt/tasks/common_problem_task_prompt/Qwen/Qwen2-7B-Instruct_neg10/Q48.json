    "**Inflatable Ball Volleyball**: Design a new sport using inflatable balls of various sizes and shapes. Players could use any part of their body to hit the ball back and forth over a net, similar to volleyball. The unique aspect would be the variety of balls used, each having different bounce properties, requiring players to adapt their strategies on the fly. This could encourage creativity in gameplay and strategy.",
