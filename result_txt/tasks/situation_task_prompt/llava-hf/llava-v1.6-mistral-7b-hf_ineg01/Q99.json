    "Shadow and Light: Shadows and light can help identify objects. For example, a shadow cast by an object can indicate its shape and the direction of the light source. The way light interacts with an object, such as reflecting off its surface or creating highlights, can also provide clues about its material and form.",
    "Size and Shape: Even without color, the size and shape of objects can be used to differentiate between them. For instance, a square box can be distinguished from a round ball, or a long, thin object from a short, wide one.",
    "Sound and Vibration: In a black and white world, our sense of hearing and touch can become more acute. Sounds made by objects, such as the rustling of paper or the clinking of metal, can help identify them. Vibrations, too, can provide clues about an object's material and structure.",
    "Smell and Taste: Our sense of smell and taste can be a valuable tool in identifying objects. Each object has a unique scent or taste that can be used to differentiate between them. For example, the scent of a freshly baked cake can be distinguished from the smell of a rotten apple.",
    "Contextual Clues: The context in which an object is found can provide clues about its identity. For example, a knife is more likely to be found in a kitchen than in a bedroom. Similarly, a book is more likely to be found on a desk than in a bathroom."
