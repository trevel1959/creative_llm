    "Establish a toy-sharing library where children can borrow toys from other families or donate their unused toys to those in need. This would promote empathy and encourage children to think beyond themselves.",
    "Develop a program that encourages children to explore the natural world through outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and nature walks. This would provide them with a chance to disconnect from technology and connect with the environment around them."
