    "Create a \"Candle Gallery\": This idea is a twist on the classic art gallery. Instead of displaying paintings and sculptures, a \"Candle Gallery\" would showcase an array of candles in various shapes, sizes, colors, and fragrances. The gallery would feature different artists' interpretations of candles and would provide visitors with a unique sensory experience.",
    "Candle-making workshop: Host a candle-making workshop where participants can learn how to create their own candles from scratch. The workshop could cover topics such as wax selection, wick types, and fragrance blending. Attendees could leave the workshop with a newfound appreciation for candles and a custom-made candle to take home.",
    "Candle-scented book club: Create a book club that focuses on books with a candle-themed element. Members could read and discuss books such as \"The Candle Maker's Daughter\" or \"The Candle Wax Chronicles.\" The club could also organize visits to candle-making workshops or candle-themed events.",
    "Candle-scented meditation: Develop a guided meditation that incorporates the scent of candles. Participants could listen to calming music and breathe in the fragrance of different candles, each with its unique scent and properties. The meditation could help reduce stress and promote relaxation.",
    "Candle-scented yoga: Combine yoga with the scent of candles to create a relaxing and calming atmosphere. Participants could practice yoga in a candle-lit space, with the scent of different candles filling the air. The combination of movement and scent could help enhance the yoga experience and promote mindfulness."
