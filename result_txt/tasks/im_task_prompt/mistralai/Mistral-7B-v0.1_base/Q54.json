    "There is always limited space inside the room so an inflatable hammock would be a great alternative!  It will also save space and it is convenient if you can use it on the bed as well :) ",
    "A retractable hammock would be great. It can be carried anywhere. I have this idea from one of the products 'pop up power tent'. I think a 4 leg retractable hammock would be a unique and beneficial product!",
    "If I was the owner of a hamac, a hammock with a pillow for a little comfort would be a huge plus.",
    "I can imagine a really good bed that's like a hammock would be great. It would be very comfortable, would support your head, back, and feet. I would design it so that there are 2 areas on each side for your head and feet to rest, and then in the area between them would be an inflatable pillow that would support your head.  Also, you could put a mattress on the bottom to make it more comfortable. ",
    "I've been thinking about what I would change about a hammock, and I would love to make a hammock stand a really large chair that would work just as well.  However, the benefit to this would be that it could get off of the ground and even be used by people without backs, for example a child who has been paralyzed by their parents.  This would give them an opportunity to sit outside and enjoy nature."
