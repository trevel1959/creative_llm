    "Carrier Pigeons: In a world where phones have stopped working, carrier pigeons could be trained to carry small messages between locations. These pigeons could be equipped with small vests or backpacks containing a message, and released at the starting point. As the pigeons fly between locations, they could be retrieved and the messages delivered. This method would be slow but reliable, and could be used for long-distance communication.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Another option for long-distance communication would be to use homing pigeons. These pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location, and could be used to carry messages between distant points. Homing pigeons could be released at the starting point, and as they fly back to their home location, they could be intercepted and the messages delivered. This method would be slower than carrier pigeons but could be more efficient for shorter distances.",
    "Couriers on Foot: In a world without phones, couriers could be used to carry messages between locations. These couriers could be trained to run or walk between locations, carrying messages in their pockets or backpacks. This method would be slow but reliable, and could be used for short to medium distances. Couriers could be equipped with maps or GPS devices to help them navigate between locations.",
    "Semaphore Signals: Semaphore signals are a method of communication that uses flags or arms to convey messages. In a world without phones, semaphore signals could be used to communicate between locations. This method would be slow but reliable, and could be used for long distances. Semaphore signals could be set up at regular intervals along a coastline or border, allowing messages to be transmitted between locations.",
    "Optical Fiber Cables: Optical fiber cables are used to transmit data over long distances using light. In a world without phones, optical fiber cables could be used to transmit messages between locations. This method would be faster than semaphore signals but slower than carrier pigeons or couriers. Optical fiber cables could be laid between locations, allowing messages to be transmitted quickly and reliably."
