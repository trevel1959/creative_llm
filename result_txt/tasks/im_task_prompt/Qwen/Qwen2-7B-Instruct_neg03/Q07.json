    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Monitoring:** Create a toothbrush that not only cleans teeth but also monitors oral health. It could include features like pressure sensors to prevent gum damage, Bluetooth connectivity to sync data with a smartphone app, and AI-powered feedback on brushing technique and frequency. The app could track brushing habits over time and alert users about potential dental issues.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothpaste with LED Lights:** Develop a toothpaste combined with an LED light device. Users would apply the toothpaste as usual and then use the light for a short period. The LED lights work in conjunction with the toothpaste to enhance whitening effects, targeting stains more effectively. This innovation makes teeth whitening accessible at home without professional visits.",
    "**Ergonomic Toothbrush for Children:** Design a toothbrush specifically for children with a focus on comfort and safety. The brush might have a soft, child-friendly design, come in fun colors, and feature a rechargeable handle. Parents can set a timer on the base or app to ensure children brush for the recommended two minutes. Additionally, it could include a reward system (like stickers or points) to encourage regular brushing.",
    "**Customizable Toothbrush Heads:** Offer toothbrushes with replaceable heads that users can customize. Each head could be made from different materials, such as bamboo, silicone, or even infused with flavors or essential oils. Users can switch out heads based on their preferences, ensuring a personalized oral care experience. This could also reduce waste by encouraging the reuse of the handle instead of disposing of the entire toothbrush.",
    "**Oral Care Subscription Service:** Launch a subscription service that delivers custom toothbrushes and related products directly to customers' homes. Based on their dental needs, age, and other factors, the service could provide personalized recommendations for toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash. This service could also include educational materials about proper oral hygiene, reminders for dentist appointments, and access to online dental consultations. "
