    "**Aurora Mission**: Design a satellite that can harness and store solar energy during the day, and then release it in a controlled manner at night to power a network of ground-based communication stations. This would provide a sustainable and reliable means of communication for remote communities, especially during natural disasters.",
    "**Eco-Satellite**: Develop a satellite that can detect and track ocean pollution, monitoring the spread of plastic waste and oil spills. The satellite could also deploy underwater sensors to collect data on marine life and ocean currents, helping scientists better understand the impact of human activities on the environment.",
    "**Gravity Assist**: Launch a satellite that uses gravitational slingshots to accelerate and change the trajectory of smaller satellites, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective space exploration. This could enable scientists to study the outer reaches of the solar system and beyond.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Design a satellite that can collect solar energy in orbit and beam it back to Earth as microwave beams, providing a clean and constant source of energy. This could help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.",
    "**Asteroid Redirect**: Develop a satellite that can detect and track near-Earth asteroids, providing early warnings for potential impacts. The satellite could also deploy a network of smaller satellites to redirect the asteroid's trajectory, protecting Earth from potential threats.
