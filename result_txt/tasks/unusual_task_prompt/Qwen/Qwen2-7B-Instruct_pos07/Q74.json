    "**Innovative Fitness Equipment**: Design a steering wheel that can be used as an interactive fitness tool. This could include features like resistance bands attached to the wheel, which provide varying levels of difficulty for exercises such as arm curls or overhead presses. Additionally, integrating sensors into the wheel can track user progress and provide real-time feedback, turning mundane workouts into engaging gaming sessions.",
    "**Smart Vehicle Interface**: Develop a steering wheel that incorporates touch screen technology, allowing drivers to easily access and control various vehicle functions without taking their hands off the wheel. Features might include climate control, audio system, navigation, and even vehicle diagnostics. The wheel could also integrate with smartphones and other devices for seamless connectivity and enhanced user experience.",
    "**Emergency Response Tool**: Create a steering wheel that doubles as a mini emergency kit. Inside the wheel, there could be compartments for storing items like a first aid kit, fire extinguisher, flashlight, and even a satellite phone. In the event of an accident or breakdown, drivers would have immediate access to essential tools, potentially saving lives or preventing further damage.",
    "**Enhanced Driving Assistance**: Design a steering wheel that integrates advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This could include features like lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and adaptive cruise control. The wheel itself might offer haptic feedback, providing subtle vibrations to alert drivers to potential dangers on the road.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation Hub**: Think about a steering wheel that promotes sustainable driving practices. For example, it could incorporate solar panels on its underside to charge onboard devices, or perhaps use kinetic energy from the wheel's rotation to power the car's auxiliary systems. This design not only enhances the vehicle's environmental impact but also provides a unique selling point for eco-conscious consumers."
