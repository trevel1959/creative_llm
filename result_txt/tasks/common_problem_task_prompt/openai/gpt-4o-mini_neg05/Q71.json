    "**Budget Overruns**: Producing a Broadway musical often comes with high costs, and financial mismanagement can lead to budget overruns. Unexpected expenses for set design, costumes, or marketing can threaten the productionâ€™s viability. If the production goes over budget, it may lead to cutbacks in other areas, affecting the overall quality of the show.",
    "**Creative Differences**: Collaborating with a diverse team of writers, directors, choreographers, and producers can lead to creative disagreements. If not managed well, these differences can result in a disjointed vision for the musical, causing delays in production and potentially alienating the creative team.",
    "**Technical Difficulties**: The complexity of staging a musical, including sound, lighting, and set changes, can lead to technical issues during rehearsals and performances. Malfunctions or failures in equipment can disrupt the flow of the show, negatively impacting audience experience and performer morale.",
    "**Audience Engagement**: Understanding and connecting with the target audience is essential for a successful musical. A potential problem is if the musical fails to resonate with its intended demographic, leading to poor ticket sales. This could be due to themes that do not appeal to current societal trends or a lack of marketing that reaches the right audience.",
    "**Rehearsal Time Constraints**: Limited rehearsal time can hinder the cast's ability to fully develop their characters and performances. If the production schedule is too tight, actors may not feel adequately prepared, which can lead to mistakes during performances and a lack of confidence among the cast."
