    "Thermal mass: Utilize the thermal mass of heavy furniture, such as couches and beds, to store heat during the day and release it at night. This can help maintain a more stable indoor temperature.",
    "Insulation: Improve the insulation of your home to reduce heat loss during colder months and heat gain during warmer months. This can help maintain a more comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "Solar panels: Install solar panels to harness the power of the sun and generate heat during the day. This can help supplement your heating needs and reduce your reliance on other heating sources.",
    "Geothermal heating and cooling: Utilize the earth's natural geothermal energy to heat and cool your home. This can provide a sustainable and efficient source of heating and cooling.",
    "Heat recovery ventilation (HRV) system: Install an HRV system to exchange fresh air with stale air while recovering heat from exhaust air. This can help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature while reducing energy consumption."
