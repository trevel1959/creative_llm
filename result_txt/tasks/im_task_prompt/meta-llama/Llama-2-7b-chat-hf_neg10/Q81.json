    "Create a smart spatula that can measure ingredients and cooking times, and even adjust cooking temperatures based on the material being cooked. This would make cooking more efficient and accurate.",
    "Invent a spatula with a built-in timer, so users can easily keep track of cooking times and avoid overcooking or undercooking their food. This would be especially useful for beginners or those who are new to cooking.",
    "Design a spatula with a detachable handle, allowing users to clean it more easily and preventing bacteria from spreading. This would make the spatula more hygienic and practical for everyday use.",
    "Create a spatula with a built-in strainer, allowing users to easily strain cooked food without having to use a separate strainer. This would save time and make the cooking process more convenient.",
    "Invent a spatula with a heating element, allowing users to cook food directly on the spatula without needing to transfer it to a pan. This would save time and energy, and make cooking more efficient."
