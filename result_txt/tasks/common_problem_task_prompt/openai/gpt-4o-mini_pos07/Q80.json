    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Traditional wedding invitations often involve significant paper waste and carbon emissions from shipping. Couples can explore digital invitations, which can be customized beautifully and sent via email or social media. If physical invitations are preferred, they can opt for recycled paper or plantable invitations that grow into flowers or herbs when planted. This not only reduces waste but also adds a unique touch to the wedding.",
    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Catering can be a significant source of waste, from single-use plastics to food scraps. Couples should consider hiring caterers who focus on local, organic, and seasonal ingredients to minimize the carbon footprint. They can also explore plant-based menus or incorporate vegetarian options to reduce meat consumption. Furthermore, couples can work with the caterer to implement a plan for composting food waste and providing leftovers to local shelters or food banks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: The wedding attire, from the bride’s dress to the groom’s suit, can have a considerable environmental impact. Couples can choose to rent attire instead of buying new, which reduces waste and the demand for new resources. Alternatively, they can seek out designers who use sustainable fabrics, such as organic cotton or hemp, or consider second-hand options. Additionally, incorporating a “wear again” aspect into the attire can encourage guests to choose outfits they can reuse for future events.",
    "**Transportation Solutions**: Transportation for guests can lead to a significant carbon footprint, especially if many individuals are traveling long distances. To mitigate this, couples can arrange for group transportation options, such as shuttles or buses, to minimize the number of vehicles used. They can also encourage carpooling among guests or select a venue that is easily accessible by public transportation. Additionally, providing information about nearby accommodations can help reduce travel distances.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decorations**: Many wedding decorations, such as floral arrangements and centerpieces, can contribute to waste. Couples can opt for potted plants or local flowers that can be replanted or gifted to guests afterward. Using natural materials, such as wood or stone, can also create a beautiful aesthetic without contributing to waste. Furthermore, couples can consider renting decor items instead of buying them, which reduces the need for new purchases and helps support local businesses."
