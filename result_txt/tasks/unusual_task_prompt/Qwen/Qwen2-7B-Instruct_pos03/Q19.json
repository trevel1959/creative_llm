    "**Candle-powered light-up books**: Create a book where the pages are made of translucent material. The user can then place a candle in a specially designed slot at the back of the book. As the candle burns, it illuminates the pages, creating a unique and intimate reading experience. The candle's heat can also be harnessed to power small electronic devices like a tiny speaker or a battery charger.",
    "**DIY scented candle-making kit**: Design a kit that allows users to create their own custom scented candles. The kit should include various fragrances (like lavender, rose, citrus, or vanilla), waxes, and other decorative items such as dried flowers or seashells. Users can mix different fragrances and colors to create personalized gifts for friends or family members.",
    "**Portable solar-powered lantern with candle design**: Combine traditional candle aesthetics with modern technology by creating a portable lantern that can be charged using sunlight. The lantern would feature a small, battery-operated LED light that mimics the appearance of a candle flame. This would make it ideal for outdoor activities like camping, picnics, or backyard gatherings.",
    "**Interactive storybook with a candle theme**: Develop an interactive children's book that tells a story through the use of candles. Each page could have a small candle holder that reveals part of the story when a candle is placed inside. The story could involve magical adventures or historical events, making the experience both educational and entertaining.",
    "**Candle-themed escape room**: Design an escape room experience centered around the theme of candle-making and history. Participants would solve puzzles related to candle-making techniques from different eras, using clues hidden within antique candle-making tools and materials. This would combine physical challenges with historical education, providing a fun and immersive learning experience."
