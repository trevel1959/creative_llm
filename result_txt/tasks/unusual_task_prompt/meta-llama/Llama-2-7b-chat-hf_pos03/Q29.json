    "SmartSnooze: A smart alarm clock that uses AI to learn your sleep patterns and preferences. It can detect when you're in a light sleep phase and gently wake you up with a soft, soothing sound, such as a gentle melody or a nature sound. This helps you wake up feeling refreshed and energized, without feeling jolted awake by a loud, harsh alarm.",
    "Vibrating Alarm Clock: A vibrating alarm clock that uses haptic technology to gently vibrate your body, rather than relying on a loud alarm sound. This can be especially helpful for people who are hard of hearing or prefer a more gentle wake-up experience. The vibrations can be customized to different levels and patterns, such as a gentle pulse or a more intense vibration sequence, to help you wake up feeling refreshed and alert.",
    "Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock: An alarm clock that uses a built-in sleep cycle tracker to determine the best time to wake you up during your lightest sleep phase. It can monitor your sleep patterns and wake you up during a time when you're likely to feel refreshed and alert, rather than groggy and disoriented. This can help you start your day feeling more energized and refreshed, and reduce the likelihood of hitting the snooze button.",
    "Voice-Controlled Alarm Clock: A smart alarm clock that can be controlled using voice commands, allowing you to set and manage your alarms hands-free. This can be especially helpful for people who are busy or have difficulty using their hands in the morning, such as those with mobility or dexterity issues. You can simply say \"good morning\" to the alarm clock to turn it off or \"snooze\" to delay the alarm for a few minutes, making it easier to get out of bed and start your day.",
    "Projector Alarm Clock: An alarm clock that projects a bright, colorful image onto a wall or ceiling to wake you up.
