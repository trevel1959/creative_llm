    "Multi-Functional Surfboard: Design a surfboard that has additional features, such as a built-in camera for capturing surfing experiences, a waterproof compartment for storing personal belongings, or even a GPS tracking system to help surfers locate their starting point after a session.",
    "Customizable Surfboard: Create a surfboard that can be personalized with different designs, colors, or patterns. This would allow surfers to express their individual style and preferences, making the surfboard not only a functional piece of equipment but also a personal statement.",
    "Surfboard Accessories: Develop a range of accessories for the surfboard, such as a leash holder for keeping the surfboard attached to the surfer's ankle, a wax-on/wax-off system for easy maintenance, or a traction pad for better grip on the board.",
    "Surfboard Training Tool: Develop a surfboard specifically designed for beginners or for use in training sessions. This surfboard could have features such as a larger, more stable surface, built-in buoyancy aids, or even a training video or guidebook to help users learn the basics of surfing.",
    "Surfboard Safety Features: Introduce a surfboard with built-in safety features, such as a whistle, a flotation device, or even a panic button that sends a signal to a nearby rescue team. This would make the surfboard not only a fun piece of equipment but also a safer one."
