    "Air-Powered Hydrofoils: Develop a new type of hydrofoil that uses air pressure to lift and propel vessels across the water. This technology would utilize a network of air chambers that inflate and deflate in synchronization with the waves, providing a stable and efficient means of transportation. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Magnetic Propulsion: Harness the power of magnetic fields to create a propulsion system that replaces traditional engines. Magnetic fields could be used to generate thrust and maneuver vessels through the water, eliminating the need for fossil fuels and reducing emissions. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Aqua-Sailing: Develop a sailing system that utilizes the buoyancy of water to propel vessels. This technology would involve a series of inflatable sails that harness the upward force of the water to propel vessels forward, reducing the need for traditional engines and improving fuel efficiency. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Bio-Inspired Design: Draw inspiration from nature to create a new type of vessel that mimics the movement and stability of marine life. This could involve the use of flexible, wing-like structures that provide lift and stability, as well as a streamlined body that reduces drag and improves fuel efficiency. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Water-Borne Cargo Drones: Develop small, autonomous drones that can transport cargo across large bodies of water. These drones could be powered by solar panels or fuel cells, and would use advanced navigation systems to avoid obstacles and reach their destinations efficiently. Confidence Score: 0.8"
