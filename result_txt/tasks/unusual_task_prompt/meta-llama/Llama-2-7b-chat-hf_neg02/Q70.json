    "Smart Coat Rack with AI-Powered Organization: Create a coat rack that not only holds coats but also uses artificial intelligence to organize them. The rack could have sensors that detect when a coat is placed on it and categorize it based on its material, color, or owner. The AI system could then suggest where each coat should be hung based on factors like temperature, humidity, and proximity to the wearer. This would ensure that each coat is stored in the most optimal location for its material and the user's preferences.",
    "Coat Rack with Built-In Lights: Design a coat rack with built-in LED lights that can be adjusted to provide different levels of illumination. The lights could be positioned at different heights to provide a subtle glow or a more intense brightness, depending on the user's preference. This feature would not only add aesthetic appeal but also provide practical lighting for the surrounding area.",
    "Coat Rack with Integrated Storage: Create a coat rack with integrated storage compartments for accessories like scarves, hats, and gloves. The compartments could be designed with different sizes and shapes to accommodate various items, and the rack could have a sliding or revolving mechanism to easily access the stored items. This would help keep the coat rack organized and clutter-free while providing convenient storage for accessories.",
    "Coat Rack with a Built-In Umbrella Holder: Design a coat rack with a built-in umbrella holder that can hold several umbrellas of different sizes. The holder could be positioned in a convenient location, such as near the front door or near a window, to make it easy to grab an umbrella when needed. This feature would be particularly useful in rainy climates or areas with frequent rain showers.",
    "Coat Rack with a Sustainable Design: Create a coat rack made from sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, bamboo, or recycled plastic. The rack could have a minimalist design that maximizes space while providing ample storage for coats and accessories. This eco-friendly coat rack would not only be good for the environment but also make a statement in any room."
