    "**Scented Clay Art**: Develop a line of air-dry clay that is infused with natural fragrances. Artists and hobbyists can mold the clay into decorative shapes, and as it dries, it releases a subtle scent. This could be marketed as a dual-purpose craft: creating art while also providing a pleasant aroma in homes. Additionally, different clay colors could correspond to different scents, allowing for a personalized artistic expression.",
    "**Aroma-Infused Fabrics**: Innovate textiles that are embedded with microcapsules containing essential oils. These fabrics could be used in clothing, home textiles, or even upholstery. As the fabric moves or is washed, the microcapsules would release fragrance, creating a continuous pleasant scent. This would be particularly appealing for bedding and curtains, where people often seek comfort and relaxation.",
    "**Scented Candle Workshops**: Establish local workshops where individuals can create their own scented candles using natural waxes and essential oils. Participants would be guided through the process of blending scents to find their perfect fragrance. This hands-on experience not only allows for creativity but also gives people a way to produce unique scents tailored to their preferences, all while learning about the properties of different oils.",
    "**Edible Scent Enhancers**: Introduce a line of culinary herbs and spices that are specifically cultivated for their aromatic properties, designed to enhance not only the flavor of dishes but also the scent of a room when cooked. For example, rosemary and citrus zest can create a delightful aroma when used in cooking, transforming the kitchen into a fragrant space. Cooking classes could be offered to teach people how to maximize these scents in their meals.",
    "**Natural Scent Diffusers**: Create a line of decorative diffusers made from sustainable materials that use natural elements like bamboo, wood, or stone. These diffusers would work by absorbing essential oils and slowly releasing them into the air. Each design could reflect different themes or styles, allowing individuals to choose a diffuser that complements their home decor while providing a pleasant scent experience."
