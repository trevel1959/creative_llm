    "Create an interactive virtual reality game where players take on the role of a person with an invisible friend. The game would allow players to experience the challenges and joys of having an invisible friend, and would also teach empathy and understanding towards those who may struggle with mental health issues.",
    "Write a letter to an invisible friend, expressing gratitude and appreciation for their presence in your life. The letter could be published online or in a book, and could serve as a reminder to others to cherish their relationships with those who may not be physically present.",
    "Create a podcast or radio show where people share their stories of their invisible friends. The show could explore the various ways in which people cope with loneliness and isolation, and could provide listeners with valuable insights and advice on how to navigate similar situations.",
    "Write a novel or short story where the protagonist discovers that their best friend is actually an invisible entity. The story could explore themes of friendship, identity, and the nature of reality, and could challenge readers to question their assumptions about what it means to be a friend.",
    "Create a social media campaign that encourages people to share photos and stories of their invisible friends. The campaign could use the hashtag #InvisibleFriend and could help to raise awareness about the importance of mental health and the value of human connection."
