    "Emberlight App: Create an app that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to bring candles to life. Users can choose from various candle scents and colors, and the app will superimpose a 3D model of the candle on their phone screen. When they light the candle virtually, the app will display a mesmerizing flame effect that responds to their touch.",
    "FlameFusion: Develop a candle that combines the benefits of aromatherapy and color therapy. The candle will have a special blend of essential oils and pigments that create a unique color and scent profile based on the user's mood. For example, a calming lavender scent and blue color may be associated with relaxation, while a peppermint scent and green color may be associated with energy and focus.",
    "WickWizard: Create a candle that can be customized with different wick sizes and shapes to control the burn time and scent release. Users can choose from various wick sizes and shapes, such as a small, slow-burning wick for a longer burn time or a larger, faster-burning wick for a more intense scent release.",
    "MeltyMoods: Develop a candle that changes color and scent based on the user's emotions. The candle will have a special sensor that detects the user's emotions and adjusts the color and scent of the flame accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the candle may change to a calming blue color with a soothing lavender scent.",
    "FlickerFusion: Create a candle that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Users can adjust the brightness and color of the flame, as well as the scent release, from a distance.
