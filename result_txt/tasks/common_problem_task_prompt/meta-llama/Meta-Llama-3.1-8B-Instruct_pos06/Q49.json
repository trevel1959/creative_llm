    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH)**: AWH is a device that can extract clean water from the air, even in arid environments. It uses a proprietary membrane that selectively absorbs water vapor, condenses it, and filters out impurities. The technology can be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, making it a sustainable solution for communities struggling with water scarcity.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Built-in Microchips**: These contact lenses are equipped with microchips that can monitor glucose levels, track eye health, and provide virtual displays for information such as time, notifications, and even augmented reality experiences. The lenses are made of a flexible, breathable material that ensures comfort and safety.",
    "**Self-Healing Concrete**: This revolutionary concrete is infused with microcapsules containing a polymer that can repair cracks and damages autonomously. The microcapsules release the polymer when exposed to stress or damage, allowing the concrete to heal itself without the need for manual intervention. This technology can significantly reduce maintenance costs and extend the lifespan of infrastructure.",
    "**Artificial Photosynthesis (AP) System**: AP mimics the process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemical energy, which can be stored and used as a clean fuel source. The system consists of a membrane that captures light energy, a catalyst that converts it into chemical bonds, and a storage unit that holds the energy. AP has the potential to replace fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.",
    "**Shape-Memory Alloys (SMAs) for Prosthetics**: SMAs are alloys that can change shape in response to temperature changes, allowing them to be used in prosthetic limbs. These prosthetics can be designed to mimic the natural movement of human limbs, providing a more comfortable and natural experience for amputees. The SMAs can also be used to create adaptive prosthetics that adjust to different environments and activities."
