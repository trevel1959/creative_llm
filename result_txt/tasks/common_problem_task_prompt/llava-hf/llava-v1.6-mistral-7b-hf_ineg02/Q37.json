    "**Inadequate Space**: Finding enough space for all the artwork, visitors, and necessary equipment (like lighting or walls to hang the art) can be challenging. Art exhibitions often require large galleries or studios, which might be hard to secure on short notice or within a tight budget.",
    "**Artwork Transportation**: Safely moving and transporting artworks to the venue can be a logistical nightmare, especially if the artwork is fragile or requires special handling. This process can put undue stress on the event organizers and the artists involved.",
    "**Permissions and Copyrights**: Organizers may overlook copyright issues or artist permissions, leading to potential legal complications. Ensuring all rights are cleared can be time-consuming and may affect the quality of artists available for the exhibition.",
    "**Security**: With valuable artworks on display, security measures need to be in place to prevent theft or vandalism. Hiring security personnel, installing surveillance cameras, or even restricting access could pose additional costs and logistical challenges.",
    "**Accessibility**: Ensuring the exhibition space is accessible to all visitors, including those with disabilities or mobility issues, can be complicated. Meeting building codes and regulations for accessibility can be expensive and require significant remodeling or additions to the venue."
