    "Smart Tape Measure: Develop a tape measure that can detect and measure the distance and dimensions of objects using computer vision and AI technology. This smart tape measure can be used in various industries such as construction, interior design, and architecture.",
    "Virtual Reality Tape Measure: Create a tape measure that utilizes virtual reality technology to allow users to measure distances and dimensions in a virtual environment. This would be particularly useful for architects and designers who need to visualize and measure spaces before they are built.",
    "Tape Measure with Built-in Level: Incorporate a built-in level into the tape measure, allowing users to ensure that surfaces are level and plumb before taking measurements. This feature would be particularly useful for construction and carpentry projects.",
    "Tape Measure with GPS Tracking: Develop a tape measure that includes GPS tracking capabilities, allowing users to track the location and distance of their measurements. This would be useful for surveying and mapping projects, as well as for tracking the location of objects or structures during construction.",
    "Tape Measure with Augmented Reality Display: Create a tape measure that includes an augmented reality display, allowing users to view measurements and dimensions in real-time. This would be particularly useful for complex projects, such as construction or interior design, where it can be difficult to visualize dimensions and measurements."
