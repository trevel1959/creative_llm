    "**Neurofeedback Training**: I would use neurofeedback training to learn how to control my brain's response to potential injuries. By monitoring my brain activity, I could anticipate and prepare for situations that might lead to injury, such as avoiding overexertion or taking evasive action to avoid accidents.",
    "**Advanced Prosthetics**: I would develop and use advanced prosthetic limbs that can detect and respond to my brain signals, allowing me to interact with my environment in a more precise and controlled manner. This would enable me to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as typing or using tools, without risking injury.",
    "**Predictive Analytics**: I would use machine learning algorithms to analyze my environment and predict potential hazards, allowing me to take proactive measures to avoid them. This could include detecting potential falls, avoiding collisions, or recognizing warning signs of an impending disaster.",
    "**Tactile Simulation**: I would create a tactile simulation system that uses sensors and actuators to recreate the sensation of touch, allowing me to feel and respond to my environment in a more intuitive way. This would enable me to perform tasks that require tactile feedback, such as cooking or playing musical instruments, without risking injury.",
    "**Autonomous Assistants**: I would develop and use autonomous assistants, such as robots or drones, to perform tasks that require physical interaction, such as lifting heavy objects or navigating complex environments. This would enable me to focus on higher-level tasks while minimizing the risk of injury."
