    "The Great Rail Revival: With cars off the road, rail transportation would experience a resurgence. People could travel long distances by train, which would be faster and more efficient than ever before. Governments could invest in upgrading existing rail infrastructure and building new lines to connect major cities. Additionally, trains could be equipped with modern amenities like high-speed Wi-Fi and comfortable sleeping cars to make the journey enjoyable.",
    "Bicycle Highways: Cities could convert their roads into bicycle-only highways, complete with dedicated lanes, traffic lights, and bike-only bridges. This would provide a low-cost, eco-friendly option for short to medium distance travel. Commuters could use foldable bikes or electric bikes for longer journeys, and bike-sharing services could be set up in major cities.",
    "Hyperloop Network: The Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using vacuum-sealed tubes and magnetic levitation technology, could become the next big thing in long-distance travel. The Hyperloop could connect major cities across the globe, reducing travel time between them significantly. This would be a game-changer for both business and leisure travelers, as they could reach their destinations faster than ever before.",
    "Solar-Powered Boats: With cars off the road, solar-powered boats could become the next big thing in water transportation. These boats could be powered by solar panels installed on the water's surface, providing a clean and sustainable mode of transportation. They could be used for both short and long distances, connecting major cities and towns along the coasts.",
    "Personal Air Vehicles: With cars off the road, people could turn to personal air vehicles (PAVs) for transportation. PAVs are small, personal aircraft that could be powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells. They could be used for short to medium distance travel and could be equipped with advanced safety features like collision avoidance systems and autonomous navigation. PAVs could also be used for emergency services and medical transportation."
