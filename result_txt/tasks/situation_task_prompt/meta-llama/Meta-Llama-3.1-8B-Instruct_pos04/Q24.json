    "**Eyesight Enhancement Technology**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, scientists develop a non-invasive, wearable technology that enhances vision using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. This device, called \"Eyesight,\" uses sensors and cameras to analyze the user's surroundings and provide real-time visual enhancements, such as zooming, contrast adjustment, and even night vision.",
    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses**: In the absence of traditional contact lenses, researchers create augmented reality (AR) contact lenses that not only correct vision but also provide users with virtual information and tools. These AR contact lenses, called \"VisionX,\" feature a high-resolution display that overlays digital information onto the user's field of vision, allowing them to access maps, messages, and other data without needing to look at a separate device.",
    "**Personalized Optics**: Without glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision turn to personalized optics, a revolutionary new field that uses 3D printing and nanotechnology to create customized lenses and implants tailored to each individual's unique vision needs. This technology, called \"OptiFit,\" allows for precise corrections and even enhancements to vision, such as correcting nearsightedness or farsightedness.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Vision**: In the absence of traditional vision correction, scientists develop a BCI that allows people to control devices with their thoughts and perceive their surroundings through a neural interface. This technology, called \"NeuroSight,\" uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to read brain signals and translate them into visual information, effectively bypassing the need for physical vision correction.",
    "**Smart Homes and Environments**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision adapt by creating smart homes and environments that cater to their needs. This involves installing advanced lighting systems, automated navigation, and voice-controlled interfaces that provide real-time information and assistance. For example, a smart home might use AI-powered lighting to adjust brightness and color temperature based on the user's preferences and activity level."
