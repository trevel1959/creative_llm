    "Extreme Temperature Fluctuations: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night, which can be challenging for living conditions. This would require the development of insulation and temperature control systems to maintain a comfortable living environment.",
    "Limited Water Supply: Mars has a thin atmosphere and scarce water resources. This would require the development of water recycling systems and the transportation of water from Earth to sustain life on Mars.",
    "Radiation Exposure: Mars has a weak magnetic field and no atmosphere, which exposes inhabitants to high levels of cosmic radiation. This would require the development of radiation protection measures and the use of spacecraft materials with radiation shielding properties.",
    "Isolation and Loneliness: Living on Mars would be isolated from Earth, which could lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This would require the development of communication systems and social interaction methods to maintain mental health.",
    "Limited Space for Living and Working: Mars is a small planet with limited space for living and working. This would require the development of compact and efficient living and working spaces, as well as the use of 3D printing and other advanced construction techniques."
