    "A Water-Filled Atoll: Create a unique habitat that mimics a tropical atoll, complete with crystal-clear waters teeming with marine life. Include a central lagoon surrounded by coral reefs, and incorporate various landmasses for different species to inhabit. For example, have a seabird colony on a nearby island, while a pod of dolphins resides in the surrounding waters.",
    "A Sky Island: Design an aerial habitat that floats high above the ground, providing a unique environment for animals to thrive. This could include a network of interconnected islands, each with its own distinct ecosystem. For instance, one island could be covered in lush vegetation, while another is a rocky outcropping with a colony of flying creatures.",
    "A Time-Lapse Habitat: Conceptualize a habitat that simulates different time periods, allowing animals to adapt and evolve in response to changing environments. This could include a prehistoric landscape with dinosaurs, a modern forest with urban wildlife, and a futuristic world with advanced technologies.",
    "A Multi-Sensory Habitat: Create an environment that engages the senses of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Incorporate various textures, colors, and scents to create a dynamic and immersive experience for the animals. For example, a rainforest habitat could feature a canopy layer with mist and fog, while a desert habitat could have a dry, sandy terrain with cacti and succulents.",
    "A Miniature World Habitat: Design a tiny, miniature-sized environment that recreates a specific ecosystem, such as a miniature forest, desert, or ocean. This habitat would be perfect for small animals like insects, reptiles, and birds, who could thrive in this miniature world. Incorporate tiny plants, rocks, and water features to create a fully immersive experience."
