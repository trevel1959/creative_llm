    "**Pet Toy with a Twist**: Transform a regular tennis ball into a treat-dispensing toy for your dog. Cut a small hole in the ball and fill it with your pet’s favorite treats. As they play with the ball, treats will gradually fall out, keeping them engaged and mentally stimulated.",
    "**Stabilizer for Cords and Cables**: Slice a tennis ball in half and use the two halves to stabilize and organize cords and cables. Place the halves on your desk or around your entertainment center to keep cords from tangling and getting in the way, providing both organization and a pop of color.",
    "**Doorstop with Personality**: Use a tennis ball as a quirky doorstop. Simply cut a small slit in the ball and place it at the base of a door to keep it open. You can also paint or decorate the ball to match your home décor, adding a fun touch to a practical item.",
    "**Tennis Ball Planter**: Cut a tennis ball in half and use it as a small planter for succulents or herbs. The bright color of the ball adds a playful element to your indoor garden, and the lightweight material makes it easy to hang or place on a shelf.",
    "**Scented Air Freshener**: Puncture holes in a tennis ball and soak it in your favorite essential oil or fragrance. Hang it in a closet or place it in a small space like a bathroom to create a subtle and pleasant aroma. The porous nature of the ball allows it to slowly release the scent over time."
