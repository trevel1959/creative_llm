    "**Built-in Hair Care Infuser**: Incorporate a compartment that allows users to add essential oils or hair serums that can be infused into the airflow while drying. This would provide a two-in-one experience where users not only dry their hair but also nourish it with hydrating and protective ingredients, promoting healthier hair over time.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Flexible Handle**: Redesign the handle to be more ergonomic, allowing for a comfortable grip and reducing wrist strain during use. Additionally, include a flexible neck that allows users to adjust the angle of the dryer for hard-to-reach areas, making the drying process more efficient and comfortable.",
    "**Quiet Mode Technology**: Develop a noise-reduction feature that utilizes sound-dampening materials and advanced motor technology to significantly reduce the noise level of the hair dryer. This would make the drying experience more pleasant, especially in quiet environments or for early morning routines.",
    "**Integrated Styling Attachments**: Create a modular design where users can easily attach different styling tools, such as diffusers, concentrators, or curling attachments, directly onto the hair dryer. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices and streamline the styling process, allowing users to switch between styles seamlessly.",
    "**UV Sanitization Feature**: Introduce a UV light feature that sanitizes the hair dryerâ€™s nozzle and attachments after each use. This would help eliminate bacteria and germs that can accumulate over time, ensuring that users have a clean and hygienic styling tool, especially beneficial for shared or salon environments."
