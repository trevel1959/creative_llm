    "**Collaborative Efforts and Sustainable Development**: With the world functioning as one city, there would be a concerted effort to address global issues from climate change to poverty. Governments and citizens would be more likely to collaborate, share resources, technologies, and knowledge. This collective effort could lead to more efficient and sustainable development strategies, with the benefits of one country being shared by all.",
    "**Improved Transportation and Infrastructure**: Just as we have integrated road networks, rail systems, and airports across nations, creating a city that spans the globe would require similar advancements. This would necessitate the construction of a massive, integrated transportation network, allowing for travel from virtually anywhere to anywhere else on the planet. High-speed trains, maglev systems, and space elevators could become viable options, reducing distances and travel time worldwide.",
    "**Global Governance and Democracy**: In such a global city, the current system of national governments would need to be reimagined. A world government or global legislature would need to be established, managing the affairs of the entire population. This governance body could also take on responsibilities related to environmental protection, social welfare, and economic regulation. It would hold the power to make decisions that affect every corner of the world, ensuring fairness and balance.",
    "**Economic Homogenization**: One of the consequences of a single global city would be the unification of economies and markets. National currencies would lose their significance and be replaced by a universal currency or system. This would lead to a more fluid exchange of goods, services, and capital, potentially reducing economic disparities between nations. However, it could also result in economic instability if one single economic entity were to dominate the market.",
    "**Consolidation of Resources and Energy**: In a global city, the need for natural resources and energy would be shared by the entire population. This could lead to the consolidation of these resources, with key energy infrastructure being built on a larger scale to support the increased demand. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, would become even more important, potentially leading to the gradual transition away from fossil fuels. As a result, countries with abundant natural resources might see a shift from extractive industries to more sustainable, global-scale operations."
