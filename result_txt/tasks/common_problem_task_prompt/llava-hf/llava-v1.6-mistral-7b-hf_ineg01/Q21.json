    "**Cyberbullying and Online Safety**: With the rise of social media platforms, online communication can expose children to cyberbullying and various online safety risks. They may encounter harmful content, engage in risky behaviors, or become targets of online harassment. Parents and guardians need to educate them about responsible online behavior and establish safety measures like parental controls and privacy settings.",
    "**Impact on Social Skills**: Technology can also impact children's communication and social skills, as it may hinder their ability to engage in face-to-face interactions and reduce their opportunities for bonding and empathy development.",
    "**Lack of Outdoor Play**: Constant screen time can reduce the time a child spends outdoors and engaging in physical activities, which are essential for their overall physical and mental well-being. Encouraging outdoor play and disconnecting from screens when not required can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Eye Health Concerns**: Staring at a screen for extended periods can strain a child's eyes, potentially leading to computer vision syndrome or myopia. To minimize eye health risks, parents should enforce the 20-20-20 rule (20 seconds of looking at an object 20 feet away every 20 minutes) and consider using software with built-in screen filters that reduce blue light exposure.",
    "**Overreliance on Technology for Learning**: While digital tools like smartboards, educational apps, and virtual tutoring platforms can be valuable assets in a child's learning process, there is a risk of overdependency, which can lead to a child not developing critical thinking or problem-solving skills. Balancing screen time with traditional methods of learning and hands-on activities is essential."
