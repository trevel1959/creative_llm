    "\"Energy of the Earth\" - This new type of energy would be harnessed from the Earth's natural resources, such as geothermal heat, tidal forces, and mineral deposits. It would be a clean and sustainable source of energy that could power homes, industries, and transportation systems without causing harm to the environment.",
    "\"Gravitational Energy\" - This energy source would tap into the gravitational forces that exist between objects in the universe. By harnessing the energy released when objects are moved or manipulated, this energy source could provide an infinite amount of power with no environmental impact.",
    "\"Nexus Energy\" - This energy source would be created by harnessing the energy released when particles from different dimensions collide. By capturing and manipulating these collisions, Nexus Energy could provide a virtually limitless source of power that could be used to fuel entire cities or even entire planets.",
    "\"Radiant Energy\" - This new type of energy would be derived from the natural radiation emitted by the Earth and other celestial bodies. By harnessing and focusing this radiation, Radiant Energy could be used to power a wide range of applications, from space exploration to medical treatments.",
    "\"Aurora Energy\" - This energy source would be inspired by the spectacular displays of light and color in the Earth's atmosphere, known as auroras. By harnessing the electromagnetic energy that creates these displays, Aurora Energy could provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly source of power that could be used to light homes, businesses, and communities."
