    "**Adjustable Fit System**: Develop a roller skate with a customizable fit that uses a self-adjusting mechanism. This could involve memory foam that molds to the user's foot or a lacing system that tightens or loosens with the press of a button.",
    "**Built-in LED Lights**: Incorporate programmable LED lights into the design that can change colors or patterns based on the user's speed or movements. This would enhance visibility at night and allow for creative expression during skating.",
    "**All-Terrain Wheels**: Create interchangeable wheels designed for different surfaces, such as rough terrain, smooth pavement, or indoor rinks. Users could easily switch wheels depending on their skating environment.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Use sustainable materials in the production of roller skates, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable components. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the ecological footprint of skating.",
    "**Safety Features**: Integrate advanced safety features like automatic braking systems that engage when a user is going too fast or when a fall is detected. This could significantly reduce the risk of injuries."
