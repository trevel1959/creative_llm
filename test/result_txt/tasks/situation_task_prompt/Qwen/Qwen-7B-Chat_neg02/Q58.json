    "Insect Repellent Plants: One idea could be to create plants that emit natural insect repellents, such as citronella or peppermint oil. These plants could be grown in gardens and other outdoor spaces, effectively keeping pests away without using harmful chemicals.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Another option could be to use genetic engineering to create insects that are resistant to pests or even beneficial to humans. For example, scientists could modify bees to produce honey with added medicinal properties or create flies that can help break down organic waste.",
    "Artificial Insects: We could also develop artificial insects that mimic the behavior of real ones but don't cause harm. These insects could be used to control pest populations in agriculture or urban areas.",
    "Bio-Insecticides: A third approach could involve creating bio-insecticides, which are made from natural materials and do not harm human health. These could be produced using bacteria, fungi, or other organisms that are effective at killing pests.",
    "Education and Awareness: Finally, it's important to educate people about the importance of pests and their role in the ecosystem. By raising awareness about the negative impact of overusing pesticides, we can encourage more sustainable and eco-friendly methods for controlling pests."
