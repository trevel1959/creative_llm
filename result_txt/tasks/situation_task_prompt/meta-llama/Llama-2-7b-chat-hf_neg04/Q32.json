    "Dental Hygiene Co-ops: With no more dentists, individuals could form dental hygiene co-ops, where they share the costs and responsibilities of maintaining good oral hygiene. Members of the co-op could rotate cleaning each other's teeth, and also learn from each other about proper brushing and flossing techniques.",
    "DIY Dental Tools: In a world without dentists, people could create their own dental tools using materials like wood, metal, or even recycled materials. For example, they could make their own toothbrushes, flossers, and dental picks. This would not only be cost-effective but also a fun and creative way to maintain good oral hygiene.",
    "Herbal Remedies: Many herbs and plants have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help prevent tooth decay and gum disease. People could use these herbs to make their own natural toothpaste or mouthwash. For example, the leaves of the neem tree have antibacterial properties that can help reduce plaque and bad breath.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: In a world without dentists, mobile dental clinics could become the norm. These clinics could be set up in community centers, schools, or even in people's homes. Trained volunteers could provide basic dental care services such as cleanings, fillings, and extractions. This would ensure that people still have access to basic dental care even if there are no more dentists.",
    "Virtual Dental Consultations: With the rise of telemedicine, virtual dental consultations could become a new norm. People could use video conferencing apps to consult with dentists remotely. This would allow people to get advice on how to improve their oral hygiene, or even receive virtual cleanings and exams. This could be especially useful for people living in remote areas where access to dental care is limited."
