    "**Zip Line Rescue**: Establish a zip line system that connects the top of the skyscraper to a secure anchor point outside. Trained rescue personnel would use harnesses and ropes to navigate the zip line, safely transporting people to the ground or to a secondary evacuation point.",
    "**Rope Climbing Teams**: Assemble a team of experienced rope climbers, equipped with specialized gear and safety equipment. They would ascend the exterior of the building, securing ropes and harnesses as they climb, to reach stranded individuals and escort them down to safety.",
    "**Parachute Deployment**: Develop a network of parachute deployment systems, strategically located on the building's exterior. These systems would deploy parachutes to gently lower people to the ground, ensuring a safe and controlled descent.",
    "**Aerial Lifts**: Deploy aerial lifts, such as cranes or cherry pickers, to access upper floors of the building. These lifts would be equipped with safety nets and harnesses to secure passengers during transit.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Walkways**: Construct a series of gravity-defying walkways, supported by advanced magnetic levitation technology or tensioned cables. These walkways would allow people to traverse the exterior of the building, while minimizing the risk of falls or accidents. [/INST] Assistant: Here are five creative and original ideas for getting to the top of a skyscraper if all elevators stopped working: 1.  **Skydiving Assistants**: Train a team of skydivers to jump from the top of the skyscraper, using specialized equipment to slow their descent and guide them to the ground. They would then assist stranded individuals in rappelling down to safety."
