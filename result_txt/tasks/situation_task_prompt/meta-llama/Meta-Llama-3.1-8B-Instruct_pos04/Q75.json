    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments, and uses it to generate hydrogen fuel through electrolysis. This hydrogen can then be used in fuel cells to power vehicles, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. ",
    "**Bio-Electrochemical Systems (BES)**: Implement a network of BES, which use microorganisms to break down organic waste and produce electricity. This electricity can be used to charge electric vehicles, providing a sustainable and waste-to-energy solution.",
    "**Advanced Nuclear Power**: Develop small, modular nuclear reactors that are safer, more efficient, and cost-effective. These reactors can provide a reliable source of electricity to power electric vehicles, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Launch solar panels into orbit around the Earth, where they can collect solar energy 24/7 without the interference of weather or nighttime. This energy can be beamed back to Earth as microwaves and used to power electric vehicles.",
    "**Graphene-Based Supercapacitors**: Develop advanced supercapacitors using graphene, which can store and release energy quickly and efficiently. These supercapacitors can be used to power electric vehicles, providing a rapid and sustainable source of energy. "
