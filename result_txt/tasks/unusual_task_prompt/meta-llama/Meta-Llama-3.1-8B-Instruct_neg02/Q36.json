    "**Eco-Friendly Capsule System**: Design a modular, stackable bottle cap that doubles as a mini-garden or a small planter. Each cap would have a built-in water reservoir and a micro-fertilizer system, allowing users to grow their own herbs or succulents while keeping their drinks cold. The caps could be connected to form a larger, intricate design, making for a unique conversation piece.",
    "**Sound-Reactive Cap**: Develop a bottle cap that incorporates LED lights and a microphone, allowing it to react to the music playing in the surrounding environment. As the music changes, the cap's lights would shift colors and patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual display. This cap could be a fun addition to music festivals, parties, or even a home bar.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Cap**: Create a bottle cap that can adjust the temperature of the drink inside, using a built-in thermoelectric cooling or heating system. This cap would be perfect for those who enjoy hot or cold beverages, and could even be programmed to maintain a specific temperature for a set period.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cap**: Design a bottle cap that contains a tiny camera, microphone, and a small display. Using AR technology, the cap would overlay interactive information, such as the drink's ingredients, nutritional facts, or even a virtual \"tasting experience.\" This cap could revolutionize the way we interact with our drinks and provide a new level of engagement.",
    "**Mood-Sensing Cap**: Develop a bottle cap that uses EEG sensors to detect the user's emotional state, adjusting the drink's temperature, flavor, or even the music playing nearby to match their mood. This cap could be a game-changer for those who struggle with anxiety or stress, providing a personalized experience that adapts to their emotional needs."
