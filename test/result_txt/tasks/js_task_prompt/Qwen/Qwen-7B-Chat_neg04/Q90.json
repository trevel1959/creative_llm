    "Artificial Limbs: With the advancement in technology, it's possible to design artificial limbs that are more durable, lightweight, and responsive than natural ones. These limbs can be designed to mimic the movements of real limbs and provide a better range of motion for the user.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Genetic engineering can be used to enhance physical abilities such as strength, speed, and endurance. For example, individuals could have their genes modified to make them stronger or faster than average.",
    "Enhanced Vision: With the help of advanced technologies like augmented reality and biotechnology, it's possible to enhance vision by enhancing the eye's ability to see colors, light, and other visual cues.",
    "Improved Brain Functioning: Advances in neuroscience can be used to improve brain functioning by increasing cognitive abilities such as memory, attention span, and problem-solving skills. This can be achieved through various techniques such as brain stimulation, neurofeedback, and brain-computer interfaces.",
    "Human-Animal Hybridization: Scientists can combine human DNA with animal DNA to create hybrid organisms that possess traits from both species. This could lead to the creation of superhumans who are stronger, faster, and smarter than humans. However, this approach raises ethical concerns about the manipulation of nature and the potential risks associated with creating new life forms."
