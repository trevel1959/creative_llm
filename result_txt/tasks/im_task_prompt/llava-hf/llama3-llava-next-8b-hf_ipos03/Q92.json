    "**Smart Wine Opener**: Develop a wine opener with built-in sensors that can detect the type of wine bottle being opened and adjust the corkscrew accordingly. The device could also include a small LED light to illuminate the cork for better visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that uses a replaceable cork to minimize waste. The cork can be recycled after use, and the opener can be made from biodegradable materials to reduce the environmental impact.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-In Glass Cleaner**: Add a small glass cleaner to the top of the wine opener. This would allow users to clean the rim of the wine glass before pouring, making the process more efficient and reducing the need for additional cleaning tools.",
    "**Wine Opener with Temperature Indicator**: Create a wine opener with a built-in thermometer that can measure the temperature of the wine inside the bottle. This would help users to ensure the wine is served at the optimal temperature for optimal taste.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-In Chilling Device**: Develop a wine opener with a small, built-in chilling device that can cool the wine bottle down to the desired temperature before opening. This would be especially useful for red wines that are often served at cooler temperatures."
