    "Pedal-Powered Public Transit: With bicycles gone, a new public transportation system could be implemented using pedal-powered vehicles. These could be larger and more stable than traditional bicycles, making them more practical for carrying multiple passengers and heavier loads. The vehicles could be designed with a central hub and gear system, allowing riders to pedal in unison to propel the vehicle forward. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation that could be used for both short and long distances.",
    "Personal Flight Devices: In a world without bicycles, personal flight devices could become the new norm for getting around. These devices could be wearable, allowing individuals to fly short distances without the need for a runway or infrastructure. They could be powered by small, lightweight engines or even human-powered using pedals. This would provide a convenient and efficient way to travel, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion is a major issue.",
    "Personal Watercraft: With bicycles gone, people could turn to personal watercraft as an alternative mode of transportation. These could be small, portable vessels that can be carried on the user's back or stored in a small compartment. They could be powered by a combination of paddles and small engines, allowing for both manual and motorized propulsion. This would provide a fun and exciting way to get around, especially in areas with access to waterways.",
    "Magnetic Transportation Systems: In a world without bicycles, magnetic levitation technology could be used to create a new mode of transportation. This technology uses magnetic fields to suspend vehicles above a track, allowing them to move at high speeds without any friction. The vehicles could be powered by electricity or even human-powered using a magnetic field. This would provide a fast, efficient, and eco-friendly way to get around, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic.",
    "Teleportation Devices: In a world without bicycles, teleportation technology could become the go-to mode of transportation. These devices could use advanced quantum mechanics to transport people and objects from one location to another instantly. They could be powered by small, portable energy sources, such as batteries or even human-powered generators. This would provide a convenient and"
