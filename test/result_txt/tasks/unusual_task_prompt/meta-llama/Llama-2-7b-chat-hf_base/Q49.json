    "Augmented Reality Picture Frame: Create a picture frame that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the viewing experience. When a user approaches the frame, the AR software superimposes additional information, such as the artist's name, the date of creation, or even a virtual tour of the location where the picture was taken. This adds a layer of interactivity and depth to the traditional picture viewing experience.",
    "Smart Picture Frame with AI-Driven Content Recommendations: Develop a picture frame that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the user's preferences and recommend relevant content. The frame could be equipped with a camera that captures the user's facial expressions and other biometric data to determine their emotional response to different images. Based on this data, the frame could suggest related images, artwork, or even music to enhance the viewing experience.",
    "Portrait Lamp: Create a picture frame that doubles as a lamp. The frame could have a built-in LED light source that illuminates the picture when the lamp is turned on. This provides a warm and cozy ambiance while also highlighting the beauty of the picture. Additionally, the lamp could have a built-in timer that automatically adjusts the light level and color temperature based on the time of day, creating a relaxing and calming environment.",
    "Interactive Mirror with Picture Frame Functionality: Design an interactive mirror that not only allows users to check their appearance but also displays pictures and artwork. The mirror could have a built-in display screen that shows a variety of images, including personal photos, artwork, or even digital art. Users could select images to display using a touchscreen interface or voice commands, creating a unique and interactive viewing experience.",
    "Self-Sustaining Picture Frame with Solar Power: Develop a picture frame that is powered by solar energy. The frame could have a built-in solar panel that charges during the day and powers the display at night. This would eliminate the need for batteries or an external power source, making the frame more eco-friendly and sustainable. Additionally, the frame could have a built-in sensor that adjusts the brightness and color temperature of the display based on the lighting conditions in the room, creating a more comfortable and natural viewing experience."
