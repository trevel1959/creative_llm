    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The Internet is the backbone of modern commerce, facilitating global trade, finance, and communication. Without it, supply chains would be severely disrupted, leading to shortages, price increases, and a global economic collapse. Businesses would struggle to operate, and many would go bankrupt. This would have a ripple effect on employment, leading to widespread job losses and social unrest.",
    "**Loss of Global Connectivity**: The Internet has enabled people to connect with others across the globe, fostering international relationships, cultural exchange, and collaboration. Without it, people would be isolated, and global communication would grind to a halt. This would lead to a loss of cultural diversity, misunderstandings, and conflicts between nations.",
    "**Disruption of Critical Infrastructure**: The Internet is used to control and monitor critical infrastructure, such as power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare services. Without it, these systems would be unable to function, leading to power outages, transportation disruptions, and healthcare crises. This would have a devastating impact on public health, safety, and quality of life.",
    "**Loss of Access to Information**: The Internet has democratized access to information, enabling people to learn, educate themselves, and make informed decisions. Without it, people would be cut off from a vast repository of knowledge, leading to a decline in education, innovation, and progress. This would have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, who rely heavily on the Internet for access to information and resources.",
    "**Social and Psychological Impacts**: The Internet has become an integral part of modern life, providing a sense of community, connection, and identity. Without it, people would experience social isolation, loneliness, and anxiety. This could lead to a rise in mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety disorders, as well as a decline in overall well-being and happiness."
