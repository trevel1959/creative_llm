    "**Interactive Lampshade**: Design a lampshade that incorporates motion sensors to adjust its brightness based on the movement in the room. The intensity of light could vary according to the level of activity or presence of people. This not only creates an engaging experience but also saves energy by reducing unnecessary illumination.",
    "**Therapeutic Lampshade**: Create a lampshade that emits different colors of light to promote relaxation or alertness depending on the user's needs. For example, blue for calming environments, green for productivity, and red for focus. It can be controlled via a smartphone app for personalized settings.",
    "**Sustainable Lampshade**: Design a lampshade made from biodegradable materials such as mushroom fiber or recycled paper, combined with solar panels to charge during daylight hours. This eco-friendly lampshade would not only reduce waste but also provide a source of sustainable lighting.",
    "**Artistic Lampshade**: Transform traditional lampshades into pieces of art by using intricate laser-cut patterns or embedded LED lights that change color and pattern based on ambient sound or music. This could be particularly appealing in cafes, bars, or home decor stores looking to offer unique and immersive lighting experiences.",
    "**Personalized Lampshade**: Develop a lampshade that allows users to upload their own images or designs, which are then printed onto the surface of the shade. This could be done through a custom online service where customers can choose from various templates or upload their own photos, making each lampshade a unique piece of personal expression."
