    "**Modular Cooking Chambers**: Design an oven with modular cooking chambers that can be independently controlled. Users could cook multiple dishes at different temperatures and times simultaneously without flavor transfer. Each chamber would have its own digital interface, allowing for personalized settings, and could even have different cooking methods, like convection or traditional baking.",
    "**Self-Cleaning and Maintenance Alerts**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that not only cleans the oven but also alerts users when maintenance is needed. This could include notifications for changing the air filter, checking the heating elements, or scheduling professional servicing. The self-cleaning mechanism could use a combination of steam and high-heat cycles to break down grease and grime effectively.",
    "**Smart Energy Management**: Create an oven that optimizes energy consumption by analyzing cooking habits and suggesting energy-efficient cooking times. For instance, it could recommend preheating during off-peak hours or using residual heat to finish cooking. An app could track energy usage and provide insights into how to reduce consumption, making it both eco-friendly and cost-effective.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Display**: Implement a large, interactive touchscreen display that serves as a control panel for the oven. This display could feature step-by-step cooking tutorials, meal planning options, and a virtual cookbook. Users could browse recipes, watch instructional videos, and even share their culinary creations on social media directly from the oven interface.",
    "**Built-in Air Fryer and Dehydrator**: Combine traditional oven functions with modern cooking techniques by incorporating an air fryer and dehydrator into the design. This multifunctional oven would allow users to prepare healthier meals by air frying with less oil and dehydrating fruits and vegetables for snacks. The settings for these functions would be clearly marked and easily accessible on the control panel."
