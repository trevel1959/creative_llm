    "Smart Stapler: Develop a stapler that can recognize and sort papers based on their content, size, and importance. This intelligent stapler could prioritize the most critical documents and staple them together first, ensuring that the most important papers are securely bound and easily accessible.",
    "Ergonomic Stapler: Create a stapler that is designed to reduce strain and discomfort for users. The stapler could have a contoured grip and a more natural hand positioning, reducing fatigue and improving posture. Additionally, the stapler could have an adjustable staple length, allowing users to customize the stapling action to their preferred length.",
    "Portable Stapler: Design a compact and lightweight stapler that can be easily carried in a bag or pocket. This portable stapler could be perfect for on-the-go tasks, such as stapling papers at a conference or while traveling. It could also be a great tool for students, who could use it to staple their notes and handouts together without having to carry a bulky stapler.",
    "Automatic Stapler: Develop a stapler that can automatically staple multiple papers together without any user input. This smart stapler could use a built-in sensor to detect the size and thickness of the papers, and then staple them together in a single motion. This would save time and reduce fatigue, as users wouldn't have to manually staple each paper.",
    "Customizable Stapler: Create a stapler that allows users to customize the staple length, color, and shape. This could be a great tool for creative professionals who need to staple together different types of papers with unique dimensions. For example, a graphic designer could use the stapler to create custom staples in different colors and shapes to match their design aesthetic."
