    "**Mind-Controlled Virtual Reality Experience**: I'd use this ability to create an immersive virtual reality experience that allows people to explore new worlds, interact with virtual objects, and even control virtual avatars. Users could simply think about what they want to do, and the system would respond accordingly. For example, if someone thinks about flying, the system would generate a virtual environment that simulates the sensation of flight. I'd also incorporate AI-powered NPCs (non-player characters) that could engage in conversations, provide information, or even offer assistance. This technology could revolutionize the entertainment industry, education, and therapy. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface for Artists**: I'd use this ability to create a brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows artists to express themselves in new and innovative ways. Musicians could compose music by thinking about melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. Visual artists could create paintings and sculptures by thinking about colors, shapes, and textures. Writers could write stories and poetry by thinking about characters, plots, and language. This technology could unlock new forms of creative expression and bring art to a wider audience. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Mind-Controlled Prosthetics and Assistive Technology**: I'd use this ability to develop prosthetic limbs and assistive technology that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. This could revolutionize the lives of people with disabilities, allowing them to perform tasks with greater ease and independence. For example, a person with a prosthetic arm could think about picking up a cup, and the arm would move accordingly. This technology could also improve the quality of life for people with conditions like paralysis or ALS. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Neural Network-Based Language Translation**: I'd use this ability to create a neural network-based language translation system that can translate languages in real-time, using the user's thoughts as input. This could facilitate global communication, breaking down language barriers and enabling people to connect with each other more easily. For example, a traveler could think about a phrase in their native language, and the system would translate it into the language of the person they're interacting with. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Mind-Controlled Robotics for Search and Rescue**: I'd use this ability to develop robots that can be controlled by the user's thoughts, allowing them to navigate complex environments and perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible"
