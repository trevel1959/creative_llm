    "**Solar-Powered Accessories**: To adapt to the absence of batteries, manufacturers could create solar-powered attachments for devices. For example, a smartphone case embedded with solar panels could harness sunlight to keep the phone charged. These cases would have a built-in energy management system that allows for charging during the day while providing a buffer of stored energy for nighttime use.",
    "**Thermoelectric Generators**: Devices could utilize thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that convert heat differentials into electricity. For instance, a portable cooking device could use the heat from cooking to generate power for a small fan or LED lights. This would not only make cooking more efficient but also provide a renewable energy source for other devices.",
    "**Hand-Crank Generators**: Devices could come with built-in hand-crank generators, allowing users to manually generate power. For example, a flashlight could have a small crank that users can turn to generate electricity. This method could be particularly useful in emergency situations where other power sources are unavailable, providing a reliable way to keep essential devices operational.",
    "**Microbial Fuel Cells**: Innovative energy solutions could harness the power of bacteria to generate electricity. Microbial fuel cells could be integrated into devices that utilize organic waste, such as food scraps or wastewater, to produce energy. For instance, a portable charger could have a small compartment for organic material that, through the metabolic processes of bacteria, generates electricity to charge devices.",
    "**Wind-Powered Gadgets**: Devices could be designed to incorporate small wind turbines. For example, a laptop could feature foldable mini turbines that deploy when used outdoors. As the wind spins the turbines, they would generate power to keep the device running, providing an eco-friendly solution for charging while on the go."
