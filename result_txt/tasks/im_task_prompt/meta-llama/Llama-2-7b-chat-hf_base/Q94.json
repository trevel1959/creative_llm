    "Aromatic Memory Jars: Create a line of candles that are designed to evoke memories through their scent. Each candle would be infused with a unique blend of essential oils that are associated with specific memories, such as the scent of freshly baked cookies for a childhood home or the smell of a tropical beach for a vacation. The jars would be designed to resemble old-fashioned preservation jars, complete with a label that lists the scent and the memory it evokes.",
    "Customizable Scent Blends: Offer a line of candles that allow customers to create their own unique scent blends. Provide a selection of essential oils and herbs that customers can mix and match to create a scent that is tailored to their preferences. The candles would be available in different sizes and shapes, such as square or round, and could be packaged in a gift box or pouch for easy gifting.",
    "Interactive Candle Experience: Create an interactive candle experience that allows customers to engage with the candle in a fun and creative way. The candle would be designed with a hidden compartment that, when lit, reveals a surprise inside, such as a small toy or a note with a message. The compartment could be hidden behind a removable panel or in a secret compartment that is only accessible when the candle is lit.",
    "Candle Subscription Box: Offer a subscription service that delivers a new, unique candle to customers each month. The candles would be handcrafted with high-quality ingredients and designed with a specific theme or scent profile in mind. The subscription box would include a detailed description of the candle and its ingredients, as well as a small gift or surprise, such as a set of coasters or a small notebook.",
    "Candle Art: Create a line of candles that are designed to be a work of art in themselves. Each candle would be hand-painted with intricate designs and patterns, creating a unique piece of art that is both functional and beautiful. The candles could be made in a variety of shapes and sizes, such as square or round, and could be packaged in a gift box or pouch for easy gifting."
