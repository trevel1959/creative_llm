    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and eliminate mold and mildew without the need for harsh chemicals. This could be activated after a certain number of washes or on a scheduled basis, ensuring that the machine remains fresh and hygienic.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a built-in detergent dispenser that uses biodegradable, concentrated detergent pods. The machine would automatically dispense the correct amount based on load size and soil level, reducing waste and the need for users to measure detergent themselves. It could also have a refillable option for liquid detergent, minimizing plastic waste.",
    "**Integrated Fabric Care Advisor**: Develop an app that connects to the washing machine, providing users with personalized fabric care tips. Users could input the type of fabric and its condition, and the app would suggest the best washing methods, drying techniques, and even ironing tips. This could help extend the life of clothes and ensure they look their best.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Design a washing machine with advanced noise-dampening materials and an innovative suspension system to minimize vibrations and sounds during operation. This would make it more suitable for small living spaces or apartments where noise can be a concern, allowing users to run cycles at any time without disturbing others.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Create a washing machine that doubles as a dryer or has an integrated drying feature. This all-in-one solution would save space and eliminate the need for a separate dryer, making it ideal for small homes or apartments. The machine could also feature a quick-dry cycle for lightly soiled items, allowing users to have clothes ready in a fraction of the time."
