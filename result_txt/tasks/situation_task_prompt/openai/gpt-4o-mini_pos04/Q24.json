    "**Vision Correction Implants**: The medical community might accelerate research into surgical options for vision correction. This could lead to the development of small, biocompatible implants that are inserted into the eye to adjust the focus of light entering the eye. These implants could be programmed or adjusted post-surgery to cater to individual vision needs, providing a permanent solution for those with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.",
    "**Community Vision Support Networks**: In the absence of corrective eyewear, communities might establish support networks to assist individuals with vision impairments. These networks could offer services like guided navigation, reading assistance, and technology training for using voice-activated devices. Local volunteers could be trained to help those with vision issues perform daily tasks, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity.",
    "**Smartphone Vision Enhancement Apps**: The tech industry would likely respond by creating apps that leverage smartphone cameras and AI to enhance vision. These apps could use real-time image processing to adjust colors, contrast, and magnification, allowing users to see their surroundings more clearly. Additionally, features like text recognition could enable users to read signs or labels by simply pointing their phone at them, turning smartphones into portable vision aids.",
    "**Adaptive Environments**: Urban planners and architects could begin designing spaces with the visually impaired in mind. This might include the use of high-contrast colors, textured pathways, and auditory cues to help navigate public spaces. Buildings could be equipped with smart technology that detects when a person is approaching and provides auditory directions or adjusts lighting to improve visibility, creating an environment that is inherently more accessible.",
    "**Wearable Vision Enhancement Devices**: Beyond AR glasses, other wearable technologies could emerge, such as headsets or visors that use advanced optics and sensors to enhance vision. These devices could incorporate features like night vision, thermal imaging, or even 3D mapping to help users navigate their surroundings. They could be lightweight and designed for comfort, allowing users to wear them for extended periods without discomfort."
