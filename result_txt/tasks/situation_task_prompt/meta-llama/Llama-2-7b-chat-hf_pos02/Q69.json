This type of exercise is low-impact, so it's easy on the joints and can be done by people of all ages and fitness levels.",
    "Bodyweight Training: Another way to stay active and fit without any sporting equipment is to use your own body weight as resistance. You can do push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and other exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. These exercises can be done anywhere, anytime, and they don't require any equipment. You can even create a circuit training routine by doing a set of exercises, resting for a minute or two, and then moving on to the next set.",
