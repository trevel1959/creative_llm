    "**Eco-Friendly Frames Made from Recycled Materials**: Design glasses frames from recycled plastics, metals, or other sustainable materials. This could not only reduce waste but also make the frames more durable and resistant to scratches. The frames could be produced using 3D printing technology, allowing for complex designs while minimizing material usage.",
    "**Glasses with Integrated Health Monitoring**: Embed sensors into the frames to track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, or glucose levels. This could be particularly useful for people with chronic conditions, allowing them to monitor their health in real-time. The data could be synced with a smartphone app for further analysis and insights.",
    "**Adjustable Focus Glasses for People with Presbyopia**: Develop glasses with adjustable focus lenses that can switch between near and far vision with a simple button press. This would eliminate the need for separate reading glasses and make it easier for people with presbyopia to navigate their daily lives.",
    "**Glasses with Integrated LED Lighting**: Incorporate LED lights into the frames to provide ambient lighting in low-light environments. This could be especially useful for people who work in dimly lit spaces or enjoy outdoor activities at night. The lights could be programmed to adjust brightness and color based on the surrounding environment.",
    "**Glasses with Integrated Air Purification**: Design glasses with a built-in air purification system that removes pollutants and allergens from the air. This could be particularly beneficial for people who live in areas with poor air quality or suffer from respiratory issues. The system could be powered by a small battery or a wearable device."
