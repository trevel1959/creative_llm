    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: Create a fire pit using stones or bricks in a safe outdoor area. Use this pit to cook meals over an open flame. You can skewer meat and vegetables on sticks and roast them over the fire, or wrap food in large leaves (like banana leaves) and place them in the coals for a makeshift steam-bake. For example, try making foil-wrapped potatoes stuffed with herbs and cheese, or grilling fish wrapped in leaves for added flavor.",
    "**Natural Hot Springs**: If you have access to a natural hot spring or geothermal area, use the hot water to cook food. You can wrap ingredients in cloth or use natural containers (like bamboo tubes) to submerge in the hot water. This method can be used to make hard-boiled eggs, cook rice, or even prepare a hearty soup by placing vegetables and broth in a sealed container and letting it simmer in the hot spring.",
    "**Cave Cooking**: If you find yourself near a cave or rock overhang, you can utilize the heat from the earth. Build a small fire at the entrance of the cave and use the heat radiating from the rock walls to cook food. You could hang a pot or container filled with ingredients using a stick or rope, allowing the heat to cook your meal over time. This method could be used for slow-cooking stews or even baking bread if you create a makeshift oven using hot stones.",
    "**Cold Cooking**: Embrace the art of cold cooking by using techniques like marinating or fermenting. For instance, you can prepare a raw salad by combining fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, dressed with a mixture of oil, vinegar, and spices. Alternatively, try making ceviche by soaking fresh fish in citrus juice, which \"cooks\" the fish without heat. You could also experiment with pickling vegetables using salt and vinegar, creating a tangy side dish to accompany your meal.",
    "**Earth Oven**: Construct an earth oven by digging a pit in the ground and lining it with stones. Build a fire in the pit to heat the stones, then remove the ashes and place wrapped food inside. Cover the pit with soil to trap the heat, allowing the food to cook slowly. This method is excellent for cooking whole meals like roasted meats and root vegetables, resulting in a tender, flavorful dish."
