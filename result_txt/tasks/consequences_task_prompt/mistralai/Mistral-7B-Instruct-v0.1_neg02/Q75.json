    "Disruption of Ecosystems: The oceans are home to a vast array of marine life. If they turned into freshwater, many of these species would not survive, leading to a major disruption in marine ecosystems.",
    "Increased Agricultural Production: Freshwater would provide an opportunity for increased agricultural production in coastal areas. However, this could lead to overfishing and depletion of fish populations.",
    "Changes in Weather Patterns: The oceans play a crucial role in regulating weather patterns. If they turned into freshwater, this could lead to changes in weather patterns, including more frequent and severe storms.",
    "Economic Impact: The oceans are a major source of food, energy, and transportation. If they turned into freshwater, this would have a significant economic impact, disrupting global trade and commerce."
