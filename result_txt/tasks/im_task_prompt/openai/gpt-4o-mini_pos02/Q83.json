    "**Modular Cart Design**: A shopping cart with a modular design that allows customers to customize the cart based on their shopping needs. For example, shoppers could attach or detach compartments for different types of items (like groceries, electronics, or clothing). This would enable a more organized shopping experience and allow for better weight distribution, making it easier to push and maneuver the cart.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cart**: Develop a shopping cart made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, the cart could feature a built-in compost bin for organic waste, encouraging shoppers to dispose of food scraps responsibly while they shop. This initiative would promote environmental consciousness and align with the growing trend towards sustainability.",
    "**Smart Navigation System**: Integrate GPS and augmented reality (AR) technology into shopping carts to guide customers through the store. Shoppers could input their shopping list into the cartâ€™s system, and the cart would display the most efficient route to find each item, highlighting the path on a screen. This would save time and reduce frustration, especially in large supermarkets.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cart**: Design a shopping cart that can transform into a portable storage solution or even a mini table. For example, the cart could have collapsible sections that allow it to fold out into a flat surface for a picnic or outdoor event. This versatility would appeal to shoppers who want to maximize the utility of their cart beyond just grocery shopping.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Equip shopping carts with health monitoring sensors that can track the shopper's heart rate, steps taken, and calories burned while pushing the cart. This data could sync with a mobile app, encouraging customers to stay active during their shopping trips. It could also provide personalized health tips based on their shopping habits, promoting a healthier lifestyle."
