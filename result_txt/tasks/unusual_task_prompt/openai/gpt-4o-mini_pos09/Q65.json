    "**Outdoor Movie Stand**: Use a shopping cart as a mobile movie stand for outdoor movie nights. Secure a projector on the top shelf and use the lower basket to hold a portable screen or a white sheet. You can also store blankets, snacks, and drinks in the cart, making it a convenient all-in-one solution for your outdoor cinema experience.",
    "**Art Supply Caddy**: Repurpose a shopping cart into an art supply caddy for artists or craft enthusiasts. Use the baskets to store paints, brushes, canvases, and other materials. The cart can be wheeled around your workspace, allowing you to easily access your supplies while you work on projects, and it can be stored neatly when not in use.",
    "**Pet Transporter**: Modify a shopping cart into a pet transport vehicle. Add a soft blanket or pet bed to the bottom, and use it to transport your furry friends to the vet, park, or on walks. You can even attach a leash to the cart to secure your pet while you shop or attend outdoor events, ensuring they stay safe and comfortable.",
    "**Pop-Up Food Stall**: Turn a shopping cart into a mobile food stall for selling snacks or homemade treats at local events or markets. Use the top shelf to display your food items, while the bottom basket can hold additional supplies like napkins, utensils, and condiments. With some creativity, you can decorate the cart to attract customers and create a unique selling point.",
    "**Rolling Bookshelf**: Convert a shopping cart into a rolling bookshelf for your home or classroom. Remove the lower basket and install wooden shelves in its place to create a multi-tiered bookshelf. This makes it easy to transport books from room to room or take them outside for reading sessions in the sun. You can also personalize it with paint or decorative paper to match your decor."
