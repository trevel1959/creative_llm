    "Artificial vision aids: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need alternative solutions to help them see. One possible solution could be the development of artificial vision aids, such as implantable microchips that can bypass the eye's natural vision system and directly stimulate the visual cortex. These chips could be surgically implanted in the brain and programmed to enhance or restore vision, depending on the individual's needs.",
    "Virtual reality vision correction: Another possible solution could be the use of virtual reality technology to create a simulated visual environment that can compensate for the lack of glasses or contact lenses. By wearing a VR headset, people with poor vision could see a virtual world that is optimized for their specific visual needs, allowing them to navigate and interact with their surroundings more easily.",
    "Bionic eye implants: Building on the concept of artificial vision aids, bionic eye implants could be developed to restore vision to people with severe vision loss. These implants would use a camera to capture images and transmit them directly to the brain, bypassing the damaged or missing retina. The implant could be controlled by a small remote control or even through brain signals, allowing the individual to selectively focus on different objects or areas.",
    "Community-based vision support: In the absence of glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on their communities for support. Neighborhoods and towns could establish vision support groups, where members could share resources, provide emotional support, and help each other navigate their surroundings. These groups could also organize training sessions on how to navigate without vision aids, such as using echolocation or other non-visual senses.",
    "Echolocation training: Another creative solution could be the widespread adoption of echolocation training programs. Echolocation is the ability to navigate by emitting high-frequency sounds and detecting the echoes that bounce back, allowing individuals to build a mental map of their surroundings. By training people in echolocation techniques, they could learn to navigate and interact with their environment more effectively, even without vision aids. This training could be provided in schools, community centers, or through online resources, making it accessible to a wide range of people."
