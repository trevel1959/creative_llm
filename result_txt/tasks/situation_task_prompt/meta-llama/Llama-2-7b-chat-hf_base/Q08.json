    "Desalination: One creative solution to obtain clean drinking water in a world where all water sources are polluted is through desalination. Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater, brackish water, or wastewater to produce fresh water. There are several desalination methods, including reverse osmosis, distillation, and electrodialysis. These methods can be used to produce fresh water that is safe for drinking, cooking, and other household purposes.",
    "Aquaponics: Another creative solution is through aquaponics, a system that combines traditional aquaculture (raising fish and other aquatic animals) with hydroponics (growing plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. In an aquaponic system, the waste produced by the fish is used as fertilizer for the plants, and the plants help to purify the water for the fish. This closed-loop system can produce both food and clean water, making it a sustainable and efficient solution for obtaining clean drinking water in a polluted world.",
    "Water-harvesting and storage: In areas with limited access to clean water, a creative solution could be to harvest and store rainwater for later use. This can be done through the construction of rainwater harvesting systems, which can collect and store rainwater for various purposes, including drinking, cooking, and irrigation. The stored water can be treated and purified using filtration systems to make it safe for consumption.",
    "Mobile water purification units: Another creative solution is through the use of mobile water purification units, which can be deployed in areas where clean water is scarce. These units can use various technologies, such as UV light, ceramic filters, or other advanced purification methods, to remove pollutants and contaminants from water, making it safe for drinking. Mobile units can be set up in remote areas or disaster zones, providing clean water to those in need."
