    "**Hovering Drones**: Develop a fleet of drones that can hover above plants and use specialized tools to pollinate flowers. These drones could be equipped with sensors to detect the presence of flowers and adjust their movements accordingly.",
    "**Pollinator Dust**: Develop a type of pollen dust that can be spread over plants to artificially initiate the pollination process. This dust could be composed of pollen from various plants and could be applied using a specialized sprayer or drone.",
    "**Light-Based Pollination**: Create a device that uses light to stimulate the pollination process. This device could be placed near plants and emit specific wavelengths of light that mimic the sun's natural effect on plants.",
    "**Genetic Engineering**: Genetically modify certain plants to produce their own pollen, eliminating the need for external pollination. This could be achieved by introducing genes that promote pollen production and release.",
    "**Pollination-Assistive Wearables**: Develop wearables, such as gloves or suits, that can be worn by humans to collect pollen from one flower and transfer it to another. These wearables could be equipped with sensors to detect the presence of flowers and release pollen on demand."
