    "I would change the shape of my nose to be more defined. I have always felt that my nose is too flat and uninteresting, and a more defined shape would make me feel more attractive and unique.",
    "I would change the length of my hair to be longer. I have always felt that short hair is tooow and doesn't make me look my best, and longer hair would make me feel more feminine and glamorous."
