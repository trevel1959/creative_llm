    "**Waste-to-Resource Revolution**: I'd implement a nationwide waste management system that converts trash into valuable resources like energy, water, and nutrient-rich fertilizers. This would not only minimize waste but also create new revenue streams for communities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Composting Hubs**: I'd establish community-led composting hubs where residents can drop off their organic waste. These hubs would use advanced composting techniques to turn waste into nutrient-rich soil, which would be sold to local farmers and gardeners, promoting sustainable agriculture.",
    "**Smart Waste Containers**: I'd design and deploy intelligent waste containers that use AI-powered sensors to detect the type and quantity of waste being discarded. These containers would then optimize waste collection routes, reducing the number of collection trips and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "**Waste-to-Product Innovation**: I'd establish a network of innovation labs where scientists and entrepreneurs collaborate to develop new products from waste materials. This would create a thriving market for waste-based products, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption.",
    "**Community-Led Waste Management Cooperatives**: I'd empower communities to take ownership of their waste management by establishing cooperatives that design and implement tailored waste management systems. This would foster a sense of responsibility and accountability among residents, leading to more effective waste management practices. [/INST] "
