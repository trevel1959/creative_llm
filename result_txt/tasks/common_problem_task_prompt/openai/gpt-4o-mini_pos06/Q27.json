    "**Funding Shortages**: Developing a vaccine is a costly endeavor, often requiring millions of dollars in research and development. If funding is not secured, it can lead to halted research, under-resourced trials, or the inability to scale up production. This issue is especially pronounced for new diseases that may not attract immediate investment interest compared to more well-known illnesses.",
    "**Public Mistrust and Vaccine Hesitancy**: In the age of misinformation, public trust in vaccines can be fragile. If there is a significant amount of skepticism or misinformation regarding the vaccine's safety or efficacy, it may result in lower vaccination rates, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity and control the spread of the disease.",
    "**Supply Chain Disruptions**: The production of vaccines relies on a complex supply chain for raw materials, components, and distribution. Any disruptions—whether due to natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or pandemics—can impact the availability of necessary materials or the distribution of the vaccine to healthcare providers.",
    "**Mutation of the Pathogen**: If the disease-causing pathogen mutates significantly during the vaccine development process, it may render the vaccine ineffective. This can lead to the need for ongoing research and development, which can extend timelines and increase costs.",
    "**Ethical Concerns in Trials**: Conducting clinical trials for a new vaccine raises ethical considerations, especially regarding informed consent and the selection of trial participants. Ensuring that trials are conducted fairly and that vulnerable populations are not exploited is crucial but can complicate the recruitment process and the overall timeline."
