    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Venue**: Choose a venue that is committed to sustainability. This could be a forest preserve, a beach with low environmental impact, or a local farm that practices sustainable agriculture. You can also consider renting a venue that uses renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, or hydroelectric power. To further reduce carbon footprint, encourage guests to use public transportation or carpool.",
    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Partner with local, organic, and seasonal caterers who use biodegradable or reusable dishes, cutlery, and glassware. They can prepare meals using locally sourced ingredients, which reduces the carbon emissions associated with food transportation. Also, consider offering vegetarian or vegan options to minimize the environmental impact of meat production.",
    "**Recycled Decorations**: Instead of buying new decorations, use items made from recycled materials like reclaimed wood, glass bottles, or old fabrics. You can create unique centerpieces using items like old books bound together as vases, or hang lanterns made from repurposed metal cans. This not only adds a personal touch but also promotes sustainability.",
    "**Digital Invitations and Signage**: Use digital invitations and thank you cards instead of traditional paper ones. This saves trees and reduces waste. For signage, opt for digital displays or chalkboards that can be reused in future events, rather than disposable printed signs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Favors**: Give guests eco-friendly gifts that they can use and appreciate after the wedding. These could include reusable water bottles, organic herbal teas, seed packets for planting, or handmade soaps packaged in recyclable materials. Avoid single-use plastic and promote the idea of reducing waste even after the celebration."
