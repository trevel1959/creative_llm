    "**Radio Waves**: Utilize amateur radio operators, also known as \"hams,\" who have the capability to communicate over long distances using radio waves. They could serve as a network, connecting people across the globe. This method would require a significant amount of training and infrastructure, but it's a viable option.",
    "**Optical Communication**: Employ optical communication methods, such as laser communication or optical fibers, to transmit data through light. This would allow for secure and high-speed communication over long distances. However, it would require a pre-existing infrastructure and a way to power the equipment.",
    "**Morse Code via Satellite**: Utilize satellites in orbit to transmit Morse code messages. This method would require a satellite with a transmitter and a way to receive the signal on the ground. It would be a slow process, but it could be a reliable means of communication.",
    "**Global Network of Reflectors**: Create a network of reflectors, such as mirrors or shiny surfaces, that could be used to bounce signals across the globe. This method would require a significant amount of planning and infrastructure, but it could be an effective way to communicate over long distances.",
    "**Physical Messengers**: Establish a network of physical messengers, such as runners or horseback riders, who could carry messages between countries. This method would be slow and labor-intensive, but it could be a reliable means of communication in a post-electronic world."
