    "**Overheating Concerns**: A newly built computer may face overheating issues if proper cooling solutions are not implemented. This can happen if the CPU cooler is insufficient, the case lacks airflow, or thermal paste is improperly applied. To prevent overheating, builders should research and select appropriate cooling solutions, such as high-quality CPU coolers, case fans, and ensuring the case has good airflow design. Monitoring software can also be used to keep track of temperatures during initial use.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When handling sensitive electronic components, static electricity can cause irreparable damage. Many builders overlook this risk, especially if they are not grounded. To prevent this, it’s essential to use an anti-static wrist strap, work on a non-static surface, and regularly touch a grounded metal object to discharge any static buildup before handling components.",
    "**Cable Management Problems**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered interior, which can obstruct airflow and make future upgrades difficult. It can also create a chaotic look that detracts from the aesthetic appeal of the build. To address this, builders should plan their cable routes in advance, use cable ties or Velcro straps to bundle cables neatly, and take advantage of the case’s cable management features, such as routing holes and tie-down points.",
    "**BIOS/UEFI Configuration Issues**: After assembling the computer, many users encounter difficulties with BIOS/UEFI settings. This can include issues like booting from the wrong drive or not recognizing certain hardware. To solve this, builders should familiarize themselves with the BIOS/UEFI interface and its settings before starting the build. Consulting the motherboard manual can provide guidance on how to properly configure the settings for optimal performance.",
    "**Software Installation Hurdles**: After successfully building the hardware, the next step is installing the operating system and drivers. Problems can arise if the installation media is not created correctly, or if drivers are missing or incompatible. To prevent these issues, builders should prepare a bootable USB drive with the latest OS version and ensure they download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website prior to starting the installation process."
