    "**Modular Shelving Design**: Create a refrigerator with modular shelving that can be easily adjusted or rearranged based on the user's needs. Users could swap out shelves for different heights, add bins for specific food types, or even include temperature-controlled compartments for items that require different storage conditions, like meats or dairy.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion**: Incorporate a water filtration system that not only purifies tap water but also allows users to infuse flavors into their drinking water. This could include built-in compartments for fruits, herbs, or even tea bags, providing refreshing flavored water directly from the refrigerator.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Cooling Zones**: Develop a refrigerator with customizable cooling zones that can be set to different temperatures based on the food stored. For example, a section for fruits and vegetables could be set to a slightly higher humidity level to keep them fresh longer, while a section for meats could be kept at a lower temperature to ensure safety.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Implement an augmented reality interface that allows users to visualize their food inventory and plan meals. Users could use their smartphones or smart glasses to see whatâ€™s inside the fridge without opening the door, view nutritional information, or get recipe suggestions based on what they have.",
    "**Built-in Meal Prep Station**: Design a refrigerator with a built-in meal prep station that includes a small cutting board, knife storage, and a mini sink. This would allow users to prepare meals directly next to the fridge, streamlining the cooking process and reducing the need to transfer items between the fridge and countertop."
