    "**Hydroponic Recycling System**: Set up a closed-loop hydroponic system where water is recirculated. Use a combination of nutrient-rich water and a filtration system to ensure that the plants receive the necessary hydration without wasting water. This method allows for precise control over water usage and can be adapted for both indoor and outdoor gardens.",
    "**Plant Companion System**: Design a companion planting system where water-loving plants are grown alongside drought-resistant plants. The water-loving plants can help retain moisture in the soil and create a microclimate that reduces evaporation. Additionally, the roots of the drought-resistant plants can help aerate the soil, improving water absorption for the entire garden.",
    "**Solar-Powered Irrigation Drones**: Create small, solar-powered drones equipped with water tanks that can autonomously deliver water to plants. These drones can be programmed to assess soil moisture levels and distribute water only where needed, ensuring efficient use of resources and minimizing waste.",
    "**Desalination Plant for Home Gardens**: Install a small-scale desalination system that converts seawater into freshwater for irrigation. This method can be particularly useful for coastal areas where freshwater is scarce but seawater is abundant. The system can use solar energy to power the desalination process, making it eco-friendly.",
    "**Water-Absorbing Gel Beads**: Introduce water-absorbing gel beads into the soil, which can absorb and retain moisture for extended periods. These beads can be made from biodegradable materials and will release water gradually to the plants as needed. This method helps maintain soil moisture and reduces the frequency of watering."
