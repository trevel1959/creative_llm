    "Unpredictable Tides: Having two moons would result in unpredictable tides, causing flooding in some areas and droughts in others. This would lead to conflicts over resources and displacement of coastal communities.",
    "Gravity Shifts: With two moons, the gravitational pull on Earth would be uneven, causing structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. This could lead to widespread destruction and loss of life, especially in areas prone to natural disasters.",
    "Eclipses Galore: Two moons would result in more frequent lunar eclipses, which could have a significant impact on astronomical observations and space exploration. The increased frequency of eclipses could also cause disruptions in communication and navigation systems.",
    "Unstable Orbit: The gravitational interactions between the two moons would cause their orbits to become unstable, leading to chaotic and unpredictable movements. This could result in collisions between the moons, causing further damage to Earth's atmosphere and surface.",
    "Energy Crisis: The increased gravitational pull of the two moons would lead to a significant increase in energy consumption, as more power would be needed to counteract their effects. This could result in an energy crisis, as the demand for power outstrips available resources."
