    "The planets in our solar system would experience a significant change in their orbits, potentially causing them to fly off course or the,, or even, into space. This could lead to a rearrangement of the planets in our solar system, and potentially cause the end of life as we know it.",
    "The Earth's atmosphere would also be affected, as the decrease in gravity would cause the air molecules to move faster, potentially leading to extreme weather patterns and even tornadoes.",
    "The oceans would also be affected, as the decrease in gravity would cause the water to move faster, potentially leading to massive waves and even tsunamis.",
    "The human body would also be affected, as the decrease in gravity would cause our bones and muscles to weaken, potentially leading to a decrease in mobility and even death.",
    "The technology we use on Earth would also be affected, as the decrease in gravity would cause many of our machines and structures to fail, potentially leading to widespread chaos and destruction."
