    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact the launch schedule and success. High winds, thunderstorms, or poor visibility can lead to delays or even cancellation of the launch. Launch teams must continuously monitor weather forecasts and have contingency plans in place, including alternate launch windows or locations to ensure the satellite can be deployed safely.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex web of regulatory requirements from various governmental and international bodies. This includes obtaining necessary licenses, adhering to space debris mitigation guidelines, and ensuring compliance with national security regulations. Failing to meet these regulations can result in legal challenges or delays in the launch timeline.",
    "**Space Debris Collision Risk**: As the number of satellites in orbit increases, so does the risk of collision with space debris. Even small fragments can cause significant damage to a satellite. To address this, mission planners must conduct thorough orbital analyses to choose a safe trajectory and implement tracking systems to monitor potential collision threats, allowing for maneuvering if necessary.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The costs associated with launching a satellite can be unpredictable, often leading to budget overruns. This could stem from unforeseen technical challenges, delays, or changes in regulatory requirements. To manage this risk, project managers should establish a comprehensive budget that includes contingencies for unexpected expenses and maintain strict oversight throughout the development and launch phases.",
    "**Public Perception and Stakeholder Communication**: Launching a satellite can attract significant public interest and scrutiny. Negative public perception, whether due to environmental concerns or geopolitical tensions, can impact funding and support. To mitigate this, effective communication strategies should be developed to engage stakeholders, provide transparency about the mission's objectives, and address any concerns from the community or interest groups."
