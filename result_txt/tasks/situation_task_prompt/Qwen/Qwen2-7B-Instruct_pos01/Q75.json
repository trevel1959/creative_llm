    "**Biofuels**: We could turn organic waste into biofuels through processes like anaerobic digestion or algae cultivation. These biofuels can be used in existing vehicles with minor modifications. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: Since most modern cars can already run on electricity, this would be an easy transition. Charging infrastructure would need to be expanded, but it's feasible given advancements in battery technology and grid capacity. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Vehicles could be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen and oxygen into water and produce electricity as a byproduct. This would require building a hydrogen supply chain, including production plants and refueling stations. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Solar-Powered Vehicles**: Develop lightweight, flexible solar panels that can be integrated into vehicle roofs or bodywork. These would recharge the vehicle's battery while driving, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "**Wind Turbine Vehicles**: Create vehicles equipped with retractable wind turbines that can harness wind energy while in motion. This would require advanced aerodynamics and possibly a new class of vehicles optimized for wind energy capture. Confidence score: 0.5"
