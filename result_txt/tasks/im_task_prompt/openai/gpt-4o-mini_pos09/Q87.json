    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Float**:    Develop a pool float made from biodegradable materials that break down safely in the environment. This would cater to environmentally conscious consumers and help reduce plastic waste in pools and oceans. The float could also feature plant-based inks and dyes to ensure itâ€™s fully eco-friendly.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Float**:    Design a float that includes built-in LED lights that change colors based on the user's mood or the time of day. Using sensors, the float could detect when someone is relaxing or having fun and adjust the lighting accordingly. The lights could also sync with music for a party atmosphere.",
    "**Built-In Water Filtration System**:    Create a float that has a built-in water filtration system, allowing users to drink clean water directly from the pool.
