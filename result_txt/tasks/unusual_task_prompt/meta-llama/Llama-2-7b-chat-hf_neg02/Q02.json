    "Interactive Virtual Reality Experience: Create an immersive VR experience where users can place their real hand inside a virtual environment and interact with a virtual rubber hand. The virtual rubber hand could be programmed to mimic the user's real hand movements, creating a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual limb. This could be used to treat phantom limb pain, as well as to help individuals with limb loss or paralysis.",
    "Art Installation: Design an art installation that features a life-size rubber hand suspended in mid-air. The hand could be covered in LED lights that change color and pattern based on the user's brain activity, measured through EEG sensors. As users approach the installation, their brain activity could be analyzed and translated into a visual display, creating a mesmerizing and interactive experience. This could be used to explore the relationship between the brain and the body, as well as to create a unique and immersive art experience.",
    "Exercise and Rehabilitation Tool: Develop a rubber hand exercise device that helps individuals with upper limb weakness or paralysis to regain strength and mobility. The device would consist of a rubber hand that the user grasps with their real hand, and a series of exercises and games that the user can play with the rubber hand to strengthen their muscles. The device could be programmed to provide feedback on the user's progress, and could be used in both clinical and home settings.",
    "Social Interaction Tool: Create a robotic rubber hand that can be used as a tool for social interaction in various settings, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or schools. The robotic hand could be programmed to mimic the user's hand movements, allowing individuals with mobility impairments to participate in activities and interactions that they might otherwise be unable to engage in. This could be used to improve social connections and reduce feelings of isolation in individuals with mobility impairments.",
    "Music Performance Tool: Develop a rubber hand instrument that can be used to create unique and expressive music. The instrument could consist of a rubber hand with a series of sensors and actuators that allow the user to control the hand's movements and create different sounds. The user could use the instrument to create music in real"
