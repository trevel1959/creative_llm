    "**Public Safety**: Zoos need to maintain a safe environment for both visitors and staff. Potential problems include escape incidents, where animals might breach enclosures, or interactions between visitors and animals that could lead to injury. Implementing strict safety protocols, regular training for staff, and designing secure enclosures are essential to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Zoos often rely on ticket sales, donations, and grants for funding. Economic downturns or shifts in public interest can lead to financial instability. This could result in cutbacks on animal care, staff, or educational programs. Developing diverse revenue streams, such as hosting events, offering memberships, and establishing partnerships with local businesses, can help ensure long-term sustainability.",
    "**Conservation and Ethical Dilemmas**: While many zoos aim to contribute to conservation efforts, ethical dilemmas can arise regarding breeding programs, species captivity, and the role of zoos in wildlife conservation. Balancing entertainment with education and genuine conservation efforts is crucial. Zoos must be transparent about their practices and engage in meaningful conservation projects to avoid criticism.",
    "**Visitor Engagement and Education**: Ensuring that visitors have a meaningful and educational experience can be challenging. If guests leave without a deeper understanding of wildlife and conservation issues, the zoo's mission may be compromised. Implementing interactive exhibits, guided tours, and educational programs can enhance visitor engagement and promote awareness about the importance of wildlife preservation.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: Keeping knowledgeable and passionate staff is essential for the zoo's success. High turnover rates or lack of training can lead to inconsistent care for animals and poor visitor experiences. Investing in staff development, offering competitive salaries, and creating a positive work environment can help retain skilled employees and ensure high standards of care."
