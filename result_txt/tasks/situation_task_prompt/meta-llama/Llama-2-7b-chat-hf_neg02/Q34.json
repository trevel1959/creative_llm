    "Create a self-sustaining hydroponic system: Develop a hydroponic system that uses the sun's energy and rainwater to irrigate plants. The system would be designed to collect and store rainwater, which would then be filtered and used to feed the plants. This would ensure that the plants receive the necessary amount of water without relying on external sources.",
    "Utilize fog collection: In areas where fog is prevalent, set up a fog collection system that captures the moisture in the air and converts it into water. This water can then be used to irrigate plants. The system could be designed to be energy-efficient and scalable, making it a viable solution for various applications.",
    "Design a rainwater harvesting system: Develop a system that collects and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. The system could be as simple as a large tank or as complex as a network of underground pipes and storage tanks. The system would be designed to maximize the amount of rainwater collected and stored, ensuring that plants receive the necessary amount of water without relying on external sources.",
    "Employ evapotranspiration-based irrigation: Create a system that uses the process of evapotranspiration to irrigate plants. Evapotranspiration is the process by which plants release water vapor into the air. By harnessing this process, plants can be irrigated without the need for external water sources. The system could be designed to be energy-efficient and scalable, making it a viable solution for various applications.",
    "Use of aquaporins: Aquaporins are proteins that allow water to pass through cell membranes, allowing plants to absorb water from the soil. By genetically engineering plants to produce more aquaporins, they could absorb water from the soil more efficiently, reducing the need for external irrigation. This could be a long-term solution for watering plants, as it would reduce the reliance on external sources of water."
