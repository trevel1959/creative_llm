    "**Modular Suitcase Design**: Create a suitcase with modular compartments that can be rearranged or detached based on the traveler's needs. For example, if someone is going on a short trip, they could detach a smaller compartment for a weekend getaway. This allows for customization and adaptability, making packing easier and more efficient.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Biodegradable Options**: Develop suitcases made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites.

    "**Personalized Interior with Smart Fabric**: Design the interior of the suitcase with smart fabric that can change color or pattern based on the ownerâ€™s preferences or mood.
