    "**Sensory Experience through Paper Cutting**: Develop a multisensory experience where visitors can touch, smell, and hear the paper cutting process.

This immersive experience can be used in art galleries, museums, or even as a therapeutic tool for individuals with sensory disorders.",
    "**Interactive Light Installations**: Design a series of interactive light installations that use paper cutting as a medium to create dynamic patterns and shapes.

This can be used in children's books, educational materials, or as a unique form of visual storytelling.",
    "**Bioluminescent Paper Cutting**: Experiment with bioluminescent materials, such as glow-in-the-dark paint or LED lights, to create paper cutouts that emit light.
