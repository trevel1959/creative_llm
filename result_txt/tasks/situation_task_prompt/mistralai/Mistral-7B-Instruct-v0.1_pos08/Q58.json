    "Develop a robotic army: In the absence of animals, humans could create a robotic army to combat insects. These robots could be programmed to hunt down and eliminate insects in their natural habitats, reducing the need for harmful pesticides.",
    "Introduce natural predators: Humans could introduce natural predators of insects, such as birds or bats, to control their populations. This would create a more sustainable ecosystem and reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Implement integrated pest management: Humans could use integrated pest management techniques to control insect populations. This involves using a combination of pesticides, biological controls, and cultural practices to reduce the impact of insects on the environment.",
    "Develop new technologies: Humans could develop new technologies to combat insects, such as drones equipped with pesticides or laser beams that can kill insects.",
    "Encourage biodiversity: Humans could encourage biodiversity by planting more trees and flowers, which can attract beneficial insects that help control pest populations. This would create a more balanced ecosystem and reduce the need for harmful pesticides."
