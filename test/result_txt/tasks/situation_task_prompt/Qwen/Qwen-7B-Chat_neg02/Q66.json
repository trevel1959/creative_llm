    "Use recycled materials: One idea could be to use recycled materials to construct a house. This could include things like old cars, appliances, and construction debris. The design of the house could be based on the shape and size of the recycled materials, and it could be decorated with items found in junkyards or salvage stores.",
    "Create a living wall: Another idea could be to create a living wall using plants that can grow without soil. These plants could be attached to the walls of the house using special hooks or brackets. The living wall could provide insulation, improve air quality, and add a unique aesthetic to the home.",
    "Build with compressed earth: Compressed earth is a type of building material made from soil that has been compacted into a solid form. It's an eco-friendly option that requires little to no maintenance once it's installed. To build a house with compressed earth, the soil would be mixed with cement and water, then shaped into blocks or panels. The blocks or panels could be stacked to create the walls of the house, and the roof could be built using materials like straw or bamboo.",
    "Use shipping containers: Shipping containers are a durable and affordable option for building a house. They can be easily modified to create different room configurations, and they're designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. To build a house with shipping containers, the containers would be stacked on top of each other and sealed together using insulation and sealant.",
    "Create a geodesic dome: A geodesic dome is a spherical structure that's characterized by its strength and stability. It's made up of interconnected triangles that distribute weight evenly throughout the structure. To build a house with a geodesic dome, the triangles would be connected using tension cables or beams, and the dome would be covered with a material like metal or glass. The dome could be customized to fit the needs of the homeowner, and it could provide ample space for living and entertaining."
