    "**Lab-Grown Nutrient-Rich Foods**: Invest in biotechnology to create lab-grown foods that are specifically engineered to contain high levels of vitamins and minerals. For instance, using cellular agriculture techniques, scientists could cultivate nutrient-dense plant cells that replicate the benefits of fruits and vegetables without actually growing them in traditional farming methods. These could be marketed as \"superfoods\" with a focus on sustainability.",
    "**Fermented Nutrient Beverages**: Create a line of fermented beverages that use probiotics and nutrient-rich ingredients like seaweed, nuts, and grains. The fermentation process enhances the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals, making them easier for the body to absorb. Flavors could be inspired by popular juices, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional fruit and vegetable sources.",
    "**Algae-Based Supplements**: Promote the use of algae as a primary source of vitamins and minerals. Algae, such as spirulina and chlorella, are rich in nutrients and can be harvested sustainably. These could be sold in powdered form to be added to smoothies, or as capsules for easy consumption. Educational campaigns could highlight the environmental benefits of algae farming compared to traditional agriculture.",
    "**Nutrient-Infused Snacks**: Develop a range of snack foods that are infused with essential vitamins and minerals. For example, protein bars or chips could be made with fortified ingredients like nuts, seeds, and grains, designed to provide a balanced intake of nutrients. These snacks could cater to different dietary needs, such as vegan, gluten-free, or high-protein options.",
    "**Mushroom Nutrient Blends**: Explore the nutritional potential of mushrooms, which are often overlooked as a source of vitamins and minerals. Create blends of various mushrooms, such as shiitake, reishi, and lion's mane, that are dried and ground into a powder. This powder could be added to soups, stews, or smoothies, providing a unique flavor while delivering essential nutrients."
