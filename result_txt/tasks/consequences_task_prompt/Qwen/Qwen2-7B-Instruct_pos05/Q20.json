    "**Economic Disruption**: If all electronic devices suddenly stop functioning, it would cause widespread economic chaos. Banks, financial institutions, and online transactions would cease to function, leading to a breakdown in global trade and commerce. This could lead to significant stock market crashes and shortages of essential goods as supply chains are disrupted.",
    "**Social Unrest**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would also impact social interactions and communications. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and internet-based communication tools would no longer work, leading to confusion and panic among the public. This could potentially lead to social unrest as people struggle to cope with the loss of their primary means of communication and information exchange.",
    "**Infrastructure Failure**: Electronic devices are integral to modern infrastructure, including transportation systems, power grids, and emergency services. A sudden stoppage of these devices could result in widespread power outages, disruptions to public transportation, and failures in emergency response systems, leading to potential loss of life and damage to property.",
    "**Educational Challenges**: Educational institutions heavily rely on technology for teaching and learning. Without electronic devices, schools, universities, and other educational facilities would have to revert to traditional methods of instruction, which could significantly hinder the learning process and academic progress. This could have long-term implications for skill development and knowledge acquisition.",
    "**Healthcare Impact**: Hospitals and medical facilities depend on electronic devices for critical functions such as monitoring patients' vital signs, administering medications, and maintaining medical records. A sudden halt in these devices would lead to critical care delays, increased risk of patient harm, and potential loss of life. This would have severe consequences for healthcare systems and public health."
