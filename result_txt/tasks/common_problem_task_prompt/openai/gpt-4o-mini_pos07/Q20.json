    "**Liability and Insurance Complications**: The introduction of self-driving cars raises complex questions regarding liability in the event of an accident. Determining whether the manufacturer, software developer, or the car owner is responsible can lead to legal disputes. Additionally, traditional insurance models may need to evolve to accommodate these vehicles, creating confusion for consumers and insurers alike.",
    "**Ethical Decision-Making Algorithms**: Self-driving cars may face situations requiring ethical decisions, such as choosing between two harmful outcomes in an unavoidable accident. The programming of these ethical algorithms raises moral dilemmas about how the car should react, which could lead to public backlash or differing opinions on acceptable responses.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Support**: As technology advances, the complexity of self-driving cars may require specialized maintenance and support. This could lead to a shortage of trained technicians, increased costs for repairs, and longer wait times for service, potentially causing inconvenience for owners and diminishing trust in the technology.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: Despite technological advancements, many people may be skeptical about the safety and reliability of self-driving cars. Building public trust is essential for widespread adoption, which may require extensive education, demonstrations, and transparent communication about safety measures and real-world performance.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in sectors reliant on human drivers, such as trucking, taxi services, and public transportation. This shift may create economic challenges and necessitate retraining programs for displaced workers to adapt to new roles in a changing job market."
