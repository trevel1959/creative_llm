The screenplay could include elements like advanced technology, alien encounters, and time travel, all presented through a humorous lens.",
    "**Time Loop Twist**: Write a screenplay where the protagonist is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. The catch?

This could lead to a complex narrative that explores themes of repetition, personal growth, and the consequences of past actions.",
    "**Non-linear Narrative**: Develop a screenplay that tells the story of a character's life through a non-linear structure.

This approach allows for deep character exploration and the interweaving of various storylines that eventually converge, providing a poignant and emotionally resonant conclusion.",
    "**Psychological Drama with Parallel Worlds**: Craft a screenplay that delves into the mind of a person struggling with mental health issues while also exploring parallel universes.

    "**Historical Fiction with Unlikely Heroes**: Write a screenplay set during a historical event but focus on the stories of ordinary people who become heroes in extraordinary circumstances. The characters might be common citizens, soldiers, or civilians caught up in the events. Their actions and decisions could have significant impacts on the course of history.
