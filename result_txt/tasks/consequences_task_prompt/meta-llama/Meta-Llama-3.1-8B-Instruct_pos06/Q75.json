    "**Mass Migration and Urbanization**: With the oceans transformed into freshwater, coastal cities and towns would become hubs for human migration, as people from all over the world would flock to these areas to settle and exploit the abundant freshwater resources. This would lead to unprecedented urbanization, straining local infrastructure, and causing significant social and economic changes. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**New Ecosystems and Biodiversity Boom**: The sudden change in ocean chemistry would create a new environment that would be conducive to the growth of freshwater species, leading to an explosion of biodiversity. New species would emerge, and existing ones would adapt to their new surroundings, potentially leading to the discovery of new medicines, food sources, and other valuable resources. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Global Food Crisis and Economic Upheaval**: The transformation of the oceans into freshwater would have a devastating impact on the global fishing industry, leading to widespread unemployment and economic disruption. The loss of a primary food source would lead to food shortages, famine, and social unrest, potentially destabilizing governments and economies worldwide. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Rise of Aquatic Agriculture**: With the oceans now filled with freshwater, new opportunities for aquatic agriculture would emerge. People would develop innovative methods for cultivating crops and raising livestock in the new environment, potentially leading to increased food production and reduced reliance on traditional agricultural methods. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Geological and Geophysical Consequences**: The sudden change in ocean chemistry would have far-reaching geological and geophysical consequences, including the potential for massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The altered density of the ocean would also impact global ocean currents, leading to changes in climate patterns and potentially catastrophic effects on coastal ecosystems. Confidence: 0.9"
