    "**Real Estate Inspection**: Imagine you're a real estate inspector. You could walk into a property and immediately see through walls to check for issues such as structural integrity, plumbing leaks, or mold behind the surfaces. This could greatly enhance your efficiency and accuracy in assessing properties, potentially saving buyers thousands of dollars by avoiding costly surprises.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: As an urban planner or architect, you could visualize the entire infrastructure beneath the ground - utilities, roads, and other critical systems. This insight would allow for more informed planning and design decisions, ensuring that new developments are built efficiently without disrupting existing services. It could also help in designing safer, more resilient cities.",
    "**Museum Curator**: For museum curators, being able to see through walls would be invaluable for conservation efforts. You could inspect artworks, artifacts, and historical structures from inside to assess their condition without needing to physically open them, reducing the risk of damage. This would also facilitate more accurate dating and understanding of the history of these items.",
    "**Historical Research**: Historians and archaeologists could benefit immensely from this ability. By seeing through walls, they could uncover hidden rooms, tunnels, and artifacts without excavation, which might otherwise destroy valuable historical evidence. This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries and a deeper understanding of past civilizations.",
    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: In law enforcement, this power could revolutionize crime prevention and investigation methods. Detectives could see through walls to identify potential hiding spots or contraband within buildings, aiding in both proactive surveillance and forensic investigations. This could significantly improve public safety and the efficiency of criminal justice processes."
