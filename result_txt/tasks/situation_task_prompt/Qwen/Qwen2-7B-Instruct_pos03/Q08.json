    "**Water Filtration Device Involving Nano Technology:** Create a portable, hand-operated device that uses nanotechnology to filter out impurities from contaminated water. This device could use a combination of nanomaterials like graphene oxide or carbon nanotubes, which have exceptional filtration properties. These materials can effectively remove pollutants, bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants down to microscopic levels. The device would be compact and easy to carry, making it accessible for emergency situations or remote areas.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification System:** Develop a solar-powered system that combines solar energy with advanced water purification techniques. The system would consist of a solar panel to charge a battery pack, which then powers a UV light and reverse osmosis membrane. The UV light kills harmful microorganisms, while the reverse osmosis membrane removes dissolved salts and other contaminants. This system could be deployed in rural or disaster-stricken areas where access to electricity is limited.",
    "**Biological Water Treatment with Aquatic Plants:** Design a system that uses aquatic plants to purify water naturally. This could involve setting up an eco-pool with plants such as water hyacinth, which are known for their ability to absorb heavy metals, nitrates, and phosphates from water. The plants' roots and leaves filter the water as they grow, and any remaining impurities can be further removed through sedimentation or biological treatment. This method would be environmentally friendly and sustainable.",
    "**Desalination Using Solar Thermal Energy:** Create a large-scale desalination plant that harnesses solar thermal energy to evaporate seawater or heavily contaminated water. The heat generated by solar panels is used to heat the water until it evaporates, leaving salt behind. The steam is then condensed back into freshwater, which can be purified further using UV light or other filtration methods. This system could provide a reliable source of clean water in coastal regions or areas with high salinity in groundwater.",
    "**Air-Cleaning Water Purification Capsule:** Invent a small, self-contained capsule that converts air into drinkable water using a combination of solar power, air purification, and condensation technology. The capsule would collect moisture from the air using a cooling coil, then purify the water through a series of filters before storing it. It could also include a UV light to disinfect the water. This concept could be particularly useful in arid climates or during extreme weather events where water sources are scarce."
