    "**DIY Cosmetics Workshop**: Create a workshop where you can learn to make your own cosmetics from natural ingredients. You could start by learning to make lip balms, scrubs, and facial masks. This way, you have control over what goes into your products, ensuring they are free from harsh chemicals and fragrances that might irritate your skin.",
    "**Herbal Bath Rituals**: Since bath soaps, shampoos, and conditioners might not be available, you can create your own herbal bath teas and oils. Infuse herbs like lavender, chamomile, and rose petals in oil for a relaxing bath. Use these oils for hair as well, ensuring your scalp stays healthy and your hair is nourished.",
    "**Personalized Aromatherapy**: Essential oils offer a wide range of benefits for both skin and hair. You can mix different essential oils based on your needs - for instance, tea tree oil for acne-prone skin, or peppermint oil for an energizing scalp massage. Pair these oils with carrier oils like coconut or almond for a more effective treatment.",
    "**Natural Skincare Routine**: Use simple and natural ingredients like honey, yogurt, oatmeal, and avocado for skincare. For instance, a honey mask can soothe irritated skin, while avocado can deeply moisturize it. For hair, a yogurt mask can help with dandruff and add shine, while oatmeal can soothe an itchy scalp.",
    "**Upcycling Old Products**: Before everything disappears, stock up on items that you think will last longer than others. Then, use creative ways to extend their life. For example, use an old toothbrush to scrub away dead skin cells when you run out of a body scrub. Similarly, repurpose an old face wash bottle as a container for homemade face toner or hair rinse."
