    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Another option is to use hydrogen fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of an electrolyte. This electricity can then be used to power electric vehicles or other electrical devices.",
    "Solar panels: Solar panels can be used to generate electricity from sunlight, which can then be used to power electric vehicles or other devices.",
    "Wind turbines: Wind turbines can also be used to generate electricity, which can be used to power electric vehicles or other devices.",
    "Geothermal energy: Geothermal energy can be harnessed by drilling wells into the ground and extracting heat from the earth's core. This heat can be used to generate electricity, which can then be used to power vehicles or other devices.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels can be produced from plant or animal matter and used to power vehicles. These fuels are renewable and can be produced sustainably."
