    "Garden Bags: Create a set of garden bags that can be filled with soil and planted directly into the ground without the need for digging. These bags can be made from durable materials such as canvas or nylon and can be designed with drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.",
    "Vertical Gardening: Develop a system of vertical gardening using a series of interconnected planters that can be stacked on top of each other to maximize space. This would allow gardeners to grow a variety of plants without the need for large areas of land.",
    "Hydroponic Gardening: Create a hydroponic gardening system that uses nutrient-rich water instead of soil to grow plants. This system would be ideal for areas with poor soil quality or limited space, as it can be set up indoors or outdoors and can be easily scaled up or down depending on the space available.",
    "Living Roofs: Design a system for creating living roofs that can be planted with a variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, and flowers. These living roofs can provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create habitats for wildlife, making them an eco-friendly alternative to traditional gardening methods.",
    "Robot Gardening: Develop a robotic gardening system that can automate the process of planting, watering, and maintaining a garden. This system could use sensors and AI algorithms to optimize plant growth and reduce waste, making it an efficient and sustainable option for gardening in challenging environments."
