    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Candle Holder**: Design a candle holder made from biodegradable materials that can be reused. Instead of throwing away the wax remnants after a candle burns down, users can refill the holder with eco-friendly wax. This would reduce waste and promote sustainability while offering customizable scent options.",
    "**Scented Candle Subscription Box**: Create a subscription service that delivers a curated selection of unique, artisanal candles each month. Each box could focus on a theme (e.g., seasonal scents, world cultures, or relaxation) and include exclusive candles not available in stores, along with information about the scent's origin and intended mood.",
    "**Interactive Candle Experience**: Develop a candle that incorporates augmented reality (AR) features. When users scan the candle with their smartphone, they could unlock an interactive experience, such as guided meditations, storytelling, or visualizations that enhance the ambiance and connection to the scent.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Combine the benefits of candles and essential oils by creating a dual-function product. This candle would burn like a traditional candle but also have a small compartment for essential oils that, when heated, would diffuse calming scents into the air, enhancing the relaxation experience.",
    "**Mood-Sensing Candle**: Introduce a candle that can change its color and scent based on the user's mood. By incorporating sensors that detect changes in heart rate or body temperature, the candle could adapt its properties to create a more personalized and soothing environment, providing comfort during stressful times."
