    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate sensors within the laptop that can monitor the user’s posture, eye strain, and even heart rate. This system could provide real-time feedback and reminders to take breaks, adjust posture, or engage in eye exercises, helping to reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries and promoting overall well-being during long work sessions.",
    "**Dynamic Cooling System**: Develop a smart cooling system that adapts to the laptop’s usage. For example, when the laptop is under heavy load (like gaming or video editing), the cooling fans could automatically ramp up. Conversely, during light tasks, the system could quiet down to reduce noise and save battery life. This would not only improve performance but also enhance the user experience by minimizing distractions.",
    "**Built-in Solar Charging**: Design a laptop with solar panels embedded in the lid that can harness sunlight to charge the battery. This feature would be especially beneficial for users who work outdoors or travel frequently, providing an eco-friendly charging option and reducing reliance on traditional power sources.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Integrate AR capabilities that allow users to project a virtual workspace in their physical environment. With AR glasses or through the laptop’s screen, users could manipulate virtual screens, tools, and documents in 3D space, enhancing productivity and providing a more immersive working experience.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Develop an AI assistant that learns the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could proactively suggest task prioritization, automate repetitive tasks, and provide personalized tips for productivity based on the user’s work patterns. It could also integrate with other apps and services to streamline workflows."
