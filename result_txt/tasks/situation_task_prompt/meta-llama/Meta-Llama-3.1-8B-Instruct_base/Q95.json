    "**Elastic Headrest**: I would design an elastic headrest that can be attached to any surface, such as a chair, table, or even a wall. This headrest would be made of a flexible, yet supportive material, allowing it to conform to the shape of my head and provide comfort. It could be adjustable, allowing me to customize the level of support and comfort to my liking.",
    "**Sleeping Sack**: I would create a sleeping sack with built-in, inflatable headrests. The sack would be made of a soft, breathable material and would have a zipper or Velcro closure to allow me to easily get in and out. The inflatable headrests would provide the necessary support and comfort for my head, while the sack would cradle my body, allowing me to sleep soundly.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Headrest**: I would design a headrest that uses magnetic levitation technology to suspend my head in mid-air. This would eliminate the need for a traditional pillow and allow me to sleep with my head in a neutral position, promoting proper spinal alignment and reducing pressure on my neck and shoulders.",
    "**Smart Headrest**: I would create a smart headrest that adjusts to my head shape and position in real-time. Using sensors and AI, the headrest would detect my head's position and adjust its shape and firmness to provide optimal comfort and support. It could also integrate with my sleep tracking devices to monitor my sleep quality and provide personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "**Bioluminescent Headrest**: I would design a headrest that incorporates bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria, to create a soft, ethereal glow. This would not only provide a unique and calming ambiance but also help to regulate my sleep-wake cycle by simulating the natural light-dark cycle. The bioluminescent organisms would be safely contained within the headrest, eliminating any potential health risks."
