    "**Adaptive Bristle Technology**: Develop a toothbrush with bristles that can change their stiffness based on the user’s brushing technique and pressure. Softer bristles could emerge for sensitive areas, while firmer bristles could activate for tougher plaque. This would ensure a personalized brushing experience that adapts to the user's needs.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Create a toothbrush with a built-in LED display that shows brushing time, technique, and areas that need more attention. The display could provide animated tutorials on proper brushing techniques and even offer gamified challenges to encourage children to brush more effectively.",
    "**Replaceable Brush Head with Customization Options**: Design a toothbrush that allows users to easily swap out brush heads that are customizable for different needs—such as whitening, gum care, or orthodontic care. Users could select a brush head that fits their specific dental needs and preferences, making it more versatile.",
    "**Integrated Mouthwash Dispenser**: Incorporate a small, refillable compartment for mouthwash within the toothbrush handle. After brushing, users could press a button to dispense a small amount of mouthwash that mixes with water, allowing for a convenient rinse without needing a separate bottle.",
    "**UV Sanitizing Case**: Create a travel case for the toothbrush that features built-in UV-C light sanitization. This would ensure that the toothbrush head is free from bacteria and germs after each use, promoting better oral hygiene, especially for those who travel frequently."
