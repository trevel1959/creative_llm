    "**Insufficient Resources**: Implementing a new curriculum often requires new textbooks, technology, and teaching materials. A common issue could be a lack of funding to procure these resources. Schools could initiate fundraising campaigns, apply for grants, or partner with local businesses to secure the necessary materials.",
    "**Parent and Community Concerns**: Parents and community members may have differing opinions on the curriculum's content and approach, leading to potential backlash or misunderstandings. To mitigate this, schools should hold informational sessions and workshops for parents, allowing them to engage with the curriculum and provide feedback.",
    "**Curriculum Misalignment**: The new curriculum may not align with standardized testing requirements or state education standards, causing confusion and potential legal issues. Schools should conduct a thorough review of the new curriculum against these standards and work with educational authorities to ensure compliance.",
    "**Diverse Learning Needs**: A one-size-fits-all curriculum may not cater to the diverse learning needs of students, including those with special needs or varying academic abilities. To tackle this, the curriculum should incorporate differentiated instruction strategies, allowing teachers to tailor lessons to meet the needs of all learners.",
    "**Inadequate Implementation Timeline**: Rushing the implementation of a new curriculum without adequate planning can lead to chaos and confusion. Schools should develop a phased implementation plan, allowing time for feedback and adjustments based on initial rollout experiences."
