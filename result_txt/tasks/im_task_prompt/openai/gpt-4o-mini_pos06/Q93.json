    "**Customizable Weight Inserts**: Design a bowling ball with interchangeable weight inserts that can be easily swapped out. This would allow bowlers to adjust the weight of the ball according to their personal preferences or for different types of games (e.g., lighter for kids or beginners, heavier for experienced players). A simple mechanism for swapping inserts could be developed to ensure ease of use.",
    "**Adaptive Grip Technology**: Create a bowling ball with a textured surface that can adapt its grip based on the bowler's hand moisture levels. Using a material that reacts to humidity, the ball could provide a better grip for sweaty hands or a smoother finish for dry hands. This could help bowlers maintain control over their throws, improving their overall performance.",
    "**LED Light-Up Ball**: Develop a bowling ball that features built-in LED lights that illuminate during play. These lights could change colors based on the speed of the throw or the impact with the pins, adding a visual spectacle to the game. This could be particularly appealing for night bowling or special events, creating a more engaging and entertaining atmosphere.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate a bowling ball made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable composites or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and could lead to a new market segment. The ball could also come with a recycling program, encouraging users to return old balls for proper disposal or repurposing.",
    "**Personalized Design Options**: Offer a service where bowlers can design their own bowling balls with custom colors, patterns, and even images. Using a high-quality printing process, bowlers could express their individuality while maintaining the performance characteristics of the ball. This could be an attractive option for leagues or special events, allowing teams to showcase their unique identities."
