    "Changes in the publishing industry: The book industry has a significant impact on the global economy, with jobs and revenue generated through the publishing of books, sales, marketing and distribution. The decline of print books could have a major effect on this sector.",
    "Disruption to libraries and educational institutions: Libraries are an essential part of society, providing access to knowledge and education to millions of people around the world. As books disappear, libraries could experience a significant decline in visitors and may have to evolve in new and innovative ways to remain functional.",
    "Environmental concerns: The production, distribution and disposal of books contribute to a significant amount of waste and carbon emissions. The decline of print books could lead to less waste and a decrease in the environmental impact of the publishing industry.",
    "Increase in piracy: Since book piracy is a problem even at present, if books disappear entirely one might expect an increase. This could make it easier for people to access books that might otherwise be purchased, but it could also lead to copyright infringement and legal problems."
