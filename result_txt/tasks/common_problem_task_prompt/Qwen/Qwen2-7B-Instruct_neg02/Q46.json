    "**Incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Develop an AR-based navigation system that enhances the traditional GPS system used on public transportation. The idea is to overlay real-time data such as arrival times, vehicle locations, and traffic conditions directly onto the passenger's view through their smartphones or dedicated AR glasses. This would make it easier for passengers to navigate through unfamiliar routes and crowded areas.",
    "**Smart Bus Stops with Interactive Information Kiosks**: Create smart bus stops equipped with interactive information kiosks. These kiosks can provide passengers with real-time updates on bus schedules, weather forecasts, and even local news. They can also allow passengers to pay their fares digitally, check bus routes, and get directions to nearby destinations. This not only streamlines the boarding process but also adds a level of convenience for passengers.",
    "**Electric Vehicles with Solar Panels**: Integrate electric vehicles into the public transportation fleet, particularly those that run on solar power. By doing so, the city can reduce its carbon footprint significantly and demonstrate commitment to sustainability. Additionally, these vehicles could have solar panels on their roofs, which would help to charge them while they're parked during off-peak hours, further reducing energy costs.",
    "**Community Involvement and Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish regular forums where citizens can provide input on the public transportation system. This could include online surveys, town hall meetings, and suggestion boxes placed at various bus stops. By actively involving the community, the city can gather valuable insights about the needs and preferences of its residents, leading to more effective improvements.",
    "**Integration with Mobility Apps**: Partner with popular mobility apps to offer integrated services. For instance, the city could create a mobile app that connects with popular platforms like Uber, Lyft, or bike-sharing services. This would allow passengers to easily plan multi-modal trips, combining different forms of transportation to reach their destination efficiently. Additionally, the app could provide real-time data on traffic, parking availability, and public transport schedules, making urban navigation much smoother."
