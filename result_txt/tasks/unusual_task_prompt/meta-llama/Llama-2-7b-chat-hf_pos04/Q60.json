    "Clothes Hanger with Built-in Steamer: Create a clothes hanger with a built-in steamer function, allowing users to quickly and easily remove wrinkles from their clothes without the need for a separate steamer. This could be achieved through the use of a small, compact steamer unit that is integrated into the hanger, or through the use of a heating element that can be activated by a button or sensor.",
    "Smart Clothes Hanger with Sensors: Design a clothes hanger with sensors that can detect when a garment is put on or taken off, and adjust the hanger's position and angle accordingly. This could help to prevent wrinkles and creases, and could also provide a more organized and streamlined closet experience. Additionally, the sensors could be used to track the temperature and humidity of the closet, providing real-time data on the best conditions for storing clothes.",
    "Adjustable Clothes Hanger for Different Garment Types: Create a clothes hanger that can be adjusted to accommodate different types of garments, such as dresses, shirts, pants, and skirts. This could be achieved through the use of interchangeable clips or hooks that can be attached to the hanger, allowing users to customize the hanger for each type of garment. This could help to prevent wrinkles and creases, and could also make it easier to organize and hang clothes in a closet.",
    "Clothes Hanger with Built-in LED Lighting: Design a clothes hanger with built-in LED lighting that can be used to illuminate the garments being hung, making it easier to see any stains or damage. This could be particularly useful for people who are trying to identify stains or damage before putting their clothes away, or for those who simply want to be able to see their clothes more clearly. The LED lighting could be powered by a small battery or through induction, and could be adjusted to provide different levels of brightness.",
    "3D-Printed Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that is 3D printed using a flexible, durable material such as nylon or polycarbonate. This could provide a unique and modern look for the hanger,"
