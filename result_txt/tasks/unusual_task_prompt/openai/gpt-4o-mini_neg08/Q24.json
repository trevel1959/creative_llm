    "**Cleaning Small Crevices**: Toothbrushes are perfect for cleaning hard-to-reach places around the house. Use them to scrub dirt and grime from the edges of kitchen appliances, between the keys of a keyboard, or in the grooves of a car's dashboard. The bristles can get into tiny spaces where larger brushes can't.",
