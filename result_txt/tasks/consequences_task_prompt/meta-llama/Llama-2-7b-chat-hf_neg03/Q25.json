Cities will become overcrowded, leading to housing shortages, increased traffic congestion, and strain on public services such as healthcare and education. To mitigate these challenges, cities will need to adopt innovative solutions such as vertical farming, smart city technologies, and sustainable energy sources.",
    "Resource Scarcity: With a rapidly growing population, the demand for resources such as food, water, and energy will increase exponentially. This could lead to resource scarcity, particularly in areas with limited land and water availability. To address this challenge, governments and corporations will need to invest in sustainable resource management practices, such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and water conservation.",
    "Environmental Degradation: The doubling of the human population in ten years will result in increased environmental degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change. To mitigate these effects, governments and individuals will need to prioritize sustainable practices such as reforestation, reducing carbon emissions, and implementing circular economy principles.",
    "Economic Instability: The rapid growth of the population will put pressure on the global economy, leading to inflation, job shortages, and economic instability.
