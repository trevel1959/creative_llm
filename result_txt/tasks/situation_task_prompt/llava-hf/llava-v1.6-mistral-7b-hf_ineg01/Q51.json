    "Ferry Service: Implement a river ferry service using motorized boats that can transport people and vehicles across the river. The ferries would be scheduled to run on a regular basis and could be equipped with ramps for easy loading and unloading.",
    "Cable Suspension Bridge: Create a cable suspension bridge that uses strong cables and support towers to span the river. This bridge would be relatively easy to construct and could be assembled on-site using pre-fabricated components.",
    "Floating Platform: Develop a series of floating platforms that can be connected together to form a bridge. These platforms would be buoyant and could be anchored to the riverbed or attached to floating barges.",
    "Underwater Tunnel: Construct an underwater tunnel that would allow vehicles and pedestrians to cross the river without any interruption to the water surface. This tunnel would be designed to withstand the pressure of the water and could be constructed using pre-fabricated segments.",
    "Pontoon Bridge: Create a pontoon bridge using large, floating pontoons that can be linked together to form a bridge. This bridge would be easily deployable and could be moved to different locations as needed."
