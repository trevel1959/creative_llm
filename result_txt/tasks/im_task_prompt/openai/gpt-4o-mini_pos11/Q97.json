    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Design a leash that can be easily adjusted in length using a simple locking mechanism. This would allow owners to choose between a short length for control in crowded areas and a longer length for more freedom in open spaces. The leash could also feature a retractable design, allowing for easy storage and portability.",
    "**Reflective and LED Safety Features**: Enhance the visibility of the leash by incorporating reflective materials and LED lights. This would be especially beneficial for evening or early morning walks, ensuring that both the dog and the owner are visible to passing vehicles and other pedestrians. The LED lights could be set to different modes (steady, blinking) for varying visibility needs.",
    "**Built-in Treat Dispenser**: Create a leash that includes a small, detachable compartment for dog treats. This would allow owners to reward their dogs during walks without needing to carry extra items. The compartment could be designed to keep treats fresh and easily accessible, promoting positive reinforcement training on the go.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Comfort Grip**: Develop a leash with an ergonomically designed handle that includes a soft, non-slip grip. This would reduce strain on the owner's hand during long walks and provide better control over the dog. The handle could also include a built-in shock absorber to minimize the impact on the owner's wrist when the dog pulls.",
    "**Multi-functional Leash with Accessory Attachments**: Introduce a leash that comes with a variety of attachable accessories, such as a water bottle holder, poop bag dispenser, or a flashlight. This modular approach would allow owners to customize their leash according to their needs for different activities, such as hiking, running, or urban walking."
