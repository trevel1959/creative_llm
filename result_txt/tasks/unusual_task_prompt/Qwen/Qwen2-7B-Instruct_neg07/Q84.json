    "**Trash Can Recycling Station**: Create a multi-level recycling station for your trash can that categorizes waste into different bins for recyclables, compostable items, hazardous waste, and regular trash. This not only makes waste disposal more efficient but also encourages better environmental practices among users. The station could include labels or visual cues to guide users on what goes where.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with Sensor Technology**: Develop a smart trash can that uses sensors to automatically open when it detects an object being placed near it. This reduces the need for constant manual opening and closing, making it particularly useful in public spaces or offices where frequent use is common. It can also be equipped with additional features like waste level indicators, full-bin alerts, and even integrated recycling guides.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can Game**: Design a trash can that incorporates elements of a game, perhaps by having different compartments each associated with a point value based on how difficult it is to sort or recycle the item. Users could earn points for correctly disposing of waste, which could then be tracked and displayed. This gamification approach could make waste sorting fun and engaging, especially in schools or community centers.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags with Smart Tie System**: Introduce trash bags made from biodegradable materials that come with a built-in smart tie system. Users simply pull the bag down to fill it, and as they reach the bottom, the bag automatically ties itself shut, reducing the need for a separate trash tie or string. This idea is particularly efficient for those who are always on the go or in environments where quick and easy trash disposal is necessary.",
    "**Trash Can with Integrated Cleaning Function**: Develop a trash can that includes a small, automated cleaning mechanism that sprays water and cleans the inside of the can periodically or upon detection of a full bin. This prevents unpleasant odors and keeps the can hygienic, especially in high-traffic areas. The cleaning function could be powered by solar energy or other sustainable power sources to further enhance its eco-friendliness."
