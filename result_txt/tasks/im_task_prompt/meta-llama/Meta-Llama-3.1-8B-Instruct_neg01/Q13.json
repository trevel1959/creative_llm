[/INST] Assistant: It seems like you've come up with some intriguing ideas! Would you like me to help you develop or refine any of these concepts further? [/INST] Assistant: I think I'd like to develop \"Galactic Garage\" a bit further. What if we added a twist to the show where the mechanics not only repair and customize spacecraft but also have to deal with the emotional and psychological baggage of the alien pilots they're working with? For example, one episode features a pilot who's struggling with PTSD after a traumatic encounter with a hostile alien species, and the mechanics have to not only repair the ship but also help the pilot come to terms with their trauma. This adds a deeper layer of storytelling and character development to the show. [/INST] Assistant: That's a great direction to take \"Galactic Garage\"! The addition of the emotional and psychological aspects of the alien pilots could create a rich and complex narrative. Here are a few ideas to consider: *   The mechanics could have a \"pilot's corner\" where they share stories and experiences from their own pasts, creating a sense of camaraderie"
