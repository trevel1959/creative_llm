    "**Modular Design**: Create a sleeping bag with a modular system that allows users to attach or detach different sections based on their needs. For instance, during colder months, users could add an insulated foot compartment or an extra layer for the upper body. In warmer weather, they could detach the additional layers to create a lightweight bag. This would enhance versatility and cater to various camping conditions.",
    "**Integrated Mosquito Netting**: Design a sleeping bag with an integrated, detachable mosquito netting system. The netting could be rolled out from a hidden compartment and secured around the sleeping bag, providing protection from insects while still allowing for airflow. This feature would be particularly useful for campers in tropical regions or during the summer months when bugs are prevalent.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting**: Incorporate LED lights into the sleeping bag, strategically placed along the zippers or within the fabric. This would provide ambient lighting for nighttime activities, such as reading or finding gear in the dark, without needing a separate flashlight. The lights could be powered by a small, rechargeable battery, making it convenient for nighttime use.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Pockets**: Design a series of cleverly placed pockets within the sleeping bag that serve multiple purposes. For example, a pocket could hold a water bottle that also serves as an insulated compartment to keep drinks warm or cool. Another pocket could include a removable storage pouch for personal items like a phone, wallet, or snacks, keeping them secure and accessible without leaving the bag.",
    "**Self-Inflating System**: Introduce a self-inflating mechanism that allows the sleeping bag to expand automatically when unpacked. This could work using a combination of air chambers and a lightweight pump integrated into the design. Users would simply unroll the bag, and it would inflate to its full size without requiring manual effort, making setup quicker and easier."
