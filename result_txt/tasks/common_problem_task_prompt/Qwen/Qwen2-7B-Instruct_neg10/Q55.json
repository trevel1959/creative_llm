    "**Lack of Community Support**: Another problem might be the lack of community support and involvement. Without the active participation and support of local communities, the conservation park might struggle to achieve its goals effectively. This can affect not only funding but also the sustainability of the project and its acceptance by the local population.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Legal issues can be a major obstacle. Obtaining necessary permits, adhering to environmental laws, and navigating complex bureaucratic procedures are crucial. These can often be time-consuming and costly, potentially delaying the project or increasing costs.",
    "**Environmental Impact Assessment**: Conducting thorough environmental impact assessments (EIAs) can be a significant challenge. Ensuring that the development of the park does not harm the ecosystem, wildlife, and habitats is essential. This requires expertise in ecology, biology, and environmental science, which can be difficult to secure or fund.",
    "**Balancing Conservation and Tourism**: Balancing the need for conservation with tourism development can be tricky. Too much focus on tourism might lead to degradation of the natural environment and loss of biodiversity. On the other hand, too little attention to tourism could mean reduced revenue for the park and limited opportunities for education and awareness.",
    "**Threats from Illegal Activities**: Wildlife poaching, illegal logging, and other forms of illegal activities pose serious threats to the conservation park. Protecting the park from such threats requires robust law enforcement and monitoring systems, which can be expensive and resource-intensive."
