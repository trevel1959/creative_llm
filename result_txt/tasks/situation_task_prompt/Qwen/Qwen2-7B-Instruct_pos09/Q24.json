    "**Enhanced Tactile Sensory Aids**: In a world without glasses or contacts, people might develop enhanced tactile sensory aids that help them navigate their environment safely. This could involve using vibrations, heat sensors, or other forms of sensory feedback to detect obstacles, textures, and distances. For instance, individuals could wear gloves equipped with micro-vibrators that adjust intensity based on the distance to an object.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Environments**: With the advent of advanced AR technology, a visual overlay could be projected onto the user's field of view, compensating for poor vision. These overlays might include text-to-speech features, magnification tools, and even predictive navigation systems that guide users through their surroundings by indicating the location of obstacles or specific points of interest.",
    "**Advanced Braille and Tactile Communication**: For those who are blind or have significantly impaired vision, advanced braille systems could be developed to aid in reading and writing. These might include haptic keyboards, braille displays that can project words and numbers into tactile form, and wearable devices that interpret speech and convert it into braille for immediate feedback.",
    "**Neural Interface Devices**: In a future where traditional vision correction is not possible, neural interface devices could provide a new way for people to perceive their environment. These devices might use non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to translate visual information captured by cameras worn on eyeglasses into electrical signals that stimulate the brain's visual cortex. This would allow users to perceive visual data directly, bypassing the need for physical eyesight.",
    "**Collaborative Community Support Systems**: People with poor vision might rely more heavily on community support and technology-assisted learning. Specialized apps and online platforms could facilitate group learning sessions, peer-to-peer mentoring, and collaborative problem-solving. These systems could include features like shared virtual reality experiences, real-time text translation, and audio descriptions of images and videos, enabling a more inclusive and supportive environment for all."
