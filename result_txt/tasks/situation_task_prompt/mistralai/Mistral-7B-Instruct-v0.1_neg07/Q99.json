    "Texture: Even if objects lose their color, they still have unique textures that can help differentiate them. For example, a smooth and shiny object may be a phone, while a rough and textured object may be a rock.",
    "Shape: Shape is another important characteristic that can help differentiate between objects. For example, a sphere may be a ball, while a cylinder may be a pen.",
    "Size: Size is a simple yet effective way to differentiate between objects. For example, a small and round object may be a button, while a larger and flat object may be a keyboard.",
    "Sound: Even if objects lose their color and texture, they still make sounds that can help differentiate them. For example, a metal object may make a ringing sound when struck, while a rubber object may make a squishy sound.",
    "Light reflection: Even if objects lose their color, they still reflect light differently based on their shape and texture. For example, a shiny object may reflect light in a bright and clear way, while a rough object may reflect light in a dull and muted way."
