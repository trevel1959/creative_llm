    "**Film Selection and Curation**: Choosing the right films that will attract an audience and represent a variety of genres and styles can be a daunting task. There may be conflicts over which films to include, especially if there are submissions from local filmmakers. To mitigate this, forming a diverse selection committee can help ensure that a range of perspectives is considered, and a transparent voting process can be established to finalize the lineup.",
    "**Sponsorship and Funding**: Securing enough funding to cover costs such as venue rental, marketing, and equipment can be a major hurdle. If sponsorships fall through, the festival may struggle to stay afloat financially. To address this, organizers can create a tiered sponsorship package that offers varying levels of visibility and benefits, encouraging local businesses and larger companies to invest in the festival.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**: Attracting an audience to the festival is crucial for its success. If marketing efforts are insufficient or poorly targeted, attendance may be lower than expected. To combat this, a comprehensive marketing strategy should be developed, utilizing social media, partnerships with local influencers, and community outreach to build excitement and awareness well in advance of the event.",
    "**Technical Issues During Screenings**: On the day of the festival, technical difficulties such as equipment failure or poor sound quality can disrupt screenings and lead to a negative experience for attendees. To minimize these risks, itâ€™s essential to conduct thorough technical rehearsals before the event, have backup equipment on hand, and ensure that technical staff are well-trained and prepared for any issues that may arise.",
    "**Networking and Industry Connections**: One of the key benefits of attending a film festival is the opportunity for filmmakers to network with industry professionals. If there are not enough opportunities for networking, or if attendees feel excluded from these interactions, it can diminish the overall experience. To enhance networking opportunities, organizers can host panels, Q&A sessions, and social events that encourage mingling among filmmakers, industry experts, and attendees."
