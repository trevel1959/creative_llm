    "In a sunlit savanna, a young cheetah named Zara was born with a peculiar condition—she couldn’t run. While her siblings sprinted gracefully, Zara watched from the grass, feeling left out. One day, a fierce storm threatened the herd of antelope nearby. Instead of fleeing, Zara used her keen eyesight and knowledge of the land to guide her family to safety, finding hidden paths and secret waterholes. The cheetahs learned that speed wasn’t everything; Zara’s wisdom and courage saved them. From that day on, she became the heart of the pack, proving that true strength lies in more than just speed.",
