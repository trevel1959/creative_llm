    "Water Purification: Another option is to purify water through various filtration and disinfection processes. This can be done using water filters, UV light disinfection, or even boiling the water to kill bacteria and viruses. Although this method may not be as effective as desalination, it can be a practical solution for small-scale use.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: If the water pollution problem is localized, rainwater harvesting can be an effective solution. This involves collecting rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces and storing it in tanks or other containers for later use. This method can be particularly useful in areas with regular rainfall, as it provides a sustainable and cost-effective source of clean drinking water.",
    "Water Recycling: In some cases, wastewater can be treated and recycled for reuse. This process involves removing contaminants and pollutants from the wastewater through various filtration and disinfection methods. The treated water can then be used for drinking, cooking, or other household needs.",
    "Water Delivery: In areas where water sources are scarce or contaminated, water delivery services can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water. These services can deliver water in bottles, jugs, or even tanker trucks to households or communities in need.",
    "Emergency Water Storage: Governments and non-governmental organizations can invest in emergency water storage facilities. These facilities can store large volumes of water and provide a reliable source of clean drinking water in times of crisis, such as natural disasters or water supply disruptions."
