    "Language learning: Create earplugs that can help language learners improve their listening skills by providing real-time translations of conversations in the user's surroundings. This could be particularly useful for travelers who want to practice their language skills while on the go.",
    "Smart hearing protection: Develop earplugs that can monitor the user's hearing health and provide real-time feedback on noise exposure levels. This could help individuals identify potential hearing damage and take necessary steps to protect their hearing.",
    "Augmented reality experiences: Create earplugs that can provide an immersive augmented reality experience, such as virtual tours of museums, historical sites, or other destinations.
