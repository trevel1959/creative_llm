    "Create a clock that can speak and tell time in a unique way. Instead of displaying numbers, the clock has a series of animal figurines that move around a circular face to indicate the time. For example, a rabbit might move clockwise for hours, a bird might move counterclockwise for minutes, and a fish might swim across the face for seconds. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Design a clock that can change its face to match the user's mood. The clock has a series of interchangeable faces with different designs, colors, and patterns. When the user sets a specific mood, the clock will automatically switch to a face that matches their emotions. For example, if the user sets the mood to \"relaxed,\" the clock might display a face with a soothing ocean scene. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Create a clock that can predict the weather based on the user's location and time of day. The clock has a built-in weather forecasting system that uses data from the user's location and the current time to predict the weather for the day. For example, if it's 6am on a Monday in New York, the clock might display a forecast of \"mostly sunny with a high of 60 degrees.\" (Confidence Score: 0.7)",
    "Design a clock that can adjust its time based on the user's circadian rhythms. The clock has a built-in sleep tracking system that monitors the user's sleep patterns and adjusts the time accordingly. For example, if the user tends to wake up earlier on weekends, the clock might automatically shift the time forward by 30 minutes. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Create a clock that can create a personalized soundtrack for the user's day. The clock has a built-in music synthesizer that generates a unique soundtrack based on the user's schedule and preferences. For example, if the user has a meeting at 10am, the clock might generate a more energetic and motivational soundtrack to help the user get ready. (Confidence Score: 0.9)"
