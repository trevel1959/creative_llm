    "**Pest Management**: Organic farms must deal with pests without the use of synthetic pesticides. A potential problem is the introduction of invasive species that can harm crops. Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, such as companion planting or introducing natural predators, is crucial. Failure to effectively manage pests can result in significant crop loss.",
    "**Water Supply and Irrigation**: Access to a reliable water supply is vital for any farm. Problems may arise if there is insufficient rainfall or if the water source is contaminated. Additionally, improper irrigation methods can lead to soil erosion or waterlogging. Establishing a sustainable irrigation system that conserves water and supports crop health is necessary to mitigate these issues.",
    "**Market Access and Pricing**: Once the crops are ready for harvest, farmers may face challenges in accessing markets or setting competitive prices. Problems can arise if there are limited local markets for organic produce or if larger commercial farms dominate the market. Building relationships with local grocery stores, farmers' markets, and restaurants can help ensure that the produce reaches consumers effectively.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Organic farming is subject to specific regulations and certification processes. A potential problem is navigating these regulations, which can be complex and time-consuming. Failure to comply with organic standards can lead to loss of certification and market access. Itâ€™s important to stay informed about the requirements and work with certifying bodies to maintain compliance.",
    "**Crop Diversity and Rotation**: Relying too heavily on a single crop can lead to soil depletion and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases. A potential issue is the lack of crop rotation or diversity, which can negatively impact long-term sustainability. Implementing a crop rotation plan that includes a variety of plants can improve soil health and reduce pest pressures."
