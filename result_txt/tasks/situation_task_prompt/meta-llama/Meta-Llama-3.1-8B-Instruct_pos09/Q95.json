    "**Inflatable Headrest**: Design a portable, compact inflatable device that can be placed under a person's head while sleeping. This inflatable headrest would provide the necessary support and comfort, allowing individuals to rest their heads comfortably even without pillows. The inflatable device could be made of a soft, breathable material and could be easily deflated and stored when not in use.",
    "**Customizable Sleeping Platform**: Develop a sleeping platform that can be adjusted to different heights and angles to accommodate various sleeping positions. This platform would have a soft, cushioned surface and could be equipped with built-in massage features or temperature control to enhance the sleeping experience. The platform could be made of a durable, easy-to-clean material and could be designed to fit snugly into a bed frame or used as a standalone sleeping surface.",
    "**Smart Head Support**: Create a wearable head support device that uses AI-powered sensors to detect the user's head position and adjust the support accordingly. This device would be a lightweight, wearable headband or band that could be easily put on and taken off. The AI-powered sensors would detect the user's head position and adjust the support to provide optimal comfort and support.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Sleeping Surface**: Design a sleeping surface that uses a combination of magnets and a specialized material to create a \"floating\" effect, allowing the user to rest their head comfortably without feeling the weight of the pillow. This surface would be made of a soft, breathable material and could be equipped with built-in temperature control or massage features to enhance the sleeping experience.",
    "**Adaptive Sleeping Cushion**: Develop a sleeping cushion that can adapt to the user's head shape and size, providing customized support and comfort. This cushion would be made of a soft, flexible material that can be molded to fit the user's head, and could be equipped with built-in sensors to detect the user's head position and adjust the support accordingly. The cushion could be designed to be used in conjunction with a traditional pillow or as a standalone sleeping surface.
