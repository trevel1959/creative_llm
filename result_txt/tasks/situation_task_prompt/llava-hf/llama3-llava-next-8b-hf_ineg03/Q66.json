    "Modular construction: Modular construction involves prefabricating building components off-site and then assembling them on-site. This method would be particularly useful in the absence of natural materials, as it allows for greater control over the quality and consistency of the materials used.",
    "3D printing: With the absence of natural materials, 3D printing could become a viable option for constructing houses. 3D printing technology allows for the creation of complex shapes and structures from digital designs, using a wide variety of materials.",
    "Space frames: Space frames are lightweight structures made of interconnected metal components. They can be used to create the framework of a house, and then covered with a variety of materials such as composite materials or advanced polymers.",
    "Floating foundations: Floating foundations involve constructing a house on a floating platform rather than traditional pilings or foundations. This method would allow for the use of advanced materials such as floating concrete or composite materials to create a stable and durable structure.",
    "In-situ concrete: In-situ concrete involves creating concrete structures on-site, rather than pre-fabricating them. This method would allow for the use of advanced concrete mixtures and curing techniques to create structures that are both durable and energy-efficient."
