    "Competition from non-vegan chains: Other fast food chains may try to compete with the new vegan chain by offering their own vegan options, potentially diluting the market share of the new chain.",
    "Limited availability of vegan-friendly food trucks: Depending on the location and size of the fast food chain, there may be a lack of vegan-friendly food trucks available for catering or pop-up events, limiting the chain's ability to expand its offerings.",
    "Nutritional deficiencies: A vegan diet can be nutritionally incomplete if not planned properly, leading to potential health issues for customers who rely solely on the chain's offerings.",
    "Cost control: As the chain grows, it may be challenging to maintain quality and pricing while also keeping costs under control, potentially leading to lower profit margins.",
    "Sustainability concerns: The production and disposal of fast food packaging can have a significant environmental impact, which may be difficult to mitigate without a comprehensive sustainability plan."
