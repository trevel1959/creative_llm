    "**Gesture-Controlled Zoom and Focus**: Develop a camera with built-in gesture recognition technology, allowing photographers to control zoom and focus with hand movements. This feature would enable a more fluid shooting experience, particularly in dynamic environments where traditional controls may be cumbersome. For instance, a simple hand swipe could zoom in or out, while a pinch gesture could adjust focus.",
    "**Integrated Storytelling Mode**: Create a mode that allows users to record short video clips and automatically compiles them into a narrative format. The camera would analyze the footage, select the best moments, and add transitions, music, and effects to create a polished mini-movie. This feature would appeal to social media users looking to share their experiences in an engaging way.",
    "**Smart Environment Recognition**: Implement technology that recognizes different environments (landscapes, portraits, night scenes) and automatically adjusts settings like exposure, ISO, and white balance. This feature would help amateur photographers achieve professional-quality results without needing extensive knowledge of camera settings, making photography more accessible to everyone.",
    "**Mood Lighting Integration**: Design a camera with built-in adjustable LED lighting that can simulate different moods or settings. Photographers could choose from various color temperatures and intensities to enhance their shots, whether they want a warm sunset glow or a cool, dramatic effect. This would be particularly useful for portrait photography or product shoots.",
    "**Interactive Photography Workshops**: Equip the camera with an interactive tutorial mode that guides users through various photography techniques. This could include step-by-step lessons on capturing motion, adjusting lighting, or using different lenses. The camera could provide real-time feedback on the userâ€™s performance, helping them improve their skills while they shoot."
