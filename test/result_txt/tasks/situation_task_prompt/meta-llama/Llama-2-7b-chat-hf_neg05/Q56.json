    "Use a Reflection Amplifier: Develop a device that can amplify the light around the user, allowing them to see their reflection even without mirrors. This device could work by magnifying the light from the surrounding environment, making the user's reflection visible.",
    "Create a Virtual Mirror: Develop an AI-powered virtual mirror that can project a 3D image of the user's reflection onto a surface. This could be achieved through the use of a depth sensor and a projector, allowing the user to see their reflection in a virtual environment.",
    "Harness the Power of Water: Use water as a medium to see one's reflection. Develop a device that can create a small pool of water on the user's body, allowing them to see their reflection in the water. This could be achieved through the use of a specialized surface that can hold water, such as a hydrophobic material.",
    "Utilize the Human Mind: Develop a technique that allows the user to see their reflection through the power of their own mind. This could involve using brain-computer interfaces to create a mental image of the user's reflection, allowing them to see themselves without the need for any physical medium.",
    "Create a Holographic Reflection: Develop a holographic display that can project a 3D image of the user's reflection into space. This could be achieved through the use of lasers and holographic technology, allowing the user to see their reflection in a fully immersive and interactive environment."
