    "Water Filtration Bicycles: Develop a bicycle that can filter water as you pedal, providing clean drinking water to communities in developing countries. The bicycle would be equipped with a filtration system that uses activated carbon, ceramic filters, or UV light to remove contaminants and bacteria from water. This innovative solution would provide a sustainable and mobile way to purify water in remote areas.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Distillation: Create a solar-powered still that can distill seawater or contaminated water into clean drinking water. The still would use the heat of the sun to vaporize the water, and then condense it back into a clean and pure form. This technology would be particularly useful in coastal areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "Vertical Aquifer Storage: Develop a system that uses vertical aquifers to store clean water underground, providing a sustainable and reliable source of water for communities in developing countries. The system would involve digging wells or boreholes in areas with high water tables, and then lining them with a durable material to prevent contamination. The water would be pumped up from the aquifer and distributed to communities through a network of pipes.",
    "Water-Saving Showerheads: Create showerheads that use advanced technology to reduce water usage by up to 50%. The showerheads would use a combination of aerodynamics and water-saving nozzles to reduce the amount of water needed for a shower, while still providing a satisfying and comfortable experience. This innovation would be particularly effective in areas where water is scarce, and could help reduce the strain on local water supplies.",
    "Mobile Water Purification Units: Develop a series of mobile units that can be deployed in emergency situations to purify water in remote areas. The units would use advanced filtration technology, such as UV light or ceramic filters, to remove contaminants and bacteria from water. This would provide a reliable source of clean water for communities affected by natural disasters or conflict, where access to clean water is often limited."
