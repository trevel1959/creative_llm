    "**Hair Shield Helmet**: Develop a wearable, lightweight helmet with a built-in, breathable mesh that allows for airflow while protecting the scalp from the sun. The mesh would be treated with a UV-blocking material, ensuring the scalp remains protected without overheating. The helmet could also have a built-in cooling system, using evaporative cooling or phase-change materials to keep the head cool in hot weather. The design could be sleek and aerodynamic, making it suitable for both casual and athletic use.",
    "**Scalp Sunscreen**: Create a highly concentrated, water-based sunscreen specifically designed for the scalp. This sunscreen would be formulated to provide long-lasting protection against UVA and UVB rays, while also being gentle on the scalp and hair follicles. It could be applied directly to the scalp, ensuring even coverage and minimizing the risk of sunburn. The sunscreen could also be infused with soothing ingredients, such as aloe vera or tea tree oil, to calm and moisturize the scalp.",
    "**Hair Regrowth Helmet with UV Protection**: Design a helmet that not only protects the scalp from sunburn but also stimulates hair growth. The helmet would incorporate low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or photobiomodulation (PBM) to promote hair growth, while also providing UV protection through a built-in, transparent visor or mesh. This helmet could be a game-changer for individuals experiencing hair loss due to sun damage or other factors.",
    "**Scalp Umbrella**: Invent a wearable, collapsible umbrella that can be attached to a headband or a hat. This umbrella would provide instant shade for the scalp, protecting it from the sun's harsh rays. The umbrella could be made from a lightweight, waterproof material and feature a compact design that allows for easy storage and transportation. It could also be equipped with a built-in sunscreen or a cooling system to enhance its protective capabilities.",
    "**Hair Growth Cap with Built-in Sunscreen**: Develop a cap or hat with a built-in, breathable mesh that allows for airflow while protecting the scalp from the sun. The mesh would be treated with a UV-blocking material, ensuring the scalp remains protected without overheating. The cap could also incorporate a built-in sunscreen or a cooling system, using evaporative cooling or phase-change materials to keep the head cool in hot weather. Additionally, the cap could feature a built-in, gentle massage function to stimulate hair growth and promote a healthy scalp. [/INST] "
