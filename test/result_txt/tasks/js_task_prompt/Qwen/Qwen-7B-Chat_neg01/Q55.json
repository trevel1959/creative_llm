    "\"Suppose you could see sound waves. How would they look like? Would high-pitched notes be bright and colorful like lightning or low-pitched notes be dark and muted like shadows?\"",
    "\"Suppose you could speak in any language. How would it sound? Would English be clear and concise like a stream or Chinese be complex and ornate like a river?\"",
    "\"Suppose you could fly without wings. How would it feel?"
