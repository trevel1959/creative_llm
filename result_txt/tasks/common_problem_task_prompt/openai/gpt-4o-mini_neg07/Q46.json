    "**Funding and Budget Constraints**: Securing adequate funding is a common challenge in public transportation projects. Budget overruns can occur due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the need for additional construction work or inflation. Additionally, public opposition to tax increases or reallocating funds from other essential services can hinder the financial support needed for the overhaul.",
    "**Community Resistance**: Residents may resist changes to the public transportation system, particularly if they perceive that it will disrupt their daily lives. Concerns about increased traffic, noise, or changes in neighborhood character can lead to public protests or pushback from local businesses, complicating the implementation process.",
    "**Technological Integration**: Introducing new technologies, such as smart ticketing systems or real-time tracking apps, may face hurdles. Issues such as data privacy, the digital divide (where some populations may not have access to the necessary technology), and integration with existing systems can create challenges that slow down progress.",
    "**Environmental Concerns**: While overhauling the transportation system may aim to be more sustainable, it can inadvertently lead to environmental issues. Construction activities can disrupt local ecosystems, increase pollution, and contribute to waste. Additionally, if the new system does not significantly reduce carbon emissions, it may face criticism from environmental advocates.",
    "**Operational Challenges**: Transitioning to a new system may create operational challenges, such as training staff on new equipment or procedures, scheduling conflicts, and ensuring safety protocols are updated and followed. If these challenges are not managed effectively, it could lead to service disruptions and public dissatisfaction."
