    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Create a computer mouse equipped with health monitoring features. It could track metrics like hand movement, grip strength, and even pulse rate through built-in sensors. This data could be synced with a mobile app to provide insights into the user's ergonomics and suggest breaks or exercises to prevent repetitive strain injuries. The mouse could vibrate gently as a reminder to take breaks or change positions, promoting healthier computer usage habits.",
    "**Customizable LED Feedback**: Introduce a computer mouse with customizable LED lights that provide feedback based on usage. For example, the color could change to indicate different modes (e.g., gaming, productivity, browsing) or even signal notifications from apps (like emails or messages). Users could personalize the colors and patterns, turning the mouse into a visual extension of their personality and workflow preferences.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with Smart Gestures**: Develop a mouse that incorporates gesture recognition technology, allowing users to perform various functions with simple hand movements. For instance, a flick of the wrist could switch between applications, while a circular motion could scroll through documents. This would reduce the need for multiple clicks and enhance multitasking efficiency, especially for creative professionals who often juggle different software.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Design a computer mouse made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. The manufacturing process could also be optimized to reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, the mouse could be modular, allowing users to replace specific parts (like buttons or the scroll wheel) rather than discarding the entire device when it wears out. This eco-conscious approach would appeal to environmentally aware consumers.",
    "**Wireless Charging Dock with Storage**: Create a computer mouse that comes with a sleek wireless charging dock that doubles as a storage unit for small office supplies (like paper clips or USB drives). The dock would have an integrated power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. This all-in-one solution would help declutter workspaces while ensuring that the mouse is always charged and ready for use."
