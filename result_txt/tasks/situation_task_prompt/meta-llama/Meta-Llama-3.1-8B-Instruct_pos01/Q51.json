    "**Water Walker Shoes**: Develop shoes with a water-repellent membrane and a series of inflatable bladders that allow the wearer to walk on water. The shoes would be equipped with a micro-adjustable system to maintain stability and prevent sinking. This innovative footwear would enable people to cross rivers safely and efficiently. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Inflatable Raft Canopy**: Design a portable, inflatable canopy that can be attached to a makeshift raft or a floating platform. The canopy would provide shade, protection from the elements, and a sense of security while navigating the river. It could also be used as a signaling device to attract attention in case of an emergency. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**River-Swimming Assistive Technology**: Create a wearable device that uses AI-powered sensors to detect the river's currents and provide real-time guidance to the user. The device would be equipped with a propulsion system, such as a small propeller or a water jet, to assist the user in swimming against the current. This technology would be particularly useful for people with mobility impairments. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Portable, Foldable Bridge**: Design a compact, foldable bridge made from lightweight, durable materials such as aluminum or carbon fiber. The bridge would be easy to transport and assemble, allowing people to quickly set up a crossing point in emergency situations. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "**Aerial River Crossing**: Develop a drone-based system that can transport people across the river using a network of aerial platforms or \"sky bridges.\" The drones would be equipped with advanced navigation systems and safety features to ensure a smooth and secure crossing experience. Confidence score: 0.5"
