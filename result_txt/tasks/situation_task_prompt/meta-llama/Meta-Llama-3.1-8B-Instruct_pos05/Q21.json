    "**Community-Led Information Hubs**: In the event of a global internet crash, communities would come together to establish local information hubs. These hubs would be physical spaces where people could gather to access and share information, using traditional methods such as books, maps, and printed newspapers. These hubs would also serve as centers for skill-sharing, where people could learn new skills and trade knowledge with one another. For example, a community might set up a library with a vast collection of books, or create a network of messengers who could carry information between different parts of the city.",
    "**Augmented Reality Scavenger Hunt**: In the absence of the internet, people could use augmented reality (AR) technology to create a scavenger hunt that would allow them to access information. This could be done by creating a series of physical markers or QR codes that, when scanned, would trigger an AR experience that provides information on a particular topic. For example, a person might scan a QR code on a street sign to learn about the history of the area, or scan a marker on a book to get information about the author.",
    "**Radio Broadcasting**: Radio broadcasting could become a vital means of accessing information in a post-internet world. Community radio stations could be established to broadcast news, educational programs, and other types of information. People could tune in to these stations using traditional radios or mobile devices that don't rely on the internet. This would allow people to stay informed and educated, even in the absence of the internet.",
    "**Personalized Information Networks**: In the event of a global internet crash, people could create their own personalized information networks using a combination of physical and digital tools. For example, a person might use a paper notebook to record information they come across, and then use a mobile device to scan the notebook and access the information digitally. This would allow people to create their own personal information networks, even in the absence of the internet.",
    "**Public Art Installations**: Public art installations could be used to convey information in a post-internet world. For example, a city might create a series of murals that provide information about local history, culture, and events. These murals could be designed to be interactive, allowing people to scan a QR code or use a mobile device to access additional information. This would allow people to access information in a visually engaging and interactive way, even in the absence of the internet. [/INST] "
