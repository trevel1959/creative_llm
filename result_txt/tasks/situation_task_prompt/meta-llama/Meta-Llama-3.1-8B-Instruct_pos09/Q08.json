    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that can extract clean drinking water from the air, even in arid regions. This technology uses condensation to collect water vapor from the atmosphere, which can then be filtered and purified for consumption. The system could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, making it a sustainable solution for clean drinking water.",
    "**Underground Water Storage**: Create a network of underground water storage tanks that can be used to collect and store rainwater during periods of high precipitation. This water can then be filtered and distributed to communities in need. The tanks could be designed to be self-sustaining, with built-in filtration systems and aeration to maintain water quality.",
    "**Solar Still**: Design a portable, solar-powered still that can be used to purify water in the field. The still would use the sun's heat to evaporate water from a contaminated source, which would then be collected and condensed back into clean drinking water. This technology could be particularly useful for emergency response situations or in areas where access to clean water is limited.",
    "**Artificial Wetlands**: Develop a system of artificial wetlands that can be used to filter and purify water. These wetlands would be designed to mimic the natural processes of a wetland ecosystem, using plants and microorganisms to break down pollutants and contaminants. The purified water could then be collected and distributed to communities in need.",
    "**Desalination using Bio-Inspired Membranes**: Create a new type of membrane that uses bio-inspired materials to remove salt and other impurities from seawater or brackish water. This technology would be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional desalination methods, making it a viable solution for communities that rely on seawater or brackish water sources. The membrane could be designed to be scalable and adaptable to different water sources and treatment needs.
