    "**Lumina Luggage**: Design a smart suitcase with a built-in, rechargeable flashlight that doubles as a power bank to charge your devices on the go. The flashlight could have adjustable brightness levels and a red light mode to preserve night vision. To make it even more convenient, the suitcase could have a built-in USB port and a wireless charging pad on the lid. The suitcase's exterior could be designed with a reflective material to increase visibility in low-light conditions. When the suitcase is closed, the flashlight could automatically turn off to conserve battery life.",
    "**Glowing Gauntlets**: Develop a pair of wearable, high-visibility gloves with built-in LED lights that provide illumination for hands while walking, hiking, or working in low-light environments. The gloves could have adjustable light settings, including a strobe mode for increased visibility in emergency situations. The lights could be powered by rechargeable batteries or even harvested from kinetic energy generated by the wearer's movements. The gloves could also have built-in touch-sensitive controls to adjust light settings or trigger emergency alerts.",
    "**Lumina Locks**: Design a smart door lock with a built-in, motion-sensing flashlight that illuminates the surrounding area when approached. The lock could have a fingerprint reader or facial recognition system for secure access, and the flashlight could be programmed to turn on and off based on the user's schedule or activity levels. The lock could also have a built-in camera and microphone to capture and record footage of potential intruders. The flashlight could be powered by a rechargeable battery or even solar panels integrated into the lock's design.",
    "**Glowing Grills**: Develop a smart, high-visibility grill mat that provides illumination for cooking and grilling in low-light conditions. The mat could have adjustable light settings, including a red light mode to preserve night vision. The lights could be powered by rechargeable batteries or even harvested from kinetic energy generated by the grill's movement. The mat could also have built-in temperature sensors and a wireless connectivity option to monitor cooking progress and receive notifications when food is ready.",
    "**Lumina Lanterns**: Design a smart, portable lantern that provides adjustable light levels and a range of color options to suit different environments and activities. The lantern could have a built-in power bank to charge devices on the go and a wireless charging pad for convenience. The lantern could also have a built-in speaker and microphone for playing music or making hands-free calls. The lantern could be powered by a rechargeable battery or even solar panels"
