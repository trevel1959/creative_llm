    "Sunlight Harvesting: Use solar-powered windows to harness natural light during the day and store it in a specialized light-emitting panel. This would allow the room to be lit naturally during the night, reducing the need for artificial light sources.",
    "Bioluminescent Decor: Incorporate bioluminescent plants or fungi into the room's decor, such as moss, glowing mushrooms, or luminescent flowers. These organisms would emit a soft, natural light, providing a soothing ambiance without the need for electricity.",
    "Mirror-based Illumination: Use mirrors to reflect light from a single source, such as a candle or lantern, to create a diffused and ambient lighting effect throughout the room. This would not only conserve energy but also create a visually striking ambiance.",
    "Fireplace Lighting: In colder climates, use a fireplace as a primary source of light during the night. Not only would it provide warmth, but the flickering flames would also create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.",
    "Glowing Paint: Utilize special glow-in-the-dark paint to cover the walls, ceiling, or furniture. This would provide a soft, ambient light without the need for any external sources, making it an eco-friendly and sustainable option for lighting a room at night."
