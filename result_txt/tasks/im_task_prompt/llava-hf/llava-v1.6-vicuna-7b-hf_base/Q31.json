    "Optical Zoom: The camera could be equipped with an optical zoom lens that provides a larger zoom range and better image quality. This would allow users to get closer to their subjects without sacrificing image quality.",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Enhancements: The camera could use AI to automatically adjust settings such as exposure, focus, and sharpness in real-time. This would make it easier for users to take great photos without having to adjust settings manually.",
    "Shock Resistance: The camera could be made with materials that are more resistant to shocks and vibrations, such as stainless steel and shatter-resistant glass. This would help ensure that the camera remains in good condition even when it is being used by people who are rambunctious or who are in rough environments.",
    "Weather Protection: The camera could be designed with several weather-resistant features, such as a rubberized body and gaskets around ports and buttons. This would keep the camera protected from water, dust, and other environmental factors that could damage it.",
    "Gimbal Mount: The camera could be equipped with a gimbal mount that allows it to be attached to a stabilizing gimbal for more steady and shake-free video footage. This would be especially useful for users who want to take videos while walking or moving around."
