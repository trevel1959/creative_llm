    "**Innovative Modular Design:** You could create a modular house made of recycled plastics, metal, and glass. Each module would be self-contained and could be arranged to suit the space available. These modules could include living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc., all designed for maximum efficiency and sustainability. They could also be easily disassembled and relocated if needed.",
    "**Aquaponic and Vertical Farming:** If traditional materials are unavailable, you could build a house that incorporates vertical farming and aquaponics. This would allow you to grow your own food, even in a remote location. The house could have layers of vertically stacked growing beds with fish tanks below, providing a sustainable food source while using minimal land. The fish waste would fertilize the plants above, creating a closed-loop ecosystem.",
    "**Biodegradable Materials:** In the absence of natural materials, you could utilize biodegradable substances such as hemp, bamboo, and recycled fabrics. These materials can be woven together or molded into various shapes for building walls, floors, and roofs. Hemp, for instance, is incredibly strong and durable, while bamboo offers a lightweight yet sturdy option. Recycled fabrics could serve as insulation or be used to create decorative elements.",
    "**Sustainable Water Collection and Recycling:** Given the scarcity of natural resources, you could design a house that collects and recycles water. Rainwater harvesting systems could be installed to collect rainwater for use in irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable applications. Greywater recycling systems could treat and reuse water from sinks, showers, and washing machines for reuse within the home.",
    "**Solar-Powered and Wind Turbine Integration:** With an emphasis on renewable energy, you could build a house powered entirely by solar panels and wind turbines. Solar panels would cover the roof and sides of the house, converting sunlight into electricity. Wind turbines, placed either on the rooftop or integrated into the design of the house, would generate additional power. Battery storage systems would ensure a continuous supply of electricity, even during cloudy days or periods without wind."
