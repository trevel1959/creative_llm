    "**Public Safety Hazards**: Zoos must prioritize the safety of both visitors and staff. Potential problems include escape of animals, improper handling during feeding or cleaning, and accidents involving visitors. Effective training for staff, robust enclosures, and emergency protocols are essential to mitigate these risks. Regular safety drills and public education on how to behave around animals can further enhance safety.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Many zoos face challenges related to funding, particularly if they rely heavily on ticket sales and donations. Economic downturns can lead to reduced visitor numbers and financial strain. To address this, zoos can explore alternative revenue streams such as partnerships with local businesses, hosting events, and offering educational programs that attract school groups and community organizations.",
    "**Conservation Ethics**: Zoos often face scrutiny regarding their role in conservation. Critics argue that keeping animals in captivity is inherently unethical, regardless of breeding programs or rehabilitation efforts. To counter this perception, zoos must actively engage in and promote conservation initiatives, participate in wildlife rescue efforts, and educate the public about the importance of biodiversity and habitat preservation.",
    "**Visitor Engagement and Education**: Ensuring that visitors leave the zoo with a meaningful experience can be challenging. If exhibits are not engaging or informative, visitors may feel disappointed or disconnected. To enhance visitor engagement, zoos can incorporate interactive exhibits, virtual reality experiences, and guided tours that provide deeper insights into animal behavior and conservation efforts.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: A zoo's success heavily relies on the expertise and passion of its staff. High turnover rates can lead to inconsistencies in animal care and visitor experience. To combat this, zoos should invest in comprehensive training programs, professional development opportunities, and employee wellness initiatives. Creating a positive workplace culture that values teamwork and growth can help retain skilled staff."
