    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex landscape of regulations and international treaties. Issues can arise from not obtaining the necessary licenses from government agencies, leading to potential legal consequences or launch delays. Additionally, international regulations regarding space debris and frequency allocation must be adhered to, complicating the launch process.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The costs associated with satellite launches can escalate quickly due to unforeseen circumstances, such as delays, design changes, or increased material costs. Budget overruns can threaten the viability of the entire project, leading to cutbacks in mission objectives or the need for additional funding, which may not be readily available.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The launch of rockets can have environmental consequences, including noise pollution, chemical emissions, and potential impacts on wildlife. These concerns may lead to public opposition or additional scrutiny from environmental agencies, resulting in potential delays or increased costs to mitigate these impacts.",
    "**Launch Window Constraints**: Satellites often have specific launch windows dictated by orbital mechanics, the alignment of the Earth and other celestial bodies, and mission objectives. If a launch is delayed due to technical issues or weather conditions, it may miss its optimal launch window, necessitating a complete reassessment of mission goals or even the need to wait for months for the next opportunity.",
    "**Collaboration Challenges**: Many satellite missions involve collaboration between multiple organizations, including government agencies, private companies, and international partners. Miscommunication, differing priorities, or cultural differences can lead to challenges in coordination and project management, potentially jeopardizing the mission timeline and objectives."
