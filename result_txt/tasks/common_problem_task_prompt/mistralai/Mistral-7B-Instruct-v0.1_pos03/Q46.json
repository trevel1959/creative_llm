    "Implement a dynamic pricing system: This would allow the public transportation system to adjust fares in real-time based on demand, time of day, and distance traveled. This would incentivize people to use public transportation during peak hours, and reduce overcrowding.",
    "Develop a smartphone app: A mobile app could be created to allow people to plan their transportation routes, purchase tickets, and receive real-time updates on delays or: audio and visual announcements. This would make the public transportation experience more convenient and accessible.",
    "Create a network of bike-sharing stations: Bike-sharing stations could be placed throughout the city, allowing people to easily rent a bike for a short trip. This would reduce the number of cars on the road and encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation.",
    "Implement a subscription-based model: Instead of paying per ride, people could purchase a monthly or yearly subscription to the public transportation system. This would encourage people to use public transportation more often and reduce the number of cars on the road.",
    "Utilize renewable energy sources: The public transportation system could be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. This would reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation system and promote sustainability."
