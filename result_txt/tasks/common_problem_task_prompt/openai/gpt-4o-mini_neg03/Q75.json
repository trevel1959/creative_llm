    "**Overcrowding and Environmental Degradation**: Popular national parks often face overcrowding, which can lead to soil erosion, littering, and disruption of wildlife habitats. Implementing a reservation system to limit daily visitors, alongside educational campaigns about Leave No Trace principles, can help preserve the park's natural beauty and ecosystem.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt the local ecosystem, outcompeting native flora and fauna. Regular monitoring and a robust removal strategy for invasive species are essential. Engaging volunteers for removal efforts and promoting awareness about the impact of invasive species can foster community involvement and stewardship.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting weather patterns, wildlife migration, and plant growth. Developing adaptive management strategies that include habitat restoration, sustainable resource management, and climate resilience planning can help parks better cope with these changes.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: National parks often struggle with limited budgets, impacting maintenance, staffing, and conservation efforts. Innovative funding solutions, such as partnerships with local businesses, grants for conservation projects, and a membership program for frequent visitors, could provide much-needed financial support.",
    "**Visitor Safety and Emergency Preparedness**: Natural hazards such as wildfires, floods, or wildlife encounters can pose risks to visitors. Establishing comprehensive safety protocols, regular training for park staff, and clear communication of emergency procedures can enhance visitor safety. Additionally, creating a mobile app that provides real-time alerts and safety tips could be beneficial."
