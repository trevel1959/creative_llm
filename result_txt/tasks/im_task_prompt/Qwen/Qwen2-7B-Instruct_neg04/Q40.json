    "**Innovative Sunglasses for Night Driving:** Design a pair of sunglasses that come equipped with built-in night vision technology. These sunglasses would have infrared sensors and LED lights that help drivers see better in low-light conditions. The glasses could adjust their sensitivity based on the light level, ensuring optimal visibility without blinding other drivers.",
    "**Sunglasses as Smart Wearables:** Create a line of smart sunglasses that include features like touch screen control, Bluetooth connectivity, GPS navigation, and even integrated audio for listening to music or receiving calls. The glasses could also incorporate augmented reality elements, displaying information about nearby points of interest or traffic updates directly onto the lens.",
    "**UV-Protective Sports Sunglasses with Changeable Lenses:** Develop sports-oriented sunglasses with interchangeable lenses that can be easily swapped out depending on the intensity of sunlight or the specific activity being performed (e.g., running, cycling, skiing). The lenses would provide UV protection, while the frames would feature adjustable nose pads and temple arms for a customized fit.",
    "**Fashionable Sunglasses with Eco-Friendly Materials:** Design a collection of sunglasses made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, bamboo, or organic cotton. Each pair could be hand-painted or embossed with unique patterns, offering customers a stylish accessory while contributing to environmental conservation.",
    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Cooling System:** Introduce a line of sunglasses with a miniaturized cooling fan inside the frame that can be activated when the temperature outside rises. The fan would draw air through the lenses, helping to keep the wearer's eyes cool and comfortable during hot summer days. This feature could also incorporate a small water reservoir for hydration, ensuring users stay refreshed while wearing the sunglasses."
