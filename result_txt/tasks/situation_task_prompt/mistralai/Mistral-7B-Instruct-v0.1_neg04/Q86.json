    "Use a oil-based cleanser: If soap disappears, one of the most effective ways to keep clean is by using a rinse-oil based cleanser. This type of cleanser is made by blending a carrier oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil, with a small amount of water. Simply wet your skin and apply the oil-based cleanser to your body, gently massage it in, and then rinse it off with water. This method effectively removes dirt, grime, and other impurities from the skin without stripping it of its natural oils.",
    "Use a natural cleanser: Another option for keeping clean is to use natural cleansers such as baking soda, lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar. These ingredients are effective at removing dirt and bacteria from the skin, and they are also gentle on the skin. Simply mix the natural cleanser with water and apply it to your skin, then rinse it off with water.",
    "Use a dry brush: A dry brush is a great tool for removing dead skin cells and keeping your skin feeling soft and smooth. Simply use a dry brush to gently massage your skin, starting at the top of your body and working your way down. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may be on your skin.",
    "Use a natural deodorant: If soap disappears, you will need to find a natural deodorant to keep yourself feeling fresh. Some effective natural deodorants include baking soda, lemon juice, and tea tree oil. Simply mix the natural deodorant with water and apply it to your underarms.",
    "Use a natural mouthwash: If soap disappears, you will need to find a natural mouthwash to keep your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Some effective natural mouthwashes include mint oil, peppermint extract, and aloe vera. Simply mix the natural mouthwash with water and swish it around in your mouth for a few minutes."
