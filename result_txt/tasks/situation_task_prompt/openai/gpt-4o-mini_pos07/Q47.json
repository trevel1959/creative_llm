    "**Sunscreen Infused Head Wraps**: Create head wraps that are infused with sunscreen. These wraps could be made from a lightweight, breathable fabric that has been treated with SPF properties. Users would simply wear the wrap around their heads, and the fabric would provide continuous UV protection while being comfortable and stylish. Additionally, the wraps could come in various colors and patterns to suit different tastes.",
    "**Smart Sun Protection Scalp Spray**: Develop a high-tech scalp spray that not only provides SPF protection but also monitors UV exposure. This spray could contain natural ingredients to soothe the skin and could be activated by a mobile app that alerts users when theyâ€™ve been exposed to a certain amount of UV rays. The app could also provide reminders to reapply the spray throughout the day.",
    "**Solar-Powered Cooling Headgear**: Innovate a solar-powered headgear that incorporates small, lightweight fans and UV-blocking technology. This headgear would harness solar energy to power the fans, providing a cooling breeze to the scalp while blocking harmful UV rays. The design could include a visor to shield the eyes and enhance overall comfort during outdoor activities.",
    "**Temporary Tattoo Sunscreen**: Introduce a line of temporary tattoos that serve as sunscreen barriers. These tattoos would be designed to be applied directly to the scalp and would contain SPF properties. They could be available in various designs, allowing users to express their individuality while ensuring their scalp is protected. The tattoos would gradually fade over time, providing a fun and unique way to stay sun-safe.",
    "**Interactive UV-Detecting Beanie**: Create a beanie equipped with UV-detecting technology that changes color based on UV exposure levels. This beanie would not only provide warmth and comfort but also visually alert the wearer when they are at risk of sunburn. When the fabric changes color, it would serve as a reminder to apply sunscreen or seek shade, ensuring that users are always aware of their sun exposure."
