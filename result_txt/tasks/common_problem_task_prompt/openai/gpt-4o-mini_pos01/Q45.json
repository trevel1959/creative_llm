    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and venue arrangements for delegates from various countries can be daunting. Issues such as flight cancellations, visa delays, or inadequate facilities can arise. To address this, a dedicated logistics team should be established, with contingency plans for transportation and accommodation, ensuring that all delegates have reliable options and support throughout the event.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events can attract unwanted attention, including protests or threats to attendees. Ensuring the safety of all participants is paramount. Organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to create a comprehensive security plan, including screening processes and emergency response protocols.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Conflicts**: Different countries may have conflicting priorities and agendas, making it challenging to reach a consensus on peace initiatives. To navigate this, facilitators could conduct pre-summit surveys to gauge the main interests of participating nations and tailor the agenda to ensure that all voices are heard, possibly creating breakout sessions for specific topics to allow focused discussions.",
    "**Technology Failures**: Reliance on technology for presentations, communication, and documentation can lead to disruptions if systems fail. To prevent this, organizers should conduct thorough tech checks prior to the summit, have backup systems in place, and ensure that technical support is readily available throughout the event to troubleshoot any issues that arise.",
    "**Funding and Sponsorship Issues**: Securing adequate funding for an international summit can be a significant challenge. Budget constraints may limit the scope of the event or lead to compromises in quality. Organizers should explore diverse funding sources, including government grants, private sponsorships, and crowdfunding, and create a transparent budget to manage resources effectively."
