    "Floating Vase: Create a vase that appears to be suspended in mid-air using optical illusions. The vase would be made of a clear glass or acrylic material, with a hidden magnet or air chamber inside that creates the illusion of weightlessness. The vase would be displayed on a shelf or pedestal, adding an element of mystery to the arrangement.",
    "Vase with a Twist: Design a vase that changes shape and size depending on the angle from which it is viewed. The vase would be made of a flexible material, such as silicone or polyurethane, that can be molded into different shapes and sizes. When viewed from one angle, the vase would appear to be a traditional, cylindrical shape, but when viewed from a different angle, it would change shape to a more organic, flowing form.",
    "Glowing Vase: Create a vase that emits a soft, ethereal glow. The vase would be made of a translucent material, such as glass or acrylic, and would be filled with a special gel or liquid that absorbs and emits light. The vase would be powered by a small LED light source, located inside the base of the vase, that emits a soft, pulsing glow.",
    "Vase with a Purpose: Design a vase that serves a dual purpose, such as a planter and a candle holder. The vase would have a small, built-in tray or well that can be filled with soil and plants, while also accommodating a candle or tea light. The vase would be made of a durable material, such as ceramic or glass, and would have a sleek, modern design that makes it both functional and decorative.",
    "Shatter-Resistant Vase: Create a vase that is virtually indestructible. The vase would be made of a special, impact-resistant material, such as polycarbonate or Tritan, that can withstand being dropped or hit without shattering. The vase would be available in a variety of colors and shapes, and would be perfect for use in a busy, active home or office."
