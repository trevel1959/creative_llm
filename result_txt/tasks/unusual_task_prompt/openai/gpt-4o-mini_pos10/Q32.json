    "**Pet Grooming Tool**: Repurpose a hairbrush specifically for grooming pets, especially those with longer fur. The bristles can help detangle and smooth out fur, while the handle provides a comfortable grip for pet owners. This can be particularly useful for animals that are sensitive to traditional grooming tools, as the softer bristles can be gentler on their skin.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: Use a hairbrush as an unconventional scent diffuser by applying a few drops of essential oils or fragrance onto the bristles. As you brush your hair or simply leave it in a room, the scent will gradually be released into the air, creating a pleasant atmosphere. This can also be a fun way to enjoy your favorite scents while grooming.",
    "**Garden Tool**: Turn a sturdy hairbrush into a mini gardening tool for delicate tasks like weeding or planting seeds. The bristles can help clear small debris from soil or create small furrows for seed placement. Its compact size makes it perfect for working in tight spaces or pots, allowing for precise gardening efforts.",
    "**Crafting Stencil**: Cut the bristles off an old hairbrush and use the base as a stencil for crafting projects. The shape of the brush can create interesting patterns when used with spray paint or sponging techniques. This could be especially useful for creating backgrounds in scrapbooking, card making, or other paper crafts.",
    "**Fashion Accessory Organizer**: Transform a hairbrush into a chic accessory holder by attaching small hooks or clips to the handle. This can be a stylish way to store earrings, necklaces, or bracelets. The unique design adds a decorative touch to a vanity or dressing area while keeping accessories organized and easily accessible."
