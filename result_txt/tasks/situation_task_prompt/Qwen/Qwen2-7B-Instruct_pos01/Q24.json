    "**Innovative Augmented Reality Devices**: People could use AR glasses or headsets that project a virtual overlay on the real world, enhancing visibility and providing clear, enhanced images of their surroundings. This technology would be similar to what is currently used in the gaming industry but adapted for everyday use. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9.",
    "**High-Tech Braille Enhancements**: For those who are visually impaired, advanced braille technology could emerge, such as tactile screens or smart gloves that can convert text into touchable, raised patterns. This would allow users to read digital content by touch, providing an alternative to visual reading. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85.",
    "**Sound-Based Navigation Systems**: Individuals could rely on sound systems that detect objects and obstacles in their environment and provide auditory feedback. These systems could be integrated into clothing or wearable devices, guiding the user through their surroundings. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8.",
    "**Advanced Audio Description Services**: A service could be developed where audio descriptions accompany video content, narrating the visual elements in real-time. This would enable those with poor vision to understand scenes and actions without relying on visual cues. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75.",
    "**Tactile Mapping and Wayfinding Apps**: Apps could be created that provide tactile maps and wayfinding guidance using vibrations or haptic feedback. Users would interact with their smartphones or other devices to navigate through familiar or new environments. The confidence score for this idea is 0.7."
