    "**Eco-Friendly Light Bulb Recycling Program**: Create a program where old light bulbs can be recycled for free in exchange for new energy-efficient LED bulbs. The old bulbs would be collected, broken down into their components (glass, metal, and glass), and then the materials would be used to make new products like garden ornaments or educational toys. This not only reduces e-waste but also promotes recycling and sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Light Bulb Museum**: Develop an interactive museum where visitors can learn about the history of lighting, from oil lamps to modern LED technology. Each exhibit could include a hands-on activity related to light, such as building simple circuits or designing your own light bulb. Interactive displays could use augmented reality to bring historical light bulbs to life, making the experience engaging and educational.",
    "**Light Bulb Art Competition**: Organize an annual competition where artists submit light bulb art installations. Participants could use light bulbs as a medium to create sculptures, paintings, or even large-scale public art pieces. This encourages creativity while also promoting environmental awareness, as participants might be asked to use reclaimed or eco-friendly light bulbs.",
    "**Educational Workshops on Sustainable Lighting**: Host workshops that teach people how to save energy by choosing the right type of light bulbs and installing them efficiently. These workshops could cover topics like choosing the correct wattage for different rooms, using motion sensors, and integrating smart lighting systems. By educating consumers, we can significantly reduce energy consumption and promote sustainable living practices.",
    "**Smart Home Lighting System Development**: Create a line of smart light bulbs that can be controlled through voice commands, mobile apps, or integrated with other smart home devices. These bulbs could also adjust brightness based on natural light levels, save energy during peak hours, and even change color to enhance mood or productivity. This innovation could significantly improve the energy efficiency of homes and offices, reducing costs and environmental impact."
