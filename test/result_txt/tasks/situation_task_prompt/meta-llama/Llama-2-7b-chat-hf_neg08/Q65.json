These lanterns use the energy of the sun to charge during the day and provide a soft, warm glow at night. They are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and require minimal maintenance.",
    "Glowing Plants: Another creative idea is to use glowing plants to light up a room at night. This can be achieved by using plants that naturally glow in the dark, such as certain species of mushrooms or plants that have bioluminescent properties. These plants can be placed around the room to create a soft, ambient light.",
