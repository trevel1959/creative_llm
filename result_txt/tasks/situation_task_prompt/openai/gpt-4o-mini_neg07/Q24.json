    "**Community Vision Networks**: Create local community groups that support individuals with visual impairments. These networks could facilitate shared resources, such as transportation services for those who need assistance getting around, and organize workshops where members can learn skills to adapt to their vision challenges, like navigation techniques or using technology to assist with daily tasks.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: Develop AR glasses that enhance the remaining vision of individuals with poor eyesight. These glasses could feature customizable settings to adjust contrast, magnify objects, or even highlight edges of objects to improve clarity. They could also include navigation features that provide auditory directions, making it easier for users to move around in their environment.",
    "**Vision Adaptation Apps**: Launch mobile applications that use the phone's camera to help users identify objects, read text, or navigate their surroundings. These apps could employ machine learning to recognize faces, read signs, or even convert written text into audio. This would empower individuals to regain some independence in their daily lives.",
    "**Crowdsourced Vision Assistance**: Create a platform where individuals can connect with volunteers who offer real-time assistance. Users could request help with tasks like reading labels in stores, navigating unfamiliar areas, or even participating in social activities. This service could operate similarly to ride-sharing apps, allowing users to find nearby helpers quickly.",
    "**Adaptive Learning Programs**: Implement educational programs that teach adaptive skills for those with visual impairments. These programs could cover a range of topics, from using tactile materials and braille to understanding spatial awareness and using sound to navigate. The goal would be to equip individuals with the skills they need to thrive without traditional vision aids."
