    "**Sponsorship and Funding Challenges**: Securing sufficient funding and sponsorships can be a significant hurdle. Without proper financial backing, the festival may struggle to cover costs such as venue rental, marketing, and equipment rental. It's essential to create a compelling sponsorship proposal that outlines the benefits for potential sponsors, such as brand visibility and audience engagement. Additionally, relying too heavily on a few sponsors can lead to financial instability if they withdraw support at the last minute.",
    "**Film Selection and Curation**: Curating a diverse and engaging lineup of films is vital for attracting audiences. A potential issue is the risk of bias in the selection process, leading to a lack of representation in terms of genre, culture, and perspectives. Moreover, if the selected films do not resonate with the target audience or fail to meet quality standards, it can negatively impact attendance and overall festival reputation. Establishing a diverse selection committee can help mitigate this risk.",
    "**Technical Issues During Screenings**: Technical glitches can disrupt screenings and frustrate audiences. Problems such as projector malfunctions, sound issues, or incompatible formats can arise, particularly if there is a lack of thorough testing before the event. To address this, itâ€™s essential to conduct multiple rehearsals and have a dedicated technical team on-site during the festival to quickly resolve any issues that may occur.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the festival to ensure high attendance is a common challenge. A poorly executed marketing strategy can lead to low ticket sales and a lack of awareness among potential attendees. Utilizing a mix of digital marketing, social media, traditional advertising, and partnerships with local businesses can help spread the word. Additionally, engaging with the community and building relationships with local influencers can enhance visibility.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Ensuring a positive experience for attendees goes beyond just screening films. Common problems may include long lines, insufficient seating, and inadequate amenities such as food and beverage options. To enhance audience engagement, consider incorporating interactive elements such as Q&A sessions with filmmakers, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Providing a comfortable and enjoyable environment can encourage repeat attendance in future years."
