    "Signal Fires: Another option could be to use signal fires to communicate long distance. People could use a series of fires at different locations to send messages. The arrangement and sequence of the fires would represent the message, and the recipient would need to interpret the signals based on pre-established codes.",
    "Carrier Pigeons: In times before modern communication methods, carrier pigeons were used to carry messages from one location to another. In a world without phones, these birds could be trained to fly between specific locations and deliver messages written on a leg band or attached to their body.",
    "Semaphore: Semaphore is a signaling system that uses a series of flags or panels to communicate messages. It's an optical signaling system that can be used over long distances, and it's effective even without electricity or electronic devices.",
    "Ham Radio: Ham radio, also known as amateur radio, is a communication method that uses radio waves to send messages over long distances. It requires a license and specialized equipment, but it's a viable option for long-distance communication in the absence of phones.",
    "Homing Pigeons with GPS Tracking: Another possibility is to use homing pigeons equipped with GPS tracking devices. These birds can be trained to fly to specific locations and can carry messages attached to their body. The GPS tracking device would allow the sender to know when the message has been delivered."
