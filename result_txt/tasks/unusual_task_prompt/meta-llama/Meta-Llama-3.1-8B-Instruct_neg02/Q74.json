    "**Augmented Reality Windshield Display**: A smart windshield display that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide drivers with real-time information about the road ahead, such as traffic updates, road closures, and construction zones. The display would be projected onto the windshield, allowing drivers to focus on the road while still receiving important information.",
    "**Smart Steering Wheel with Haptic Feedback**: A steering wheel that incorporates haptic feedback technology, allowing drivers to feel subtle vibrations and resistance as they turn the wheel. This would help drivers stay on course and maintain a steady speed, even in challenging driving conditions. The haptic feedback could also be used to alert drivers to potential hazards or provide subtle cues for navigation.",
    "**Biometric Steering Wheel with Health Monitoring**: A steering wheel that incorporates biometric sensors to monitor the driver's physical and mental state. The sensors could track heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs, providing drivers with real-time feedback on their health and well-being. This could also enable the vehicle to adjust its settings to optimize comfort and safety for the driver.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Steering Wheel**: A steering wheel that can change shape and configuration to accommodate different driving scenarios. For example, the wheel could become more compact for parking or more expansive for high-speed driving. The wheel could also adjust its shape to provide a more comfortable grip for drivers with different hand sizes or preferences.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Integrated Navigation and Controls**: A steering wheel that incorporates a touch-sensitive surface, allowing drivers to control various vehicle functions and access navigation information without taking their hands off the wheel. The wheel could also include voice command capabilities, enabling drivers to issue commands without touching the wheel at all. This would help reduce distractions and improve overall safety while driving. [/INST] "
