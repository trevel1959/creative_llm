    "Theke - A tale of a young girl who discovers that she is the only person who can communicate with animals. She embarks on a journey to save her village from a curse that has turned all the animals into humans. This fairy tale would be perfect for me because I have always had a love for animals and I think it would be amazing to be able to communicate with them.",
    "The Little Mermaid - I would love to bring this classic fairy tale to life because I have always been fascinated by the ocean and its creatures. I think it would be incredible to spend time under the sea and to experience life as a mermaid.",
    "The Emperor's New Groove - This tale of a vain emperor who is turned into a llama by his advisor would be a great choice for me because I think it would be hilarious to see a person in such a ridiculous position of power. It would also be a fun way to explore the themes of vanity and self-discovery.",
    "The Nutcracker - I have always loved the ballet version of this fairy tale, so I would love to bring it to life in a more immersive way. I think it would be amazing to be a part of the story and to dance alongside the characters.",
    "The Secret Garden - This tale of a young girl who discovers a hidden garden and the magical creatures that live there would be a great choice for me because I think it would be wonderful to spend time in a place that is full of life and beauty. It would also be a great way to explore the themes of friendship and the power of nature."
