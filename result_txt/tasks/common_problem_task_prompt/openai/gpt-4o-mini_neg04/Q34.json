    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Robots require a reliable power source to operate effectively. The challenge lies in choosing the right type of battery or power system that balances weight, capacity, and recharge time. Insufficient power can lead to reduced performance, limited operational time, or the inability to carry out tasks that require higher energy consumption.",
    "**Cost Overruns**: Developing a robot can be an expensive endeavor. The costs associated with materials, components, and labor can quickly escalate, especially if unforeseen issues arise during the design and testing phases. Budget overruns may result in project delays or the need to compromise on certain features or functionalities.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Depending on the robot's intended use, safety is a critical issue. Robots that interact with humans or operate in public spaces must be designed to prevent accidents or injuries. This includes implementing fail-safes, emergency stop mechanisms, and adhering to industry safety standards. Failing to prioritize safety could lead to liability issues or harm to users.",
    "**User Acceptance and Trust**: For a robot to be successful, it must be accepted by its intended users. Factors such as usability, design, and perceived reliability play significant roles in user acceptance. If users feel uncomfortable or distrustful of the robot's capabilities, they may be hesitant to adopt it, regardless of its technical merits.",
    "**Maintenance and Longevity**: Robots require regular maintenance to ensure they function optimally over time. Issues such as wear and tear, software updates, and component replacements must be anticipated. If maintenance is neglected or too complicated for users, it could lead to reduced performance, increased downtime, and ultimately, the robot becoming obsolete."
