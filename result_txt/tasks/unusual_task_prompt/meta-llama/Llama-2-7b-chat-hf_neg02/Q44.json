    "Smart Ice Tray: Create an ice cube tray that can monitor and control the temperature of the ice cubes it produces. The tray could have sensors that detect the temperature of the ice cubes and adjust the temperature of the freezer accordingly. This would ensure that the ice cubes are always the perfect temperature for your drink.",
    "Personalized Ice Cubes: Develop an ice cube tray that can be personalized with different shapes, colors, and designs. Users could choose from a variety of templates or create their own designs using a mobile app. This would add a fun and creative touch to any drink.",
    "Health-Tracking Ice Cubes: Create an ice cube tray that can track the amount of time it takes for an ice cube to melt. This information could be used to monitor the user's hydration levels and alert them when it's time to drink more water. The tray could also track the temperature of the ice cubes and alert the user if the temperature is too high or too low.",
    "Multi-Use Ice Cubes: Design an ice cube tray that can be used for multiple purposes. For example, the tray could have different compartments for different types of ice cubes, such as crushed ice, cubed ice, and even frozen fruit. This would eliminate the need for multiple ice cube trays and save space in the freezer.",
    "Smart Ice Tray with Built-In Cooler: Create an ice cube tray that has a built-in cooler. The tray could have a small cooling unit that can keep the ice cubes at a consistent temperature, even after they've been removed from the freezer. This would be especially useful for outdoor events or picnics, where access to a freezer may be limited."
