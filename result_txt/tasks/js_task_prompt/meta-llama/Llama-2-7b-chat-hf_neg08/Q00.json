    "Fly to the moon: I would be the first person to set foot on the moon since the Apollo missions. I would explore the lunar surface, discover new craters, and plant a flag with my name on it.",
    "Attend a concert in space: I would book a ticket to a concert on a space station or a planet with a breathable atmosphere. I would enjoy the music while floating in zero gravity, surrounded by the vastness of space.",
    "Visit my ancestors' homeland: I would use my newfound flying ability to travel back in time to the era of my ancestors. I would explore their culture, meet their leaders, and learn about their way of life.",
    "Help with natural disaster relief: I would fly to areas affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, or tsunamis. I would use my flying ability to deliver aid, evacuate people, and assess damage.",
    "Circumnavigate the world: I would fly around the world, visiting famous landmarks, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures. I would also document my journey through photos, videos, and blog posts."
