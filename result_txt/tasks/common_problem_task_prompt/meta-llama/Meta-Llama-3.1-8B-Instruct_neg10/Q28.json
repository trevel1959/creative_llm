    "**Inequitable Access**: The recycling initiative might not be accessible to all residents, particularly those living in low-income or marginalized communities. These areas may lack the necessary infrastructure, resources, or education to participate in the program, leading to unequal distribution of recycling opportunities and potential environmental injustices.",
    "**Compliance and Enforcement**: Ensuring compliance with the recycling program and enforcing the rules could be a significant challenge. Some residents might not be aware of the guidelines or might intentionally ignore them, leading to contamination of recyclables and undermining the effectiveness of the program.",
    "**Public Education and Awareness**: Educating the public about the importance of recycling and how to properly participate in the program could be a significant obstacle. Many residents might not understand the value of recycling or might be unaware of the correct procedures for sorting and preparing recyclables.",
    "**Infrastructure and Logistics**: The city might not have the necessary infrastructure or logistics in place to support a city-wide recycling initiative. This could include a lack of recycling facilities, inadequate transportation systems, or insufficient storage capacity, making it difficult to collect, process, and manage recyclables.",
    "**Financial Constraints**: Implementing a city-wide recycling initiative could be costly, and the city might not have the necessary financial resources to support it. This could lead to reduced services, decreased effectiveness, or even the cancellation of the program."
