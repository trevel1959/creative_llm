    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy, which would then be stored in the battery for use when needed. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a battery that uses living organisms, such as bacteria or algae, to generate electricity. These batteries would use the metabolic processes of the organisms to produce energy, which would then be stored in the battery. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power, as the organisms could be easily cultivated and replaced.",
    "Thermal Energy Batteries: Create a battery that harnesses the heat generated by the Earth's core to generate electricity. These batteries would use thermoelectric materials to convert the heat into electrical energy, which would then be stored in the battery. This would provide a constant source of power, even in areas where sunlight or other sources of energy are not available.",
    "Magnetic Batteries: Develop a battery that uses magnetic fields to store energy. These batteries would use magnetic materials to generate electricity, which would then be stored in the battery. This would provide a highly efficient and sustainable source of power, as the magnetic fields could be easily generated and manipulated.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Create a battery that uses hydrogen as a fuel source to generate electricity. These batteries would use hydrogen gas to produce electricity through a process called electrolysis, which would then be stored in the battery. This would provide a clean and sustainable source of power, as the only byproduct of the reaction would be water vapor."
