    "**Solar-Powered Charging Umbrella**: This umbrella would have solar panels integrated into its canopy. On sunny days, the umbrella could harness solar energy to charge small devices like smartphones and tablets through USB ports located in the handle. This would be perfect for outdoor events, picnics, or beach days, allowing users to stay connected while being shielded from the sun.",
    "**Automatic Drying Mechanism**: This innovative umbrella would feature a self-drying system that uses a combination of heated fabric and a small fan embedded in the handle. After being used in the rain, the user could activate the drying mechanism, which would quickly dry the umbrella's fabric, preventing water from dripping and creating a mess when closed.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Umbrella**: This umbrella would have LED lights embedded along the edges of the canopy that could change colors based on the user's mood or preference. The lights could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to select colors for different occasions (e.g., bright colors for sunny days or calming hues for rainy days). This feature could make carrying an umbrella a more enjoyable experience and serve as a fun accessory.",
    "**Multi-Functional Umbrella with Built-In Seating**: This design would incorporate a collapsible seat within the umbrellaâ€™s structure. When opened, the umbrella could extend outwards to create a small, portable shelter with a built-in foldable seat on one side. This would be perfect for outdoor events, allowing users to rest while staying dry or shaded, making it ideal for festivals, concerts, or sporting events.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Umbrella**: To combat plastic waste, this umbrella would be made from sustainable, biodegradable materials. The fabric could be derived from organic cotton or recycled plastics that break down naturally over time. The handle could be made from bamboo or another sustainable wood source, promoting an eco-conscious lifestyle while providing a stylish alternative to traditional umbrellas."
