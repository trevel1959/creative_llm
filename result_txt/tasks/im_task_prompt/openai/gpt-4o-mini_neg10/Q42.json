    "**Self-Weighting Mechanism**: To avoid overweight baggage fees, a suitcase could be designed with a built-in scale that accurately weighs the contents as you pack. It would display the weight on a digital screen and provide alerts when you're nearing the airline’s weight limit. This feature could also sync with an app that tracks your packing habits and suggests packing lists based on your destination.",
    "**Modular Packing System**: A suitcase that features interchangeable compartments or modules would allow travelers to customize their packing experience. Users could select different sizes and shapes of packing cubes or sections depending on their trip needs, such as clothing, electronics, or toiletries. This modular design would make it easier to access items without unpacking the entire suitcase.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Station**: Integrating solar panels into the suitcase’s exterior could provide a sustainable way to charge devices while on the go. Travelers could place the suitcase in sunlight while waiting at the airport or on a beach, allowing it to harness solar energy to charge smartphones, tablets, or other electronic devices through built-in USB ports.",
    "**Smart Lock with Biometric Security**: Instead of traditional locks, a suitcase could be equipped with a smart locking mechanism that uses biometric security features, such as fingerprint or facial recognition. This would enhance security, as only the authorized user could open the suitcase. Additionally, the suitcase could send notifications to the owner’s smartphone if someone attempts to tamper with it.",
    "**Integrated RFID Tracking System**: A suitcase that includes an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking system would allow travelers to keep tabs on their luggage at all times. By placing an RFID tag inside the suitcase, users could locate it through a smartphone app, receive notifications if it’s moved out of a designated area, and ensure it’s safely loaded onto their flight."
