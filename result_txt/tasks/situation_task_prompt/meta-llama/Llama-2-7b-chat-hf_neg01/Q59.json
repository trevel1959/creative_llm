    "Build a Sun-Harvesting Dome: Create a large, hemispherical dome made of a translucent, reflective material that allows sunlight to pass through. The dome would be suspended above the clouds, anchored by a network of cables and pulleys. As the sun moves across the sky, the dome would rotate to maintain a constant angle towards the sun, ensuring maximum sunlight exposure. This would provide a consistent source of natural light for inhabitants, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Design skyscrapers with built-in, retractable sunlight collection systems. These towers would feature mirrors or lenses that focus sunlight onto photovoltaic panels or solar concentrators, harnessing the energy of the sun even when it's hidden behind clouds. The towers could also be equipped with weather-sensing technology, adjusting their orientation and angle of attack to maximize sunlight capture.",
    "Solar-Powered Cloud Seeding: Develop a system that uses solar-powered electrical charges to stimulate the growth of cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the amount of sunlight that can pass through the clouds. This could involve deploying small, unmanned aircraft or drones that release cloud-forming agents, such as saltwater or silver iodide, into the atmosphere. As the sunlight hits these particles, they would amplify the light, allowing more of it to reach the ground.",
    "Cloud-Based Solar Farms: Create large-scale solar farms that are integrated into the clouds themselves. These farms would use advanced, flexible solar panels that can be stretched and shaped to conform to the irregular shapes of the clouds. The panels would be anchored to the clouds using a network of cables and tethers, allowing them to move with the wind and clouds. This would provide a consistent source of solar energy, even on cloudy days, and could be scaled up to cover vast areas of the sky."
