    "**Bio-Inspired Architecture**: Utilize microorganisms like bacteria and fungi to create sustainable building materials. For example, mycelium (mushroom roots) can be used to create a durable, fire-resistant, and insulating material. This approach not only provides a solution to the lack of natural materials but also reduces waste and carbon emissions.",
    "**3D-Printed Structures**: Leverage advancements in 3D printing technology to fabricate houses using a combination of recycled plastics, metals, and other synthetic materials. This method allows for rapid construction, reduced labor costs, and the ability to create complex designs.",
    "**Inflatable Habitats**: Design inflatable structures that can be made from advanced polymers or membranes. These can be easily transported, set up, and disassembled, making them ideal for temporary or emergency housing. The inflatable design can also provide natural insulation and protection from harsh weather conditions.",
    "**Recycled Material Assemblage**: Develop a system where discarded materials like plastic bottles, cardboard, and fabric scraps are collected, sorted, and repurposed to create building components. This approach reduces waste, promotes sustainability, and encourages creative reuse of materials.",
    "**Self-Healing Materials**: Explore the development of self-healing materials that can repair cracks and damages autonomously. This could be achieved through the use of shape-memory alloys, self-healing polymers, or even nanotechnology-based solutions. Such materials would reduce maintenance costs, extend the lifespan of buildings, and create more resilient structures."
