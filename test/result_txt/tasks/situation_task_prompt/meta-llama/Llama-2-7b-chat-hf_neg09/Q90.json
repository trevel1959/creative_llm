    "Solar-Powered Water Harvesting: Create a system that harnesses the power of the sun to collect and store water. The system would involve large, curved mirrors or lenses that focus sunlight onto a central point, heating the air and creating a steam cycle. The steam would then be channeled into a condenser, where it would cool and condense into water. This system could be scaled up for use in both residential and industrial settings.",
    "Atmospheric Water Extraction: Develop a technology that extracts water directly from the atmosphere. This could involve using a combination of heat and humidity sensors to locate areas with the highest water vapor content, and then using a specialized membrane to filter and purify the water. The extracted water could then be stored in tanks or distributed directly to users.",
    "Ocean-Based Water Collection: Create a system that collects water from the ocean using a network of underwater buoys. These buoys would be equipped with specialized membranes that filter out salt and other impurities, producing fresh water. The water could then be pumped up to the surface for storage or distribution. This system could be particularly useful in coastal areas where access to fresh water is limited.",
    "Bioluminescent Water Collection: Develop a system that uses bioluminescent organisms to collect and purify water. The system would involve cultivating certain species of bacteria or algae that produce light when exposed to water. These organisms could be used to purify water by breaking down impurities and creating a clean, glowing water source. The purified water could then be stored or distributed.",
    "Cloud-Based Water Collection: Create a system that collects water from clouds using a network of inflatable, cloud-based storage tanks. These tanks would be designed to capture and store water droplets from passing clouds, which could then be released as needed. This system could be particularly useful in areas with high levels of cloud cover, such as coastal regions or mountainous areas."
