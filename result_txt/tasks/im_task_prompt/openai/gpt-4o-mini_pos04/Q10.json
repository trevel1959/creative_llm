    "**Integrated Air Quality Monitor**: Adding a built-in air quality sensor to laptops could promote healthier working environments. The laptop could monitor the air quality in real-time and suggest breaks or adjustments to workspace setup when pollution levels or allergens are high. This feature could be paired with a companion app that provides insights and tips for maintaining optimal air quality.",
    "**Self-Healing Materials**: Utilizing advanced self-healing materials for the laptop casing could revolutionize its durability. If the laptop gets scratched or dented, the material would have the ability to repair itself over time when exposed to certain temperatures or conditions. This would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also extend the lifespan of the device.",
    "**Modular Hardware Design**: Creating a modular laptop design would allow users to easily upgrade components such as the CPU, GPU, or RAM without needing to replace the entire device. This would cater to tech enthusiasts and professionals who need high-performance machines but want to keep their costs down and reduce electronic waste.",
    "**Smart Cooling System**: Implementing a smart cooling system that adjusts fan speed and airflow based on the laptop's internal temperature and workload could significantly improve performance and reduce noise. The system could use AI to predict and adapt to usage patterns, ensuring optimal cooling without excessive power consumption.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Imagine a laptop that includes built-in AR capabilities, allowing users to interact with virtual elements in their physical workspace. For example, users could project a virtual keyboard onto their desk or have a 3D model of a project appear above the laptop screen. This would enhance productivity and creativity, especially for designers and engineers."
