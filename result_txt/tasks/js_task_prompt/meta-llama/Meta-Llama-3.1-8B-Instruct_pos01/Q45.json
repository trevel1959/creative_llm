    "**Electroreception**: I'd propose a sense that allows humans to perceive the electrical signals emitted by living organisms, including other humans. This sense would enable us to \"feel\" the emotions, intentions, and even the physical state of those around us. Imagine being able to sense the stress levels of your colleagues, the excitement of a crowd, or the calmness of a forest. This sense would revolutionize communication, empathy, and even conflict resolution. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Chronoception**: I'd design a sense that allows humans to perceive time in a more nuanced and visceral way. This sense would enable us to feel the rhythm of time, sensing the ebb and flow of hours, days, and years. We could \"feel\" the weight of time, the pressure of deadlines, or the freedom of a vacation. This sense would help us better manage our schedules, prioritize tasks, and appreciate the fleeting nature of life. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Nexalization**: I'd propose a sense that allows humans to perceive the interconnectedness of all things. This sense would enable us to \"feel\" the web of relationships between people, places, and objects. We could sense the flow of energy, resources, and information between systems, and even perceive the hidden patterns and structures that underlie our world. This sense would foster a deeper understanding of the world, promote empathy, and inspire creative problem-solving. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Ecophoria**: I'd design a sense that allows humans to perceive the natural world in a more direct and intimate way. This sense would enable us to \"feel\" the pulse of the earth, sensing the rhythms of the seasons, the cycles of weather, and the vibrations of the land. We could \"feel\" the health of ecosystems, the beauty of landscapes, and the awe-inspiring power of natural phenomena. This sense would inspire a deeper appreciation for the natural world, promote sustainability, and foster a sense of responsibility towards the planet. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Symphonia**: I'd propose a sense that allows humans to perceive the harmonies and dissonances between different frequencies, patterns, and vibrations. This sense would enable us to \"feel\" the music of the universe, sensing the intricate web of relationships between sound, light, and matter. We could \"feel\" the beauty of a symphony"
