    "**Interactive QR Code Design**: Design the luggage tag with a customizable QR code that links to a digital profile. Travelers can input their contact information, travel itinerary, and even a short video introduction. If someone finds the luggage, they can scan the code to view the owner’s information and contact them directly, making it easier to return lost items.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material Options**: Create luggage tags from biodegradable or recycled materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious travelers. The tags could be made from materials like cork or recycled plastics, ensuring that they are durable yet sustainable, and can even be composted after their lifecycle.",
    "**Color-Coded Identification System**: Develop a series of luggage tags with interchangeable color bands that can be easily swapped out. Travelers could use different colors to signify various trips, such as vacations, business trips, or family travel. This visual cue would help them quickly identify their bags at the airport and reduce mix-ups.",
    "**Built-in USB Charging Port**: Integrate a compact USB charging port into the luggage tag. This would allow travelers to charge their devices on the go, especially during long layovers or in crowded airports. The tag could be designed with a secure compartment to hold a small power bank, making it both functional and convenient.",
    "**Personalized Voice Message Feature**: Add a small audio playback device within the luggage tag that allows owners to record a personalized message. If someone finds the luggage, they can press a button to hear the message, which could include the owner’s name, a request to return the bag, or even a friendly greeting. This adds a personal touch and can encourage goodwill in returning lost items."
