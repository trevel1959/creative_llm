    "**Innovative Rechargeable LED Flashlight**: Design a rechargeable flashlight that can also charge other devices via USB. This could be a life-saver for those stranded in the wilderness without access to electricity or for people who often forget to charge their phones. The flashlight could have multiple modes (e.g., high, low, strobe) and could be made from durable materials like aluminum or titanium for long-lasting use.",
    "**Solar-Powered Camping Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that harnesses solar energy. It would be perfect for camping trips, beach days, or any outdoor activity where you don't want to rely on batteries. This flashlight could include a small solar panel that recharges the internal battery when exposed to sunlight. It might also come with an adjustable angle base for easier positioning when set up on the ground.",
    "**Emergency Multi-Function Flashlight**: Design a compact, multi-functional flashlight that includes not only the standard light but also a compass, a whistle, and a small knife. This would be particularly useful for emergency situations, as it consolidates several tools into one device. The knife could retract into the flashlight body for safety, and the whistle would help alert rescuers if you're lost or injured.",
    "**Smartphone-Controlled Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that can be controlled using a smartphone app. Users could control the brightness, mode, and even turn it on and off remotely. This feature would be incredibly handy for situations where you need light but don't want to physically touch the flashlight, such as when handling hazardous materials or working in a dark room. The flashlight could also double as a panic button, alerting others to your location with a single tap on the app.",
    "**Portable, Reusable Light Painting Tool**: Design a flashlight specifically for light painting enthusiasts. This flashlight would have a longer, flexible neck and a bright LED light that can be easily adjusted for different angles. It could also have different color options and possibly even a timer function, allowing users to paint with light more precisely and creatively. This tool would be great for photographers, artists, and anyone looking to add a unique touch to their nighttime photography or art projects."
