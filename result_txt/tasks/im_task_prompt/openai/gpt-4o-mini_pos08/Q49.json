    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature using UV-C light technology that sanitizes the brush head after each use. This would ensure that bacteria and germs are eliminated, promoting better oral hygiene. The self-cleaning function could be activated by a simple button or automatically after the toothbrush is placed back in its charging dock.",
    "**Replaceable Brush Head with Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a line of brush heads made from biodegradable or recyclable materials. This would reduce plastic waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the design could allow for easy swapping of brush heads to encourage regular replacement without needing to buy an entirely new toothbrush.",
    "**Customizable Brushing Modes**: Introduce customizable brushing modes that allow users to adjust the intensity and speed of the brush according to their needs. For instance, softer modes for sensitive gums, stronger modes for plaque removal, and even a massage mode to stimulate gums. Users could control these settings through a smartphone app or directly on the toothbrush.",
    "**Integrated Water Flosser**: Combine an electric toothbrush with a built-in water flosser to enhance oral hygiene. This dual-function device would allow users to brush and floss simultaneously, saving time and providing a more thorough cleaning experience. The water flosser could be adjustable for pressure settings, catering to different preferences and needs.",
    "**Gamification for Kids**: Design an electric toothbrush specifically for children that incorporates gamification elements. The toothbrush could feature fun characters, lights, and sounds that engage kids while they brush. An accompanying app could track their brushing habits and reward them with points or badges for consistent brushing, making oral care an enjoyable experience."
