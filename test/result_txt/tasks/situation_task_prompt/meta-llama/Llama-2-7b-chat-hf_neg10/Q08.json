    "Innovative Water Filtration Systems: Create a portable water filtration system that can be used to purify water from any source. This system would use a combination of carbon filters, UV light, and other advanced technologies to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water, making it safe for drinking.",
    "Vertical Hydroponics: Develop a vertical hydroponic system that can be used to grow clean drinking water in a controlled environment. This system would use a combination of nutrient-rich water and LED lighting to cultivate algae, which can then be harvested and converted into clean drinking water.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Distillation: Create a solar-powered water distillation system that can be used to purify water in remote areas without access to electricity. This system would use the heat from the sun to vaporize water, which can then be condensed and collected as clean drinking water.",
    "Bamboo Water Filters: Develop a bamboo water filter that can be used to remove pollutants and contaminants from water. This filter would use the natural properties of bamboo to create a porous membrane that can trap impurities, leaving clean water to flow through.",
    "Community-Led Water Collection: Organize a community-led water collection effort where individuals can donate their time and resources to collect and transport clean drinking water from unaffected areas to areas where water sources are polluted. This effort could involve the use of reusable containers and transportation methods that minimize waste and energy consumption."
