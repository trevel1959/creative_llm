    "**Liability and Insurance Issues**: With the advent of self-driving technology, determining liability in the event of an accident becomes complicated. If a self-driving car is involved in a collision, questions arise about whether the manufacturer, software developer, or owner is responsible. This uncertainty can lead to legal disputes and challenges in insurance coverage. A potential solution could be the development of new insurance models specifically tailored for autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars may encounter situations where they must make ethical decisions, such as choosing between the lesser of two evils in an unavoidable accident scenario. These moral dilemmas raise questions about how the algorithms should be programmed and who gets to decide the ethical guidelines for these vehicles. A collaborative approach involving ethicists, engineers, and policymakers could help establish a framework for these decisions.",
    "**Public Perception and Trust**: Many people may feel apprehensive about riding in a self-driving car due to concerns about safety and reliability. Building public trust in this technology is crucial for widespread adoption. Manufacturers could implement extensive public education campaigns, showcase successful safety records, and allow potential customers to experience the technology firsthand through test rides or pilot programs.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Self-driving cars require a supportive infrastructure to function optimally, including well-maintained roads, clear signage, and communication systems with traffic management. In many areas, existing infrastructure may not be adequate for autonomous vehicles. Local governments and urban planners will need to invest in upgrades and smart city technologies to accommodate this new mode of transportation.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could disrupt various industries, particularly those relying on driving jobs, such as trucking and taxi services. This shift could lead to significant job losses and require retraining programs for affected workers. A proactive approach involving workforce development initiatives and education on new roles in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem can help mitigate these impacts."
