    "Infrastructure Challenges: Upgrading a city's public transportation system often requires significant changes to existing infrastructure, such as building new train tracks, bus lanes, or stations. This can be difficult due to space constraints, environmental impact, and the need for permits and approvals from various stakeholders.",
    "Integration with Existing Systems: The new public transportation system needs to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, such as buses, trains, and trams. This requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that passengers can easily transfer between different modes of transportation.",
    "Technical Challenges: Implementing new technology, such as smart ticketing systems or electric vehicles, can be challenging. This requires the development of new software, hardware, and systems to ensure that everything works together smoothly.",
    "Disruption to Services: Overhauling the public transportation system can disrupt existing services, causing delays, cancellations, and inconvenience for passengers. This requires careful planning and communication to minimize disruptions and ensure that passengers are informed about any changes.",
    "Environmental Impact: Overhauling the public transportation system can have significant environmental impacts, such as air pollution and noise pollution. This requires careful consideration of the materials used, the energy sources used to power the system, and the overall carbon footprint of the project."
