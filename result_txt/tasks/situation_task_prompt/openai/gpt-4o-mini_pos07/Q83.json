    "**Dream-Inducing Aromatherapy**: In a world without night, we could harness the power of scents to cue our bodies for sleep. A specialized diffuser could release calming essential oils like lavender, chamomile, or sandalwood at specific intervals throughout the “day.” As the scents permeate the air, they would signal the brain to release melatonin, encouraging a restful state. This could be paired with a gentle, rhythmic sound machine that mimics the sounds of night, providing a tranquil atmosphere for sleep.",
    "**Adaptive Sleep Masks**: These high-tech sleep masks would be equipped with sensors to detect when a person is ready to sleep. They would gradually darken, simulating nightfall, while also playing soft ambient sounds. Additionally, the masks could incorporate a gentle vibration feature that lulls the wearer into sleep by mimicking the feeling of a heartbeat. The masks could be programmed to adjust to the user’s preferences, offering personalized comfort for a restful sleep experience.",
    "**Virtual Reality Sleep Experiences**: In the absence of night, people could use virtual reality (VR) headsets to immerse themselves in serene, calming environments designed for sleep. Users could choose from various scenarios, such as lying on a beach under a starlit sky or floating on a tranquil lake surrounded by mountains. The VR experience would include soothing visuals and sounds that promote relaxation, allowing users to escape the constant daylight and find peace in their minds, leading to better sleep.",
    "**Nature-Inspired Sleep Terrariums**: These small, self-contained ecosystems would serve as sleep aids. Each terrarium would be designed to mimic a natural habitat, complete with plants, small water features, and ambient sounds. As users prepare for sleep, the terrarium would activate a gentle misting system to release moisture into the air, simulating the coolness of night. The soft sounds of flowing water and chirping crickets would create a calming atmosphere, encouraging a restful state.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Cycles with Biofeedback**: Advanced wearable technology could monitor an individual’s biometrics—heart rate, body temperature, and brain waves—to determine the optimal time for sleep. This device would then provide personalized recommendations on when to start winding down, even in constant daylight. It could also utilize gentle vibrations or light cues to signal when it’s time to enter a sleep state, helping the body adapt to a new routine without the traditional night-time cues."
