    "Mirror-like camera: Create a camera that has a mirror-like design, allowing users to see themselves in real-time while they are recording. This would be particularly useful for vloggers, makeup artists, and other content creators who want to see themselves during the recording process. The mirror-like design could also be used for selfies, allowing users to take high-quality photos and videos with a unique perspective.",
    "Smartphone-attached camera: Design a camera that can be attached to a smartphone, providing users with a higher-quality camera experience without the need for a separate device. The attachment could be magnetic, allowing for easy connection and disconnection, and could include features such as image stabilization and wireless charging. This would be a convenient and portable solution for those who want to capture high-quality photos and videos on the go.",
    "Holographic camera: Develop a camera that captures holographic images, allowing users to capture 3D images and videos that appear to jump off the screen. This could be achieved through the use of advanced lens technology and software, and could be used for a variety of applications, including entertainment, education, and advertising.",
    "Invisible camera: Create a camera that is completely invisible to the human eye, allowing users to capture photos and videos without being detected. This could be achieved through the use of advanced stealth technology, such as infrared sensors and mirrors, and could be used for a variety of applications, including surveillance and journalism.",
    "Shape-shifting camera: Develop a camera that can change its shape and form depending on the environment it is in. For example, the camera could change from a traditional camera shape to a more compact and portable shape when it is being used in a crowded area, or it could change to a more rugged and durable shape when it is being used in a harsh outdoor environment. This would provide users with a versatile and adaptable camera that can be used in a variety of situations."
