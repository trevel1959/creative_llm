    "A plastic picnic table for each person sitting on the table, instead of a paper towel or napkin. You don't put your head on the table because it wouldn't be hygienic.",
    "An insulated mat or a picnic rug, maybe two large quilts, so at the end of the day you're not cold, or to put your legs on. Also, it may come with a pillow.",
    "I don't know about a water bottle, it doesn't have water. I don't know about that. Also, maybe some utensils.",
    "Maybe the basket can be used as a portable barbecue grill, because all the people want to have a cookout, they'll have food left over to take home with them. But I have no idea how to make the basket and grill like that.",
    "Also, I believe a picnic basket could be made of lightweight plastic with handles instead of being made of wood. I know that they have picnicking accessories like a small table that you could set the picnic basket on, but they don't have handles on them."
