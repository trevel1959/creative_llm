    "Whisk with Built-In Measuring System: Design a whisk with built-in measuring marks on the handle, allowing users to measure ingredients directly on the whisk without having to switch between tools. This would save time and reduce errors in the cooking process.",
    "Whisk with LED Light: Create a whisk with an LED light embedded in the handle, providing a convenient source of light for cooking in low-light environments. This would be particularly useful for nighttime cooking or for cooking in small spaces with limited natural light.",
    "Smart Whisk: Develop a whisk with sensors that detect the type of ingredients being mixed and automatically adjust the mixing speed and technique accordingly. For example, the whisk could detect the consistency of the ingredients and adjust the mixing speed to ensure the perfect consistency is achieved.",
    "Collapsible Whisk: Design a whisk that can be collapsed and stored in a small space, making it easy to take with you when cooking on the go. This would be particularly useful for camping or traveling.",
    "Whisk with Built-In Grater: Create a whisk with a built-in grater on the blade, allowing users to grate ingredients directly into the mixture as they mix. This would save time and effort compared to grating ingredients separately before mixing."
