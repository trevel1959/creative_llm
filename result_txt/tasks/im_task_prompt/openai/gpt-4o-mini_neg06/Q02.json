    "**Solar-Powered Charging System**: Design a bicycle with built-in solar panels on the frame or fenders that charge a battery while riding or parked in the sun. This battery could power lights, a horn, or even charge a phone via USB. This eco-friendly feature would not only enhance safety with improved visibility at night but also provide convenience for cyclists who rely on their devices.",
    "**Adaptive Suspension System**: Innovate a bicycle with an adaptive suspension system that adjusts based on terrain and rider weight. Using sensors, the system could automatically soften or stiffen the suspension to optimize comfort and performance. This would be particularly beneficial for mountain bikers, allowing for smoother rides over rocky trails and better handling on flat surfaces.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Introduce a bicycle with integrated safety features such as turn signals and brake lights that are activated by the rider's hand signals or a wireless remote. This would improve visibility and communication with other road users, enhancing safety during rides. Additionally, incorporating reflective materials into the design could increase visibility at night.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular bicycle design that allows riders to easily attach and detach accessories based on their needs. Accessories could include a cargo rack, child seat, or even a weather shield. This would allow for greater customization and adaptability for various riding situations, whether commuting, touring, or recreational riding.",
    "**Smart Health Monitor**: Develop a bicycle equipped with a built-in health monitoring system that tracks the rider's heart rate, calories burned, and other vital statistics. This data could be displayed on a handlebar-mounted screen or synced to a smartphone app. Such a feature would appeal to fitness enthusiasts looking to optimize their workouts while cycling."
