    "**Emergency Phone Stand**: If you need to watch videos or take video calls hands-free, use your wallet as a makeshift phone stand. Fold the wallet in half and prop your phone against it. The wallet's thickness can provide the perfect angle for viewing, especially if you’re in a pinch and don’t have a stand.",
    "**Secret Storage for Notes**: Use the slots in your wallet to store important notes or reminders. Instead of relying on your phone, jot down quick thoughts or to-do lists on small pieces of paper and slide them into the card slots. This can be a more tactile way to keep track of your thoughts.",
    "**Portable Mini Art Gallery**: Use your wallet to showcase tiny art pieces or photographs. Create small, wallet-sized art prints or photos and insert them into the card slots. This not only adds a personal touch to your wallet but also allows you to carry around a mini art gallery wherever you go.",
    "**Travel Game Board**: Convert your wallet into a travel game board. Use the card slots to hold small game pieces (like coins or buttons) and draw a simple game board on a piece of paper that you can fold and keep in the wallet. Games like Tic-Tac-Toe or a mini chessboard can be fun ways to pass the time while waiting.",
    "**Coin Sorting System**: Instead of just throwing loose change into a jar, designate specific card slots in your wallet for different denominations of coins. This can help you keep your change organized and make it easier to find the right amount when you need it."
