    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. This innovative solution would provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy, eliminating the need for traditional batteries.",
    "Electromagnetic Induction: Develop a device that uses electromagnetic induction to transfer energy wirelessly between devices. This technology would allow for the transfer of power wirelessly, eliminating the need for batteries altogether.",
    "Hydroelectric Power: Harness the power of moving water to generate electricity. This could involve building small hydroelectric power plants in areas with fast-moving rivers or streams, providing a renewable source of energy.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a system that stores thermal energy from renewable sources, such as solar or geothermal, for use when needed. This technology would allow for the efficient storage and use of energy, reducing the need for batteries.",
    "Bio-Based Batteries: Create batteries made from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based polymers or bacteria-based electrolytes. These batteries would be more environmentally friendly and sustainable than traditional batteries, and could be easily disposed of at the end of their life cycle."
