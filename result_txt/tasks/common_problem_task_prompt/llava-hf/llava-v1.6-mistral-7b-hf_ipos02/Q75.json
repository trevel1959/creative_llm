    "**Wildlife Conflict**: As human populations expand and encroach on natural habitats, there may be conflicts between wildlife and humans. Park management needs to develop strategies to mitigate these conflicts, such as implementing wildlife corridors, conducting public awareness campaigns, and implementing measures to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, such as proper waste disposal and respecting wildlife.",
    "**Infrastructure and Maintenance**: Managing a national park requires maintaining and updating infrastructure, such as roads, trails, and restrooms. The park management must ensure that the infrastructure is in good condition and can handle the demands of visitors, which may involve allocating budget for maintenance, planning for long-term infrastructure needs, and implementing sustainable practices in construction and maintenance.",
    "**Climate Change and Adaptation**: Climate change can have a significant impact on national parks, altering ecosystems and increasing the risk of wildfires. Park management must adapt to these changes by implementing strategies to reduce the park's carbon footprint, monitoring the effects of climate change on the park's ecosystems, and developing plans for long-term conservation.",
    "**Accessibility and Inclusivity**: National parks should be accessible to all visitors, regardless of their physical abilities. This may involve developing accessible trails, providing signage in multiple languages, and ensuring that park facilities are designed to accommodate visitors with disabilities.",
    "**Education and Research**: National parks can serve as living laboratories for scientific research and educational programs. Park management should work with universities and other organizations to facilitate research and education programs, which can help raise awareness about the park's ecosystems and the importance of conservation."
