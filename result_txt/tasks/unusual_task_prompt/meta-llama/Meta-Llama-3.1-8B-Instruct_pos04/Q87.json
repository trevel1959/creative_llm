    "What are the five creative and original ideas you'd like to share?",
    "**Smart City Canopy**: Design a network of interconnected, solar-powered canopies that not only provide shade but also collect and store rainwater, reduce urban heat island effects, and integrate smart sensors for real-time pollution monitoring and noise reduction.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for PTSD**: Develop a VR therapy platform that simulates real-world environments for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allowing them to confront and overcome their fears in a controlled, safe space. This could be especially beneficial for veterans and survivors of traumatic events.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Packaging Made from Algae**: Create packaging materials using algae, which are biodegradable, compostable, and require minimal water to grow. This could significantly reduce plastic waste and pollution in the environment.",
    "**Accessible Music Composition for People with Disabilities**: Develop an AI-powered music composition platform that allows individuals with disabilities to create music using only their voice, eye movements, or other accessible methods. This platform could include tools for adjusting tempo, pitch, and composition style based on user feedback."
