    "Desalination Plants: One creative solution to obtaining clean drinking water in a world where all water sources are polluted is to establish desalination plants. These plants use advanced technology to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it suitable for drinking. The plants could be located near coastal areas, and the water could be transported to inland areas through pipelines or tankers.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Another innovative solution is to use cloud seeding technology to purify water in the atmosphere. This involves injecting substances like silver iodide or dry ice into clouds to stimulate the formation of rain. The resulting rainwater would be cleaner and free from pollutants. This method could be especially useful in areas with frequent rain showers.",
    "Bio-filter Bags: A unique approach to cleaning water is to use biodegradable bags infused with microorganisms that can break down pollutants. These bags could be placed in contaminated water sources, and the microorganisms would feed on the pollutants, purifying the water. This method would be effective in areas with slow-moving water, such as lakes or ponds.",
    "Vertical-axis Wind Turbines: Developing vertical-axis wind turbines that can capture wind energy from any direction could provide a reliable source of clean electricity for water purification. These turbines could be used to power water purification systems, making it possible to obtain clean drinking water in even the most remote areas.",
    "Solar Still Systems: In areas with high levels of sunlight, solar still systems could be used to purify water. These systems use the heat of the sun to evaporate water, leaving impurities behind. The resulting water vapor could then be collected and condensed, providing clean drinking water. Solar still systems could be especially useful in arid regions where water is scarce."
