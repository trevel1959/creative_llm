    "Design a towel with a built-in heating system: Create a towel with a thin layer of heating elements sewn into the fabric. When the user needs a warm towel, they can simply turn on the heating function using a small button or sensor. This would be especially useful for people who enjoy hot showers or baths and want to stay warm afterward.",
    "Develop a towel with a built-in UV protector: Incorporate a special fabric treatment that absorbs and blocks UV rays, protecting the user's skin from harmful exposure. This would be ideal for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in sunny climates, as it would provide an extra layer of protection against sunburn and skin damage.",
    "Create a towel with a hidden pocket for storing small items: Add a discreet pocket or pouch sewn into the towel that can hold small items like a phone, keys, or cash. This would be a convenient feature for people who want to keep their essentials within reach while drying off after a shower or swim.",
    "Design a towel with a unique texture for better grip: Develop a towel with a textured surface that provides better grip, making it easier to hold onto while showering or bathing. This could be achieved through the use of a special weave or the addition of small nodules or bumps on the surface of the towel.",
    "Invent a towel with a built-in waterproof layer: Create a towel with a waterproof membrane sewn into the fabric, allowing the user to dry off without worrying about water seeping through. This would be especially useful for people who enjoy water sports or activities, as it would keep them warm and dry while minimizing the risk of water damage to their clothing."
