    "**Educational Outreach Satellite**: Create a satellite that is primarily designed for educational purposes. This satellite could feature interactive modules on various scientific topics such as astronomy, physics, biology, and engineering. It would also have a camera system to capture images of Earth from space, which can be used in classrooms for teaching geography and environmental science. Additionally, it could have a live communication system allowing students to interact directly with astronauts or scientists on Earth.",
    "**Space Weather Monitoring Satellite**: Develop a satellite dedicated to monitoring solar activity, Earth's magnetic fields, and atmospheric conditions. This satellite would continuously transmit data back to Earth, providing real-time information on space weather events like solar flares and geomagnetic storms. This information would help meteorologists predict extreme weather conditions on Earth and alert industries like telecommunications and power grid operators to potential disruptions.",
    "**Biological Experiment Satellite**: Design a satellite that can carry out biological experiments in microgravity, such as growing plants, studying cell cultures, or conducting protein crystallography research. The satellite would include a sealed environment with controlled temperature, humidity, and light conditions. The results could provide valuable insights into how living organisms adapt in space and could have applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.",
    "**Communication Relay Satellite**: Build a satellite specifically for enhancing global internet connectivity. Equipped with advanced communication technology, this satellite would relay signals between different regions, especially those with limited access to high-speed internet. By deploying multiple such satellites, the coverage area could be expanded significantly, improving communication infrastructure in remote areas and enhancing emergency response capabilities.",
    "**Art and Cultural Satellite**: Create a satellite that showcases art and cultural content to people around the world. It could broadcast live performances, art exhibitions, and documentaries about different cultures and historical events. The satellite would use virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies to provide immersive experiences, making the audience feel like they are part of the event. This initiative would not only entertain but also educate and promote global understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures."
