    "**Regulation of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: With the internet as a basic human right, there would likely be a push for stricter regulations on ISPs to ensure fair pricing, no data caps, and non-discriminatory practices.

ISPs might be required to provide basic internet access at no charge or at a subsidized rate, similar to how some countries handle public transportation.",

This could lead to stronger protections for freedom of speech and privacy online, as citizens would have the right to challenge any actions that infringe upon their internet access. Activism and advocacy groups might emerge to monitor government practices, ensuring transparency and accountability in how citizens' online rights are protected.",
    "**Global Collaboration for Cybersecurity**: Acknowledging the internet as a human right could encourage international cooperation on cybersecurity measures. Countries might collaborate to create global standards for protecting users from cyber threats, ensuring that everyone can access the internet safely. This could lead to joint efforts in combating cybercrime and protecting personal data, fostering a more secure online environment for all users.",
    "**Innovation in Connectivity Solutions**: With the recognition of internet access as a basic human right, there could be a surge in innovation aimed at developing new connectivity solutions. Companies and startups might focus on creating low-cost satellite internet, mesh networks, or community-driven internet services to reach remote and underserved populations. This could lead to a boom in technological advancements, making internet access more affordable and accessible globally."
