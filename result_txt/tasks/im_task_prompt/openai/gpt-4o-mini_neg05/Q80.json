    "**Adjustable Speed Whisk**: Create a whisk that allows users to adjust the speed of whisking with a simple twist of the handle. This would cater to different recipes that require varying degrees of mixing intensity, from gentle folding to vigorous whipping. The whisk could have a visual indicator showing the selected speed level, making it user-friendly for cooks of all skill levels.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Introduce a whisk that features a self-cleaning mechanism. By incorporating ultrasonic cleaning technology, the whisk could emit sound waves that create tiny bubbles, effectively removing food residue. This would save time and effort for users, making cleanup after cooking a breeze. The whisk could also have detachable parts that are dishwasher safe for added convenience.",
    "**Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a whisk with interchangeable heads that can be easily swapped out depending on the task at hand. For example, one head could be for whisking egg whites, another for mixing batters, and a third for emulsifying dressings. This versatility would reduce the need for multiple kitchen tools and save storage space.",
    "**Ergonomic Whisk with Built-in Grip**: Create a whisk that features an ergonomic handle designed to reduce wrist strain during prolonged use. The handle could be padded with a non-slip material for a comfortable grip, making it easier for users to whisk without discomfort. Additionally, the whisk could have a balanced weight distribution to enhance control and reduce fatigue.",
    "**Whisk with LED Indicator Lights**: Develop a whisk that includes LED indicator lights that change color based on the mixing process. For example, the light could turn green when the mixture is perfectly whisked, yellow when it needs more time, and red when it is over-whisked. This visual cue would help novice cooks understand when they have achieved the right consistency, reducing the chances of ruining a recipe."
