    "**Natural Cleaning Agents:** Develop a system to extract and purify natural cleaning agents from plants and trees, such as soap bark, soapwort, and other plant-based sources. These agents can be used to create effective cleaning solutions for personal hygiene and household cleaning.",
    "**Vinegar and Baking Soda:** Utilize the antibacterial and antifungal properties of vinegar and baking soda to create a multi-purpose cleaning solution. Mix equal parts of vinegar and water to create a disinfectant, and use baking soda as a gentle abrasive for scrubbing surfaces.",
    "**Water Purification:** Develop a method to purify water using natural materials such as sand, charcoal, and plant-based filters. This would allow for the safe consumption of water from streams, lakes, and other water sources, reducing the risk of waterborne illnesses.",
    "**Composting Toilets:** Implement a composting toilet system that breaks down human waste into a safe and odorless fertilizer. This would reduce the need for soap and cleaning products, as the waste would be naturally decomposed and reused as fertilizer.",
    "**Wax and Clay:** Use natural waxes such as beeswax, carnauba wax, and plant-based waxes to create a natural and effective soap substitute. Combine these waxes with natural clays such as kaolin or bentonite clay to create a gentle and effective cleanser for personal hygiene."
