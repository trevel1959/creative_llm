    "Upholstered Headrest: One creative solution would be to design an upholstered headrest that can be attached to a wall or a bed frame. This would provide a soft, cushioned surface for resting one's head without the need for a traditional pillow. The headrest could be made of a comfortable fabric, such as cotton or microfiber, and could be adjusted to different heights to accommodate different sleeping positions.",
    "Sleep Mask with Built-In Ear Protection: Another idea would be to create a sleep mask with built-in ear protection. This would allow individuals to block out light and noise while sleeping, providing a more restful and peaceful sleeping environment. The ear protection could be made of a soft, flexible material, such as silicone, and could be adjusted to fit different ear sizes.",
    "Inflatable Pillow Alternative: For those who are looking for a more portable solution, an inflatable pillow alternative could be developed. This would be a lightweight, compact pillow that can be inflated using a hand or electric pump. The inflatable pillow could be made of a durable, puncture-resistant material, such as vinyl or nylon, and could be adjusted to different firmness levels by adding or releasing air.",
    "Sleep Sack with Built-In Support: A sleep sack with built-in support could be designed to provide extra comfort and support for the head and neck. This would be a one-piece garment that covers the upper body, providing warmth and comfort without the need for a separate pillow. The built-in support could be made of a sturdy material, such as mesh or fleece, and could be adjusted to different sizes to fit different body types.",
    "Smart Pillow with Built-In Sensors: For those who want to take their sleep to the next level, a smart pillow with built-in sensors could be developed. This pillow would track various aspects of sleep, such as sleep quality, duration, and position, and provide feedback to help individuals improve their sleep. The sensors could be made of a flexible, conductive material, such as silicone, and could be integrated into the pillow cover or sewn into the pillow filling"
