    "🔥 Wax Wanderlust: Create a candle line that takes inspiration from different countries and cultures. Each candle would be named after a unique destination and feature a blend of fragrances that evoke the sights, sounds, and smells of that place. For example, the \"Tokyo Sunrise\" candle could feature top notes of green tea and cherry blossom, middle notes of jasmine and incense, and base notes of sandalwood and musk.",
    "🕯️ Flame Fusion: Introduce a candle line that combines two or more complementary scents to create a unique and harmonious fragrance experience. For instance, the \"Coastal Breeze\" candle could combine the fresh, oceanic scent of lavender with the warm, earthy aroma of cedarwood, while the \"Spicy Oasis\" candle could blend the bold, spicy notes of cinnamon and cardamom with the sweet, floral scent of rose.",
    "🔥 Fire & Ice: Develop a candle line that features both warm, inviting scents and cool, refreshing fragrances. The \"Winter Wonderland\" candle could feature a blend of rich, spicy notes like pine, cinnamon, and clove, while the \"Summer Sunset\" candle could be a blend of bright, fruity notes like peach, mango, and bergamot.",
    "🎨 Colorful Canvases: Create a candle line that incorporates artistic, colorful packaging to match any decor.

    "🌟 Starry Nights: Develop a candle line that captures the magic and mystery of the night sky. Each candle could be named after a different constellation and feature a unique fragrance blend inspired by the stars and celestial bodies"
