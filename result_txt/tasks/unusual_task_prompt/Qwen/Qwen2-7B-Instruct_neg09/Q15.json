    "**Sleeping Pillow Lamp**: Design a unique pillow that doubles as a lamp. The pillow is filled with small, LED lights, which are powered by a rechargeable battery. The light can be adjusted to various colors and brightness levels, creating a calming or energizing atmosphere depending on the user's preference. The soft texture of the pillow provides a comfortable place for reading in bed, while the light helps reduce eye strain and promotes a peaceful environment.",
    "**Therapeutic Pillow**: Create a specialized pillow that offers relief for specific conditions like neck pain, back pain, or insomnia. The pillow could be made from memory foam or adjustable layers that conform to the body shape, providing support where needed. It could also incorporate heat or cold therapy elements, like small heating pads or cooling gel pockets, to soothe aching muscles or promote relaxation.",
    "**Inflatable Yoga Pillow**: Design an inflatable yoga pillow that can be used for various yoga poses, especially for those who need additional support for their knees or head. The pillow can be inflated to different levels of firmness using a small pump, allowing users to customize their comfort. It can also feature ergonomic contours to help maintain proper alignment during exercises, enhancing the effectiveness of the yoga practice.",
    "**Travel Pillow with Built-in Neck Support**: Develop a compact, lightweight pillow designed specifically for travel. This pillow would include a built-in neck support, making it easier to rest comfortably on long flights or car rides. The pillow could have a unique design, such as a U-shape or a wrap-around style, that securely holds the head and neck in place without slipping. Additionally, it might include a detachable face cover for added privacy and comfort.",
    "**Sound-Activated Pillow**: Create a pillow that reacts to sound waves, transforming ambient noise into soothing white noise. The pillow would contain speakers or vibration motors that activate based on the decibel level of nearby sounds. For example, if the room becomes too noisy, the pillow would emit calming white noise to mask the disturbance, helping the user relax and fall asleep more easily. The pillow could also have a Bluetooth connection to play music or nature sounds directly from a device, offering even more customization options."
