    "**Car-Transforming Drone**: This innovative concept combines a drone and a car into one vehicle. The idea is to create a versatile mode of transportation that can adapt to different environments and needs. When you're in the city, the drone part can detach from the car body and fly away, allowing you to park the car in tight spaces or on the roof of your building. In rural areas or when you need to transport large items, the drone component can attach back onto the car, increasing its carrying capacity and flight capabilities.",
