    "**Smart Hair Dryer**: Develop a hair dryer with smart features such as adjustable heat settings, temperature sensors to prevent overheating, and a timer to prevent excessive use. It could also have a built-in brush to help detangle hair.",
    "**Hands-Free Hair Dryer**: Design a hair dryer with a built-in clamp or stand that allows users to dry their hair without holding the device. This would be especially useful for multitasking or when doing hair in large sections.",
    "**Multi-Function Hair Dryer**: Combine the functionality of a hair dryer with other beauty tools, such as a curling iron or a straightener. This would save space and reduce the number of devices needed in a bathroom.",
    "**Blow-Dryer with Ionization**: Incorporate ionization technology into the hair dryer to help reduce frizz and improve hair manageability. Ionization technology works by breaking down water molecules in the air, which can help smooth the cuticle and improve hair condition.",
    "**Cordless Hair Dryer**: Design a cordless hair dryer that uses rechargeable batteries. This would offer the convenience of wireless use and the ability to take the dryer anywhere without needing a power outlet."
