    "Smart Display: Add a touchscreen display to the microwave oven that can show recipes, cooking times, and temperature settings. This would make it easier for users to follow recipes and monitor the cooking process without having to constantly open the microwave door to check on the food.",
    "Automated Food Defrosting: Implement a feature that automatically defrosts frozen food items using a combination of temperature and humidity control. This would save time and effort for users who frequently cook frozen meals.",
    "Built-in Scale: Integrate a built-in scale into the microwave oven, allowing users to weigh ingredients without having to use a separate kitchen scale. This would be particularly useful for precise cooking measurements and for users who follow specific diets.",
    "Self-Cleaning Mode: Add a self-cleaning mode to the microwave oven that uses high heat and steam to loosen and remove food residue without the need for chemicals or scrubbing. This would make cleaning the microwave easier and more environmentally friendly.",
    "Multi-Functionality: Expand the microwave oven's functionality to include additional cooking modes such as convection baking, broiling, or even slow cooking. This would make the appliance more versatile and useful in the kitchen."
