    "**Driver Responsibility**: While self-driving cars are designed to operate autonomously, there may still be situations where human intervention is necessary. Deciding when and how to intervene without causing accidents or confusion could become a complex issue, especially if the system's decision-making process isn't transparent.",
    "**Legal and Liability Issues**: If an accident occurs while a self-driving car is in operation, determining liability becomes challenging. Should the manufacturer, software developer, sensor supplier, or even the passenger be held responsible? Establishing clear legal guidelines would be crucial to ensure fair compensation and prevent lawsuits from overwhelming the industry.",
    "**Infrastructure Adaptation**: Self-driving cars require advanced infrastructure such as high-precision mapping, robust communication networks, and possibly dedicated lanes. Retrofitting existing roads or creating new infrastructure could lead to significant costs and disruption, raising questions about the economic feasibility of widespread adoption.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The introduction of self-driving cars could significantly impact employment, particularly in the transportation sector. Drivers, mechanics, and other related professions might face job loss, leading to societal and economic challenges in retraining and reemploying these individuals.",
    "**Public Trust and Acceptance**: The public's trust in technology and its ability to make safe decisions is essential for the successful implementation of self-driving cars. Building this trust through education, transparency, and showcasing the benefits of autonomous vehicles over time will be crucial."
