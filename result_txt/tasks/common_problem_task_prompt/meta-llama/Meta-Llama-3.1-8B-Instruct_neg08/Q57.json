    "**\"Task-Storming\" Workshop**: Organize a workshop where participants are divided into small groups and given a series of tasks related to building an e-commerce store. Each group is tasked with brainstorming creative solutions to these challenges, and then presenting their ideas to the entire group. The twist? Each participant is given a \"Jealousy Jar\" where they can anonymously write down what they're jealous of in others. The facilitator then shares the collective jealousies and encourages the group to use those feelings as fuel for their creative problem-solving.",
    "**\"The Green-Eyed Monster\" Challenge**: Design a gamified experience where participants are given a series of e-commerce-related challenges, but with a twist: each challenge is presented in a way that highlights what others have achieved in the past. The participant's goal is to complete the challenge while also acknowledging and overcoming their own jealousy. The challenge could be something like, \"Build a social media campaign that outperforms the most successful one from last quarter.\"",
    "**\"Overcoming Envy\" Coaching Sessions**: Offer one-on-one coaching sessions where participants can share their feelings of jealousy and work through them with a certified coach. The coach would help the participant identify the root causes of their jealousy and develop strategies to overcome it, using real-world examples from e-commerce success stories.",
    "**\"The E-Commerce Envy\" Podcast**: Launch a podcast where successful e-commerce entrepreneurs share their stories of overcoming jealousy and achieving success. Each episode would focus on a different aspect of e-commerce, such as marketing, product development, or supply chain management. The twist? The podcast would also feature a \"Jealousy Segment\" where listeners can share their own feelings of jealousy and receive advice from the guests.",
    "**\"Jealousy-Driven Innovation\" Hackathon**: Host a hackathon where participants are tasked with building innovative solutions to e-commerce-related challenges. The twist? Each participant is given a \"Jealousy Card\" that outlines a specific challenge or problem that they're jealous of in others. The participant's goal is to create a solution that not only addresses the challenge but also acknowledges and overcomes their own jealousy. The hackathon would culminate in a pitch competition where the winning teams would receive funding and support to turn their ideas into reality. [/INST] "
