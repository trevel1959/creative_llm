    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Develop a portable, solar-powered umbrella that can be set up in a public area or at home. The umbrella would have a built-in LED light system, which would be powered by a small solar panel on the umbrella's canopy. This would provide a reliable source of light during the day, even if the sun didn't rise. The umbrella could also be equipped with a USB port to charge other devices, making it a multi-functional solution.",
    "**LED Streetlight Network**: Establish a network of LED streetlights that can be powered by a combination of solar panels and energy storage systems. These streetlights would be strategically placed throughout the city, providing a comprehensive lighting solution. The energy storage systems would ensure that the lights remain on even if the solar panels are not generating enough power.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Develop a system that uses bioluminescent plants to produce light. These plants would be genetically engineered to produce a sustainable and long-lasting light source. The plants could be placed in public areas, such as parks or gardens, to provide a unique and eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "**Reflective Road Markings**: Design and implement a system of reflective road markings that can be used to guide pedestrians and vehicles during the day. These markings would be made from a special reflective material that can be charged by the moon's light or artificial lighting. This would provide a safe and reliable way to navigate during the day, even without the sun.",
    "**Personal Light-Generating Wearables**: Create wearable devices that can generate light using advanced technologies such as thermoelectricity or piezoelectricity. These wearables would be designed to be worn on the body, providing a personal light source that can be adjusted to different levels of brightness. This would allow individuals to move around safely and confidently during the day, even without the sun. [/INST] "
