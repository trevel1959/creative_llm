    "**Radiation Exposure**: Space is filled with harmful cosmic radiation that can pose serious health risks to astronauts. Designing effective shielding that is lightweight yet robust enough to protect the crew is a significant challenge. Engineers could explore innovative materials, such as polyethylene or water, which are effective at blocking radiation. Additionally, incorporating safe zones within the spacecraft where astronauts can retreat during solar flares or increased radiation events would enhance safety.",
    "**Microgravity Effects on the Human Body**: Prolonged exposure to microgravity can lead to muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and fluid redistribution in the body. To address these issues, the spaceship could be equipped with advanced exercise equipment that simulates resistance training and promotes bone health. Moreover, the design could include a rotating section of the spacecraft to create artificial gravity, providing a more Earth-like environment for the crew.",
    "**Resource Management**: Efficiently managing resources such as food, water, and energy is critical for long-duration missions. The spaceship could incorporate hydroponic or aeroponic systems for growing fresh food, alongside advanced recycling systems for water. Smart energy management systems could be integrated to optimize energy use, drawing from solar panels or nuclear sources, and ensuring that the crew has a continuous supply of essential resources.",
    "**Communication Delays**: Communication with Earth can be significantly delayed due to the vast distances in space. This can hinder real-time decision-making and support for the crew. To counter this, the spaceship could utilize an AI-driven assistant that can provide immediate support and troubleshooting for common issues. Additionally, creating a robust database of procedures and protocols that the crew can access offline would empower them to make informed decisions without waiting for Earth-based support.",
    "**Psychological Challenges**: The isolation and confinement of space travel can lead to psychological stress among the crew. To address this, the spaceship design could include dedicated spaces for relaxation and recreation, such as virtual reality environments or areas for social interaction. Regular communication with loved ones back on Earth, facilitated by video calls or messages, could also help maintain morale and mental well-being during long missions."
