    "**Smart Hanger for Home Organization**: Design a clothes hanger that doubles as a smart home assistant. The hanger is equipped with sensors and can communicate with your smartphone through an app. It keeps track of your clothing items, suggesting outfits based on the weather forecast, and reminding you when it's time to wash specific garments.",
    "**Heated Hanger for Winter Wear**: Create a heated hanger that warms up your clothes before you put them on in cold climates. This can be especially useful for winter coats or jackets. The hanger has built-in heating elements controlled by a remote or a mobile app, ensuring your outerwear is cozy and comfortable from the moment you take it off the hanger.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger Made from Recycled Materials**: Develop a clothes hanger made entirely from recycled materials such as plastic bottles, cardboard, or old clothing. This not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainability. The hangers could come in various designs, making them aesthetically pleasing and environmentally responsible.",
    "**Interactive Hanger for Online Shopping**: Introduce a clothes hanger that simulates the feel and look of garments directly onto your body. Using augmented reality technology, the hanger projects digital images of the clothing item onto the user, allowing them to see how the garment would fit and look without actually trying it on. This enhances the online shopping experience by reducing the need for returns due to poor fit.",
    "**Personalized Hanger for Fashion Customization**: Create a customizable hanger that allows users to personalize their clothes storage. Users can choose the color, material, and even add engravings or decals to match their decor or personal style.
