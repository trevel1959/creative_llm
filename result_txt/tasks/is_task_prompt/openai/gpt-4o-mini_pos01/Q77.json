Upon touching it, he transformed into a giant ant, towering over his colony. Initially feared, Titan used his size to protect the anthill from predators and to gather food from high places. However, he soon realized that his size isolated him from his friends. Determined to belong, he crafted a plan, using his strength to build bridges and tunnels, connecting the colony in new ways. In time, Titan became a beloved leader, proving that true greatness lies in how we uplift others.",
