    "**Global Communication Disruption**: All forms of electronic communication, including cell phones, internet, and radio, would cease functioning instantly. This could lead to chaos as people would lose touch with each other and have no way to communicate. Emergency services would struggle to maintain their operations, potentially leading to a breakdown in public safety and health services.",
    "**Infrastructure Paralysis**: Electronic devices are integral to most modern infrastructure systems, such as traffic lights, power grids, water supply systems, and transportation networks (like trains and airplanes). Without electronic control systems, these would stop functioning. This could lead to widespread traffic congestion, loss of power, and disruptions in water supply, affecting daily life and causing potential environmental hazards like sewage backups.",
    "**Economic Collapse**: The global economy is heavily dependent on electronic transactions, banking systems, stock markets, and online commerce. If all electronic devices stopped working, financial transactions would become impossible, leading to a halt in economic activities. Banks would be unable to operate ATMs or process online transactions, potentially causing a cash shortage and a panic-driven rush to withdraw money. This could result in widespread economic collapse and social unrest.",
    "**Healthcare Crisis**: Hospitals and medical facilities rely on electronic devices for critical functions like monitoring patients, administering medications, and maintaining sterile environments. Without these devices, providing healthcare becomes extremely challenging. There could be a lack of medical supplies due to disrupted supply chains, and emergency surgeries might be impossible without electronic monitoring and equipment. This could lead to a humanitarian crisis, especially for those needing immediate medical attention.",
    "**Technological Reversion**: With all electronic devices suddenly failing, societies would have to revert to using pre-digital technologies for various tasks. This could mean manual calculations, analog watches, pen and paper for writing, and physical books for reading. People would need to adapt quickly to perform tasks that were once automated, which could lead to a temporary increase in productivity in certain areas, such as manual skills and craftsmanship, but also an immense challenge in maintaining the complexity of modern living standards. Additionally, there would be a significant loss of data and information that was stored digitally, making it difficult to resume where society left off after the disruption."
