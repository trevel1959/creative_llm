    "**Temperature and Humidity Control Zones**: Design the refrigerator with customizable temperature and humidity control zones. Different compartments could be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For example, fruits and vegetables could have a slightly higher humidity to prolong freshness, while meats could be kept at a lower temperature to prevent spoilage. This feature could be controlled via a touchscreen interface or a smartphone app.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature using UV-C light technology. The interior of the refrigerator could periodically activate UV-C lights that eliminate bacteria and odors without the need for harsh chemicals. This would help maintain a hygienic environment and reduce the frequency of manual cleaning, making it more convenient for users.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Display**: Replace the traditional refrigerator door with an interactive touchscreen display that serves multiple functions. Users could browse recipes, watch cooking tutorials, or even leave notes for family members. The display could also connect to calendars, allowing families to sync meal planning and grocery shopping directly from the fridge.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Solar Panel Integration**: Design refrigerators with built-in solar panels that harness energy from sunlight. This feature would allow the refrigerator to operate on renewable energy, reducing electricity bills and environmental impact. It could also have a backup battery system to store excess energy for nighttime use.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infuser**: Create a refrigerator that includes an advanced water filtration system along with an infusion chamber. Users could fill the infusion chamber with fruits, herbs, or vegetables to create flavored water. The fridge would then dispense purified and infused water, promoting hydration and healthy drinking habits."
