    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Hydrogen fuel cells could be another solution for powering vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen in a chemical reaction, which can be used to power electric motors in vehicles. The production of hydrogen can be achieved through renewable sources such as wind, solar, or water electrolysis.",
    "**Bio-Ethanol**: Bio-ethanol, produced from plant materials, could be used as a fuel source to power vehicles. It is a renewable resource that can be produced locally, reducing the need for transportation of fuel. However, it would require significant investment in research and development to make it more efficient and cost-effective.",
    "**Hybrid Vehicles**: Hybrid vehicles, which combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor, could be a practical solution for vehicles that need to travel long distances. The electric motor can be charged using renewable energy sources, while the internal combustion engine can provide additional power when needed.",
    "**Public Transportation**: In a world without oil, public transportation would become even more critical. Investing in high-speed rail systems, buses, and trams could reduce the reliance on private vehicles and help alleviate traffic congestion.",
    "**Pedestrian and Cycling Infrastructure**: Encouraging people to walk or cycle instead of driving could be a solution for short-distance travel. This would require significant investment in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and safe crossing points."
