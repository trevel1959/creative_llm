    "Develop a Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore the zoo from the comfort of their own homes. This could include interactive exhibits, 360-degree views of animal habitats, and virtual tours led by zookeepers.",
    "Implement a Smart Feeding System: Use technology to create a smart feeding system that tracks the diet and nutritional needs of each animal in the zoo. This would help zookeepers ensure that each animal is receiving the right amount of food and nutrients, while also reducing waste and improving animal welfare.",
    "Create a Conservation Education Program: Develop an educational program that teaches visitors about the importance of conservation and how they can help protect endangered species. This could include interactive exhibits, workshops, and talks by conservationists.",
    "Use Augmented Reality to Enhance the Visitor Experience: Use augmented reality technology to create an immersive experience for visitors. This could include virtual animal encounters, augmented reality maps that allow visitors to explore the zoo in a new way, and interactive exhibits that use augmented reality to bring animals to life.",
    "Implement a Sustainable Energy System: Use renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, to power the zoo. This would help reduce the zoo's carbon footprint and set an example for other institutions to follow. Additionally, the energy generated could be used to power electric vehicles and other sustainable transportation options for visitors."
