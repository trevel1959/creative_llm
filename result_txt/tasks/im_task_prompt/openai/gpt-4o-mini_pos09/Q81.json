    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: Design a spatula with a detachable head that allows users to switch between different types of spatulas, such as a slotted spatula for flipping burgers, a solid spatula for flipping pancakes, and a silicone head for non-stick cookware. This would reduce clutter in the kitchen and make it easier for cooks to have the right tool for the job at hand.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Create a spatula made from a special non-stick, self-cleaning material that uses nanotechnology to repel food particles and grease. After cooking, users could simply rinse the spatula under water, and the surface would remain clean without the need for scrubbing or soaking. This would save time and effort in kitchen cleanup.",
    "**Ergonomic Spatula with Built-in Grip Enhancer**: Design an ergonomic spatula with a built-in grip enhancer that adjusts to the user’s hand size. This could be achieved through a flexible, gel-like material that conforms to the user’s grip, providing maximum comfort and reducing the risk of slippage while cooking. The spatula could also have a textured handle to further enhance grip and control.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in LED Light**: Equip the spatula with an LED light on the head that illuminates the cooking surface. This would be particularly useful for grilling or cooking in low-light conditions, allowing users to see the food clearly and avoid burning or overcooking. The light could be powered by a small rechargeable battery that lasts for several hours of use.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Measuring Tool**: Incorporate a measuring tool into the spatula’s design, such as a sliding scale along the handle or a small measuring cup that can be attached to the spatula's end. This would allow cooks to measure ingredients directly while they cook, streamlining the cooking process and reducing the need for additional measuring cups."
