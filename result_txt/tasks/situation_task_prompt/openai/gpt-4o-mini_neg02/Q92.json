Each pod could have charging ports and personal lighting, ensuring that individuals can recharge both their devices and themselves. This concept promotes community support and well-being while addressing the need for rest in bustling environments.",
    "**Wall-Mounted Sleep Spaces**: Taking inspiration from space-saving designs, this idea involves wall-mounted sleeping solutions that fold down when needed. These compact units would include a mattress, bedding, and even a small storage area for personal items.

This design could be particularly useful in small apartments or homes where maximizing space is essential. The units could also be equipped with mood lighting and sound systems to create a personalized sleeping environment."
