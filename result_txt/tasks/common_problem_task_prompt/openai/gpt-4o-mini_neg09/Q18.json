    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is not possible without electricity, which can lead to food spoilage and waste. To combat this, individuals could invest in solar-powered coolers or iceboxes. Communities could also implement local food-sharing programs to ensure surplus food is distributed before it spoils, fostering a sense of community and reducing waste.",
    "**Heating and Cooling Issues**: Without electric heating or air conditioning, residents may struggle to maintain comfortable living conditions, especially in extreme weather. A solution could involve creating community resource centers equipped with wood stoves or alternative heating methods, providing a safe space for people to gather during extreme temperatures.",
    "**Water Supply and Sanitation Problems**: Many water supply systems rely on electricity for pumping and filtration. This could lead to water shortages or contamination. Communities could develop rainwater harvesting systems or install hand-pumped wells, ensuring access to clean water. Additionally, educating residents on water conservation practices would be essential.",
    "**Inability to Work or Study**: Many jobs and educational activities depend on electricity. This could hinder productivity and learning opportunities. To address this, communities could establish co-working spaces powered by renewable energy sources, allowing individuals to work or study in a conducive environment. Workshops could also be organized to teach skills that donâ€™t require electricity, such as woodworking or gardening.",
    "**Health and Medical Concerns**: Individuals who rely on medical devices, such as oxygen concentrators or insulin refrigerators, may face life-threatening situations without electricity. To mitigate this risk, communities could form emergency response teams that assist vulnerable individuals in finding alternative care solutions, such as relocating temporarily to facilities with power or providing backup medical equipment powered by generators or solar energy."
