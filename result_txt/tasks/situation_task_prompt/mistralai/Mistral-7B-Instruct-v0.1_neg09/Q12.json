    "Solar Panels: Solar panels can be installed on the roof of the house to harness the power of the sun and convert it into electricity. This electricity can be used to power a heat pump or electric radiators to heat the house.",
    "Geothermal Heating: Geothermal heating is a system that uses the natural heat from the earth to heat the house. This can be achieved by digging a geothermal well or using a geothermal heat pump to extract heat from the ground and distribute it throughout the house.",
    "Biomass Heating: Biomass heating involves burning organic materials such as wood, agricultural waste, or pellets to generate heat. This can be done in a wood stove or pellet boiler, and the heat can be used to heat the house and provide hot water.",
    "Passive Solar Heating: Passive solar heating involves designing the house to take advantage of the sun's natural heat. This can be achieved by using large south-facing windows to let in sunlight, and by insulating the house properly to retain the heat.",
    "Electric Heating: Electric heating can be used to heat the house, using electric radiators or heat pumps. This can be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, or by purchasing green electricity from a supplier."
