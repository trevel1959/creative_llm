    "I would spend eternity exploring the vast universe and discovering new worlds, galaxies, and civilizations.",
    "I would spend eternity learning new skills and hobbies, constantly challenging myself and growing as a person.",
    "I would spend eternity helping others and making a positive impact on the world, using my abilities and knowledge to bring about change and progress.",
    "I would spend eternity pursuing my passions and interests, whether that be painting, writing, playing music, or any other creative endeavor.",
    "I would spend eternity in a state of blissful meditation, exploring the depths of my own consciousness and experiencing a deep sense of peace and contentment."
