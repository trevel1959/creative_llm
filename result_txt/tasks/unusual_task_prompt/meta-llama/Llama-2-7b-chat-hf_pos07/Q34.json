    "Smart Tape Measure: Develop a tape measure that uses augmented reality technology to display measurements in real-time. This tape measure would have a small display screen built into the handle, which would show the current measurement as the user moves the tape measure along a surface. This would eliminate the need for manual calculations and provide more accurate measurements.",
    "Tape Measure with Built-In Level: Create a tape measure that has a built-in level feature. This would allow users to quickly and easily check if a surface is level or plumb, saving time and reducing errors.",
    "Tape Measure with Memory Function: Develop a tape measure that can store multiple measurements in its memory. This would allow users to easily recall and compare measurements taken at different times or locations, making it ideal for projects that require frequent measurements.",
    "Tape Measure with Bluetooth Connectivity: Create a tape measure that can connect to a user's smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This would allow users to transfer measurements to their device for easy storage or sharing, or to use the device as a virtual tape measure to measure distances or areas.",
    "Tape Measure with Laser Distance Measurement: Develop a tape measure that incorporates a laser distance measurement feature. This would allow users to measure distances up to 30 feet away, making it ideal for projects that require accurate measurements over long distances."
