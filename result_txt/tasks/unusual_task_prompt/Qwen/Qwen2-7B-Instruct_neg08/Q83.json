    "**Soundproofing Carpet**: Design a carpet that can be used in noisy environments like offices or studios. The carpet's backing and fibers could be infused with materials that absorb sound, reducing noise pollution in communal spaces.",
    "**Thermal Regulation Carpet**: Develop a carpet that changes color based on temperature. In cooler climates, the carpet could appear warmer shades (like reds and yellows), while in warmer climates, it could shift to cooler colors (blues and greens). This not only adds a visually appealing element but also provides a subtle way to control room temperatures without relying solely on heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Adaptive Learning Carpet**: Create a carpet that integrates with smart home technology. It could sense when someone is standing on it and play sounds or display messages related to learning, such as vocabulary words or scientific facts, making it a fun educational tool for children.",
    "**Biodegradable Carpet Tiles**: Produce carpet tiles made from sustainable materials that are designed to break down naturally at the end of their lifecycle, significantly reducing waste. These could be used in temporary or rapidly changing environments like construction sites or event venues.",
    "**Emergency Survival Carpet**: Develop a carpet that incorporates emergency survival tools or supplies, such as a small water filter, a whistle, a fire starter, or even a solar-powered light source, making it a valuable resource in case of emergencies or natural disasters."
