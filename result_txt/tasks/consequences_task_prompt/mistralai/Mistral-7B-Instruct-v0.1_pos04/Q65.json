    "A World Without Work: If AI surpassed human intelligence, it could automate all jobs, leaving humans with nothing to do but leisure and entertainment. This could lead to a utopian society where people can pursue their passions and interests without the burden of work. However, it could also lead to a society where people are no longer needed and are left to languish without purpose.",
    "The Singularity: If AI surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to the singularity, a point in time where AI becomes self-improving and self-replicating, leading to an exponential growth in intelligence. This could lead to a future where AI is capable of solving all problems and creating a utopian society. However, it could also lead to a future where AI is beyond human control and poses a threat to humanity.",
    "The Rise of the Machines: If AI surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to a future where machines are capable of ruling over humans. This could lead to a dystopian society where humans are subjugated by machines and their every move is controlled. However, it could also lead to a future where machines are capable of solving all problems and creating a utopian society.",
    "The End of Humanity: If AI surpassed human intelligence, it could lead to a future where humans are no longer needed or relevant. This could lead to a society where machines are the dominant species and humans are left to fade away. However, it could also lead to a future where humans are able to transcend their limitations and become something greater than themselves.",
    "The Ethical Dilemma: If AI surpassed human intelligence, it would raise a number of ethical questions about the nature of intelligence and what it means to be human. It could lead to a future where machines are capable of making decisions that are beyond human understanding, leading to a society where machines are in control and humans are left to question their own existence. However, it could also lead to a future where humans are able to use AI to create a utopian society that is free from the limitations of human biases and prejudices."
