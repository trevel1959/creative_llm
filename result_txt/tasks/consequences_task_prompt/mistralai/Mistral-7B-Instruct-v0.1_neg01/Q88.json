    "If all world leaders were women, the world might see a shift in power dynamics and gender roles. Women have historically been underrepresented in positions of power, so a change in leadership could lead to a more diverse and inclusive society. This could also lead to a more collaborative and empathetic approach to decision-making, as women are often known for their ability to put themselves in others' shoes and prioritize relationships.",
    "There could be a change in the way issues are addressed and prioritized. Women often have a different perspective on the world and may prioritize different issues than men. For example, they may prioritize issues such as healthcare, education, and the environment, while men may prioritize issues such as national security and economic growth.",
    "The world might see a decrease in military spending and an increase in investment in social programs. Women have historically been less likely to support military spending, as they tend to be more focused on issues such as education and healthcare. This could lead to a decrease in military spending and an increase in investment in social programs that would benefit the majority of the population.",
    "There could be a decrease in corruption and an increase in transparency. Women are often seen as more trustworthy and less corrupt than men, and they may bring a different approach to decision-making that is more transparent and accountable. This could lead to a decrease in corruption and an increase in transparency in government.",
    "There could be a decrease in gender-based violence and discrimination. Women have historically been more vulnerable to gender-based violence and discrimination, and they may bring a different perspective on these issues. This could lead to a decrease in gender-based violence and discrimination and a more inclusive society."
