    "**Light Art Installation**: Since there's no paint to use for traditional wall decorations, you can create a stunning light art installation. Use LED strips or string lights in various colors and patterns to illuminate your walls. You can hang them directly from the ceiling or attach them to the walls. This will not only add a unique aesthetic but also change the mood of the room depending on the color and intensity of the lights.",
    "**Textured Wall Panels**: Instead of painting, you can create textured walls using materials like wood, metal, or fabric. For instance, you could create a panel wall using reclaimed wood, each piece sanded and stained differently to create a natural, rustic look. Alternatively, use metal sheets that can be hammered into different shapes, or create fabric panels that are sewn together to form a unique, abstract design.",
    "**Mosaic Murals**: Utilize small tiles, stones, or even seashells to create intricate mosaic murals. Start by sketching your design on the wall, then arrange the tiles to match it. This method requires patience and precision, but the result can be an eye-catching and unique piece of art. It's a great way to personalize your space and add depth and texture.",
    "**Decoupage Walls**: The decoupage technique involves gluing printed paper onto a surface, usually followed by varnish to protect it. Collect magazines, newspapers, or other printed materials, cut out images and patterns, and paste them onto your walls. Once the glue dries, apply a clear coat over the entire surface to seal the artwork. This creates a collage-like effect that can be customized to reflect your personal style.",
    "**Washi Tape and Tissue Paper Art**: If you have access to washi tape and tissue paper, you can create a colorful and artistic wall decoration. Use the washi tape as a guide to arrange pieces of tissue paper in geometric patterns or free-form designs. The translucent nature of the tissue paper allows light to pass through, creating a soft, diffused glow. This method is not only visually appealing but also easy to create, making it perfect for beginners or those who prefer a simpler approach."
