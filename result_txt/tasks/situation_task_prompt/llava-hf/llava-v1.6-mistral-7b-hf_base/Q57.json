    "Underwater Cities: Building cities beneath the ocean water. This would involve constructing water-tight structures deep beneath the water surface, with extensive water-filtration systems to ensure clean air and a sustainable living environment. Infrastructure could include transportation, food production, and recreational facilities.",
    "Vertical Dwellings on Coastal Cities: Building multi-tiered vertical structures along coastal cities, utilizing the limited land space available. This would allow for population densities to increase without expanding horizontally. These structures could integrate agriculture and utilize natural barriers like sea walls or mangroves.",
    "Seasteading/Offshore Nations: Developing floating communities in seasteeds, which are boats or ships that have been repurposed for living. These seasteads could house small communities with living spaces, agriculture, and essential utilities. They would move based on favorable weather conditions and currents, allowing for adaptable living.",
    "Biodegradable and Adaptive Architecture: Invent innovative designs that can degrade and grow over time, mimicking the natural growth of coral structures. These constructions could blend seamlessly with the water environment and adapt to changing ocean levels.",
    "Subaqueous Tunnels: Constructing subaqueous tunnels within coastal areas to create underground living spaces, bypassing the risks of rising sea levels. These tunnels could be built with high-strength materials to support enormous water pressure, ensuring the safety of occupants."
