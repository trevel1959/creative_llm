    "Design a skateboard with adjustable/swappable decks, allowing riders to change the type of deck (e.g., street, vert, cruiser) based on their riding style and preferences. This feature would cater to a wider range of skateboarding disciplines.",
    "Implement a shock-absorption system into the skateboard's deck, similar to what is used in mountain bikes, to provide better cushioning and prevent injuries during falls.",
    "Develop a skateboard with an integrated battery pack that can be used to power accessories such as lights, speakers, or even a small motor to propel the board. This would not only make the skateboard more versatile but also potentially transform it into a personal electric vehicle.",
    "Introduce specialized skateboard trucks that can be quickly and easily swapped out for different purposes, such as racing, carving, or even snowboarding. This feature would allow the skateboard to be used in multiple scenarios and sporting events.",
    "Design a skateboard with built-in safety features, such as a handlebar grip for beginners or retractable safety rails for grinding and sliding, reducing the risk of falls and injuries."
