    "Environmental concerns: Another potential problem is the impact that development has on the environment. City planning for tourism often involves constructing new buildings, hotels, and infrastructures to accommodate visitors. However, this can lead to issues such as water scarcity, pollution, and land degradation. To address this, cities could opt for eco-friendly tourism practices that minimize the negative impact on the environment.",
    "Uneven distribution of attractions and facilities: A common issue in developing a city's tourism industry is the uneven distribution of attractions and facilities. Tourists may find it difficult to move around the city and visit all the major attractions if they are not well-connected by transportation options, walking paths, or pedestrian-friendly zones. This could also detract from the tourism experience and discourage visitors from returning.",
    "Noise and air pollution: Another challenge in developing a city's tourism industry is managing noise and air pollution. Large-scale events and tourist attractions can generate a significant amount of noise and air pollution, causing discomfort and health problems for both tourists and residents. To address this, cities could adopt sustainable event management practices, limit large-scale events to designated areas, or invest in public transportation options to reduce private vehicle use.",
    "Safety and security: Another potential issue in developing a city's tourism industry is the safety and security of visitors. Cities need to ensure that tourists feel safe while exploring the city and its attractions. They could invest in security measures such as CCTV cameras, security personnel, or visitor awareness programs. Additionally, cities should work with local communities to foster a sense of ownership and pride in maintaining a safe and secure environment for visitors.",
    "Overcrowding: With the increasing popularity of a city's tourism industry, overcrowding can become a major issue. Overcrowding can lead to a dissatisfactory visitor experience, negatively impact local businesses, and increase the risk of accidents. To address this, cities could implement regulations on tourist numbers, provide visitors with maps and guides that indicate overcrowded areas, or even promote off-peak season travel."
