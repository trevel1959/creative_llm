    "Reversal of Aging: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans could potentially reverse the aging process. As we age, our bodies undergo degenerative changes, such as muscle loss, bone density reduction, and nerve damage. By regenerating limbs, we could potentially restore these lost functions, leading to a more youthful and vital appearance and increased lifespan.",
    "Enhanced Athletic Performance: Professional athletes and weekend warriors could significantly benefit from the ability to regenerate limbs. With faster healing times and increased limb durability, they could train and compete at a higher level, leading to better performance and more wins. This could also open up new avenues for sports training and competition, such as limb-based augmentations or enhancements.",
    "Injury Prevention and Treatment: Regenerating limbs like starfish could revolutionize the way we treat injuries. Instead of relying on surgery and physical therapy to repair damaged limbs, we could simply regrow new ones. This could significantly reduce the risk of complications and improve recovery times, leading to better outcomes for patients. Additionally, we could use this ability to regenerate limbs in a more targeted manner, such as regrowing only the damaged tissue or specific limb segments, leading to more precise and effective treatments.",
    "Space Exploration: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans could potentially explore space for longer periods without the fear of injury or degradation. In microgravity environments, the body experiences a variety of physiological changes, including muscle wasting, bone loss, and nerve damage. By regenerating limbs, astronauts could maintain their physical fitness and mobility, leading to more effective space exploration and longer missions. This could also open up new possibilities for space colonization and habitation.",
    "Artificial Limb Replacement: Regenerating limbs like starfish could revolutionize the field of prosthetics. Instead of relying on artificial limbs that are limited in their functionality and durability, we could regrow natural limbs that mimic the function and sensation of the originals. This could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with amputations, allowing them to perform daily tasks and activities with greater"
