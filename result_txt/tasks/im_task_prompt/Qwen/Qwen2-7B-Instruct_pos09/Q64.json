    "**Voice-activated Alarm System**: Design an alarm system that can be activated by voice commands only. This system could be integrated into smart home devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home, making it easier for users to set alarms without having to physically interact with the device. For example, a user could simply say, \"Set an alarm for 7 AM\" and the system would automatically activate.",
    "**Smart Bedside Alarm**: Create a unique alarm system in the form of a smart bedside table. This table would have a built-in alarm clock, but also include features such as a reading light, USB charging ports, and even a small nightstand drawer. The alarm could be customized with different sound options and brightness levels for the light, providing a more personalized wake-up experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Alarm Clock**: Develop an AR alarm system that uses a smartphone or tablet as the display. When the alarm goes off, it could project an engaging animation or scene on the wall, ceiling, or even on the floor. Users would need to physically interact with this virtual environment to turn off the alarm, making it a fun and interactive way to start the day.",
    "**Wearable Smart Alarm**: Introduce a wearable device like a wristband or smartwatch that wakes you up through gentle vibrations, gradually increasing in intensity until you're fully awake. This system could learn your sleep patterns over time and adjust the alarm timing and intensity accordingly. It might also provide insights into your sleep quality through its data analysis.",
    "**Scents-Based Alarm System**: In addition to sound, develop an alarm system that also releases a pleasant scent when the alarm goes off. This could be achieved using a diffuser connected to the alarm system. Different scents could be associated with different times of the day, creating a pleasant and customized morning routine. For instance, lavender could be used for relaxation in the evening, while citrus scents could be used in the morning to boost energy and focus."
