    "**Customizable Soap Dispenser**: Design a soap dispenser that can be customized by users for various purposes. This could include different dispensing modes (spray, foam, liquid), adjustable dispensing amounts, and color-changing LED lights to indicate when the soap is low. Users can choose their preferred mode based on their specific needs, such as gentle foaming for sensitive skin or a stronger spray for kitchen cleaning.",
    "**Sustainable Soap Dispenser**: Create an eco-friendly soap dispenser made from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This dispenser can also feature a built-in filter to separate the soap from water, reducing waste and making it easier to refill. The dispenser can come in different sizes and shapes to fit any bathroom decor, promoting sustainability without compromising aesthetics.",
    "**Smart Soap Dispenser**: Develop a smart soap dispenser that connects to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and can be controlled via smartphone apps or voice commands. The dispenser can monitor usage patterns and alert the user when it's running low on soap. It could also integrate with other smart home devices, like the water heater, to optimize water usage during dispensing.",
    "**Therapeutic Soap Dispenser**: Design a dispenser that incorporates aromatherapy into its design. The dispenser could release essential oils into the air while dispensing soap, providing a relaxing experience during handwashing. Users can select different scents for various moods or activities, enhancing personal well-being.",
    "**Hygienic Soap Dispenser**: Introduce a high-tech soap dispenser equipped with ultraviolet light or ozone technology to sanitize the soap before use. This feature ensures that users are washing their hands with clean, germ-free soap, especially in public settings. The dispenser could also have touchless operation, further minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. "
