    "Carve Data Into Stone: One approach to storing information without digital technology would be to carve it into stone. This could involve inscribing data onto stone tablets or creating 3D printed stone structures with encoded information. The information would be permanent and resistant to natural disasters or other catastrophic events that could result in data loss.",
    "DNA Data Storage: Another option would be to use DNA as a storage medium. This involves encoding data into strands of DNA, which can be stored in a variety of media, including dry powder, liquid, or solid supports. The information can be retrieved by reading the DNA sequence using specialized machines, providing a highly durable and long-term storage solution.",
    "Holographic Data Storage: Holographic data storage involves encoding data onto holographic media, which can store information in the form of interference patterns. This method allows for high storage densities and can be used in a variety of applications, including data recovery and reproduction. The holographic data can be stored on various materials, such as photopolymer or glass.",
    "Crystal Radio Communication: In this approach, information can be encoded onto crystals and used as a communication medium. The crystals would act as natural antennas, transmitting the encoded data through radio waves. This method would be useful for long-distance communication in areas without existing communication infrastructure.",
    "Memory Moss: Memory moss is a type of fungus that can store information by modifying its genetic material. Researchers have found that certain species of moss can retain information for extended periods, making it a potential candidate for long-term data storage. By engineering the moss to encode and decode data, it could be used as a biological storage medium."
