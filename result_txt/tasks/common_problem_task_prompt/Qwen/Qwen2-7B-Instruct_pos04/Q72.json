    "**Solar-Powered Vertical Farms**: Designing a solar-powered vertical farm that uses solar panels on its rooftops to generate electricity while growing crops in an efficient, space-saving manner. The system could also incorporate rainwater harvesting for irrigation, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. ",
    "**Geothermal Power Plant with Hydrothermal Reservoirs**: Constructing a geothermal power plant utilizing hydrothermal reservoirs. This method involves drilling into a natural hot spring or geothermal area and extracting heat directly from the Earth's core. The steam generated can then be used to drive turbines, producing electricity. ",
    "**Wind Turbine Forests**: Establishing wind turbine forests in areas where traditional wind farms are not feasible due to topography or urban landscapes. These forests could be designed as integrated urban parks, providing clean energy while enhancing the environment and recreational spaces.",
    "**Biomass Energy Farm with Waste Management System**: Creating a biomass energy farm that utilizes organic waste materials (such as agricultural residues, food waste, and forestry byproducts) to produce bioenergy. Implement a comprehensive waste management system that includes composting, anaerobic digestion, and possibly even biogas production, which can be used to generate electricity.",
    "**Hybrid Solar-Wind Energy System**: Building a hybrid solar-wind energy system that combines both solar panels and wind turbines in a single facility. This system would be optimized based on local weather patterns, using solar panels during the day when sunlight is abundant and wind turbines at night or during periods of low sunlight. This ensures a more consistent energy supply than relying solely on either source."
