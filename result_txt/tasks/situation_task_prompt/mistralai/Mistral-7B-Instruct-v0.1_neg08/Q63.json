    "Develop a password-protected lockbox: If all keys disappeared, you would need a secure way to store important documents and valuables. One solution could be to invest in a password-protected lockbox that can be accessed via a digital keypad or biometric authentication. This would allow you to secure your belongings without the need for physical keys.",
    "Implement a keyless entry system: Another option would be to install a keyless entry system for your home or office. This could involve using a smartphone app or key fob to unlock doors, which would eliminate the need for physical keys altogether.",
    "Use a combination lock: If you have items that you need to secure on a daily basis, such as a laptop or purse, you could use a combination lock instead of a key. This would allow you to set a unique code that only you know, which would prevent others from accessing your belongings.",
    "Use a security camera: If you have a lot of valuable items that you need to secure, you could install a security camera to monitor your property. This would allow you to keep an eye on your belongings at all times, and you could receive alerts if anyone tries to access your property.",
    "Keep a spare key hidden: While it may not be the most secure option, you could keep a spare key hidden somewhere on your property. This would allow you to access your belongings in the event that all keys disappear, but it would also increase the risk of someone else finding the key and using it to gain access to your property."
