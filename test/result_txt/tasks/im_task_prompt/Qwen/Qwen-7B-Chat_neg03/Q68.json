    "Create a calculator that can perform complex mathematical operations such as integration, differentiation, and solving differential equations. This could be a web-based tool or a mobile app that uses machine learning algorithms to provide accurate results in real-time.",
    "Design a calculator that can recognize handwriting input and convert it into text. This would allow users to enter mathematical expressions using their finger or a stylus, rather than typing them out on a keyboard. The calculator could also include features like voice recognition and natural language processing to make it more user-friendly.",
    "Develop a calculator that can perform calculations in different languages. This would be useful for students who are learning foreign languages and need to perform math problems in those languages. The calculator could also include a feature that translates English math problems into other languages, making it easier for non-native speakers to use.",
    "Create a calculator that can simulate real-world scenarios. For example, a financial calculator could help users calculate loan payments, interest rates, and investment returns. A physics calculator could help users solve problems related to mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.",
    "Design a calculator that can learn from its users' behavior and adapt to their preferences over time. This could be done by analyzing the types of calculations the user performs most often and suggesting new functions or features that would be useful to them. The calculator could also track the user's progress and provide personalized feedback to help them improve their math skills."
