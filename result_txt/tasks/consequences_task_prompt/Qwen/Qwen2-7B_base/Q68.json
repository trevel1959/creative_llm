    "We could help in mitigating the effects of climate change: Fossil fuel burning is one of the major contributing factors to climate change, which is caused by a buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If humans could photosynthesize, they could potentially absorb those gases back into their bodies, thus reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigating the effects of climate change.",
    "We could have a much greater diversity of diets: Human's diet is largely limited due to our inability to produce our own food. With the ability to photosynthesize, we could eat plants in a more sustainable and diverse manner, which would benefit the environment as well.",
    "We could extend our life expectancy: With the help of photosynthesis, our bodies could heal themselves more effectively, and we could have access to more nutrients with no risk of overeating.",
    "We could potentially change the ecosystem: With humans being able to photosynthesize, it could have a profound impact on the ecosystem. The increase in human populations due to the ability to photosynthesize could potentially deplete resources and disrupt ecosystems.",
    "The ability to photosynthesize would shift the balance of power: The ability to produce our own energy would make us equal to, if not surpass, some nonrenewable energy sources in terms of energy provision. This could shift the balance of power between nations and countries."
