    "**Luminescent Clothing**: Design clothing that is infused with a luminescent material that absorbs light during daylight hours and releases it at night. This could involve special fabrics or fibers that glow in the dark when exposed to light. The wearer could have an outfit specifically designed for use on days without sunlight.",
    "**Moonlight Enhancement Systems**: Develop a system that captures moonlight using large mirrors or reflective surfaces and directs it into areas where it is needed. These systems could be installed in key locations like roads, streets, parks, and public squares. They might also include adjustable reflectors to focus the moonlight in specific directions or to enhance the light intensity in certain areas.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Cultivate plants that produce their own light through bioluminescence. This could be achieved through genetic modification or selective breeding of plants that already exhibit bioluminescence. These plants could be planted along sidewalks, in gardens, and public spaces to provide natural lighting.",
    "**Solar-Powered Light Collectors**: Design and implement a network of solar-powered light collectors that capture and store sunlight during the day. These collectors could be integrated into buildings, streets, or other infrastructure. The stored energy could then be used to power streetlights, home lights, and other necessary electrical devices during the absence of sunlight.",
    "**Light-Reflecting Nanotechnology**: Create a nanoscale coating that can be applied to surfaces to increase their reflectivity. This coating would amplify any available light, whether from artificial sources or natural light entering buildings. It could be used on windows, walls, and ceilings to enhance interior lighting, reducing the need for artificial illumination."
