    "**Adjustable Blade Tension**: Design scissors with an adjustable tension mechanism that allows users to customize the tightness of the blades. This would be particularly useful for different materials; for example, users could loosen the tension for delicate fabrics or tighten it for thicker materials, improving cutting efficiency and reducing hand fatigue.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Multi-Function Handle**: Create scissors with an ergonomic handle that includes multiple functions. The handle could feature a built-in grip for various cutting angles, a retractable utility knife, or even a compartment for small tools like a screwdriver or a seam ripper. This would make the scissors versatile for crafters and DIY enthusiasts.",
    "**Color-Coded Blades for Material Types**: Introduce color-coded blades designed for specific materials (e.g., fabric, paper, plastic). Each color could indicate the best use, helping users quickly grab the right pair of scissors for the task. The blades could also have different shapes (like serrated edges) to improve cutting effectiveness for certain materials.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Innovate scissors with self-sharpening blades that maintain their edge over time. This could be achieved through a built-in mechanism that sharpens the blades slightly every time the scissors are closed, ensuring they remain effective without the need for manual sharpening.",
    "**Scissors with Interchangeable Blades**: Develop a pair of scissors that allows users to easily swap out blades depending on their needs. Users could choose from different blade types (straight, pinking, rotary) and lengths, making the scissors adaptable for various projects. The handle could feature a locking mechanism to secure the blades in place."
