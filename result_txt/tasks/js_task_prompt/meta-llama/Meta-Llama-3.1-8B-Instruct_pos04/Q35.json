    "**The Dodo (Raphus cucullatus)**: A large, flightless bird native to the island of Mauritius. Its reintroduction could help restore the island's ecosystem and provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the behavior and biology of a bird that has been extinct for over 300 years.",
    "**The Woolly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius)**: A large mammal that roamed the Earth during the Ice Age. Its reintroduction could provide insights into the evolution of mammals and the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Additionally, the mammoth's ability to survive in cold climates could make it a valuable asset for studying and mitigating the effects of climate change.",
    "**The Quagga (Equus quagga quagga)**: A subspecies of zebra that was once found in large numbers in South Africa. Its reintroduction could help restore the diversity of African savannas and provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the behavior and biology of a zebra subspecies that has been extinct for over 100 years.",
    "**The Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis)**: A flightless bird that was once found in the North Atlantic. Its reintroduction could help restore the diversity of seabird populations and provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the behavior and biology of a bird that has been extinct for over 100 years.",
    "**The Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus)**: A carnivorous marsupial that was once found in Australia and Tasmania. Its reintroduction could provide insights into the evolution of marsupials and the impact of human activity on ecosystems. Additionally, the thylacine's unique biology and behavior could make it a valuable asset for studying and mitigating the effects of invasive species on native ecosystems."
