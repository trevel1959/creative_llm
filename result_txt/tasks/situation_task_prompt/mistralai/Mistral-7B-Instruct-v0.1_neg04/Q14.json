    "I would use nature as my music instruments. For example, I could use the wind to create a flute-like sound, the rain to create a drum-like sound, and the leaves to create a percussion-like sound.",
    "I would use my voice to create music. I could sing and hum different tones and rhythms to create a variety of sounds.",
    "I would use household objects as music instruments. For example, I could use a plastic bottle as a drum, a wooden spoon as a maraca, and a jar as a xylophone.",
    "I would use technology to create music. I could use a music app on my phone or computer to create and record different sounds and rhythms.",
    "I would collaborate with other people to create music. I could gather a group of people and have them make music together using whatever resources they have available."
