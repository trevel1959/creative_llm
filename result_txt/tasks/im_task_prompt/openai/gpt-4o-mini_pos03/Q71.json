    "**Integrated Sleep Tracker**: Incorporate a lightweight, flexible sleep tracking system within the sleeping bag's lining. This system could monitor the user’s sleep patterns, body temperature, and movement throughout the night. The data could be synced to a smartphone app, providing insights into sleep quality and suggestions for improvement, making it ideal for outdoor enthusiasts who want to optimize their rest.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sleeping bag system where users can add or remove sections based on their needs. For instance, users could attach a waterproof bottom section for wet conditions or a thermal top section for cold nights. This adaptability would allow campers to customize their sleeping experience based on the environment and personal comfort preferences.",
    "**Built-in Mosquito Netting**: Design a sleeping bag with an integrated, retractable mosquito netting system. The netting could be stored in a small pocket at the head of the bag and easily pulled out and secured around the bag’s opening. This feature would be especially beneficial for camping in areas with high insect activity, providing a bug-free sleeping environment without the need for additional gear.",
    "**Self-Inflating Pillow and Mattress**: Integrate a self-inflating pillow and mattress into the sleeping bag. Using an air chamber system, the pillow could inflate automatically when the bag is unrolled, providing head and body support. This feature would enhance comfort without the need for extra gear, making it perfect for backpackers who prioritize lightweight packing.",
    "**Built-in Entertainment System**: Embed a compact, waterproof entertainment system into the sleeping bag, featuring Bluetooth speakers and a small, flexible screen that can display movies or play music. This would allow campers to enjoy entertainment while cozying up in their sleeping bag, perfect for family camping trips or solo adventures where relaxation is key."
