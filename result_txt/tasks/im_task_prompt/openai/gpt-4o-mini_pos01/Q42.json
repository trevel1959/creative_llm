    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Compartments**: Design a suitcase with modular compartments that can be easily swapped out based on the type of trip. For example, a traveler could use a larger compartment for clothes and a smaller one for tech gadgets, or switch to a compartment designed specifically for sports equipment. This would allow for greater customization and organization.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Solar Charging**: Create a suitcase made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or organic fabrics. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the exterior that can charge devices on the go, ensuring that travelers have access to power for their gadgets without relying solely on outlets.",
    "**Built-in Weight Sensors and Smart Scale**: Equip the suitcase with built-in weight sensors that can alert users when they are approaching the weight limit for checked baggage. This feature could be paired with a digital display that shows the weight as items are added, helping travelers avoid unexpected fees at the airport.",
    "**Integrated GPS Tracking and Anti-Theft Features**: Implement GPS tracking within the suitcase that can be monitored through a mobile app. This would allow travelers to locate their luggage if it gets lost. Additionally, include anti-theft features like a locking mechanism that can be controlled via the app, making it harder for thieves to access the suitcase.",
    "**Expandable and Collapsible Design**: Design a suitcase that can expand or collapse based on the traveler's needs. It could have zippers or folds that allow it to go from a compact size for weekend trips to a larger size for longer journeys. This would make it versatile and save space when not in use."
