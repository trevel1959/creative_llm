    "In a treehouse: If my house were to disappear, I would build a treehouse in a nearby forest. It would be a sustainable and eco-friendly living space that allows me to connect with nature and enjoy the fresh air.",
    "On a boat: I would rent a boat and live on the water. This would give me the freedom to travel wherever I want and enjoy the peace and quiet of the open sea.",
    "In a tiny house: I would build a tiny house that is portable and can be taken anywhere. It would be a minimalist living space that allows me to focus on the essentials and live a simple life.",
    "In a community: I would join a community of like-minded individuals who share my values and interests. We would live together in a communal space that promotes sustainability, cooperation, and personal growth.",
    "In a nomadic lifestyle: I would become a nomad and travel the world. I would live in different countries, cultures, and environments, learning new skills and experiences along the way."
