    "One potential consequence of being able to regenerate limbs like starfish is that it could lead to a significant advancement in the field of regenerative medicine. Scientists could potentially use this ability to study the regeneration process and apply it to human limb regeneration, which could have a huge impact on medical research and treatment options for people who have lost limbs.",
    "Another potential consequence is that it could lead to a shift in our understanding of the body and its ability to heal. If we can regenerate limbs like starfish, it could challenge our assumptions about the limits of regeneration and lead to new discoveries about the body's healing processes.",
    "It could also have ethical implications, as it raises questions about the use of animals for scientific research. If we are able to regenerate limbs in a lab, it could potentially reduce the need for animal testing in this area.",
    "It could also have implications for the environment, as it could potentially lead to the development of new species that are able to regenerate limbs. This could have a significant impact on ecosystems and the balance of nature.",
    "Finally, it could have implications for the evolution of the human body. If we are able to regenerate limbs like starfish, it could potentially lead to new evolutionary adaptations and changes in the way that we move and interact with the world."
