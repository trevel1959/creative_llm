    "**Adjustable Climate Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable climate zones that allow users to adjust temperature and humidity levels in different compartments based on the specific needs of various foods. For example, a crisper drawer could have higher humidity for fruits and vegetables, while a meat drawer could have a lower temperature. This feature would enhance food preservation and quality.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration and Infusion System**: Incorporate a built-in water filtration system that not only purifies water but also allows users to infuse it with fruits or herbs. A dedicated compartment could hold ingredients for infusion, and the fridge could dispense flavored water directly from a tap. This encourages hydration and offers a healthier alternative to sugary drinks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Develop a refrigerator that uses innovative cooling technology, such as thermoelectric or magnetic refrigeration, which operates without harmful refrigerants. This would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the appliance. Additionally, the fridge could be powered by solar panels, making it energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Equip the refrigerator with a large interactive touchscreen interface that serves multiple functions. Users could access recipes, create shopping lists, set reminders for food expiration, and even connect to smart home systems to control other appliances. The interface could also feature a virtual assistant that provides cooking tips and meal planning advice.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes UV light or ozone technology to sanitize the interior of the refrigerator. This would reduce the need for manual cleaning and eliminate odors and bacteria. Users could activate the cleaning cycle via a button or schedule it to run at specific times, ensuring a hygienic environment for food storage."
