    "**Solar Shower**: Develop a portable, inflatable shower system that harnesses the power of the sun to heat water for personal hygiene. The system would include a clear, insulated bag that can be filled with water, a reflective surface to concentrate sunlight, and a spray nozzle to distribute the warm water. This would be especially useful for outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responders, and individuals living in areas with limited access to clean water.",
    "**Air-Purifying Wipes**: Create a line of biodegradable, air-purifying wipes that can be used to clean the skin and also remove pollutants from the air. These wipes would contain a unique blend of natural ingredients that absorb and neutralize airborne toxins, leaving the skin feeling clean and refreshed while also improving indoor air quality.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabrics**: Develop a line of clothing and textiles infused with microorganisms that break down dirt and stains, eliminating the need for soap and water. These self-cleaning fabrics would be treated with a specialized coating that allows the microorganisms to thrive, keeping clothing and surfaces clean with minimal maintenance.",
    "**Electrostatic Cleaning Gloves**: Design a pair of gloves with built-in electrostatic charges that attract and trap dirt, dust, and other particles, allowing users to clean surfaces without the need for soap or water. The gloves would be rechargeable and adjustable, making them suitable for a variety of cleaning tasks.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Cleaning**: Harness the power of bioluminescent organisms to create a line of cleaning products that emit a soft, blue glow while cleaning surfaces. These products would contain a specialized blend of microorganisms that break down dirt and stains, leaving surfaces clean and sanitized while also providing a unique, futuristic aesthetic. The bio-luminescent effect would also help to reduce the need for harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances. </s> [/INST] "
