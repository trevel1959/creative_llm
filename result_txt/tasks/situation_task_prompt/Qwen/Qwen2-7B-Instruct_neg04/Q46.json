    "**Portable Waste Management Units**: Develop compact, portable waste management units that can be easily carried around by individuals. These units could include compartments for sorting waste into recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclables. Users can carry them when they leave their homes or workplaces and dispose of their waste in designated recycling bins or composting facilities.",
    "**Smart Trash Bags**: Introduce smart trash bags that come with sensors which alert users when they are full. The sensors could also track waste content, such as food waste or hazardous materials, to ensure proper disposal. This system would reduce the need for frequent emptying of trash cans and minimize the chances of improper waste disposal.",
    "**Wearable Waste Collection Devices**: Design wearable devices, such as wristbands or clothing items, that collect small items like scraps of paper or plastic. These devices could have small compartments or pockets that hold waste until the user reaches a designated collection point. This concept encourages people to carry their waste without the need for traditional trash cans.",
    "**Floating Trash Collectors**: Create large, floating structures that move through bodies of water, collecting waste from rivers, lakes, and oceans. These could be designed to target specific types of pollution, such as plastics, and use advanced filtration systems to separate and process the collected waste. They could be anchored or powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines.",
    "**Interactive Public Art Installations**: Transform waste collection into an interactive art experience by creating large, visually appealing public installations that encourage community participation. These installations could be designed as sculptures or large-scale murals that incorporate waste materials into their structure. Visitors could contribute their own waste to the installation, turning it into a form of art and reducing the need for traditional trash cans. This approach would not only address waste management but also raise awareness about environmental issues."
