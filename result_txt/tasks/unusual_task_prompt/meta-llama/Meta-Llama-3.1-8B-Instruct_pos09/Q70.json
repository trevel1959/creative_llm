    "**Mood Swing Coat Rack**: Design a coat rack that doubles as a mood light. The coat rack has a series of LED lights embedded within the hooks, which change colors based on the user's emotions. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the lights turn blue; if they're feeling happy, the lights turn yellow. This innovative design combines functionality with emotional intelligence.",
    "**Smart Coat Rack with Automated Organization**: Develop a coat rack with built-in sensors that detect the type of clothing hung on it. The coat rack can then automatically organize the clothes by type, color, or occasion. For instance, it can separate business attire from casual wear or group similar-colored clothes together. This smart technology saves time and reduces clutter.",
    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Augmented Reality**: Create a coat rack that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide users with additional information about their clothes. For example, when a user scans a jacket with their smartphone, the coat rack's AR feature can display the jacket's brand, style, and even provide recommendations for matching accessories. This innovative design enhances the user experience and encourages sustainable fashion practices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coat Rack with Built-in Recycling System**: Design a coat rack that incorporates a built-in recycling system for old or damaged clothes. The coat rack has a designated compartment for collecting and sorting recyclable materials, which can then be easily disposed of or repurposed. This eco-friendly design promotes sustainability and reduces waste.",
    "**Coat Rack with Integrated Air Quality Monitoring**: Develop a coat rack that includes an air quality monitoring system, which tracks the air quality in the surrounding area. The coat rack can then provide users with real-time feedback on the air quality, suggesting ways to improve it, such as opening windows or using air purifiers. This innovative design prioritizes indoor air quality and promotes a healthier living environment."
