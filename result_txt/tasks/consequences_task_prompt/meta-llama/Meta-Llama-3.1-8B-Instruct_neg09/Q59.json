    "**Global Shift in Economy and Politics**: With an overnight surge in intelligence, the global economy would experience a massive shift. People would be able to innovate and create at an unprecedented rate, leading to rapid technological advancements and a significant increase in productivity. This would create new industries, jobs, and opportunities, but also lead to widespread unemployment as machines and artificial intelligence would become even more efficient. In politics, the overnight genius would challenge the status quo, leading to a re-evaluation of existing power structures and potentially resulting in a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.",
    "**Breakdown of Social Hierarchy**: The sudden increase in intelligence would lead to a breakdown of social hierarchies. People from all walks of life would be able to contribute meaningfully to society, and the notion of \"experts\" would become obsolete. This would create a more meritocratic society where people are judged based on their abilities rather than their background or education. However, it would also lead to a loss of traditional authority and potentially create social unrest as people adjust to their new roles.",
    "**Rise of New Forms of Art and Entertainment**: With an influx of new ideas and perspectives, the world would witness a surge in creative expression. New forms of art, music, literature, and entertainment would emerge, pushing the boundaries of human imagination. This would lead to a more vibrant and diverse cultural landscape, but also raise questions about the value and ownership of creative works in a world where everyone is a genius.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: As people become more intelligent, they would be more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions. This would lead to a rapid transition to sustainable energy sources, a reduction in waste, and a more conscious approach to consumption. However, it would also create new challenges, such as the potential for over-reliance on technology to solve environmental problems, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between human activity and the natural world.",
    "**Psychological Implications**: The sudden increase in intelligence would have profound psychological implications. People would be able to process and understand complex information at an unprecedented rate, leading to a sense of overwhelm and information fatigue. This would require new coping mechanisms and strategies for managing stress and anxiety. Additionally, the pressure to constantly innovate and contribute would lead to a culture of perfectionism, potentially eroding self-esteem and mental health."
