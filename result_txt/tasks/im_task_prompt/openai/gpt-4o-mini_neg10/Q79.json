    "**Multi-Functional Hanger with Built-in Steamer**: Create a clothes hanger that includes a compact, portable steamer. This steamer could be activated with a button on the hanger and would release steam to remove wrinkles from clothing while they hang. This would save time for those in a rush, allowing them to quickly freshen up their outfits without needing to take them off the hanger.",
    "**Color-Coding System for Organization**: Develop a system of hangers with color-coded clips or hooks that correspond to different categories of clothing (e.g., casual, formal, seasonal). This would help users quickly identify and organize their clothes based on occasion or style, making it easier to pick outfits and maintain an organized closet.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hanger with Built-in Air Freshener**: Design a hanger made from sustainable materials that features a compartment for eco-friendly air fresheners. These hangers would not only hold clothes but also release pleasant scents to keep garments smelling fresh. The air freshener could be refillable, promoting sustainability and reducing waste from disposable air fresheners.",
    "**Adjustable Hanger for Different Garment Types**: Create an adjustable hanger that can change its shape and size based on the type of clothing being hung. For example, it could expand for coats and shrink for delicate blouses. This would help prevent stretching and distortion of garments, keeping them in better condition and making the closet more organized.",
    "**Hanger with Built-in UV Sterilization**: Innovate a hanger that features a UV light sterilization system. This would allow users to sanitize their clothes while they hang, eliminating bacteria and odors without the need for washing. This is particularly useful for items that are worn briefly or for delicate fabrics that cannot be washed frequently."
