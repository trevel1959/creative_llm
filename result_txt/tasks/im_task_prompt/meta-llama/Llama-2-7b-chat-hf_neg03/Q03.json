    "Smart Microwave Oven with AI-Powered Cooking: Create a microwave oven that uses artificial intelligence to optimize cooking times and methods based on the type of food being cooked. The oven would use sensors to detect the food's composition and adjust cooking parameters such as power level, cooking time, and temperature to achieve the best results.",
    "Portable Microwave Oven with Solar Power: Design a portable microwave oven that can be powered by solar energy. The oven would include solar panels on its exterior, which would charge a built-in battery during the day, allowing users to cook their meals without any electricity connection. This would be especially useful for campers, RV owners, or people living in areas with limited access to electricity.",
    "Air Fryer-Microwave Oven Combo: Create a countertop appliance that combines the functions of an air fryer and a microwave oven. The device would use hot air and microwave energy to cook a wide range of foods, including fries, chicken, and vegetables, with minimal oil and calories. It would also have a built-in grill function for cooking meats and fish.",
    "Smart Microwave Oven with Augmented Reality Display: Develop a microwave oven with an augmented reality display that shows users step-by-step cooking instructions and nutritional information for their meals. The display would use AR technology to project visuals onto a transparent surface inside the oven, making it easy for users to follow along with recipes and make adjustments as needed.",
    "Modular Microwave Oven: Design a microwave oven that consists of interchangeable modules that can be easily swapped out as users' cooking needs change. For example, one module could be dedicated to cooking frozen meals, while another module could be used for defrosting and heating up leftovers. This would allow users to customize their microwave oven to suit their specific cooking habits and preferences."
