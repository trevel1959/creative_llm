    "**Incorporating Vertical Farming Techniques**: This innovative approach involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, which can be done indoors or outdoors using vertical structures. It optimizes space, conserves water, reduces the need for pesticides, and allows year-round production. The use of LED lighting can further enhance plant growth, especially in areas with limited sunlight. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Developing a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Model**: In this model, consumers purchase shares in the farm at the beginning of the season. They then receive a weekly or bi-weekly delivery of fresh produce directly from the farm. This not only supports local farmers but also ensures that customers get fresh, seasonal produce. Confidence Score: 0.98",
