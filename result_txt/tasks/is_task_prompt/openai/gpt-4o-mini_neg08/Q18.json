    "Once, in a vibrant forest, there lived a clever fox named Felix. Unlike his peers, Felix had no tail, a fact that made him feel incomplete. One day, he overheard a group of animals gossiping about the beauty of tails. Envious, Felix devised a plan to trick them into believing that a tailless fox could be just as charming. He donned a colorful scarf, twirling and prancing through the forest. The animals, mesmerized by his confidence, soon forgot about tails. Felix learned that true beauty lies not in appearances but in how one carries oneself. From then on, he embraced his uniqueness.",
