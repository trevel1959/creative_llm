    "**Smart Power Strip with Energy Monitoring and Automation**: Design a power strip that not only provides surge protection and multiple outlets but also monitors energy consumption in real-time. The strip could be connected to a mobile app, allowing users to track their energy usage, set budgets, and receive notifications when energy consumption exceeds a certain threshold. The app could also automate tasks, such as turning off devices during peak hours or when not in use, to reduce energy waste and lower bills.",
    "**Portable Power Station with Integrated Solar Panel**: Create a portable power station that combines a high-capacity battery with an integrated solar panel. This innovative product would allow users to charge their devices on-the-go, even in remote areas with limited access to electricity. The solar panel would charge the battery during the day, and the battery would power devices at night or during periods of low sunlight. The power station could also include features like USB ports, a USB-C port, and a DC output for charging larger devices.",
    "**Smart Plug with AI-Powered Energy Efficiency**: Develop a smart plug that uses AI to optimize energy consumption by identifying and adapting to a user's behavior. The plug would learn a user's daily habits and adjust energy usage accordingly, such as turning off devices during sleep hours or when not in use. The plug could also provide real-time energy monitoring, set energy budgets, and receive notifications when energy consumption exceeds a certain threshold.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip with Integrated USB Ports**: Design a wireless charging power strip that combines the convenience of wireless charging with the functionality of traditional USB ports. The strip would include multiple USB ports for charging devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops, as well as a wireless charging pad for devices like smartphones and smartwatches. The strip could also include features like energy monitoring, surge protection, and automatic shut-off.",
    "**Modular Power System with Interchangeable Batteries and Power Sources**: Create a modular power system that allows users to easily swap out batteries and power sources as needed. The system would consist of a base unit with interchangeable batteries and power sources, such as solar panels, fuel cells, or traditional wall outlets. This innovative design would enable users to adapt to changing energy needs, such as during outdoor activities or in areas with limited access to electricity. The system could also include features like energy monitoring, automatic shut-off, and USB ports for charging devices. </s>[/INST] Assistant: These ideas aim to provide creative and original solutions for power management and energy efficiency. Each concept combines innovative features"
