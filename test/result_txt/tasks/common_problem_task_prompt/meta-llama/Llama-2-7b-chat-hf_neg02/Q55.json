    "Floating Islands Conservation Park: Create a nature conservation park that utilizes floating islands to protect and restore delicate ecosystems. These islands would be designed to mimic the natural habitats of the region, providing a safe haven for endangered species to thrive. The floating islands would be anchored to the ocean floor, creating a unique and sustainable ecosystem that promotes biodiversity and ecological balance.",
    "Time Traveler's Conservation Park: Develop a park that allows visitors to travel through different eras of the Earth's history, highlighting the impact of human activities on the environment. Visitors would be immersed in different ecosystems, from ancient forests to modern deserts, and learn about the importance of conservation through interactive exhibits and educational programs. This park would serve as a powerful reminder of the need to protect the environment and preserve biodiversity for future generations.",
    "Bioluminescent Conservation Park: Establish a park that showcases the beauty of bioluminescent organisms, using specialized lighting and design to create an immersive experience for visitors. The park would feature interactive exhibits and educational programs that highlight the importance of preserving these unique ecosystems, which are vulnerable to habitat loss and pollution. By promoting awareness and appreciation for these incredible organisms, the park would inspire visitors to take action to protect them.",
    "Underwater Biodiversity Conservation Park: Develop a park that explores the vast and diverse world of underwater ecosystems, featuring interactive exhibits and educational programs that highlight the importance of marine conservation. Visitors would be able to observe and learn about the unique species and habitats of the ocean, from coral reefs to deep-sea trenches, and learn about the impact of human activities on these ecosystems. The park would serve as a vital educational resource, inspiring visitors to take action to protect the ocean and its inhabitants.",
    "Sky Island Conservation Park: Establish a park that creates a series of interconnected \"sky islands\" or artificial mountains, providing a safe haven for endangered species to thrive. These islands would be designed to mimic the natural habitats of the region, with varying climates and ecosystems, and would be connected by elevated walkways"
