    "**Innovative Scent Diffusion System**: Design a perfume bottle that integrates an ultrasonic atomizer directly into its structure. When the cap is removed or opened, the ultrasonic waves break down the perfume into tiny particles, which are then dispersed into the air. This system allows for a more subtle and continuous scent release throughout the day, without the need for frequent reapplication.",
    "**Personalized Scent Experience**: Create a custom-made perfume bottle that can be personalized by the user. The bottle contains a microchip that stores different scent profiles, which can be selected using a smartphone app. Users can mix their own scents or choose from a variety of pre-designed combinations to suit their mood or occasion. ",
    "**Interactive Art Installation**: Transform the perfume bottle into an interactive art piece. The bottle is equipped with a motion sensor and LED lights that illuminate when the bottle is tilted or moved. Each movement triggers a change in the scent released, creating a unique olfactory experience that changes with the user's actions.",
    "**Sustainable Refillable Design**: Develop a perfume bottle made from biodegradable materials like bamboo or recycled glass, which can be refilled using refillable capsules. These capsules contain concentrated fragrance oils that can be easily replaced, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption.",
    "**Smart Scent Delivery System**: Integrate a smart sensor into the perfume bottle that detects proximity and adjusts the scent intensity accordingly. For example, it could be programmed to release more scent when near someone's face during a handshake or when in close proximity to a person. This system ensures that the wearer remains fragranced without overpowering others around them."
