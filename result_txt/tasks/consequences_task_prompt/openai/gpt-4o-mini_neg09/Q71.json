    "**Economic Disparity**: If immortality were only accessible to the wealthy or privileged, it could exacerbate existing economic inequalities. The rich might hoard immortality treatments, while the poor remain mortal, creating a two-tiered society. This could lead to social tensions, revolts, or a class war as the disenfranchised fight for equal access to life-extending technologies, sparking debates on the ethics of wealth distribution and healthcare.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation**: Immortality could lead to cultural stagnation, as individuals who live indefinitely may become resistant to change and innovation. The fear of losing established norms and traditions might hinder progress in arts, sciences, and social movements. Over time, society could become mired in a static state, where creativity and adaptability decline, as the same voices dominate discourse for centuries.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: An immortal population could have dire consequences for the environment. Continuous consumption of resources without the balancing effect of death could lead to accelerated climate change, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity. This might necessitate drastic measures to preserve ecosystems, such as strict regulations on consumption or the implementation of sustainable living practices, potentially reshaping human interaction with nature.",
    "**Psychological Consequences**: Living forever could have profound psychological effects on individuals. The weight of endless existence might lead to existential crises, boredom, or a sense of purposelessness. People might struggle with the loss of loved ones who do not achieve immortality, leading to grief that never resolves. This could increase mental health issues and demand new forms of therapy and support systems to help individuals cope with their eternal lives.",
    "**Shifts in Governance and Power**: Immortality could dramatically alter political landscapes. Leaders who do not age may cling to power indefinitely, leading to authoritarian regimes or dynastic politics. The dynamics of governance would shift, as the political elite could become entrenched, resisting new ideas and reforms. This could prompt revolutions or the emergence of new political philosophies that challenge the notion of leadership and representation."
