    "**Urban Sprawl and Resource Management**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the urban sprawl would be unprecedented. The city would stretch across continents, with towering skyscrapers and endless concrete jungles. However, this would lead to a significant strain on resources such as food, water, and energy. The city would need to implement efficient resource management systems to ensure everyone's basic needs are met.",
    "**Economic and Social Stratification**: The single city would likely experience extreme economic and social stratification. The wealthy would reside in luxury high-rises, while the poor would be relegated to cramped, low-income housing. This would lead to a significant divide between the haves and have-nots, potentially sparking social unrest and conflict.",
    "**Environmental Concerns**: With the entire world's population living in a single city, the environmental impact would be catastrophic. The city would produce massive amounts of waste, pollution, and greenhouse gases, leading to a significant decline in air and water quality. This would have severe consequences for public health and the planet as a whole.",
    "**Cultural Homogenization**: The single city would likely lead to cultural homogenization, as people from different backgrounds and cultures would be forced to adapt to a single, dominant culture. This could result in the loss of traditional customs, languages, and practices, leading to a loss of cultural diversity and identity.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Living in a single city would have a profound psychological impact on individuals. The constant exposure to crowds, noise, and stress would lead to increased anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. People would need to find ways to cope with the overwhelming environment, potentially leading to a decline in overall well-being."
