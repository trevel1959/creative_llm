    "**Portable Home Pod**: Design a modular, self-contained living space that can be transported via drone or airship. The pod is equipped with all necessary utilities, including solar panels for energy, water recycling systems, and an AI system to manage daily functions. This solution offers freedom of movement and reduces dependency on traditional housing infrastructure.",
    "**Underwater Oasis**: Create a sustainable underwater habitat that combines elements of a coral reef and futuristic architecture. The habitat would be self-sufficient, utilizing algae for oxygen production and aquaponics for food cultivation. It could also incorporate bioluminescent plants and animals to attract marine life, providing a unique ecosystem and potential tourist attraction.",
    "**Treehouse Community**: Build a series of interconnected treehouses within a dense forest area. Each treehouse is designed for maximum energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact. They are connected by elevated walkways, creating a networked community. The design allows for a closer connection with nature and promotes a sustainable way of living.",
    "**Sustainable Space Station**: Design a space station that serves as both a living space and a research facility, capable of supporting long-term human habitation in space. The station would utilize advanced technologies for recycling resources, producing food, and generating energy from solar power. It could also serve as a hub for space exploration and scientific discovery.",
    "**Subterranean City**: Develop a complex of underground structures, utilizing the earth's natural resources like geothermal energy and groundwater for heating, cooling, and water supply. The city would feature vertical gardens, artificial sunlight, and air purification systems to create a habitable environment. This concept addresses issues like limited land resources and urban overcrowding while offering a cooler, more stable climate year-round."
