    "**Smart Hose with Sensors**: Develop a garden hose equipped with moisture sensors that can communicate with a smartphone app. The hose would automatically water plants based on soil moisture levels, ensuring optimal hydration without overwatering. Users could set schedules, receive alerts when watering is needed, and monitor water usage to promote sustainability.",
    "**Color-Changing Temperature Indicator**: Design a hose that changes color based on the temperature of the water flowing through it. This feature would help gardeners avoid using water that is too hot or too cold for their plants. For example, the hose could turn blue when the water is cool and red when it's hot, providing a visual cue for optimal watering conditions.",
    "**Multi-Function Nozzle with Attachments**: Introduce a hose nozzle that comes with interchangeable attachments for various tasks, such as watering, cleaning, and misting. Each attachment could be designed for specific uses—like a showerhead for delicate plants, a jet spray for hard surfaces, and a fan spray for large areas—allowing users to customize their watering experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hose Material**: Develop a garden hose made from biodegradable or recycled materials that are durable yet environmentally friendly. This could include plant-based plastics or rubber alternatives, appealing to eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, the hose could be designed to break down safely after its lifespan, reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Integrated Water Filter**: Create a hose with an integrated water filtration system that ensures the water used for gardening is free from contaminants. This feature would be particularly beneficial for urban gardeners who may be using tap water that contains chlorine or other chemicals. The filtration system could be easily replaceable, ensuring clean water for plants without additional effort."
