    "**DIY Phone Stand**: With a little cutting and folding, an empty tissue box can be repurposed into a phone stand. Cut a small slot in the front of the box to hold your phone at a comfortable viewing angle. This can be especially useful for watching videos or video chatting without needing to hold your device.",
    "**Gift Wrapping Assistant**: Use a tissue box as a makeshift gift wrap holder. Simply insert a roll of wrapping paper into the box, and pull it through the opening when you need to cut a piece. This keeps the roll from unraveling and makes it easier to manage, especially when wrapping multiple gifts.",
    "**Craft Supply Organizer**: An empty tissue box can be a handy organizer for craft supplies. Use it to store small items like beads, buttons, or yarn scraps. You can even decorate the box with paint or washi tape to match your crafting space, making it both functional and visually appealing.",
    "**Pet Toy Dispenser**: If you have small pets like cats or dogs, an empty tissue box can be turned into a toy dispenser. Fill it with small, soft toys or balls, and let your pet have fun digging them out. The crinkly sound of the box will also add an element of excitement for your furry friend.",
    "**Seedling Starter Kit**: Use tissue boxes as mini planters for starting seeds. Cut holes in the bottom for drainage and fill each compartment with soil. You can plant different seeds in each section and keep the box on a windowsill to monitor their growth. Once the seedlings are strong enough, you can transplant them into larger pots or your garden."
