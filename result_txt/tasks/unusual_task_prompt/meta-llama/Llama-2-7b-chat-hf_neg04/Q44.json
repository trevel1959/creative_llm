    "Aroma-infused Ice Cubes: Create a line of ice cube trays with built-in aroma dispensers. Each tray would have small compartments for adding essential oils or fragrances, allowing the ice cubes to release a subtle scent as they melt. This would be perfect for cocktail parties or for those who enjoy aromatherapy while they drink.",
    "Smart Ice Cubes: Develop a line of ice cubes that can monitor the temperature of the drink they are in. These \"smart\" ice cubes would use sensors to detect the temperature of the drink and adjust their size accordingly. If the drink is too cold, the ice cube would expand to dilute it, and if it's too warm, it would shrink to keep it cold. This would ensure that your drink is always at the perfect temperature.",
    "Customizable Ice Cubes: Create a line of ice cube trays that allow users to customize the size and shape of their ice cubes. With interchangeable molds, users could create everything from classic cubes to intricate shapes like stars or hearts. This would be a fun and creative way to add a personal touch to your drinks.",
    "Healthy Ice Cubes: Develop a line of ice cubes made from natural ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or herbs. These \"super ice cubes\" would not only add flavor and nutrients to your drinks but also provide additional health benefits. For example, an ice cube made from spinach would provide a boost of iron, while an ice cube made from citrus fruits would have antibacterial properties.",
    "Color-Changing Ice Cubes: Create a line of ice cubes that change color as they melt. These \"magic\" ice cubes would use a special dye that would react with the water inside the cube, causing it to change color as it melts. This would add a fun and unexpected element to your drinks, and the changing colors could be used to signal when the drink is ready to be enjoyed."
