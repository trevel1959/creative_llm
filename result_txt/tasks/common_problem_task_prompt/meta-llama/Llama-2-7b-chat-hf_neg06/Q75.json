This innovative approach will allow people from all over the world to experience the park without the need for travel, making it more accessible and environmentally friendly.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-Powered Wildlife Tracking: Develop an AI-powered wildlife tracking system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sensors and cameras placed throughout the park. The system will be able to detect and track wildlife in real-time, providing visitors with accurate information on the movements and behaviors of different species. This will enhance the visitor experience by allowing them to learn more about the park's unique wildlife and their habitats.",
    "Augmented Reality Nature Guides: Create an interactive augmented reality app that provides visitors with real-time information on the park's flora and fauna. Using AR technology, the app will superimpose digital information on the visitor's surroundings, allowing them to learn about the park's unique ecosystems and species. The app can also include interactive games and quizzes to engage visitors and make learning more fun.",
    "Solar-Powered Infrastructure: Install solar panels on park buildings and facilities to reduce the park's carbon footprint and reliance on non-renewable energy sources. This will not only help the park become more environmentally friendly but also reduce maintenance costs and increase energy independence. The park can also use excess energy generated by the solar panels to power electric vehicles and other equipment, further reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.",
    "Community-Led Conservation Programs: Establish community-led conservation programs that involve local residents in the park's management and conservation efforts. This can include initiatives such as citizen science projects, habitat restoration, and wildlife monitoring. By involving local communities in the park's conservation efforts, visitors will gain a deeper appreciation for the park's natural and cultural resources and develop a sense of ownership and stewardship for the park's future."
