    "**Gravity-Defying Wheelchair**: Design a wheelchair that uses a combination of magnetic levitation and AI-powered navigation to allow users to move around with ease and precision. The wheelchair would be equipped with sensors that detect the user's intentions and adjust the movement accordingly. It could also be programmed to avoid obstacles and navigate through crowded areas.",
    "**Personal Aerial Transportation (PAT)**: Develop a wearable device that uses miniature thrusters to lift the user off the ground, allowing them to move around in mid-air. The PAT system would use AI to detect the user's intentions and adjust the movement accordingly. It could also be equipped with sensors to detect obstacles and adjust the trajectory in real-time.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: Create a wearable exoskeleton suit that uses AI-powered motors to assist the user in moving around. The suit would be equipped with sensors that detect the user's intentions and adjust the movement accordingly. It could also be programmed to adjust to different terrain and environments.",
    "**Hydro-Powered Wheelchair**: Design a wheelchair that uses a hydro-powered propulsion system to move around. The wheelchair would be equipped with a water tank that stores water, which would be used to power the propulsion system. The system would use AI to detect the user's intentions and adjust the movement accordingly.",
    "**Gravitational Manipulation Device (GMD)**: Develop a device that manipulates gravity to allow users to move around with ease. The GMD would use a combination of magnetic fields and AI-powered navigation to create a localized gravity field that allows the user to move around with minimal effort. It could also be programmed to adjust to different terrain and environments."
