    "Island Archipelago: Construct a series of interconnected islands that are strategically placed to protect against rising sea levels. Each island would have its own unique ecosystem and would be connected by bridges or tunnels. Residents would have access to a variety of natural resources, including fresh water, food, and energy from renewable sources.",
    "Oceanic Aquaria: Create a massive underwater habitat where people can live in large, pressurized domes. The domes would be connected by tunnels and would have their own ecosystems, including gardens, forests, and wildlife. Residents would have access to a unique and diverse environment that is protected from the impacts of rising sea levels.",
    "Seawall Metropolis: Build a city that is completely enclosed by a massive seawall. The seawall would be designed to protect against rising sea levels and would be lined with green spaces, including parks and gardens. Residents would have access to a variety of recreational activities, including surfing, diving, and boating.",
    "Artificial Island: Construct a large artificial island that is designed to be self-sustaining. The island would be equipped with its own energy and water supply, and would be protected from rising sea levels by a sophisticated barrier system. Residents would have access to a variety of natural resources, including fresh water, food, and energy from renewable sources.",
    "Floating Gardens: Imagine living in a city that is built on a series of interconnected floating gardens. The gardens would be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own energy and water supply. Residents would have easy access to the ocean for fishing and other water-based activities, while the gardens themselves would be protected from rising sea levels by a sophisticated barrier system."
