    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature into the juicer that uses steam and hot water to sanitize and clean the internal components after use. This would eliminate the tedious task of manual cleaning, making the juicer more user-friendly and encouraging more frequent use.",
    "**Adjustable Pulp Control**: Design a juicer with an adjustable pulp control feature that allows users to customize the amount of pulp in their juice. This could be achieved through a dial or lever that adjusts the filter mesh size, catering to individual preferences for pulp-free or thicker juices.",
    "**Portable and Rechargeable Juicer**: Develop a compact, battery-operated juicer that can be easily transported. Ideal for travelers or those with limited kitchen space, this juicer could be charged via USB and would include a detachable container for easy pouring and storage of juice on the go.",
    "**Integrated Nutrient Extractor**: Enhance the juicer by adding a nutrient extractor function that can blend and emulsify ingredients like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, maximizing the extraction of nutrients. This dual-functionality would allow users to create smoothies and nut milks in addition to fresh juices.",
    "**Personalized Juicing Assistant**: Implement a voice-activated assistant that guides users through the juicing process. It could provide step-by-step instructions, suggest ingredient combinations based on the userâ€™s health needs, and even remind them to drink their juice at optimal times for maximum health benefits."
