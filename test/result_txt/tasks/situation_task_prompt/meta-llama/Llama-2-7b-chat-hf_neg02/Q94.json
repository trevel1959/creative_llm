    "Immersive Outdoor Screenings: Create a mobile, inflatable, or projection-mapped outdoor screen that can be set up in various public spaces, such as parks, rooftops, or beaches. The audience can bring their own seating and snacks, creating a communal viewing experience.",
    "Virtual Reality Cinemas: Develop VR headsets that transport viewers into the movie world. These headsets could be equipped with sensors that track the user's movements, allowing for a fully immersive experience.",
    "Interactive Storytelling Platforms: Create an online platform that allows users to collaboratively create and share their own stories through a web-based interface. Users can contribute to the story by adding their own text, images, or videos, and can interact with other users' contributions in real-time.",
    "Augmented Reality Film Props: Develop AR filters that allow viewers to interact with movie props and characters in the real world.
