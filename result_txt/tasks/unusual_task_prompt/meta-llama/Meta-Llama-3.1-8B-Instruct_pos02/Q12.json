    "A \"Floating Garden\" - a futuristic, self-sustaining ecosystem that floats above the city, providing a serene oasis amidst the concrete jungle. This concept would involve a series of interconnected, aerodynamic modules that harness solar energy and recycle water, creating a lush environment teeming with plant life. The \"garden\" would be accessible via a network of suspended walkways, allowing visitors to stroll among the verdant landscape and enjoy breathtaking views of the city below.",
    "\"Aurora Bloom\" - an immersive, interactive light installation that simulates the experience of witnessing a breathtaking aurora borealis display.
