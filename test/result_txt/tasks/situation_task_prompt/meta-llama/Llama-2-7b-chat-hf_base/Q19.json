    "Herbal Remedies: One possible solution to treat a common cold in a world without medicines is to rely on traditional herbal remedies that have been used for centuries to alleviate symptoms. For example, mint tea can help to soothe a sore throat, while ginger tea can help to reduce inflammation and alleviate congestion. Other herbs such as echinacea, elderberry, and eucalyptus can also be used to boost the immune system and fight off infection.",
    "Honey and Lemon: Another option for treating a common cold is to use a mixture of honey and lemon juice. Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce congestion and soothe a sore throat. Adding lemon juice can help to thin out mucus and make it easier to expel, while also providing vitamin C to support the immune system.",
    "Salt Water Gargle: A simple and effective way to treat a sore throat is to gargle with salt water. Mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water can help to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria in the throat. Gargling with salt water several times a day can also help to reduce swelling and promote healing.",
    "Steam Inhalation: Steam inhalation is another effective way to treat a common cold without medication. By inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam humidifier, mucus and bacteria can be loosened and cleared from the nasal passages. Adding eucalyptus oil or menthol to the water can also help to reduce congestion and promote easier breathing.",
    "Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy can also be used to treat a common cold without medication. Essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and lavender can be inhaled directly from a cloth or added to a diffuser to help reduce congestion, soothe a sore throat, and promote relaxation. These oils can also be added to a bath or used topically on the chest and throat to provide additional relief."
