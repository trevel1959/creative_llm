    "on stone tablets: If all pens and pencils disappeared, people might turn to a more ancient method of writing - stone tablets. People could carve words or drawings onto smooth stones using a sharp rock or piece of bone. This method would be a nod to the early writing methods used by ancient civilizations, such as the Sumerians and Egyptians.",
    "on wax tablets: Another option would be to use wax tablets, similar to those used by the ancient Greeks and Romans. People could inscribe words or drawings onto the wax using a stylus, creating a durable and long-lasting record. This method would be a great way to evoke a sense of history and tradition.",
    "on clay tablets: Clay tablets were also used by ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians and Assyrians. People could write on clay tablets using a reed stylus, creating a smooth and even surface. This method would be a great way to create a tactile and tangible record of information.",
    "on leaves: In a more rustic or natural setting, people might turn to writing on leaves. This could involve inscribing words or drawings onto individual leaves using a sharp rock or piece of bone, or creating a bark scroll by writing on the bark of a tree. This method would be a great way to connect with nature and create a unique and organic record.",
    "on human skin: In a more unconventional and experimental approach, people might turn to writing on their own skin. This could involve tattooing words or drawings onto the skin using a variety of techniques, such as traditional tattooing or even temporary tattoos. This method would be a bold and personal way to create a permanent record of information."
