    "**Hammock Headrest**: Construct a mini hammock for your head using soft fabric or a light scarf. Tie the ends to the bed frame or a nearby stable structure. The hammock design cradles your head gently, providing support without the bulk of a traditional pillow. This can also be adjusted to your preferred height for maximum comfort.",
    "**Water-Filled Bladder**: Design a water-filled pillow substitute using a durable, leak-proof bag. Fill it with water to create a customizable firmness level; you can adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired softness. The contouring nature of water will support your head and neck, allowing for a restful sleep.",
    "**Folded Clothes Method**: Use a stack of soft clothing items, such as t-shirts or sweatshirts, to create a pillow. Fold them neatly to your desired thickness and shape, ensuring they are clean and soft. This method allows for easy adjustments to your comfort level and can be a great way to utilize what you already have at hand.",
    "**Memory Foam Alternative**: If you have access to memory foam material (like a mattress topper), cut a piece to size and shape it to fit under your head. Memory foam provides excellent support by conforming to the shape of your head and neck, reducing pressure points and enhancing comfort.",
    "**Bean Bag Headrest**: Create a small bean bag filled with lightweight materials like rice or small beans. The malleable nature of a bean bag allows it to conform to the shape of your head, providing a custom fit. You can even add a soft cover for added comfort and style."
