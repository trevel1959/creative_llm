    "Smart Hanger: Create a smart coat hanger that can detect the weight of the coat and automatically adjust the temperature in the room to maintain a comfortable climate. The hanger can be connected to a smart thermostat, and the user can control the temperature through a mobile app. This innovative coat hanger will not only keep your coats organized but also ensure a comfortable environment in your home.",
    "Virtual Try-On: Develop a virtual try-on feature for online shoppers. Using a 3D scanner, customers can take a photo of themselves holding a coat hanger with the coat they are interested in purchasing. The AI-powered system will then superimpose the coat on the customer's body, allowing them to see how it would look without having to physically try it on. This feature will reduce returns and increase customer satisfaction.",
    "Coat Hanger with Built-in Dryer: Design a coat hanger with a built-in dryer function. The hanger can have a small heating element or a mini fan that dries the coat quickly and efficiently. This feature will save time and effort for the user, as they won't have to hang their coat to dry after each use. The hanger can also have a built-in LED light to help locate the coat in the dark.",
    "Coat Hanger with Smart Sensors: Create a coat hanger with sensors that can detect the moisture level of the coat and automatically turn on a built-in dehumidifier or fan to maintain a dry environment. This feature will help prevent mold and mildew from growing on the coat, extending its lifespan. The sensors can also detect temperature and humidity levels in the room and adjust the hanger's settings accordingly.",
    "Augmented Reality Coat Hanger: Develop an augmented reality (AR) coat hanger that can display information about the coat on the hanger. Using a mobile app, customers can scan the hanger and see detailed information about the coat, including its material, size, color, and care instructions. The AR feature can also allow customers to virtually try on the coat and see how it would look in different settings. This innovative coat hanger will enhance the shopping experience and provide customers with valuable information about their purchases."
