    "**Economic Growth Boost**: The immediate consequence of erasing all world debt would likely result in a significant boost to economic growth. This is because the burden of servicing debt (interest payments) would be lifted from both individuals and governments. This freed-up capital can be invested back into the economy, potentially leading to increased spending, investment, and job creation.",
    "**Inflation Risk**: However, the sudden injection of capital into the economy could also lead to inflation if the money supply increases too rapidly. Central banks may need to adjust their monetary policies to prevent this from happening. Inflation could also cause uncertainty among investors and consumers, potentially destabilizing financial markets.",
    "**Socioeconomic Impact**: Erasing debt could lead to widespread improvements in the standard of living, particularly for those in lower-income brackets. This could reduce poverty levels, improve health outcomes, and increase access to education and other social services. However, it might also exacerbate wealth inequality if the benefits are not distributed equitably.",
    "**Impact on Global Financial Systems**: The global financial system, which is intricately connected through international debts, would experience major disruptions. Banks, financial institutions, and countries that have lent and borrowed heavily would need to restructure their financial relationships. This could lead to a period of instability and adjustment in global finance.",
    "**Government Debt Sustainability**: Without the pressure of debt repayment, governments might become more relaxed about fiscal discipline, potentially leading to higher deficits and increased public debt in the long term. This could undermine the credibility of fiscal policy and lead to unsustainable debt levels over time."
