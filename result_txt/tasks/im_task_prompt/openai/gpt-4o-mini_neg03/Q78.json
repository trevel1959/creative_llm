    "**Customizable Touchscreen Interface**: Replace the traditional button layout with a customizable touchscreen interface. Users could design their own layouts, choosing which functions they use most frequently and placing them in easy-to-reach spots. This could also include customizable themes and colors, allowing for personalization that reflects the user's style.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Transform the remote into a smart home hub that can control not only the TV but also other smart devices in the home, such as lights, thermostats, and security systems. This would streamline home automation, allowing users to manage their entire environment from a single device.",
    "**Gesture Control Technology**: Implement gesture control capabilities that allow users to navigate their devices with simple hand movements. For example, swiping left or right could change channels, while a fist pump could play or pause content. This would provide a fun and innovative way to interact with the television.",
    "**Built-in Streaming App Access**: Equip the remote with direct access buttons for popular streaming services (like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+) that can be customized by the user. Instead of navigating through multiple menus, users could instantly access their favorite content with one click, improving the overall user experience.",
    "**Find My Remote Feature**: Add a \"Find My Remote\" feature that uses Bluetooth technology to help users locate their remote when it's lost. This could be activated via a smartphone app or a button on the television, which would make the remote emit a sound or light up, making it easier to find."
