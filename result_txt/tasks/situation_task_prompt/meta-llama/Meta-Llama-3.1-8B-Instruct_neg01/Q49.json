    "**Fire-Resistant Materials**: I would start by inspecting my home for any flammable materials and replacing them with fire-resistant alternatives. This could include using fire-resistant roofing materials, replacing wooden furniture with metal or plastic alternatives, and covering walls and ceilings with fire-resistant paints or coatings. This would significantly reduce the risk of my home catching fire in the first place.",
    "**Firebreaks**: I would create firebreaks around my home by clearing any combustible materials from the surrounding area, such as dead leaves, branches, or dry grass. This would prevent the fire from spreading to my home in the event of a nearby fire. I would also create a firebreak between my home and any neighboring buildings to prevent the fire from jumping from one building to another.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Window Film**: I would apply a fire-resistant window film to all windows and doors in my home. This film would help prevent the spread of fire by preventing heat and flames from entering the home through the windows. It would also help to contain the fire within the home, making it easier to extinguish.",
    "**Fire Suppression System**: I would install a fire suppression system in my home, which would detect the presence of fire and automatically release a fire-suppressing agent, such as water or foam, to extinguish the fire. This would provide an added layer of protection against fires, even if I'm not present in the home.",
    "**Fire Escape Plan**: I would create a fire escape plan with my family, which would outline the safest routes to exit the home in the event of a fire. We would identify two ways out of each room, and designate a meeting spot outside the home where we would all gather once we've escaped. This would ensure that everyone in the household knows what to do in case of a fire, and would help to prevent injuries and fatalities. [/INST] "
