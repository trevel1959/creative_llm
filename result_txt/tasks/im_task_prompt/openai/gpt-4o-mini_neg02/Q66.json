    "**Modular Compartment Design**: Redesign the interior of the picnic basket with modular compartments that can be rearranged or removed based on the type of food being packed. These compartments could be stackable, collapsible, or even insulated, allowing for easy customization of space and temperature control for different items, such as hot dishes, cold salads, or delicate desserts.",
    "**Built-in Solar Charger**: Incorporate a solar panel on the top of the picnic basket that can charge small electronic devices. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts who rely on their phones for navigation or want to power portable speakers. The solar charger could also power built-in LED lights for evening picnics, enhancing the ambiance.",
    "**Eco-friendly Materials**: Shift to sustainable, biodegradable, or recycled materials for the construction of the picnic basket. This could include using bamboo, recycled plastics, or organic cotton for any fabric components. Additionally, offer a take-back program where customers can return old baskets for recycling, promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Integrated Utensil Storage and Cleanup Station**: Design a section of the picnic basket that includes built-in storage for reusable utensils, plates, and cups, which can be easily accessed during the picnic. This area could also have a mini-cleanup station with a small sink, soap dispenser, and drying rack for easy cleaning of utensils after the meal, minimizing waste and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Companion App**: Develop an AR app that users can access via their smartphones or smart glasses. The app could provide picnic planning assistance, such as suggesting food pairings, games, or activities based on the picnic location. Users could also scan their basket to get recipe ideas or reminders for items they need to pack, enhancing the overall picnic experience."
