    "**Sustainable Materials Selection**: Choosing materials for a tiny house that are both functional and stylish can be challenging, especially if the goal is to maintain sustainability. Many traditional materials may not be eco-friendly or may not align with the aesthetic vision. A potential issue is finding locally sourced, sustainable materials that still meet design standards. This can be addressed by researching local suppliers or even incorporating reclaimed materials to give the house a unique character while minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance and Zoning Laws**: Tiny houses often face issues with zoning regulations and building codes, which can vary significantly by location. A common problem is ensuring that the design adheres to local regulations regarding size, foundation type, and utilities. This can lead to delays or increased costs. To mitigate this, one could engage with local authorities early in the design process to understand the requirements and possibly advocate for more flexible zoning laws for tiny homes.",
    "**Insulation and Energy Efficiency**: Given the smaller size of tiny houses, maintaining comfortable temperatures year-round can be a significant issue. Poor insulation can lead to higher energy costs and uncomfortable living conditions. The challenge lies in finding stylish yet effective insulation materials that fit the tiny house aesthetic. A solution could involve using innovative insulation techniques, such as spray foam or structural insulated panels (SIPs), which provide excellent thermal performance without sacrificing style.",
    "**Plumbing and Electrical Systems**: Designing efficient plumbing and electrical systems in a tiny house can be problematic due to the limited space and the need for compact solutions. Traditional systems may not fit or may require complex layouts. This can lead to increased costs and complications during installation. A creative approach could involve using off-grid solutions, such as composting toilets and solar panels, which not only save space but also align with sustainable living principles.",
    "**Natural Light and Ventilation**: A common problem in tiny house design is ensuring adequate natural light and ventilation, which are crucial for making small spaces feel larger and more inviting. Limited window space can lead to dark and cramped environments. One potential solution is to incorporate skylights or strategically placed windows that not only allow for natural light but also provide cross-ventilation. Additionally, using light-colored materials and reflective surfaces can help enhance the sense of space."
