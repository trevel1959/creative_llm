    "**Art Installation**: Create an art installation that transforms the beach into a giant canvas. Use the absence of sand to create large-scale sculptures or installations using natural elements like driftwood, rocks, and seashells. This could be a temporary art piece that changes throughout the day as the tide comes in and goes out, creating a unique experience each time.",
    "**Water Sports Festival**: Instead of traditional beach activities, organize a water sports festival where participants can engage in various water-based activities without sand. Activities could include stand-up paddleboarding races, underwater photography contests, and sea kayaking tours. The focus shifts from sunbathing on the sand to enjoying the water.",
    "**Sustainable Beach Cleanup**: Utilize the absence of sand as an opportunity to clean up the beach more effectively. Set up stations for volunteers to collect litter and debris from the shoreline and waters. This initiative could also involve educating the community about sustainable practices and waste reduction, making it a community service event with a positive impact.",
    "**Outdoor Film Festival**: Transform the beach into an open-air cinema space. Set up comfortable seating options (like bean bags or cushions) and project films onto a large screen. With the absence of sand, there's more room for setup and attendees can enjoy the movies while lying down under the stars, experiencing a unique cinematic adventure.",
    "**Interactive Environmental Education**: Develop an interactive educational program focusing on marine life and conservation. Set up stations along the beach where visitors can learn about local ecosystems, participate in hands-on activities like identifying sea creatures, and engage in discussions led by environmental experts. This would not only educate people about marine life but also inspire them to take action to protect it."
