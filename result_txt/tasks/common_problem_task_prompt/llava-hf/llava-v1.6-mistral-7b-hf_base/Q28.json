    "Inadequate public bins: Insufficient public recycling bins can deter people from recycling. To solve this, the city should consider installing more recycling bins in high-traffic areas, such as parks, shopping centers, and public transportation hubs. This would make it more convenient for citizens to dispose of their recyclable waste.",
    "Insufficient waste management support: A lack of manpower in waste management might lead to delays in waste collection and increase the risk of littering. The city could consider hiring more waste management staff or contracting waste management services to address this issue.",
    "Insufficient incentives for recycling: People may not see the point in recycling if there are no incentives or rewards for doing so. The city could introduce a reward system, such as discounts on city services or access to special events for residents who consistently participate in the recycling program.",
    "Inadequate enforcement of recycling rules: Some residents might not take the recycling program seriously and continue to throw away recyclable material with their regular waste. The city could consider implementing stricter penalties for those who fail to follow the recycling guidelines or launching a public awareness campaign to encourage responsible waste disposal.",
    "Insufficient funding for the recycling initiative: Organizing a city-wide recycling initiative requires financial resources for its implementation and maintenance. The city would need to allocate funding to ensure the success of the initiative, which may involve raising taxes or implementing revenue-generating programs."
