    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Function**: Ski poles that can automatically adjust their length based on the user's height and skiing style. With a memory function, these poles would remember the preferred length for different types of skiing (e.g., downhill, cross-country, or backcountry). Users could simply press a button to switch between settings, ensuring optimal performance and comfort.",
    "**Built-in Heating Elements**: Cold hands can ruin a skiing experience. Ski poles with built-in heating elements in the grips would keep your hands warm without the need for bulky gloves. The heating could be adjustable and powered by rechargeable batteries, ensuring that skiers stay comfortable even in the coldest conditions.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Shock Absorption**: A redesign of the pole grips to include an ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the hand and reduces fatigue. Incorporating a shock-absorbing mechanism in the grip would help minimize the impact on the wrists and arms during aggressive skiing, making for a more enjoyable experience over long runs.",
    "**Multi-Functional Tips**: Ski poles that come with interchangeable tips designed for different terrains. For instance, a hard tip for icy conditions, a rubber tip for walking on hard surfaces, and a powder tip for deep snow. This versatility would make the poles more useful for skiers who enjoy varying types of terrain without needing to carry multiple pairs.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Ski poles with built-in communication systems that allow skiers to talk to each other without the need for mobile phones or radios. This could be especially useful in crowded resorts or during backcountry skiing where communication is key for safety. The poles could have a push-to-talk button on the grip, allowing for hands-free communication."
