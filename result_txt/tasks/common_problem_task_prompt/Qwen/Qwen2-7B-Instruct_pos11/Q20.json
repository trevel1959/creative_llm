    "**Personalized Travel Experience**: Design your self-driving car to learn your preferences over time, including music tastes, driving style (aggressive, smooth, eco-friendly), and even the preferred route based on traffic conditions. The car could adjust the temperature, lighting, and even play your favorite podcasts or audiobooks automatically, providing a personalized experience every time you use it.",
    "**Mobile Office**: Integrate advanced features such as wireless charging, high-speed internet connectivity, and a touch-screen dashboard that transforms into a full-fledged workspace. This allows users to work from anywhere, converting their self-driving car into a mobile office. It could also include noise-cancelling technology for better concentration.",
    "**Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate wearable technology that integrates with the car's system. Sensors could monitor vital signs, alerting the driver if they show signs of drowsiness, distraction, or even potential health issues. In such cases, the car could automatically take over driving or navigate towards a medical facility.",
    "**Interactive Entertainment System**: Beyond just playing music and audiobooks, the car could feature a virtual reality (VR) system for immersive gaming experiences, educational content, or even virtual sightseeing tours. Passengers can relax and enjoy interactive entertainment during long drives, making travel more enjoyable and engaging.",
    "**Community Integration**: Develop a social aspect where passengers can connect with other drivers through in-car communication platforms. This could be useful for sharing tips on scenic routes, local attractions, or even forming carpools to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact. The car could also offer a platform for local businesses to advertise or promote services to its users."
