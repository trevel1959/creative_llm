    "Tissue Box with Built-in Tissue Dispenser: Create a tissue box with a built-in tissue dispenser that can be easily accessed and used without having to open the box. This could be achieved by designing a compartment within the box that can be opened with a small lever or button, allowing the user to easily dispense tissues without having to open the entire box.",
    "Smart Tissue Box with Automatic Tissue Dispensing: Develop a tissue box that can detect when a user needs a tissue and automatically dispenses one. This could be done through the use of sensors that detect the user's hand movements or facial expressions, and can be controlled through a smartphone app. This would eliminate the need for the user to physically open the box and search for a tissue.",

This could be a fun and creative way for users to express their personal style and add a unique touch to their home decor.",
    "Tissue Box with Air Purifying Filters: Design a tissue box that incorporates air purifying filters, which can help to remove impurities and allergens from the air.

    "Tissue Box with Built-In Lighting: Create a tissue box with built-in lighting that can provide a soft, gentle glow in a dimly lit room. This could be particularly useful for people who have difficulty seeing or need to navigate to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The lighting could also be aesthetically pleasing and add a touch of elegance to a bathroom or bedroom."
