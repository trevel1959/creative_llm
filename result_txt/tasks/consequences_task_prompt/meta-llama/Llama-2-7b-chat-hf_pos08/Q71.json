    "Uncontrollable population growth: If immortality were discovered, the global population would increase exponentially, leading to severe resource shortages, environmental degradation, and overcrowding. This could result in social unrest, political instability, and conflict over resources.",
    "Loss of purpose and meaning: With the fear of death no longer a motivator, people might struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives. This could lead to a decline in creativity, innovation, and overall well-being, as people would no longer be driven to achieve their goals and make the most of their time.",
    "Economic collapse: The discovery of immortality would likely lead to a significant shift in the global economy. The cost of healthcare and other services would skyrocket as people lived longer, and the financial burden on governments and societies could become unsustainable. This could result in economic collapse, social unrest, and political instability.",
    "Ethical concerns: Immortality would raise a host of ethical concerns, such as the fair distribution of resources, the right to life, and the potential for exploitation. There could be a significant disparity between those who had access to immortality and those who did not, leading to social inequality and injustice.",
    "Psychological impact: Living forever would have a profound psychological impact on individuals. The constant awareness of time and the lack of a finite end to life could lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and depression. The loss of the ability to let go of the past and move on could also hinder personal growth and development."
