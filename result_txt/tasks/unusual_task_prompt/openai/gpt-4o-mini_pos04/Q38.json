    "**Travel Towel**: Handkerchiefs can be an excellent travel companion. They can be used as a quick-dry towel for your face or hands when you're on the go. Their small size makes them easy to carry in your pocket or bag, and they can be used to dab sweat during a hike or to dry your hands after washing them.",
    "**Bookmark**: Instead of using a traditional bookmark, use a handkerchief to mark your place in a book. The fabric is gentle on pages and won’t cause creases. Plus, it can be a colorful and personalized touch to your reading experience, especially if you choose one with a unique design.",
    "**Emergency Bandage**: In a pinch, a clean handkerchief can serve as an emergency bandage. If you or someone else gets a small cut or scrape, you can fold the handkerchief and use it to apply pressure to stop bleeding or to cover the wound until proper medical attention can be obtained.",
    "**Scented Sachet**: Handkerchiefs can be filled with dried lavender, herbs, or potpourri and tied off to create a scented sachet. This can be placed in drawers, closets, or luggage to keep clothes smelling fresh. The handkerchief’s fabric allows for the scent to permeate while keeping the herbs contained.",
    "**Artistic Canvas**: Use a handkerchief as a mini canvas for fabric painting or embroidery. This can be a fun project for both adults and children, allowing for creativity to flourish. Once decorated, these handkerchiefs can be used as decorative pieces, gifts, or even framed as art."
