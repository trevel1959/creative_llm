    "Floating Cities - A Floating City is a city built on a large structure that floats on the water, providing a safe and sustainable living space for people in the event of a drastic ocean level rise. The city could be designed with a series of interconnected platforms, each one providing a different function such as residential areas, commercial spaces, and recreational areas. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Island Nations - If the ocean levels rose drastically, many small island nations would become uninhabitable. However, these nations could be repurposed as sustainable living spaces for people who are displaced by the rising oceans. The islands could be equipped with sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and designed to be self-sufficient in terms of food production and waste management. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Submerged Cities - A Submerged City is a city built underwater, where the city's infrastructure is designed to withstand the pressure of the water and the changing ocean levels. The city could be built with a series of interconnected domes, each one providing a different function such as residential areas, commercial spaces, and recreational areas. The city could also be equipped with advanced water filtration systems and sustainable energy sources. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Water-based Communities - A Water-based Community is a community built on a large floating structure, such as a ship or a barge, that provides a sustainable living space for people who are displaced by the rising oceans. The community could be designed with a series of interconnected modules, each one providing a different function such as residential areas, commercial spaces, and recreational areas. The community could also be equipped with sustainable energy sources and advanced water filtration systems. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Floating Forests - A Floating Forest is a series of interconnected floating islands that provide a sustainable living space for people and wildlife. The islands could be covered with a variety of vegetation, including trees, plants, and flowers, and could be equipped with sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The floating islands could also be designed to provide a safe haven for marine life, such as coral reefs and"
