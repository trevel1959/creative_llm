    "Smart Toothbrush with AI-Powered Brushing Techniques: Create an electric toothbrush that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze the user's brushing technique and provide real-time feedback to improve their oral hygiene. The toothbrush could have sensors to detect brushing speed, pressure, and positioning, and an AI-powered algorithm to evaluate the user's brushing technique. Based on the analysis, the toothbrush could provide suggestions for improvement, such as increasing brushing speed or reducing pressure in certain areas.",
    "Portable Toothbrush with Built-in Toothpaste Dispenser: Design an electric toothbrush that comes with a built-in toothpaste dispenser, eliminating the need for users to carry separate toothpaste tubes. The dispenser could be located on the handle of the toothbrush, and the toothpaste could be released with a simple squeeze of the user's fingers. This feature would make traveling with an electric toothbrush more convenient and hygienic.",
    "Toothbrush with Personalized Brushing Modes: Create an electric toothbrush that offers personalized brushing modes based on the user's oral health needs. For example, a \"sensitive teeth\" mode could provide gentler brushing strokes, while a \"deep clean\" mode could offer more intense brushing for users with braces or other dental work. The toothbrush could also include a \"brushing timer\" feature to ensure users brush for the full recommended 2 minutes.",
    "Electric Toothbrush with Customizable Colors and Designs: Design an electric toothbrush that allows users to customize the color and design of the toothbrush handle and bristles. This feature would appeal to users who want to express their personal style or add a pop of color to their oral hygiene routine. The toothbrush could also include interchangeable handles and bristles, allowing users to change the look of their toothbrush as often as they want.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Flosser and Mouthwash: Create an electric toothbrush that includes a built-in flosser and mouthwash dispenser."
