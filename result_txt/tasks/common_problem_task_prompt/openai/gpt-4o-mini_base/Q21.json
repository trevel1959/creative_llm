    "**Exposure to Inappropriate Content**: With the vast amount of information available online, children are at risk of encountering inappropriate content, including violence, adult themes, and misinformation. Parents can mitigate this risk by using parental control software, discussing online safety, and creating an open dialogue about what children see online, helping them develop critical thinking skills regarding content.",
    "**Cyberbullying**: The anonymity of the internet can lead to increased instances of cyberbullying, which can have serious emotional and psychological effects on children. Parents should monitor their child's online interactions, educate them about the signs of cyberbullying, and encourage them to speak up if they experience or witness bullying. Establishing a supportive home environment where children feel safe discussing their online experiences is crucial.",
    "**Screen Time Overload**: Excessive screen time can negatively impact a child's physical health, leading to issues such as obesity, sleep disturbances, and eye strain. To address this, parents can set daily screen time limits, encourage breaks during prolonged device use, and promote alternative activities such as reading, sports, or arts and crafts to ensure a balanced lifestyle.",
    "**Loss of Privacy**: Children may not fully understand the implications of sharing personal information online, leading to potential privacy breaches or exploitation. Parents should educate their children about the importance of privacy settings, the consequences of oversharing, and the need for caution when interacting with strangers online. Regular discussions about privacy can help instill a sense of responsibility.",
    "**Digital Literacy Gap**: Not all children have equal access to technology and the internet, leading to disparities in digital literacy and opportunities. This can affect their educational outcomes and future job prospects. To bridge this gap, parents and communities can advocate for equitable access to technology, support local initiatives that provide resources for underprivileged families, and encourage schools to incorporate digital literacy programs."
