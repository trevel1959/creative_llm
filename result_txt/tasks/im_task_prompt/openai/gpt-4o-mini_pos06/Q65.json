    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature using ultrasonic technology or steam cleaning. The kettle could have a dedicated cleaning cycle that uses high-frequency sound waves or steam to break down mineral deposits and other residues. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and prolong the lifespan of the kettle.",
    "**Multi-Function Lid**: Design a lid that serves multiple purposes. It could include a built-in strainer for infusing teas or herbs directly in the kettle, a measuring cup for precise water levels, and an adjustable vent for steam release. This would enhance usability and make the kettle more versatile for various cooking tasks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create an electric kettle made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, without compromising durability. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the kettle could incorporate energy-efficient heating elements that minimize electricity consumption.",
    "**Color-Changing Indicator**: Incorporate a color-changing LED light that indicates the temperature of the water inside the kettle. For example, blue for cold, green for warm, and red for boiling. This visual cue would allow users to easily gauge the kettle's status at a glance, enhancing the user experience.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration**: Equip the kettle with a built-in water filtration system that purifies tap water as it heats. This could involve a replaceable filter cartridge that removes impurities and enhances the taste of the water. This feature would be especially beneficial in areas with hard water or poor water quality."
