    "**Human-Assisted Pollination**: Create a training program for humans to become pollinators. This could involve teaching people the necessary skills to collect pollen from one flower and transfer it to another, similar to how bees and butterflies do. This method would require a significant number of people to participate, but it could be an effective way to pollinate plants when flowers are scarce.",
    "**Artificial Pollination Machines**: Design and build machines that can simulate the actions of pollinators, such as bees and butterflies. These machines could be placed near plants and programmed to move between flowers, collecting pollen and transferring it to other plants.",
    "**Edible Pollinators**: Genetically modify certain plants to produce pollen-producing organs that are safe for consumption. This would allow humans to eat the pollen and transfer it to other plants, thereby promoting pollination.",
    "**Hydroponic Pollination**: Set up hydroponic systems with pollen-producing plants and create a system for collecting pollen from these plants. This pollen could then be transferred to other plants for pollination.",
    "**Electromagnetic Pollination**: Use electromagnetic fields to stimulate pollen release from flowers. This method could be particularly useful for plants that rely on wind or vibrations for pollination."
