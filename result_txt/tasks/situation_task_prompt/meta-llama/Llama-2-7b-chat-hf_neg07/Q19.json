    "Herbal remedies: One creative approach to treating a common cold without medication would be to utilize herbal remedies. Many herbs have natural antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and ginger. By brewing these herbs into teas or taking them in supplement form, you could potentially alleviate symptoms like congestion, coughing, and sore throats.",
    "Saltwater gargle: Another option for treating a common cold is to use a saltwater gargle. Mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water and gargling several times a day could help reduce swelling in the throat and ease a sore throat.",
    "Steam inhalation: Steam inhalation is a simple and effective way to help relieve congestion and coughing associated with a common cold. By boiling water and inhaling the steam, the heat and moisture can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion in the nose and sinuses.",
    "Humidifier: Using a humidifier in your home can help add moisture to the air, which can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion. This can be especially helpful for people who live in dry climates or have dry sinuses.",
    "Probiotics: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help boost your immune system and reduce the severity of cold symptoms. By taking a probiotic supplement or eating probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or kefir, you may be able to reduce the duration and severity of a common cold."
