    "**Life Support Systems**: Creating a sustainable life support system is crucial for long-duration space missions. This involves recycling air and water, managing waste, and providing food. The challenge lies in developing closed-loop systems that can operate efficiently without resupply from Earth. Innovations like hydroponic gardens for food production and advanced filtration systems for air and water will be essential, alongside ensuring that the system can handle potential failures or malfunctions.",
    "**Propulsion Technology**: Selecting the right propulsion system is vital for maneuverability and efficiency in space. Traditional chemical rockets may not be suitable for long missions due to fuel limitations. The design team must consider alternatives like ion thrusters, nuclear thermal propulsion, or even theoretical concepts like solar sails. Each propulsion type presents its own set of challenges, such as power requirements, fuel availability, and the ability to accelerate over long periods.",
    "**Thermal Management**: Spacecraft experience extreme temperature variations, from intense heat when exposed to the sun to frigid cold in the shadow of planets. Designing an effective thermal management system that maintains optimal operating temperatures for both the crew and sensitive equipment is critical. This could involve multi-layer insulation, heat exchangers, and active thermal control systems that can adapt to changing conditions.",
    "**Communication Systems**: Reliable communication with mission control on Earth is essential for the safety and success of any space mission. However, the vast distances and potential interference in space can complicate this. The design must incorporate advanced communication technologies, such as laser communications or satellite relay systems, to ensure high data transfer rates and low latency. Additionally, redundancy must be built into the system to account for potential failures.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Spacecraft are exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation and solar particles, which can pose serious health risks to astronauts. The design must include effective shielding solutions, such as thick walls made of specialized materials or the use of water tanks as radiation barriers. Additionally, incorporating safe zones within the spacecraft where crew members can retreat during solar storms is vital for ensuring astronaut safety."
