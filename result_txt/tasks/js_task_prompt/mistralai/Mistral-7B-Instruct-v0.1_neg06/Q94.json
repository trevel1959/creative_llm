The more people and animals connected to the network, the more energy would be generated.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Euphoria Energy\" and it would be created by tapping into the natural highs and lows of human emotions.

    "The new type of energy would be called \"Fusion Energy\" and it would be created by combining two or more different types of energy sources in a way that creates a new, more powerful energy. This energy would be generated by experimenting with different types of energy sources, such as solar, wind, and nuclear, and then combining them in new and innovative ways.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Harmony Energy\" and it would be created by using technology to promote peace and understanding between different cultures and groups. This energy would be generated by creating a global network of interconnected devices that would monitor and analyze the behavior of people and then use that data to create a more harmonious society. The more people who learn to understand and appreciate each other's differences, the more energy would be generated."
