    "Woolly Mammoth - If I could bring any extinct animal back to life, I would choose the Woolly Mammoth. These majestic creatures roamed the Earth during the last ice age and were characterized by their shaggy fur, long tusks, and massive size. With their ability to survive in harsh climates and their herding behavior, I believe they could thrive in modern-day environments. Plus, their extinction was likely due to climate change, so it would be interesting to see how they would adapt to the current warming trend.",
    "Quagga - The Quagga, a subspecies of zebra, is another fascinating animal that I would love to see brought back to life. Unfortunately, the last Quagga died in 1883, but with advanced genetic techniques, it's possible to revive this unique and striking creature. Quaggas were known for their distinctive stripes, which featured a brownish-colored body with white stripes on the front and back. They were also known for their intelligence and social behavior, living in large herds in the grasslands of Africa.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - The Passenger Pigeon was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America, with an estimated population of 3 billion to 5 billion individuals. However, their numbers declined rapidly due to overhunting and habitat loss, leading to their extinction in 1914. I would love to see these fascinating birds return to their former glory, as they were known for their incredible flocking behavior and their ability to migrate thousands of miles each year.",
    "Moa - The Moa was a large flightless bird that once inhabited New Zealand, with some species reaching heights of over 10 feet (3 meters) and weighing up to 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms). Unfortunately, the last Moa died in the 15th century due to hunting and habitat loss. However, with advanced genetic techniques, it's possible to revive these magnificent birds and restore them to their native habitats. Moas were known for their size, strength, and their ability to survive in harsh environments.",
