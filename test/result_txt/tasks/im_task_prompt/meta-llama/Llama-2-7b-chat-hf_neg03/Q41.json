    "Skateboard-shaped garden planters: Transform skateboards into functional and stylish garden planters. The boards can be cut and shaped to fit into different sizes and types of plants, such as herbs, succulents, or small flowers. The trucks can be used as a trellis for climbing plants, and the wheels can be used as a self-watering system, ensuring the plants receive the right amount of moisture.",
    "Skateboard-powered generators: Design skateboards with built-in generators that harness the energy from the board's movement to generate electricity. This could be used to power small devices, such as smartphones, cameras, or even small appliances like blenders or coffee makers. The generators could be powered by the board's wheels, trucks, or even the board itself, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly source of energy.",
    "Skateboard-inspired furniture: Create furniture pieces inspired by the design and shape of skateboards. For example, a skateboard-shaped coffee table or end table with built-in storage for books, remotes, or other small items. The legs of the furniture could be designed to resemble skateboard trucks, adding a unique and quirky touch to the design.",
    "Skateboard-themed escape rooms: Design an escape room experience centered around the world of skateboarding. Participants can solve puzzles and challenges related to skateboarding, such as finding hidden skate spots, identifying different skateboarding tricks, or even building their own skateboards. The room could be designed to resemble a skate park, complete with ramps, rails, and other skateboarding features.",
    "Skateboard-infused art: Create art pieces that incorporate skateboards as the primary medium. This could include sculptures made from stacked skateboards, skateboard-shaped canvases for painting, or even skateboard-inspired mosaics. The artwork could be inspired by the colors, shapes, and textures of skateboards, or it could be more abstract, using the boards as a canvas for creative expression"
