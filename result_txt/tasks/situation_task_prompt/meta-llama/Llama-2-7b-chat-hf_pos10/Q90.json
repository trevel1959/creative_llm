    "Cloud Harvesting: In a world without rain, harnessing water from clouds would be an innovative solution. Develop a technology that mimics the process of cloud formation, using a network of nets or membranes to capture and collect water droplets. This system could be powered by solar energy, ensuring a sustainable and renewable source of water.",
    "Ocean Water Collection: In a world without rain, the ocean would be the next largest source of water. Develop a system that utilizes ocean currents and tides to collect and filter seawater, making it potable for consumption. This could involve using a series of floating barriers or platforms to capture and concentrate the water, followed by a filtration system to remove salt and impurities.",
    "Atmospheric Water Extraction: Instead of collecting water from the ground or ocean, focus on extracting water from the atmosphere itself. Develop a technology that can harness the moisture in the air, using a combination of condensation and evaporation to create freshwater. This could involve creating large-scale structures that mimic the process of fog collection, or developing a portable device that can extract moisture from the air in real-time.",
    "Desert Greenhouses: In arid regions, greenhouses could play a crucial role in collecting and storing water. Develop a system that utilizes the natural temperature and humidity of the greenhouse to create a self-sustaining water cycle. This could involve using a combination of hydroponics, aquaponics, and evaporative cooling to create a closed-loop system that collects and reuses water.",
    "Biomimetic Water Collection: Inspired by nature, develop a system that mimics the way plants collect water from the air. Create a network of micro-towers or trellises that are covered in hydrophilic materials, which absorb water from the air and release it for use. This system could be particularly effective in humid climates, where the air is already saturated with moisture."
