    "**Pre-Internet Archives**: I'd rely on physical archives and libraries, where books, documents, and records are stored. These institutions have been preserving knowledge for centuries, and their collections would still be accessible. I'd visit local libraries, universities, and research centers to find the information I need. ",
    "**Offline Databases**: I'd use offline databases, such as encyclopedias, almanacs, and other printed reference materials. These resources would still be available in bookstores, libraries, and private collections. I'd also utilize databases stored on personal computers, laptops, or mobile devices that are not connected to the internet. ",
    "**Community Knowledge**: I'd tap into community knowledge by reaching out to experts, scholars, and individuals with specialized knowledge in various fields. This could be done through face-to-face interactions, phone calls, or written correspondence. I'd also participate in local workshops, seminars, and conferences to learn from others. ",
    "**Physical Maps and Atlases**: I'd use physical maps and atlases to access geographical information, such as locations, distances, and terrain. These resources would still be available in libraries, bookstores, and travel agencies. I'd also use GPS devices and other navigation tools that don't rely on internet connectivity. ",
    "**Radio and Television**: I'd rely on radio and television broadcasts to access news, educational programs, and other forms of information. Many radio and TV stations would continue to operate, providing a source of information and entertainment. I'd also use satellite radio and other non-internet based broadcasting services. "
