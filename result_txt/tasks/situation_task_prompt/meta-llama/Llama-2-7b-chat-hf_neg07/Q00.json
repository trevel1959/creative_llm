    "Caravans: One possible solution would be to organize caravans, where people travel together in groups, carpooling and towing each other's vehicles. This would ensure that there are enough drivers and vehicles to make the journey safely and efficiently. Caravans could also be organized based on the number of passengers, so that larger groups can travel together and smaller groups can travel more quickly.",
    "Bicycle trains: Another option would be to organize bicycle trains, where people ride bicycles in a line, with each person taking turns leading and following. This would allow for a more leisurely pace and a more environmentally-friendly mode of transportation. Bicycle trains could also be organized based on skill level, so that beginners can ride with more experienced cyclists.",
    "Hitchhiking networks: In the absence of cars, people could create hitchhiking networks, where they travel together in groups, sharing rides with other travelers. This would allow for a more spontaneous and flexible mode of transportation, as people could join or leave the network as needed. Hitchhiking networks could also be organized based on destination, so that travelers can find others heading in the same direction.",
    "Foot paths: For shorter distances, people could use foot paths, such as hiking trails or walking paths, to travel between cities. This would allow for a more leisurely pace and a chance to enjoy the scenery along the way. Foot paths could also be organized based on difficulty level, so that beginners can find easier trails and more experienced hikers can tackle more challenging paths.",
    "Waterways: For longer distances, people could use waterways, such as rivers or lakes, to travel between cities. This would allow for a more relaxing and scenic mode of transportation, as people could travel by boat or kayak. Waterways could also be organized based on the type of watercraft, so that travelers can choose the one that best suits their needs and abilities."
