    "**Photosynthetic Light Source**: This plant species would have the unique ability to produce light during the night, functioning like a small, portable source of illumination. It would use its leaves to capture sunlight during the day and convert this energy into light for nighttime use. The plant would need minimal water and could thrive in low-light environments, making it an excellent choice for indoor spaces or places with limited access to sunlight.",
    "**Water Purification Plant**: This plant species would have the capability to clean polluted water by extracting toxins and pollutants while simultaneously purifying the water.

The plant could be grown in large tanks or planted near water sources, offering a sustainable method of water purification without relying on chemicals or electricity.",
    "**Emotional Support Plant**: This plant would respond to human emotions, changing its appearance and releasing specific scents based on the environment's mood. For instance, if it senses sadness or anxiety, it might release calming scents like lavender and change color to soothing hues such as blue or green. Conversely, if the environment is happy and energetic, the plant might release uplifting scents and brighten its colors. This emotional intelligence would make it a unique addition to homes, offices, and therapy rooms, potentially improving mental well-being."
