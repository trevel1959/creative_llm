    "**Scented Candle with a Twist**: Create a candle that changes scents based on the temperature. The candle could have a phase-change material that melts and releases a different fragrance as the temperature rises or falls. For example, the candle could have a citrus scent at room temperature, but as it gets hotter, it releases a floral scent. This would create an immersive experience for the user, as they would notice the scent changing in response to the environment.",
    "**Candle with a Built-in Speaker**: Design a candle that has a built-in speaker, allowing users to listen to music or nature sounds while enjoying the ambiance of the candlelight. The speaker could be powered by a rechargeable battery, and the user could control the volume and music selection using a remote or a smartphone app. This would add a new dimension to the candle experience, making it a more engaging and relaxing activity.",
    "**Candle with a Hidden Message**: Create a candle with a hidden message or design that is only visible when the candle is lit. The message could be a quote, a poem, or a personal message, and it could be written in a special wax or dye that only appears when the candle is heated. This would add an element of surprise and discovery to the candle experience, making it a unique and memorable gift.",
    "**Candle with a Mood-Enhancing Light**: Develop a candle that uses color-changing technology to create a mood-enhancing light. The candle could have a sensor that detects the user's mood and adjusts the color of the light to match it. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the candle could emit a calming blue light, while a happy user could be treated to a warm and uplifting yellow light. This would create a more immersive and responsive experience for the user, making the candle a valuable tool for mood management.",
    "**Candle with a Built-in Air Purifier**: Design a candle that not only provides ambiance and light but also purifies the air. The candle could have a built-in air purifier that uses a HEPA filter or activated carbon to remove pollutants and allergens from the air. This would make the candle a healthier and more sustainable option for users, especially those who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues. The air purifier could also be designed to detect specific pollutants and adjust its cleaning power accordingly, making it a highly effective and intelligent solution.
