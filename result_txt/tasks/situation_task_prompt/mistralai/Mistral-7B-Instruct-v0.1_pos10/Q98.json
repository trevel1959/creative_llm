    "DIY Natural Scent: I would start by creating my own natural scent using essential oils, herbs, and spices. I would mix and match different scents to create a unique and pleasant aroma that I could use to fill my home or wear on my skin.",
    "Citrus Scents: I would use citrus fruits like lemon, lime, and orange to create a refreshing and uplifting scent. I could use a citrus peeler to extract the essential oils and mix them with water to create a natural and invigorating scent.",
    "Baking Soda Scents: I would use baking soda to create a fresh and clean scent. I could mix baking soda with water to create a paste and then let it dry. Once it's dry, I could crumble it up and sprinkle it around my home to freshen up the air.",
    "Essential Oil Diffuser: I would invest in an essential oil diffuser and use it to create a pleasant scent. I could mix different essential oils together to create a unique and relaxing aroma that I could enjoy throughout the day.",
    "Herb Garden: I would start a herb garden and use it to create a natural scent. I could plant herbs like lavender, rosemary, and thyme and use them to create a fragrant and soothing atmosphere in my home."
