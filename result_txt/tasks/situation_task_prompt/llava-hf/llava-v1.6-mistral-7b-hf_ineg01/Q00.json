    "Public Transportation: Public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and trams, could become more important and widely utilized. With cars no longer functioning, these systems would need to expand to accommodate the increased demand. This could lead to improvements in public transportation infrastructure and potentially a decrease in traffic congestion.",
    "Cycling: Cycling would likely become a more popular mode of transportation, as it is an eco-friendly, healthy, and cost-effective option for both short and long distances. Cities would need to invest in better cycling infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing programs, and improved bike parking facilities.",
    "Hyperloop: A high-speed transportation system that uses magnetic levitation technology to travel through a vacuum chamber. Although currently in the experimental phase, hyperloop systems could provide a fast and efficient means of traveling long distances without the need for cars.",
    "Electric Scooters: Electric scooters are already a popular mode of transportation in many cities, and their popularity could increase significantly in a car-less world. They are lightweight, easy to maneuver, and can cover longer distances than skateboards.",
    "Walking: In a car-less world, walking would become a more common mode of transportation for short to medium distances. This would encourage a more active lifestyle and promote healthier living conditions. Additionally, cities would need to invest in pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, such as wide sidewalks, pedestrian-only zones, and well-maintained pathways."
