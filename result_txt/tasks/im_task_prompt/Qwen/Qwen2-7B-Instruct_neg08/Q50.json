    "**Smartphone with Enhanced Augmented Reality (AR) Capabilities**: Develop a smartphone with advanced AR features that allow users to overlay digital information onto the real world in real-time. This could be particularly useful for educational purposes, such as providing historical context during visits to landmarks, or for enhancing gaming experiences by adding interactive elements to physical spaces.",
    "**Smartphone with Self-Cleaning Coating**: Implement a nano-coating on the smartphone screen that repels dust, fingerprints, and liquid, making it easier to maintain cleanliness and reduce the need for frequent cleaning. This not only saves time but also potentially extends the lifespan of the device by reducing wear and tear.",
    "**Smartphone with Health Monitoring Integration**: Create a smartphone that seamlessly integrates with wearable health monitoring devices, allowing users to track their fitness, monitor vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure, and receive real-time alerts for potential health issues. The device could also learn from these data to offer personalized health recommendations and reminders.",
    "**Smartphone with Advanced Eye-Care Technology**: Design a smartphone that includes features to protect users from blue light exposure, which can cause eye strain and disrupt sleep patterns. This could include adjustable color temperature settings, automatic dimming capabilities, and possibly even a feature that tracks screen usage time to remind users to take breaks and rest their eyes.",
    "**Smartphone with Built-in 3D Printing Capabilities**: Integrate miniaturized 3D printing technology into smartphones, enabling users to create small objects or prototypes directly from the device. This could be particularly useful for students, hobbyists, and professionals who require quick prototyping or customization of items."
