    "**Inadequate Cooling Solutions**: When assembling a computer, it's crucial to consider thermal management. If the CPU and GPU are not adequately cooled, they can overheat, leading to performance throttling or even hardware failure. Many builders underestimate the importance of cooling systems, such as fans or liquid cooling solutions, which can result in a noisy or unstable machine.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Handling sensitive electronic components without proper precautions can lead to static electricity discharge, which can damage the components. Builders often forget to use anti-static wrist straps or work on non-static surfaces, risking the integrity of the motherboard, RAM, or CPU.",
    "**Cable Management Challenges**: A cluttered and poorly managed cabling setup can hinder airflow within the case and make future upgrades or troubleshooting more difficult. New builders may not plan for cable management, leading to a messy interior that can impact cooling efficiency and overall aesthetics.",
    "**Software Installation and Configuration**: After the hardware is assembled, the next challenge is installing the operating system and necessary drivers. Issues can arise if the installation media is corrupted, if there are BIOS settings that need to be adjusted, or if drivers are not compatible with the hardware. This stage can be frustrating, especially for those unfamiliar with the software side of computing.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Many first-time builders underestimate the total cost of building a computer. They may focus on the price of major components like the CPU and GPU but overlook additional costs such as storage, peripherals, and software licenses. This can lead to financial strain or compromises on component quality."
