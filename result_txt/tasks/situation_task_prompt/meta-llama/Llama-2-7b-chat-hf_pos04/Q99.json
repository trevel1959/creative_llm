    "Shape-based differentiation: Since colors are no longer present, the unique shapes of objects could be used to distinguish them. For instance, a circular object with a distinctive bump in the center could be differentiated from a flat, rectangular object with sharp corners.",
    "Texture-based differentiation: Even in a black and white world, different textures can still be perceived. For example, a rough, bumpy surface could be differentiated from a smooth, glossy surface. This could be especially useful for identifying objects like rocks, leaves, and fabrics.",
    "Size-based differentiation: Even though colors are absent, objects of different sizes can still be distinguished. For instance, a small, round object could be differentiated from a larger, more elongated object. This could be useful for identifying objects like fruit, rocks, and tools.",
    "Sound-based differentiation: In a black and white world, the sounds objects make could be used to identify them. For example, a metallic object might make a distinctive clinking sound when moved, while a wooden object might make a more muffled thud. This could be especially useful for identifying objects in a dark or quiet environment.",
    "Smell-based differentiation: While colors are absent, the distinctive smells of different objects could still be perceived. For instance, a sweet, floral scent could be used to identify a flower, while a pungent, earthy scent could be used to identify a root vegetable. This could be especially useful for identifying food items in a survival situation."
