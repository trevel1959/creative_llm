    "**Incorporating Daylight into Sleep:** One creative solution could be to design a room where all the walls, ceiling, and even floor are transparent. This setup allows natural daylight to enter the room during daytime hours, creating an environment that mimics sunlight. The person can then adjust their sleeping schedule to accommodate this new light pattern, essentially training their body to associate natural daylight with sleep time. This method might require a gradual adjustment period but could help in adapting to a world without night-time.",
    "**Sleeping with Specialized Gear:** Develop wearable technology designed to provide artificial light during daytime hours. These could be wearable headgear or wrist devices that emit light at specific wavelengths, promoting restful sleep. These devices would need to be calibrated based on individual light sensitivity levels to ensure they are effective without causing discomfort or disrupting other daily activities.",
    "**Creating a Sunroom Sleep Pod:** Design a portable, retractable pod that can be installed in any space. This pod would have transparent panels that open up during daytime hours to let in natural light, while maintaining privacy. Inside the pod, the ambient lighting could be adjusted to simulate different light conditions, allowing users to control the intensity of light to suit their sleep preferences. This solution provides a flexible and customizable sleep environment.",
    "**Using Light Therapy for Sleep:** Implement a system of adjustable light fixtures around the room that mimic the phases of sunrise and sunset. This system would gradually increase light intensity during the \"night\" hours, helping to induce sleepiness, and then decrease it during the \"day\" to encourage wakefulness. The user would need to program the system according to their personal sleep patterns, which could adapt over time as they get used to the new sleep schedule.",
    "**Developing a Sleep Inducing App:** Create a mobile application that uses auditory and visual stimuli to induce sleep. The app could include features like guided meditations, soothing music, and light animations that gradually become less intense as the user approaches sleep. Users could customize settings based on their preferences and sleep requirements. The app would also monitor sleep patterns and adjust its recommendations accordingly, fostering better sleep habits in a 24/7 illuminated world."
