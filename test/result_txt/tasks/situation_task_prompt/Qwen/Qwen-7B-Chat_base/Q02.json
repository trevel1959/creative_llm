    "Community Gardens: Create community gardens in public spaces such as parks or schoolyards where people can grow their own fruits and vegetables. This way, everyone has access to fresh produce and can help reduce the need for supermarkets.",
    "Food Co-ops: Form local food co-ops that allow people to purchase groceries in bulk at a lower cost. These co-ops could be run by volunteers and would offer a variety of healthy foods.",
    "Food Banks: Increase the number of food banks in communities to provide free food to those in need. This would ensure that people have access to basic necessities even if supermarkets are closed down.",
    "Home Delivery Services: Partner with local restaurants and grocery stores to offer home delivery services. This would allow people to order their groceries online and have them delivered right to their doorstep.",
    "Mobile Markets: Set up mobile markets in areas that do not have easy access to supermarkets. These markets could sell fresh produce, meats, and other groceries at affordable prices. They could also be set up on wheels so they can move around to different neighborhoods."
