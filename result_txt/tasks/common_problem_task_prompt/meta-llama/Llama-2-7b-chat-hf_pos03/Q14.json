    "Bio-based Building Materials: Utilize sustainable materials like bamboo, straw, or hemp for building components like walls, floors, and roofs. These materials are biodegradable, non-toxic, and have high thermal insulation properties, reducing the building's carbon footprint and environmental impact.",
    "Solar Powered High-Rise: Integrate a large-scale solar panel system on the building's rooftop to generate electricity. The panels can be designed to rotate to optimize energy production throughout the day, and the building can also incorporate energy storage systems like batteries to ensure a stable power supply.",
    "Vertical Farm: Incorporate an indoor vertical farm on the building's rooftop or within its structure. This will allow for year-round crop cultivation, reducing the carbon footprint of food transportation and providing a local source of fresh produce for the building's occupants.",
    "Green Roof: Create a living roof on the building, covered with lush vegetation and soil. This will provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create a habitat for local wildlife. The green roof can also be designed with a water harvesting system to collect and store rainwater for irrigation and other non-potable uses.",
    "Air Purification System: Develop an innovative air purification system that utilizes natural elements like plants, algae, or bacteria to cleanse the building's air. This system can be integrated into the building's HVAC system, providing a healthier and more sustainable indoor environment for occupants."
