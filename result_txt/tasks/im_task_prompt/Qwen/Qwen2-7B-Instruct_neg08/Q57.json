    "**Adaptive Feedback Mechanism**: Create a computer mouse that provides tactile feedback based on the user's preferences and usage patterns. The mouse could learn from its user's habits over time, adjusting the weight, texture, or even the shape of the mouse accordingly. For instance, if someone prefers a heavier mouse for gaming, the device would adapt and provide more weight as needed.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Power Management**: Develop a computer mouse that supports wireless charging. This feature would allow users to charge the mouse without the need for cables, enhancing convenience and reducing clutter. Additionally, implement an energy-efficient power management system that extends battery life, enabling extended use between charges.",
    "**Integrative Voice Recognition**: Integrate voice commands into the computer mouse to allow users to control their computers hands-free. Users could issue commands like \"scroll up,\" \"zoom in,\" or \"open application\" by speaking instead of clicking. This innovation would be particularly beneficial for visually impaired individuals, those with mobility issues, and anyone who desires greater accessibility and ease of use.",
    "**Customizable Surface Area**: Offer a computer mouse with an adjustable surface area, allowing users to modify the size according to their needs. Smaller surfaces could be suitable for users with limited desk space or for those who prefer a more compact design, while larger surfaces could cater to professionals who require more workspace for precise work or gaming.",
    "**Smart Object Detection**: Implement a computer mouse that detects the presence of nearby objects (such as fingers) and adjusts its sensitivity accordingly. This would prevent accidental clicks when a user accidentally brushes against the mouse and would also optimize performance based on the user's distance from the screen, enhancing comfort and precision."
