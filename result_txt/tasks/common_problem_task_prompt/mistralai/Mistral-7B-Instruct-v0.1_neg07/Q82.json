    "Incorporate multi-functional furniture: One of the key aspects of designing a tiny house is to maximize space. To achieve this, consider using multi-functional furniture pieces that can serve multiple purposes. For example, a foldable table that can also serve as a desk, or a sofa bed that can also be used as a daybed.",
    "Use natural materials: Natural materials such as wood, stone, and bamboo can add warmth and character to a tiny house. Consider using reclaimed wood for the flooring or walls, or incorporating plants and greenery to bring in a natural element.",
    "Utilize vertical space: In a tiny house, every square inch counts. Consider using vertical space to your advantage by installing shelves, cabinets, and hooks on the walls and ceiling.",
    "Choose a compact appliance: When it comes to appliances, choose compact and energy-efficient options that don't take up too much space. Consider using a mini fridge, a single-burner stove, and a small washing machine.",
    "Incorporate technology: Technology can be a great way to save space in a tiny house. Consider using a smart TV that can also serve as a computer or a projector, or installing a smart thermostat that can be controlled remotely."
