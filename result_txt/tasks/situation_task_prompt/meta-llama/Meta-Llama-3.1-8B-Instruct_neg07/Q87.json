    "**Magnetic Cutting Tool**: A handheld device that uses a strong magnetic field to manipulate and cut through various materials like metal, plastic, and even some types of wood. The tool would consist of a handle with a magnetic head that can be adjusted to different strengths, allowing users to cut through materials of varying thicknesses. This device would be particularly useful for cutting through metal pipes, wire, or even metal sheets.",
    "**Laser Cutting Wands**: A futuristic, handheld laser cutting tool that uses a high-powered laser diode to precision-cut through materials like paper, fabric, or even thin metal sheets. The wand would have a ergonomic design, allowing users to easily maneuver and control the cutting process. This device would be ideal for cutting intricate designs, patterns, or even custom shapes for various crafts and projects.",
    "**Rotary Cutting Saw**: A compact, handheld saw that uses a rotating blade to cut through materials like wood, plastic, or even drywall. The saw would have a variable speed control, allowing users to adjust the cutting speed based on the material being cut. This device would be particularly useful for cutting through thicker materials or for making precise cuts in tight spaces.",
    "**Ultrasonic Cutting Tool**: A handheld device that uses high-frequency ultrasonic waves to cut through materials like fabric, paper, or even thin metal sheets. The tool would consist of a handle with a transducer that generates the ultrasonic waves, which would then be directed at the material to be cut. This device would be ideal for cutting through delicate or fragile materials without causing damage.",
    "**Electro-Cutting Wire**: A thin, flexible wire that can be used to cut through materials like metal, plastic, or even wood. The wire would be made of a conductive material that, when energized, would heat up and cut through the material. This device would be particularly useful for cutting through thin materials or for making precise cuts in tight spaces."
