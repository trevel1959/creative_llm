    "Smart Bike Bell: Create a bike bell that can be controlled through an app on your smartphone. This bell can be programmed to make different sounds, such as a traditional bike bell, a car horn, or even a bird chirp, depending on the situation. For example, you can program it to make a loud horn sound when you're approaching a busy intersection or a softer chirp when you're riding through a quiet neighborhood.",
    "Multi-functional Bell: Design a bell that serves multiple purposes. For example, it can be a bell, a light, and a horn all in one. The bell can be used to signal your presence to other cyclists or pedestrians, the light can provide visibility in low-light conditions, and the horn can be used to alert others of potential dangers.",
    "Personalized Bell: Create a bell that can be personalized with a custom message or logo. This can be a unique gift for cycling enthusiasts or a way to promote a brand. The bell can be made of a durable material, such as metal or rubber, and can be designed to fit different types of bikes.",
    "Bell with Safety Features: Develop a bell that includes safety features such as a reflector or a flashing light. This can help increase visibility and safety, especially in low-light conditions. The bell can also be designed with a whistle or other audible alarm to alert others of potential dangers.",
    "Bell as a Bike Lock: Design a bell that can also serve as a bike lock. The bell can be made of a durable material, such as metal, and can be shaped to fit around the handlebars of a bike. The bell can be used to secure the bike to a fixed object, such as a bike rack, and can provide an additional layer of security."
