    "Noise Reduction: Develop a noise-reducing mechanism that would allow the fan to operate quietly, making it ideal for bedrooms or home offices. This could be achieved through the use of sound-absorbing materials or a more efficient blade design.",
    "Air Purification: Integrate a built-in air purification system into the ceiling fan, using advanced filters to remove dust, pollen, and other airborne particles. This would create a healthier indoor environment and reduce the need for separate air purifiers.",
    "Smart Technology: Incorporate smart features into the ceiling fan, such as Wi-Fi connectivity, voice control, and automated lighting integration. This would allow users to adjust fan speed, lighting, and even color schemes remotely, creating a more comfortable and personalized living space.",
    "Energy Efficiency: Design a ceiling fan with energy-efficient motors that consume less power while maintaining the same level of air circulation. This could be achieved through the use of advanced motor technology or by optimizing blade design for maximum airflow with minimal energy consumption.",
    "Multipurpose Design: Create a ceiling fan with a modular design that allows users to easily switch between different functions, such as a standard fan, a light fixture, or even a heater. This would provide maximum versatility and functionality in a single unit."
