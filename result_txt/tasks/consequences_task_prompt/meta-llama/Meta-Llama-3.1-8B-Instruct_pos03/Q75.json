    "**Global Coastal Cities Become Uninhabitable**: With the oceans turning into freshwater, the coastal cities would face an unprecedented crisis. The water level would rise, flooding the cities and displacing millions of people. The lack of saltwater would also disrupt the marine ecosystem, leading to the extinction of many marine species. The consequences would be catastrophic, and governments would struggle to provide aid and shelter to the affected populations.",
    "**Freshwater Aquatic Life Thrives, But at a Cost**: As the oceans become freshwater, new aquatic life forms would emerge, adapting to the changed environment. However, these new species would likely outcompete and displace existing marine life, leading to a loss of biodiversity. The changed ecosystem would also affect the global food chain, potentially leading to widespread famine.",
    "**Rise of New Maritime Empires**: With the oceans becoming freshwater, new maritime trade routes and empires would emerge. The changed environment would create opportunities for nations to establish themselves as dominant powers, exploiting the new resources and trade opportunities. However, this would also lead to conflicts over resources, territory, and influence.",
    "**Mass Migration and Social Upheaval**: The sudden change would lead to a massive migration of people from coastal areas to inland regions. This would put a strain on the global infrastructure, leading to social and economic upheaval. The displaced populations would need to adapt to new living conditions, leading to cultural and societal changes.",
    "**Economic Boom and Bust**: The changed environment would create new economic opportunities, such as the exploitation of freshwater resources and the development of new industries. However, the sudden shift would also lead to economic instability, as industries reliant on saltwater would collapse. The global economy would experience a significant boom, followed by a devastating bust as the new industries struggle to establish themselves.
