    "**Tall Buildings Become the Norm**: With reduced gravity, the structural integrity of buildings would change. Architects could design taller structures without the need for massive foundation support, leading to a new era of skyscrapers. The reduced weight would also decrease the energy required for heating, cooling, and powering buildings.",
    "**Extreme Sports Get a Boost**: Half-gravity environments would revolutionize extreme sports like skydiving, bungee jumping, and rock climbing. Athletes could perform longer, more complex maneuvers, and the risk of injury would decrease due to the reduced force of impact. New sports and competitions would emerge, focusing on gravity-defying stunts and acrobatics.",
    "**Changes in Human Physiology**: Reduced gravity would likely affect the human body, leading to changes in bone density, muscle mass, and cardiovascular health. People might adapt to the new environment by developing stronger, more efficient muscles, and their bodies could become more agile and flexible. This could also lead to new medical treatments and therapies.",
    "**Environmental Consequences**: Halved gravity would have a significant impact on ecosystems. Trees and plants might grow more horizontally, and their root systems would need to adapt to the changed gravitational forces. This could lead to new types of flora and fauna, and the reduced gravity would also affect the distribution and behavior of animals.",
    "**Economic and Social Implications**: The reduced gravity would create new opportunities for space exploration and colonization. The cost of launching objects into space would decrease, making it more feasible for humanity to establish permanent settlements on the Moon, Mars, or other celestial bodies. This could lead to a new era of space-based industries, tourism, and scientific research. The social implications would be profound, as people would need to adapt to living and working in a lower-gravity environment.
