    "Woolly Mammoth: I would choose to bring back the Woolly Mammoth because it was a majestic and fascinating animal that lived in North America and Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch. It was the largest mammal ever to have lived on Earth and had a thick coat of fur that kept it warm in the cold climate. Bringing back the Woolly Mammoth would be a great opportunity to study its behavior, habitat, and social structure in its natural environment.",
    "T: I would choose to bring back the Tasmanian Tiger because it was a unique and powerful predator that once lived in Australia and Tasmania. It had a distinctive orange and black striped coat and was one of the largest marsupials ever to have lived. Bringing back the Tasmanian Tiger would be a great opportunity to study its hunting techniques, social behavior, and adaptations to its environment.",
    "Dodo: I would choose to bring back the Dodo because it was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. It was an iconic symbol of the island and had a distinctive appearance with its large head and small wings. Bringing back the Dodo would be a great opportunity to study its behavior, habitat, and adaptations to its environment.",
    "Trilobite: I would choose to bring back the Trilobite because it was a prehistoric arthropod that lived during the Cambrian period. It had a distinctive triangular body and was one of the first animals to develop a hard exoskeleton. Bringing back the Trilobite would be a great opportunity to study its evolutionary history and the environmental conditions that led to its extinction.",
    "Saber-toothed Tiger: I would choose to bring back the Saber-toothed Tiger because it was a powerful predator that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. It had long, sharp teeth and was one of the largest cats ever to have lived. Bringing back the Saber-toothed Tiger would be a great opportunity to study its hunting techniques, social behavior, and adaptations to its environment."
