    "Wheelchair: A wheelchair would be a practical and convenient option for moving around if I could no longer stand up. I could use it to navigate through different areas and reach places that would be difficult or impossible to access on foot. I would give this idea a confidence score of 0.8 as it is a common and reliable solution for people with mobility issues.",
    "Hoverchair: A hoverchair is a futuristic and innovative option that could potentially allow me to move around without any physical effort. It would use magnetic levitation technology to float above the ground, providing a smooth and stable ride. While this idea is intriguing, its feasibility and practicality are still unknown, so I would give it a confidence score of 0.5.",
    "Exoskeleton Suit: An exoskeleton suit is a wearable device that can enhance or restore mobility for people with mobility issues. It would provide support and stability, allowing me to stand and move around with greater ease. While this idea is promising, it may not be suitable for long-term use and could be expensive, so I would give it a confidence score of 0.6.",
    "Magnetic Field Therapy: Magnetic field therapy involves using magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells and promote healing. By applying magnetic fields to specific areas of the body, I could potentially regain mobility and balance. While this idea is still in the experimental phase, some studies have shown promising results, so I would give it a confidence score of 0.4.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface: A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that allows people to control technology with their thoughts. By using a BCI, I could potentially control a robotic or exoskeleton suit with my mind, allowing me to move around without the need for physical mobility. While this idea is still in the development stage, it has the potential to revolutionize the way people with mobility issues interact with their environment, so I would give it a confidence score of 0.7."
