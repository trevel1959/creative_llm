The entity could be depicted as a creature that wraps itself around the person, suffocating them with its presence, or it could be a constant companion that the person tries to keep at bay. The entity could also be a symbol of the person's own fears and doubts, a constant reminder of their vulnerability.",
    "**\"The Weight of Expectations\"**: A person is shown carrying a massive weight on their shoulders, symbolizing the expectations placed upon them by others. This weight could be represented as a physical object, such as a boulder or a heavy chain, or it could be depicted as a mental burden, where the person is weighed down by the pressure to perform. The weight could also be a metaphor for the person's own self-imposed expectations, where they feel like they're carrying the world on their shoulders.",

    "**\"The Shadow Self\"**: A person is shown with a shadow that's darker and more twisted than their own. This shadow could represent the person's repressed thoughts and emotions, where they're hiding from their own darker impulses.
