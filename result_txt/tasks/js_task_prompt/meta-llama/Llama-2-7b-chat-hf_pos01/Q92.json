    "Retrograde Orbits: Imagine a solar system where the planets have retrograde orbits, meaning they move in the opposite direction to the Sun. This would create a unique and visually striking arrangement, with the planets appearing to \"dance\" around the Sun in reverse. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Tidal Locking: Redesign the solar system to have tidally locked planets, where one side of the planet permanently faces the Sun while the other side is perpetually in darkness. This would create extreme temperature differences between the two hemispheres, leading to the development of unique and fascinating ecosystems. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Rings of Planets: Imagine a solar system with multiple concentric rings, each containing a planet with its own unique atmosphere and ecosystem. The inner ring would be the closest to the Sun and would be home to small, rocky planets, while the outer rings would be larger and more gas giant-like, with complex ring systems of their own. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Shattered Planet: Redesign a planet to have a shattered, fragmented appearance, with large chunks of rock and debris scattered throughout the solar system. This would create a dramatic and otherworldly landscape, with each fragment having its own unique geological features and potential for supporting life. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Gravity Reversal: Imagine a solar system where the gravitational forces are reversed, with the planets pulling each other towards the Sun instead of away from it. This would create a unique and unpredictable dynamic, with the planets' orbits and interactions with each other being determined by their gravitational attraction to the Sun. Confidence Score: 0.6"
