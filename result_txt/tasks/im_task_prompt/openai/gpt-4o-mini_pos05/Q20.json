    "**Integrated Grinder with Flavor Profiles**: Create a coffee maker that includes a built-in grinder capable of grinding beans to different specifications based on the selected flavor profile. Users could choose from a range of options (e.g., espresso, French press, cold brew) and the machine would automatically adjust the grind size and brewing time for optimal flavor extraction.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a coffee maker with a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and a specialized cleaning solution to remove coffee oils and residue. This would not only maintain the taste quality but also extend the lifespan of the machine. Users could activate the cleaning cycle with a simple button press or via the app.",
    "**Customizable Brew Pods**: Introduce a system that allows users to create their own coffee pods with their preferred coffee blends. The coffee maker could come with a reusable pod that users can fill with their choice of ground coffee, allowing for greater customization while reducing waste associated with traditional single-use pods.",
    "**Coffee and Milk Frother Combo**: Combine the coffee maker with a milk frother that can create a variety of milk textures (e.g., foamy for lattes, steamed for cappuccinos) directly from the coffee machine. This would eliminate the need for a separate device and provide users with caf√©-quality beverages at home.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Add a flavor infusion chamber that allows users to add spices, herbs, or flavored syrups directly into the brewing process. This feature would enable users to create unique coffee beverages, such as chai-infused coffee or vanilla-flavored brews, enhancing the overall coffee experience."
