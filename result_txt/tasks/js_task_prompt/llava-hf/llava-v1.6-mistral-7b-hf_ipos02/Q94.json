    "Nano-Kinetic Energy: This energy type would be derived from the movement of tiny particles or nanobots that can generate electricity when they move through a magnetic field. These nanobots could be designed to harness the energy from the movement of ocean waves, wind, or even the human body, providing a portable and versatile energy source that could power devices and vehicles.",
    "Quantum Energy: Based on the principles of quantum mechanics, this energy source would be generated by manipulating subatomic particles to create a state of matter that releases energy when it reverts to its original state. This energy could be harnessed through advanced technologies that can control and manipulate quantum states, potentially providing a clean and efficient source of power.",
    "Geothermal-Tidal Energy Hybrid: This energy source would combine the power of geothermal energy from the Earth's core with the tidal energy from the ocean's waves. By installing underwater turbines that harness the energy of tidal currents and geothermal heat pumps that extract heat from the Earth's core, this hybrid system could provide a consistent and reliable source of energy.",
    "Biomass-Electric Energy: This energy type would be generated by breaking down organic matter, such as plant waste or agricultural byproducts, through a process called biomass gasification. The resulting gas would be used to power generators, providing a sustainable and renewable source of electricity.",
    "Fusion-Powered Nuclear Reactors: This energy source would combine the power of nuclear fission with the efficiency of nuclear fusion. By using advanced technologies to control the fusion reaction, these reactors could generate a clean and virtually limitless source of electricity, with minimal waste products."
