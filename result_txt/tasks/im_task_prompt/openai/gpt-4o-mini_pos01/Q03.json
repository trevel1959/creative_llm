    "**Steam Infuser**: Add a steam infuser feature that allows users to add flavored water or broth to the microwave. This would enhance the flavor of reheated food, making it taste fresher. The infuser could be a detachable compartment that releases steam during cooking, infusing moisture and flavor without the need for additional pots or pans.",
    "**Multi-Zone Cooking**: Design the microwave with multiple cooking zones that can operate independently. Users could heat different types of food simultaneously without cross-contamination of flavors or aromas. This feature would be particularly useful for families with varying tastes or for meal prepping.",
    "**Built-in Air Fryer**: Incorporate an air fryer function within the microwave, allowing users to not only reheat but also cook healthier meals with less oil. This dual-functionality would save space in the kitchen and offer a wider range of cooking options, from crispy fries to roasted vegetables.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**: Create a touch-screen interface on the microwave that displays recipes and cooking instructions. Users could select a recipe, and the microwave would automatically adjust the time and power settings accordingly. The screen could also show step-by-step instructions, including images or videos, for complex dishes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high temperatures to sanitize the interior of the microwave. This would make maintenance easier and more hygienic, reducing the need for chemical cleaners and manual scrubbing. Users could simply select the self-clean option and let the microwave do the work."
