    "**Accessibility Challenges**: Ensuring that the updated transportation system is accessible to all members of society is crucial. For instance, the city might need to consider providing ramps and other accommodations for individuals with disabilities or those who are older and have mobility issues.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Transitioning to a more modern and eco-friendly transportation system might lead to challenges in retrofitting or upgrading existing infrastructure. As the city overhauls the system, it will have to carefully balance the need for environmental benefits with the practical aspects of upgrades.",
    "**Public Perception**: Introducing new technology or making dramatic changes to the system could face resistance from the public. There might be a lack of understanding or fear around new technologies, which could impact the public's willingness to use the system. Therefore, the city might have to invest in public outreach and education programs to ease these concerns.",
    "**Job Creation and Training**: Implementing new technology or infrastructure for the transportation system could mean new job openings in different areas, but it also implies a need for training and upskilling of existing employees. The city needs to be prepared to support this aspect of the transition.",
    "**Funding and Budgeting**: Overhauling a public transportation system comes with a significant financial commitment. The city will have to consider different funding options, including grants, partnerships, and bonds, and develop a financial plan to ensure the sustainability of the overhaul."
