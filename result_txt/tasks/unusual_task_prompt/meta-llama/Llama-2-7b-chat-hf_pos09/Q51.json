    "Cutting-Edge Innovation: Develop a line of smart scissors that use AI-powered algorithms to optimize cutting techniques and reduce waste. These scissors could learn from user preferences and adapt to different materials, making them more efficient and effective over time.",
    "Foldable Design: Create a compact, portable scissor design that can be folded into a small, convenient size for easy storage and transportation. This could be particularly useful for people who travel frequently or have limited space at home.",
    "Vibration-Assisted Cutting: Incorporate vibration technology into the scissors to help with cutting tasks, particularly for people with limited dexterity or mobility. This could help improve cutting accuracy and reduce fatigue.",
    "Augmented Reality Cutting: Develop a pair of scissors with an augmented reality (AR) display that provides real-time feedback on cutting techniques and accuracy. This could help users improve their cutting skills and learn new techniques more quickly.",
    "Biodegradable Materials: Create a line of scissors made from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or plant-based plastics. This could help reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of scissors production and disposal."
