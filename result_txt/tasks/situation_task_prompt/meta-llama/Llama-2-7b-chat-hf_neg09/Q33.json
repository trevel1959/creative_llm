    "Nature's rhythm: One way to keep track of time without clocks or watches is to observe the natural rhythms of the environment. For instance, the rising and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, or the changing seasons. These cycles can be used to mark the passage of time, creating a sense of continuity and order.",
    "Community chimes: Another approach is to establish a communal timekeeping system, where a designated bell or gong is rung at regular intervals to signal the passage of time. This could be done in a neighborhood, a village, or even a city, creating a shared sense of time and community.",
    "Personal rituals: Individuals could create their own personal rituals to keep track of time. For example, they could take a daily walk at the same time every day, or perform a specific task at a set time each day. This would create a sense of routine and structure, allowing them to keep track of time without relying on clocks or watches.",
    "Time-stamped artifacts: People could create artifacts that are time-stamped, such as handmade pottery or sculptures, that are unique and can be used to mark the passage of time. These artifacts could be kept and passed down through generations, serving as a tangible reminder of the time that has passed.",
    "Memory mapping: A more abstract approach to keeping track of time is to create a mental or physical map of memories associated with different time periods. This could involve associating specific events, emotions, or experiences with different times of the day, week, or year. By visualizing these memories, individuals could keep track of time without relying on physical timekeeping devices."
