    "<s>Gravity-Defying Moons</s> Gravity-Defying Moons: Design a solar system with moons that have the ability to defy gravity, allowing them to float freely in space. These moons could be used as bases for space exploration or as unique tourist attractions.",
    "<s>Atmospheric Oases</s> Atmospheric Oases: Create a solar system with planets that have breathable atmospheres, but also have pockets of air that can be used to create small, self-sustaining ecosystems. These oases could be used for research, agriculture, or as habitats for various species.",
    "<s>Interplanetary Cities</s> Interplanetary Cities: Design a solar system with cities built on the surfaces of multiple planets and moons. These cities could be connected by a network of tunnels and bridges, allowing for easy travel and trade between different planets.",
    "<s>Space-Time Continuum</s> Space-Time Continuum: Create a solar system where time and space are intertwined, allowing for faster-than-light travel and the ability to move between different points in space-time. This could revolutionize space exploration and open up new possibilities for human civilization.",
    "<s>Planetary Gardens</s> Planetary Gardens: Design a solar system with planets that are covered in lush gardens and forests, providing a sustainable and biodiverse environment for various species. These planets could be used for research, agriculture, or as habitats for various species."
