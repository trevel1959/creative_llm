    "**Smart Cane with Augmented Reality**: Create a smart cane equipped with augmented reality (AR) technology that provides users with visual information about their environment through a paired smart device. The cane could have sensors to detect obstacles and relay this information through a heads-up display on smart glasses or a smartphone. Users could receive information about nearby landmarks, street signs, or even the location of friends and family, enhancing their independence and confidence when navigating unfamiliar spaces.",
    "**Voice-Activated Smart Home Integration**: Develop a comprehensive smart home system specifically designed for visually impaired individuals. This system would allow users to control their home environment through voice commands, providing feedback about their surroundings. For instance, users could ask the system to read out the contents of their fridge, turn on lights in specific rooms, or provide reminders for important tasks. The integration of AI could allow the system to learn the user's habits and preferences over time, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.",
    "**Wearable Object Recognition Device**: Create a compact wearable device that uses machine learning algorithms to recognize everyday objects and provide audio descriptions to the user. This device could be worn as a pendant or on the wrist and would use a camera to scan the environment. When the user points the device at an object, it would identify it and announce its name and relevant details, such as color or function. This technology would empower users to identify items in their home or when out shopping, fostering greater independence.",
    "**Interactive Braille Learning Platform**: Develop an interactive learning platform that teaches Braille in an engaging way using a combination of tactile feedback and gamification. This platform could include a Braille tablet that provides dynamic Braille output, allowing users to practice reading and writing in a fun, game-like environment. The system could track progress and offer rewards for milestones, making the learning process enjoyable and motivating for users of all ages.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Create an AI-driven personal assistant app designed specifically for visually impaired users. This app would provide a wide range of services, from reading text aloud (such as messages, emails, or books) to helping with daily tasks like scheduling appointments or setting reminders. Users could interact with the assistant through voice commands, and the app could integrate with other services like navigation, shopping, and entertainment, creating a seamless and accessible experience."
