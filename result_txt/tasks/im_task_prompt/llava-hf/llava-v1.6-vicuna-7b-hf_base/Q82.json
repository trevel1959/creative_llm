    "Reinforced toe box: Adding a reinforced toe box to the socks can provide extra support and comfort for the toes, reducing the risk of blisters and injuries from friction. This can be achieved by adding a durable layer of material in the toe area and stitching it securely to the rest of the sock.",
    "Heat retention: Incorporating materials that have thermogenic properties can help retain heat, making the socks perfect for colder weather. This can be achieved by adding small particles of metal or other conductive materials that heat up when in contact with the body.",
    "Customizable fit: Adding a system to adjust the fit of the socks can make them more comfortable and secure. This can be achieved by incorporating laces or elastic loops that can be tightened or loosened to fit the foot perfectly.",
    "Anti-microbial properties: Adding antimicrobial properties to the socks can help reduce odor and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. This can be achieved by incorporating silver ions or other natural antimicrobial agents into the material.",
    "Reflective elements: Adding reflective elements to the socks can increase their visibility, making it easier for joggers and cyclists to be seen in low light or poor weather conditions. This can be achieved by adding reflective strips or panels on the side of the socks."
