    "**Creative Trash Can Recycling System**: Design a trash can that is not only functional but also educational. The can has multiple compartments for different types of recyclables such as paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste. Each compartment could have an embedded sensor that identifies the type of waste when thrown in, and through a digital display or voice assistant, educate the user on why this specific item should be recycled. This system promotes environmental awareness while making recycling accessible and convenient.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with AI**: Integrate artificial intelligence into the trash can to offer personalized suggestions based on the items thrown away. For instance, if you often throw away leftover food, the AI could recommend recipes that use similar ingredients. It could also suggest ways to reduce waste by suggesting alternative uses for certain items before they are discarded. This idea encourages sustainable living and helps users make more eco-friendly choices.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can Game**: Create an engaging game that turns the act of disposing of trash into an interactive experience. The trash can would be equipped with sensors that detect the type and size of the items thrown in. Based on this information, the game would present challenges or mini-games related to waste management, recycling, and sustainability. Players earn points or rewards for correctly sorting and disposing of items, promoting environmental responsibility in a fun and interactive way.",
    "**Trash Can with Built-in Composting Function**: Design a trash can that includes a composting mechanism within its structure. The can would have a small chamber where organic waste can be composted using heat and microorganisms. Users could place their food scraps directly into this chamber, and the can would take care of the rest. This idea is particularly useful in urban areas where space is limited and traditional composting methods may not be feasible.",
    "**Trash Can as a Community Recycling Hub**: Develop a larger-scale trash can that serves as a community recycling hub. This can be placed in public areas like parks, schools, or community centers. The hub would feature multiple compartments for various recyclables and non-recyclables. It could also include educational materials, a digital screen displaying recycling statistics, and a leaderboard for community participation. This idea encourages community engagement and fosters a sense of responsibility towards environmental conservation."
