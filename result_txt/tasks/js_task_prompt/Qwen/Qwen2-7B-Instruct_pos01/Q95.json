    "**Territorial Skywalkers**: A habitat that allows creatures to fly and soar in the sky, much like birds and bats do. This would include large, transparent walkways suspended high above the ground, allowing for a unique way of movement and observation. The habitat could be designed with different levels, each with varying degrees of elevation and terrain types (e.g., forests, deserts, mountains). Vegetation would be grown on these elevated paths, and water sources could be integrated into the design. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Subterranean Serenaders**: A deep underground environment that mimics various ecosystems found beneath the Earth's surface. This could include habitats for creatures that thrive in dark, damp conditions such as cave-dwelling animals. The design would incorporate natural light through skylights, providing a unique balance of darkness and natural light. Different zones within the habitat would represent various subterranean environments, like caves, rivers, and underground forests. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Oceanic Odyssey**: A vast underwater habitat that spans across multiple layers of the ocean, from shallow reefs to deep sea trenches. The design would include artificial coral reefs, shipwrecks, and even artificial kelp forests. Different zones would simulate various oceanic environments, including coral reefs, open ocean, and hydrothermal vents. Creatures could move freely between these zones, experiencing different environmental conditions. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Mega-Metropolis Mammals**: An urban habitat that combines elements of city life with natural environments. This habitat would feature skyscrapers that are built around vertical gardens and include parks, rooftops, and walkways that allow animals to navigate through the cityscape. Different species could coexist in this habitat, with some living in the high-rise buildings while others inhabit the parks and green spaces. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Time Traveling Temples**: A habitat that allows creatures to explore different eras in history or even alternate realities. This could be achieved through a series of interconnected tunnels or portals that lead to different historical periods or fantastical worlds. Each area would be meticulously designed to replicate the environment of its corresponding time or reality, complete with authentic flora, fauna, and architecture. Confidence Score: 0.7"
