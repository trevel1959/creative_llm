    "Smart Alarm: Develop an alarm system that uses facial recognition technology to identify the person entering the premises. Once the person is identified, the system can adjust the volume of the alarm based on their proximity, so the person's voice is heard only if they are within a certain distance. This would be particularly useful for businesses or homes with multiple occupants.",
    "Motion-Sensing Alarm: Create an alarm system that uses motion sensors to detect movement within a specific area. The system can be programmed to detect movement in a particular pattern, such as a burglar attempting to break in through a window or door. When the motion is detected, the alarm will sound, alerting the occupants of the premises.",
    "Environmental Alarm: Develop an alarm system that monitors the environment of the premises, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. If any of these factors fall outside of a predetermined range, the alarm will sound, alerting the occupants of the potential problem. For example, if the temperature drops below a certain point, the alarm can trigger a heating system to turn on, ensuring the premises remains safe and comfortable.",
    "Multi-Factor Alarm: Create an alarm system that uses a combination of different sensors, such as motion, temperature, and humidity, to detect potential threats. For example, if the motion sensor detects movement and the temperature sensor detects a drop in temperature, the alarm will sound, indicating a potential break-in.",
    "AI-Powered Alarm: Develop an alarm system that uses artificial intelligence to learn the habits and patterns of the occupants of the premises. The system can then use this information to identify potential threats and adjust the alarm settings accordingly. For example, if the system detects that an occupant is away from the premises during a certain time of day, it can adjust the alarm settings to reduce the likelihood of false alarms."
