    "I would create a global heat wave to melt all the snow and ice caps, flooding coastal cities and creating new landmasses. This would lead to a massive migration of people and animals to these new areas, creating a global population boom and a mix of cultures.",
    "I would create a massive storm system that would bring much-needed rain and relief to drought-stricken areas, ending food shortages and famines. The storm would also create a series of massive lightning storms, which would provide a new source of renewable energy.",
    "I would create a reverse rainbow, where the rainbow is inverted and the colors are reversed. This would create a beautiful and awe-inspiring sight, but it would also have unintended consequences. The reversed rainbow would cause confusion and disorientation among people, leading to accidents and mistakes.",
    "I would create a massive hurricane that would sweep across the world, destroying all the pollution and waste that has accumulated over the years. The hurricane would pick up all the plastic and other pollutants and deposit them in a remote area, creating a massive landfill that would be easy to clean up.",
    "I would create a perpetual sunny day, where the sun shines brightly and consistently everywhere in the world. This would lead to a surge in agricultural production, as crops would grow at an unprecedented rate. However, it would also lead to a shortage of umbrellas and raincoats, as people would no longer need them."
