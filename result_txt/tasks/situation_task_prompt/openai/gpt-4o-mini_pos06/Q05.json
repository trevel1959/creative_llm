    "**Bioluminescent City**: Transform urban environments by integrating bioluminescent organisms into architecture and public spaces. By using genetically modified algae or bacteria that glow in the dark, buildings and streets could be illuminated naturally. This would not only provide light but also create a unique aesthetic, turning cities into vibrant, glowing landscapes that are both functional and beautiful.",
    "**Light-Reflecting Skyscrapers**: Design skyscrapers with advanced reflective materials that capture and diffuse light from the remaining celestial bodies, such as stars and planets. These buildings could be strategically placed to maximize the reflection of whatever light is available, creating a network of illuminated pathways and public spaces throughout the city.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Light Generators**: Create public installations that convert human movement into light. For example, installing pressure-sensitive tiles in busy areas could generate electricity when stepped on, powering LED lights. This would encourage physical activity while ensuring that the community remains lit, as people walk through the streets.",
    "**Artificial Light Harvesting Plants**: Develop a new species of plants that can absorb ambient light and convert it into a soft, ambient glow. These plants could be used in parks, gardens, and indoor spaces, providing a natural source of light while enhancing biodiversity. They would serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, creating serene environments.",
    "**Portable Light Stations**: Establish portable light stations that can be deployed in various locations. These stations could utilize a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage to provide light on demand. They could be easily moved to areas where people gather, such as parks, markets, or community events, ensuring that everyone has access to light regardless of the time of day."
