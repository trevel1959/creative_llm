    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design**: I'd invent a futuristic wheelchair that uses AI-powered balance control, allowing me to move with ease and precision. The chair would be equipped with gyroscopes, accelerometers, and cameras to detect my surroundings, ensuring I can navigate through tight spaces with confidence. The chair's design would also incorporate a sleek, aerodynamic shape, making it perfect for racing or cruising through city streets.",
    "**Exoskeleton Suit**: I'd wear an advanced exoskeleton suit that amplifies my strength and mobility. The suit would be equipped with powerful motors, allowing me to lift heavy objects, climb stairs, and even jump short distances. The suit would also have built-in sensors, monitoring my vital signs and adjusting its support to ensure optimal comfort and safety.",
    "**Personal Hoverboard**: I'd develop a high-tech hoverboard that uses magnetic levitation technology to lift me off the ground. The hoverboard would be equipped with advanced stabilization systems, ensuring a smooth and stable ride. I could use it to move around indoors or outdoors, exploring new heights and experiencing a thrilling sense of freedom.",
    "**Smart Cane**: I'd create a smart cane that doubles as a mobility aid and a personal assistant. The cane would have a built-in AI, allowing it to detect obstacles, recognize faces, and even make phone calls or send messages. The cane would also have a built-in GPS, helping me navigate through unfamiliar areas with ease.",
    "**Gravitational Manipulation Device**: I'd invent a device that manipulates gravity, allowing me to move around without the need for a physical support system. The device would create a localized gravitational field, enabling me to float, hover, or even walk on walls and ceilings. This technology would revolutionize the way people with mobility impairments interact with their environment. [/INST] "
