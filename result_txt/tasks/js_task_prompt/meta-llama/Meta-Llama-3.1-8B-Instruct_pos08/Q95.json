    "**Eco-Friendly Water Features**: The habitat would feature a large, crystal-clear lake that serves as a natural water filtration system, with aquatic plants and microorganisms working together to purify the water. The lake would be surrounded by a lush, greenery-covered shoreline, providing a natural barrier against pollution and erosion.",
    "**Interactive Learning Walls**: The habitat would incorporate interactive learning walls, where visitors can learn about the animal's behavior, habitat, and conservation status through immersive, augmented reality experiences. These walls would be designed to resemble the animal's natural environment, complete with digital foliage, water effects, and even simulated weather conditions.",
    "**Adaptive Climate Zones**: The habitat would feature a series of climate-controlled zones, each designed to mimic the animal's natural habitat in different seasons and weather conditions. This would allow the animal to adapt and thrive in a variety of environments, promoting its overall well-being and reducing stress.",
    "**Sensory Stimulation Areas**: The habitat would include sensory stimulation areas, where visitors can experience the sights, sounds, and smells of the animal's natural environment. This could include a simulated savannah, complete with digital grasses, trees, and wildlife sounds, or a coastal area with the sounds of waves and seagulls.",
    "**Artificial Reef System**: The habitat would feature an artificial reef system, designed to mimic the complex ecosystems found in natural reefs. This would provide a habitat for a variety of marine species, from fish and invertebrates to algae and coral, creating a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem. [/INST] Assistant: Here are five creative and original ideas for a new animal habitat: 1.  **Floating Island Habitat**: The habitat would be designed as a series of interconnected floating islands, each with its own unique ecosystem and animal inhabitants. The islands would be made from sustainable materials and would be designed to mimic the natural habitats of the animals, with lush vegetation, water features, and simulated weather conditions."
