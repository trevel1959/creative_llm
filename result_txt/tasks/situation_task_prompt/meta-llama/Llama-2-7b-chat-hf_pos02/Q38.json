    "Create a water-based cleaning solution: With the absence of soap and cleaning products, a water-based solution could be created using a mixture of water and essential oils. This solution can be used for cleaning surfaces, washing hands, and maintaining personal hygiene. The essential oils can provide antimicrobial properties, ensuring that the solution is effective in killing germs and bacteria.",

Aloe vera can also be used to soothe and moisturize the skin, making it a suitable alternative to soap.",
    "Develop a solar-powered cleaning device: In the absence of traditional cleaning products, a solar-powered cleaning device could be created that uses the sun's energy to generate cleaning solution. This device could use a combination of water, sunlight, and a small amount of electricity to create a cleaning solution that can be used for cleaning surfaces and personal hygiene.",
    "Use sound waves to clean: Sound waves can be used to create a cleaning solution that can be used to clean surfaces. By using a device that generates sound waves, the sound waves can be directed at surfaces to create a cleaning solution that can be used to remove dirt and grime. This method can be especially effective for cleaning hard-to-reach areas, such as corners and crevices.",
    "Create a natural cleaning powder: A natural cleaning powder can be created using a mixture of natural ingredients such as baking soda, cornstarch, and essential oils. This powder can be used to clean surfaces and can be used as a substitute for traditional cleaning products. The natural ingredients in the powder can provide antimicrobial properties, ensuring that the powder is effective in killing germs and bacteria."
