It's crucial to familiarize yourself with federal, state, and local regulations regarding brewing, distribution, and sales. Hiring a consultant who specializes in brewery regulations can streamline this process, ensuring that all permits and licenses are obtained before launching. Additionally, setting up a compliance calendar can help keep track of renewal dates and inspections.",
