You can use a variety of materials for the trellis or planter, such as wood, metal, or even recycled materials like old pallets.",
    "Utilize raised beds: Another option is to create raised beds using wooden or plastic frames. These beds can be filled with a mixture of soil and compost, allowing you to plant your garden without having to dig into the hard ground. Raised beds also help to improve drainage and soil quality, making it easier to grow a variety of plants.",
    "Grow hydroponically: If the ground is too hard to dig into, you can still grow plants using a hydroponic system.

    "Use geodesic domes: Geodesic domes are a unique and creative way to grow a garden without digging into the ground. These domes are made up of a series of interconnected triangles, which provide a stable and aerated structure for plants to grow in. Geodesic domes can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, or even recycled materials like old tires. They can be used to grow a variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs."
