    "**Biometric identification**: Biometric identification involves using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, iris scans, or voice patterns, to identify individuals. In the absence of physical identification, biometric identification could be used to prove one's identity. For example, a person could provide a fingerprint scan or a voice sample, which would be matched against a secure database to verify their identity.",
    "**Behavioral analysis**: Behavioral analysis involves studying a person's patterns of behavior to identify them. This could include analyzing their gait, writing style, or other unique habits. In a world without physical identification, behavioral analysis could be used to verify a person's identity. For example, a person could be asked to perform a specific task, such as writing a sentence, and the resulting text could be analyzed to confirm their identity.",
    "**DNA identification**: DNA identification involves using a person's unique genetic makeup to identify them. In the absence of physical identification, DNA identification could be used to prove one's identity. For example, a person could provide a DNA sample, which would be compared against a secure database to confirm their identity.",
    "**Cryptographic methods**: Cryptographic methods, such as public-key cryptography, could be used to prove a person's identity. This would involve creating a digital signature or a cryptographic key pair, which could be used to verify a person's identity. For example, a person could provide a digital signature or a cryptographic key pair, which would be verified against a secure database to confirm their identity.",
    "**Blockchain-based identity verification**: Blockchain technology could be used to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for identity verification. In this system, a person's identity would be stored on a blockchain, which would be publicly accessible and verifiable. For example, a person could provide their blockchain ID, which would be verified against the blockchain to confirm their identity."
