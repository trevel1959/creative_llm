    "Once, in a bustling town, an invisible elephant roamed freely. No one could see it, but everyone felt its presence. It would sit on benches, causing them to creak, and tip over trash cans, scattering refuse everywhere. People whispered about the strange happenings, attributing them to mischief or ghosts. Little Lucy, however, sensed the elephant’s loneliness. One day, she brought a bouquet of flowers to the park and sat beside the empty bench. “I see you,” she whispered. Suddenly, the air shimmered, and for a brief moment, the elephant appeared, grateful for her kindness. From that day on, they became inseparable friends.",
