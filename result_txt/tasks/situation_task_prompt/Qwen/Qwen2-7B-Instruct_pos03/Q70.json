    "**Digital Life Log**: Create a digital life log where every activity is recorded with specific timestamps. This could be done using an app on a smartphone or a dedicated computer program. Each task, from waking up to going to bed, would have its own designated time slot, helping maintain a structured day.",
    "**Magnetic Board Clock**: Utilize a large magnetic board and magnetic markers to create a visual clock. Each hour of the day can be represented by a different color marker. As the day progresses, move the markers along a line drawn across the board to keep track of time.",
    "**Sound-Based Clocks**: Use sound-based alarms and timers that play different melodies or sounds at specific intervals throughout the day. For example, a soft chime for waking up, a gentle bell for lunchtime, and a more upbeat tune for when it's time to wind down.",
    "**Shadow Clocks**: If you're in a place where natural light is available, shadow clocks can be used. Place a stick or a similar object vertically on a wall, and observe how the shadow moves as the sun changes position. This method can help approximate the time of day.",
    "**Tactile Time Pieces**: Develop a series of tactile time pieces that emit different textures or vibrations at regular intervals. These could be wearable items like bracelets or necklaces that subtly alert the wearer to the passage of time. Each hour or half-hour could have a unique texture or vibration pattern."
