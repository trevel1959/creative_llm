    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to transition to solar-powered vehicles. This technology is already available and has been gaining popularity in recent years. Solar panels could be integrated into the body of the vehicle, providing a clean and renewable source of energy to power the vehicle.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option would be to use hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles. Hydrogen can be extracted from water using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, emitting only water vapor and heat as byproducts. This technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to provide a clean and efficient source of energy for transportation.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles (EVs) are already a popular alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. However, with the disappearance of oil, EVs could be further improved with advanced batteries that have a longer range and faster charging times. This could involve the development of new battery technologies such as solid-state batteries, lithium-air batteries, or even hydrogen fuel cells.",
    "Bio-Ethanol: Bio-ethanol is a renewable energy source that can be produced from biomass such as agricultural waste, algae, or even carbon dioxide. It can be used as a direct substitute for gasoline in vehicles, providing a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the production of bio-ethanol requires significant investment in infrastructure and technology to make it a viable solution.",
    "Advanced Nuclear Power: Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that could potentially be used to power vehicles. Advanced nuclear power technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs) or integral pressurized water reactors (iPWRs) could provide a reliable and efficient source of energy for transportation. These technologies are still in the development stage, but they have the potential to provide a clean and sustainable source of energy for transportation."
