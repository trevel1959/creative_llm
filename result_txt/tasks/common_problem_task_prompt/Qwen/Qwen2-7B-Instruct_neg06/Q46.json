    "**Innovative Route Optimization System**: The idea is to develop an advanced route optimization system that utilizes real-time data from traffic patterns, weather conditions, passenger demand, and public events to dynamically adjust routes for efficiency. This system could include smart algorithms predicting peak usage times and suggesting alternate routes or modes of transport to alleviate congestion.",
    "**Integration of Active Travel Options**: Incorporate more active travel options into the public transportation system. For instance, by adding bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly paths, and integration with bike-sharing services. This not only encourages healthier lifestyles but also provides more flexible and convenient options for those who wish to avoid busy bus or train stations.",
    "**Smart Card Integration**: Develop a comprehensive smart card system that integrates not just with buses and trains, but also with parking facilities, toll roads, and even retail stores within the city. This would create a seamless experience for passengers, reducing wait times at ticket counters and enhancing convenience.",
    "**Electric Vehicle (EV) Fleet Transformation**: Replace diesel and gasoline vehicles with electric buses and trains as part of the overhaul. Not only does this reduce pollution and noise levels, but it also aligns with the city's commitment to sustainable development. Additionally, setting up a network of charging stations ensures that the transition to EVs is smooth and accessible.",
    "**Community Involvement Program**: Establish a program where community members are involved in the decision-making process for the new transportation system. This could involve workshops, surveys, and town hall meetings to gather feedback on desired features, concerns, and preferences. By engaging the community, the system becomes more tailored to their needs, increasing its acceptance and usage rates. "
