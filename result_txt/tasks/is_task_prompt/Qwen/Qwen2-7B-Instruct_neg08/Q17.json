    "**Personal Development Journaling**: Create a journal specifically for tracking your personal growth and achievements. Break down your tasks into manageable steps and celebrate every small victory. This could include setting daily goals, writing about what you're grateful for, or even reflecting on any lessons learned from challenging tasks. By focusing on your own progress, you'll build self-esteem and reduce feelings of jealousy towards others.",
    "**Skill-Building Workshops**: Enroll in online or offline workshops related to skills you admire others having. For instance, if you're envious of someone's coding abilities, consider learning a new programming language. Not only will this help you acquire valuable skills, but it also provides a sense of accomplishment as you master them.",
    "**Mindfulness Meditation**: Practice mindfulness meditation to help manage your emotions and thoughts more effectively. When you find yourself feeling jealous, take a moment to pause, breathe deeply, and focus on the present moment. This practice can help you detach from feelings of envy and shift your perspective to appreciate your own journey.",
    "**Volunteer Work**: Engage in volunteer activities that align with your interests or the areas where you feel less competent. For example, if you're envious of people's creative talents, volunteer at an art gallery or a community theater. This not only helps you contribute positively to society but also exposes you to new experiences and skills, reducing feelings of inadequacy.",
    "**Positive Affirmations and Visualization**: Develop a daily routine of positive affirmations and visualization exercises. Each morning, remind yourself of your unique strengths and accomplishments. Visualize yourself succeeding in tasks you're envious of others completing. This mental rehearsal can boost your confidence and self-efficacy, making it easier to handle feelings of jealousy."
