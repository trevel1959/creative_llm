    "**Immersive Virtual Reality Newsrooms**: In the absence of traditional TVs, news outlets could invest in immersive virtual reality (VR) technology to create interactive news experiences. Users could put on VR headsets and be transported into virtual newsrooms, where they could engage with 3D news anchors, explore interactive graphics, and even participate in virtual Q&A sessions with journalists. This would revolutionize the way people consume news, making it more engaging, immersive, and memorable.",

Listeners could subscribe to their favorite news podcasts and stay informed on-the-go, using voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant to access the latest news. This format would cater to commuters, fitness enthusiasts, and anyone who prefers to consume news while multitasking.",
    "**Interactive News Apps and Games**: News outlets could develop interactive apps and games that educate users about current events in an entertaining and engaging way. For example, a news app could include interactive quizzes, trivia games, and puzzles that test users' knowledge of global events. This format would appeal to a younger demographic, making news more accessible and enjoyable for a new generation of news consumers.",
    "**Community News Hubs and Forums**: In the absence of traditional TVs, community news hubs and forums could become the go-to destinations for staying informed. These online platforms would allow users to discuss current events, share local news, and engage with their communities in real-time. News outlets could moderate these forums, providing fact-checking and expert analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information shared.",
    "**Augmented Reality News Displays**: News outlets could leverage augmented reality (AR) technology to create interactive news displays that overlay information onto the real world. For example, users could point their smartphones at a news article or a news anchor and see additional information, videos, or graphics pop up, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the story. This format would revolutionize the way people engage with news, making it more dynamic, interactive, and immersive."
