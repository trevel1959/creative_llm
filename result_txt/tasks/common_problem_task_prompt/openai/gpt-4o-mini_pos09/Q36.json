    "**Initial Cost Barriers**: While solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be a significant barrier for many homeowners. Even with incentives and subsidies, the upfront costs might deter participation. This could lead to disparities in adoption rates, where only wealthier households benefit from the installation.",
    "**Aesthetic Concerns**: Some homeowners may object to the appearance of solar panels on their roofs, believing they detract from the architectural integrity of their homes. This could lead to community pushback, requiring a campaign to educate residents on the benefits of solar energy and potentially designing more aesthetically pleasing panel options.",
    "**Interconnection and Grid Capacity Issues**: Integrating a large number of solar panels into the existing electrical grid can create challenges. The grid may not have the capacity to handle the influx of energy, leading to potential overloads or outages. Upgrading the grid infrastructure would be necessary, which could involve significant investment and time.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require maintenance and occasional repairs. Homeowners may not be aware of the ongoing responsibilities associated with ownership, leading to neglected systems that underperform. Establishing a clear maintenance plan and providing education on care for the panels would be essential to ensure longevity and efficiency.",
    "**Regulatory and Zoning Issues**: Local regulations and zoning laws may complicate the installation process. Some areas may have restrictions on the type of structures that can be built or modified, which could impede the installation of solar panels. Navigating these regulations would require collaboration with local governments and possibly revising existing laws."
