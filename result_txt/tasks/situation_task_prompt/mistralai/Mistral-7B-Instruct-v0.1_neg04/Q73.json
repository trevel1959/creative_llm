    "Invent a new type of shade structure that could be used in the absence of trees. This could be a retractable canopy or a large umbrella that could be set up in various locations.",
    "Utilize other natural sources of shade, such as large rocks or overhangs on buildings, to provide shade during the day.",
    "Develop a portable shade device that can be carried around and used in different locations. This could be a small, foldable tent or a lightweight tarp that can be set up quickly and easily.",
    "Create a network of shade-producing structures, such as pergolas or trellises, that can be placed in strategic locations to provide shade during the day.",
    "Use reflective materials, such as mirrors or white paint, to reflect sunlight away from the ground and create a cooler environment. This could be applied to buildings, walls, or other surfaces to help reduce the amount of direct sunlight that hits the ground."
