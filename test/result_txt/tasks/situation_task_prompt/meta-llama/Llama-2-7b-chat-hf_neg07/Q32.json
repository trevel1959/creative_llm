    "DIY Dental Solutions: With no more dentists, people could resort to DIY dental solutions to maintain their oral health. This could involve using homemade toothpaste and mouthwash recipes, such as blending baking soda, coconut oil, and essential oils for a natural cleaning agent. They could also try using a waterpik or a homemade interdental brush to clean between teeth.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: To address the lack of dentists, communities could come together to form dental co-ops. Members of the co-op could pool their resources to purchase dental equipment and supplies, and share the cost of dental care among themselves. This would allow people to receive dental care at a lower cost and with greater convenience.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: To reach people who may not have access to dental care, mobile dental clinics could be set up in rural or underserved areas. These clinics could be equipped with portable dental equipment and staffed by volunteer dentists or dental hygienists. Patients could receive basic dental care on-site, reducing the need for travel to a fixed dental clinic.",
    "Online Dental Consultations: With the rise of telemedicine, online dental consultations could become more common. Patients could use video conferencing platforms to consult with dentists remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits. This could be particularly useful for people living in remote areas or those with mobility issues.",
    "DIY Dental Implants: In the absence of dentists, people could explore DIY dental implant options. This could involve using 3D printing technology to create custom dental implants that are tailored to the patient's mouth. The patient could then use these implants to replace missing teeth, eliminating the need for dentures or bridges."
