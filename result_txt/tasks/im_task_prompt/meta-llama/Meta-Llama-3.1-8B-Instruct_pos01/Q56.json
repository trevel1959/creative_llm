    "**Whispering Wires**: A bicycle bell that uses a network of thin, flexible wires to transmit a gentle, soothing sound to the rider's ears. The wires are embedded in the bell's handlebar grip, and when the rider rings the bell, the wires vibrate to produce a soft, whispery tone. This design combines the traditional sound of a bicycle bell with a modern, high-tech twist. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Mood Ring Bell**: A bicycle bell that changes its sound in response to the rider's mood. Using a wearable device that tracks the rider's emotions, the bell adapts its pitch, tone, and volume to match the rider's current emotional state. For example, if the rider is feeling anxious, the bell might produce a soothing, calming sound. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Environmental Echo**: A bicycle bell that incorporates a built-in microphone and speaker to create an immersive, 3D sound experience. When the rider rings the bell, the microphone picks up the sound and sends it to the speaker, which then bounces the sound back to the rider's ears, creating an echo effect. This design adds a new dimension to the traditional bicycle bell sound. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Resonance Rider**: A bicycle bell that uses the rider's body to amplify and modify the sound. The bell is designed to vibrate in harmony with the rider's voice, allowing them to create unique, resonant tones by humming or singing into the bell. This design encourages riders to experiment with sound and creativity. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Augmented Audio**: A bicycle bell that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to overlay sounds and effects onto the traditional bell sound. Using a smartphone app, riders can choose from a variety of sounds, such as animal calls, musical notes, or even sound effects from their favorite video games. This design opens up new possibilities for creative expression and community engagement.
