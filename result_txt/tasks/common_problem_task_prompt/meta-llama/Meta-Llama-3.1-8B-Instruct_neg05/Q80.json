Guests are encouraged to bring their reusable water bottles and are provided with eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics. To further minimize waste, the couple chooses a \"BYOB\" (bring your own bottle) policy for the bar, and serves plant-based, locally sourced food.",

    "**Sustainable Favors**: Instead of traditional wedding favors, the couple decides to give their guests a small potted plant or a packet of wildflower seeds to take home.
