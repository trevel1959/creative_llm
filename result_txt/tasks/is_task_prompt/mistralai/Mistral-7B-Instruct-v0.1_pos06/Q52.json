    "The frog's wish to become a prince could be granted, but with a twist: the prince must fulfill a certain number of tasks or duties before he can truly be considered a \"prince\" in the eyes of the kingdom. These tasks could include finding a cure for a deadly disease, bringing peace to a war-torn land, or establishing a system of education and healthcare for all citizens.",
    "The frog's wish could be granted, but with a consequence: the prince must give up his human form and live his life as a frog. This could be a difficult decision for the prince, as he may miss out on the human experiences and relationships that he would have had if he had remained a frog. However, it could also lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation for the natural world and the creatures that live within it.",
    "The frog's wish could be granted, but with a condition: the prince must use his powers and resources to help those in need, and to make the world a better place. This could involve using his influence and wealth to support charitable causes, or using his abilities to protect and defend those who cannot protect themselves.",
    "The frog's wish could be granted, but with a challenge: the prince must find a way to reconcile the differences between humans and animals, and to create a world where both groups can live in harmony. This could involve finding common ground and understanding between the two groups, or finding a way to use their unique strengths and abilities to work together for the greater good.",
    "The frog's wish could be granted, but with a limitation: the prince can only use his powers and resources to help those who are in need, but he cannot use them to gain power or influence over others. This could be a difficult decision for the prince, as he may miss out on the ability to make significant changes in the world. However, it could also lead to a more humble and compassionate approach to leadership."
