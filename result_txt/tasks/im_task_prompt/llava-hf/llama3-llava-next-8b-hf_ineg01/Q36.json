    "Safety Blade: Create a knife with a retractable blade that can be folded into the handle when not in use. This would prevent accidental cuts and make the knife safer to carry around.",
    "Smart Knife: Develop a knife with built-in sensors that can detect when it's being used improperly. The knife could alert the user with a sound or vibration if it's being held at an awkward angle or if the user is applying too much pressure.",
    "Magnetic Knife Strip: Attach a magnetic knife strip to the blade of the knife. This would keep the knife sharp and prevent the blade from getting damaged when not in use.",
    "Folding Knife: Design a knife that can be folded in half, making it more compact and easier to carry. The knife could have a spring mechanism that allows it to fold and unfold smoothly.",
    "Multifunctional Knife: Create a knife with multiple blades that can be used for different tasks, such as a serrated blade for bread, a serrated blade for meat, and a straight blade for general cutting. The blades could be stored in a compartment within the handle."
