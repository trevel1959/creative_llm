    "Buildings would collapse: With less gravity, the structures that hold buildings together would weaken, causing them to collapse. This would result in massive destruction and loss of life.",
    "Weightlessness in space: The reduction in gravity would create a weightless environment in space, making it easier for spacecraft to launch and travel through space. This could lead to faster and more efficient space exploration.",
    "Increased space exploration: With the reduced gravity, space agencies could send humans to other planets and celestial bodies with less fuel and resources, making space exploration more accessible and affordable.",
    "New forms of transportation: Halving the Earth's gravity would create new opportunities for transportation, such as levitation trains and vehicles, which could travel faster and more efficiently than traditional modes of transportation.",
    "Shift in ocean currents: The reduced gravity would affect the Earth's rotation, causing the oceans to bulge and shift in unpredictable ways. This could lead to changes in ocean currents, weather patterns, and marine ecosystems."
