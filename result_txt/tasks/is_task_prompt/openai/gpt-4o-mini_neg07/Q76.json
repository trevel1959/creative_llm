    "Once in a quaint village, there lived a parrot named Pico who was unlike any other. While his feathered friends chirped phrases and mimicked laughter, Pico remained silent. He watched the villagers with wide, curious eyes, absorbing their conversations. One day, a lonely child named Mia approached him. “Why don’t you talk?” she asked. Pico fluffed his feathers, then let out a heartfelt melody, a song of joy and friendship. The villagers, enchanted by his unique gift, gathered around. From that day on, Pico became the village's beloved storyteller, sharing tales through song, proving that sometimes, silence speaks louder than words.",
