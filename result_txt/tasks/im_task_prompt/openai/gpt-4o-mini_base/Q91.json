    "**QR Code with Emergency Contact Information**: Design a luggage tag that includes a scannable QR code. When scanned, the code can provide emergency contact information, travel itinerary, and special instructions for handling the luggage (e.g., fragile items). This would be especially useful for international travelers who may not speak the local language, ensuring that their luggage is handled properly in case of emergencies.",
    "**Personalized Voice Recording Feature**: Introduce a luggage tag that allows users to record a short voice message that can be played back when the tag is scanned. This could include a friendly reminder, a special message for the traveler, or even instructions for the person who finds the luggage. It adds a personal touch and can help in reuniting lost luggage with its owner.",
    "**Color-Changing Technology**: Utilize thermochromic or photochromic materials in the luggage tag design, allowing the tag to change color based on temperature or light exposure. This feature could help travelers easily identify their luggage in crowded airports or baggage claim areas. For instance, a tag that changes color in sunlight could stand out more vividly against other bags.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**: Shift towards sustainable materials for luggage tags, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious travelers and reduce the ecological footprint of travel accessories. Additionally, tags could be designed to break down safely after a certain period if not claimed, ensuring minimal environmental impact.",
    "**Built-in Miniature Scale**: Incorporate a small, digital scale into the luggage tag that allows travelers to weigh their bags before checking in. This feature would help avoid overweight baggage fees and ensure compliance with airline regulations. The scale could display the weight on a small screen, and it could sync with a mobile app to track the weight of multiple bags."
