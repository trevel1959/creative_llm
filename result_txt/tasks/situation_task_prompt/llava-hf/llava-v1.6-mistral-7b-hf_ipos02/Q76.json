    "**Carrier Pigeons:** Another option could be using carrier pigeons to send messages long distance. Pigeons have been used for centuries for long-distance communication, and they can carry small messages with them. They can be trained to fly to specific locations, and their natural instincts will guide them back home.",
    "**Horseback Messengers:** In the pre-digital era, horseback messengers were a common way to send messages long distance. A person could ride a horse to the destination and deliver the message by hand. This method would be slower than modern communication methods but would still be effective for short to medium distances.",
    "**Semaphore Systems:** Semaphore systems use a series of flags or signs to communicate messages. Two or more people could use a system of flags or signs to communicate messages over long distances. Semaphore systems were used in the past before the advent of telegraphy and can still be used today for long-distance communication.",
    "**Radio Broadcasting:** In the absence of phones, radio broadcasting could be used to communicate long distance. Radio waves can travel long distances, and a person could use a simple radio transmitter to send messages. This method would be slower than modern communication methods but would still be effective for short to medium distances.",
    "**Homing Pigeons:** Another option could be using homing pigeons to send messages long distance. These birds have an innate ability to navigate and can be trained to fly to specific locations. They can carry small messages with them and can be released to fly back home."
