    "Eco-Friendly Stapler: Design a stapler made from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles or old electronics. This not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainability. Additionally, incorporate a built-in recycling bin within the stapler to collect used staples, making it easier for users to dispose of them properly.",
    "Voice-Activated Stapler: Create a voice-controlled stapler that allows users to operate it hands-free. By using voice commands, people can easily staple documents without having to physically touch the stapler. This is particularly useful for individuals with mobility issues or those who want to minimize contact during the pandemic.",
    "Self-Standing Stapler: Design a stapler that stands on its own, eliminating the need for a separate desk accessory or holder. This compact design saves space and keeps the stapler readily accessible. The self-standing feature could also include a small tray for storing staples or other office supplies.",
    "Wireless Charging Station Stapler: Integrate a wireless charging pad into the stapler, allowing users to charge their smartphones or other compatible devices while using the stapler. This convenient feature would encourage people to use the stapler more often and make it an essential part of their daily routine.",
    "Multi-functional Stapler: Combine the stapler with other common office tools, such as a paper cutter, hole punch, or label maker. This all-in-one device would save space on desks and reduce the need for multiple gadgets. Users could quickly and efficiently complete various tasks without switching between different tools."
