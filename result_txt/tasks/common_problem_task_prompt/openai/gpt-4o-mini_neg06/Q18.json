    "**Limited Communication**: The absence of electricity can hinder access to communication devices like smartphones, computers, and the internet. This could lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the outside world. To mitigate this, communities could establish designated \"communication hubs\" where individuals can gather to share news, use communal phones, or access printed information about local events and services.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many households rely on electric pumps for their water supply. Without electricity, access to clean water could become problematic. To tackle this, residents could create a system for rainwater harvesting, utilizing barrels and filtration systems to collect and purify rainwater. Additionally, communities might organize water delivery services or establish shared wells, ensuring everyone has access to this essential resource.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: The lack of electricity can lead to darkness at night, increasing the risk of accidents and crime. Without streetlights or functioning security systems, individuals may feel unsafe. Solutions could include organizing neighborhood watch programs, where residents take turns patrolling their areas. Furthermore, communities could come together to create a system of shared solar-powered lights to illuminate key areas, enhancing safety for everyone.",
    "**Limited Access to Information and Education**: Schools and libraries often rely on electricity for teaching tools and resources. The absence of these facilities could disrupt education for children and adults alike. In response, communities might establish outdoor learning spaces where teachers can conduct classes using natural light and portable teaching aids. Additionally, book swaps and reading circles could be organized to promote literacy and knowledge sharing among residents.",
    "**Health Care Access**: Medical facilities often depend on electricity for equipment and refrigeration of medications. Without it, accessing healthcare becomes challenging. To address this, mobile health clinics could be set up, utilizing solar-powered technology to provide basic medical services and health education. Community health workers could also be trained to offer first aid and preventive care, ensuring that residents have access to essential health resources."
