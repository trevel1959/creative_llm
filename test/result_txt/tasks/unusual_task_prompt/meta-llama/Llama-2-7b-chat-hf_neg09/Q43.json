    "A bicycle that transforms into a robot: The bicycle of the future is not just a means of transportation but a versatile robot that can transform into different forms to suit various needs. With the touch of a button, the bicycle's wheels fold in, and its frame transforms into a humanoid robot. Equipped with advanced sensors and AI, the robot can navigate through crowded city streets, avoid obstacles, and even perform tasks such as delivering packages or providing assistance in emergency situations.",
    "A bicycle that generates electricity: This bicycle is designed to harness the power of pedaling to generate electricity, which can then be used to charge electronic devices on the go. The bicycle's frame is equipped with solar panels and a battery, allowing riders to store excess energy generated during the day for use at night or on long trips. Additionally, the bicycle's pedals are designed with a special mechanism that converts the up-and-down motion of pedaling into rotational energy, further increasing the efficiency of the energy-generating process.",
    "A bicycle that cleans the air: This innovative bicycle is designed with a built-in air purifier that captures pollutants and allergens from the air, providing a clean and healthy environment for riders. The air purifier is powered by a small electric motor that is fueled by the bicycle's pedaling motion. As riders pedal, the motor generates electricity to power the air purifier, which can be adjusted to suit different air quality levels and riders' preferences.",
    "A bicycle that communicates with other cyclists: This bicycle is equipped with a built-in communication system that allows riders to connect with other cyclists in real-time. The system uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi technology to create a network of cyclists who can share information such as road conditions, traffic patterns, and even social messages. Riders can also use the system to locate nearby cyclists and plan group rides or social events.",
    "A bicycle that grows with the rider: This bicycle is designed to adapt to the rider's growth and changing needs. The frame is made of a special material"
