    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Hydrogen fuel cells could be used to power vehicles, as they produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Hydrogen can be produced through various methods, including water electrolysis, and it could be used to power a wide range of vehicles, from cars to buses and even trucks.",
    "**Biofuels**: Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, could become more prevalent if oil disappeared. These fuels are made from renewable resources like corn, sugarcane, or algae, and they can be used to power vehicles that are modified to run on them.",
    "**Hybrid Vehicles**: Hybrid vehicles, which combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor, could become more common as oil becomes scarce. These vehicles can switch between gasoline and electricity, depending on the situation, and they would be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional gas-powered vehicles.",
    "**Public Transportation**: If oil disappeared, public transportation systems would become more critical for moving people and goods. Cities would need to invest in expanding and improving their public transit networks, including buses, trains, and trams. This would help reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, thereby reducing emissions and traffic congestion.",
    "**Pedestrian and Cycling Infrastructure**: Encouraging more people to walk or cycle would be an effective way to reduce reliance on oil-powered vehicles. Cities could invest in pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, such as bike lanes, pedestrian bridges, and pedestrian-only zones, to make walking and cycling safer and more attractive alternatives to driving."
