    "Foldable and Adjustable Coat Hanger: Create a coat hanger with a unique design that allows it to fold and adjust in size. This could be achieved through the use of flexible materials such as bendable plastic or metal. The user can adjust the length and width of the coat hanger to accommodate different types of coats and hang them in a more organized manner.",
    "Smart Coat Hanger with Built-in Storage: Design a coat hanger with built-in storage compartments to hold small items like keys, wallets, and phones. The compartments could be designed to be easily accessible, allowing users to quickly grab their essentials without having to dig through their pockets or a purse.",
    "Magnetic Coat Hanger: Create a coat hanger with strong magnets embedded in the hooks, allowing users to hang their coats without damaging the wall. This would be particularly useful for renters who are not allowed to put nails or hooks in the wall. The magnets could also be adjustable, allowing users to customize the strength of the hold.",
    "Adjustable Coat Hanger with Weight Sensors: Design a coat hanger with sensors that detect the weight of the coat and adjust the hook accordingly. This would ensure that the coat is hung at the perfect angle and does not slip off the hook. The sensors could also be used to detect the type of fabric and adjust the hook accordingly, to prevent damage to delicate fabrics.",
    "Coat Hanger with Built-in LED Light: Create a coat hanger with built-in LED lights that illuminate the coat rack, making it easier to find the coat in the dark. The lights could also be used to display fashion statements or to create a unique ambiance in the room. The coat hanger could be designed with a detachable base, allowing users to place it on a table or shelf when not in use."
