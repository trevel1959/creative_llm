    "**Adaptive Technology Integration**: People with poor vision would rely heavily on advanced technologies to enhance their daily lives. For instance, wearable devices like smart glasses with built-in displays, voice assistants, and AI-powered navigation systems would become ubiquitous. These devices would use computer vision, object recognition, and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time assistance, allowing individuals to navigate their surroundings, recognize faces, and read text with ease.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Revolution**: Haptic feedback technology would become the primary means of communication for people with poor vision. Specialized gloves, vests, or even implants would provide tactile feedback, allowing individuals to \"feel\" their surroundings, detect obstacles, and even recognize shapes and textures. This technology would enable people to build mental maps of their environment, improving their navigation skills and independence.",
    "**Acoustic Navigation Systems**: Acoustic navigation systems would become a vital tool for people with poor vision. By using sound waves to detect obstacles, these systems would provide real-time audio feedback, helping individuals to navigate through spaces with confidence. This technology would be especially useful in environments with limited visual cues, such as dark rooms or areas with poor lighting.",
    "**Tactile Mapping and 3D Printing**: Tactile mapping and 3D printing would become essential skills for people with poor vision. By creating detailed, three-dimensional models of their surroundings, individuals could build mental maps of their environment, allowing them to navigate with greater ease. This technology would also enable the creation of custom, personalized objects, such as tactile labels and Braille signage.",
    "**Canine Companions and Assistive Animals**: Trained animals, such as dogs and cats, would become essential companions for people with poor vision. These animals would be trained to assist with daily tasks, provide navigation support, and even detect hazards. The bond between the individual and their assistive animal would become a vital aspect of their daily lives, promoting independence and confidence. [/INST] <s>[INST] "
