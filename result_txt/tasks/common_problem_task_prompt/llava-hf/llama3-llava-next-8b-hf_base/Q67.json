    "Market access: Organic farming is subject to strict standards and regulations. Farmers must ensure their produce meets these standards, from cultivation to packaging and transportation, to sell it in organic markets. This can be difficult and costly, impacting the pricing of organic products.",
    "Pest and disease management: Organic farming relies on natural methods to control insects, weeds, and diseases, requiring a deeper understanding of agricultural practices and the environment. This may be more time-consuming and labor-intensive than using synthetic pesticides or herbicides.",
    "Soil health and fertility: Organic farming relies on composting and crop rotation to maintain soil health and fertility. However, these methods may not provide sufficient nutrients for all crops, and maintaining soil fertility can be challenging, with the need for additional inputs such as manure or compost.",
    "Environmental factors: Weather, climate, and other environmental factors can impact the success of an organic farm. Unpredictable weather patterns or droughts can lead to crop loss, limiting the farmer's ability to generate income.",
    "Labor and cost: Organic farming typically requires more labor, especially in the case of intensive crops like vegetables. The cost of organic farming may also be higher, considering the need for organic inputs, and the cost of maintaining and renovating the natural landscape."
