    "**Creative Event Umbrella Design**: Design an innovative umbrella that can be used for promotional events. The umbrella could have a digital screen on one side that displays advertisements or messages related to the event. It could also be designed with LED lights for night events, enhancing visibility and creating a unique visual experience. The design should be sleek and stylish, with features like auto-tilt and auto-retraction for convenience.",
    "**Umbrella-based Fitness App**: Develop a mobile app that integrates with wearable fitness trackers and smartwatches. This app could use GPS data from the user's location to suggest optimal routes for running or walking under umbrellas during rainy weather. It could include features like weather forecasts, route planning, and integration with popular music streaming services to enhance the user's experience while exercising.",
    "**Smart Umbrella for Cyclists**: Create a smart umbrella specifically designed for cyclists, equipped with features such as a built-in rearview mirror, LED indicators for signaling intentions, and possibly even a small fan to provide wind resistance reduction. The umbrella could also integrate with bike computers to monitor speed and distance, offering real-time feedback to cyclists.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Umbrella**: Design an umbrella that doubles as a portable storytelling device. Equipped with speakers, microphones, and a touch screen, it can read stories aloud based on the user's preferences. The umbrella could also incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to interact with the story elements through their smartphones or tablets, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.",
    "**Eco-friendly Umbrella Recycling Program**: Launch a campaign that encourages the public to recycle old umbrellas by exchanging them for new ones at participating retailers. The recycled umbrellas could then be repurposed into materials for other products, such as clothing, bags, or even new umbrellas. This initiative would not only promote environmental responsibility but also raise awareness about the importance of sustainability in daily life."
