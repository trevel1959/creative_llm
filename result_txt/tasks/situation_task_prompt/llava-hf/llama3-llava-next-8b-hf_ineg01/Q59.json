    "Energy Storage Systems: Implementing energy storage systems, such as batteries, would allow for the storage of excess energy generated during sunny days for use on cloudy days. This would ensure a continuous supply of energy even when sunlight is not available.",
    "Concentrated Solar Power: Using concentrated solar power systems, such as parabolic mirrors or Fresnel lenses, would focus the available sunlight onto a single point, increasing its intensity and allowing for the generation of electricity even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud Cover Forecasting: Developing advanced cloud cover forecasting systems would enable the prediction of when and where clouds would be present, allowing for the planning of solar power generation and energy storage accordingly.",
    "Energy Harvesting from Wind and Water: Combining energy harvesting technologies from wind and water sources would provide a more reliable and diverse energy supply, even on cloudy days. This could include wind turbines for generating electricity and hydroelectric power plants for harnessing the energy of flowing water.",
    "Bioenergy: Utilizing bioenergy sources, such as biogas from agricultural waste or algae-based biofuels, would provide an alternative energy source that is not dependent on sunlight. This would help to ensure a consistent supply of energy even on cloudy days."
