    "\"The Envy Engine\": A wearable device that detects and analyzes the emotions of the wearer, specifically targeting envy and jealousy. When the device senses these emotions, it triggers a gentle, soothing voice that whispers affirmations and reminders of the wearer's own strengths and accomplishments.

This device would not only help individuals manage their emotions but also provide a sense of belonging and connection.",

The platform would also offer resources and support for users who may be struggling with mental health issues.",
