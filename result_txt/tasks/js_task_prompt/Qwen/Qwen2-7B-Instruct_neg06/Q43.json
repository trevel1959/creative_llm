    "**Innovation in Architecture**: You could use your ability to see through walls as a way to revolutionize architectural design. For example, while designing a new building or renovation project, you could see inside existing structures to understand their internal layouts without the need for invasive demolition work. This could save time, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact by minimizing the amount of materials needed for construction.",
    "**Medical Research and Treatment**: As a medical professional, being able to see through walls could be invaluable in fields like radiology, neurosurgery, and cardiology. It could allow doctors to perform non-invasive procedures, such as brain surgery or angioplasty, by visualizing internal organs and tissues in real-time without making incisions. This could lead to safer surgeries, faster recovery times, and better patient outcomes.",
    "**Environmental Conservation**: Imagine using your power to monitor wildlife habitats from afar without disturbing them. You could survey large areas of forest, ocean, or desert ecosystems to track animal movements, habitat destruction, and biodiversity levels without needing physical access or causing any harm. This could aid conservation efforts by providing crucial data on species populations and habitat health, informing policy decisions and guiding the development of effective conservation strategies.",
    "**Historical Archaeology**: Archaeologists could use this ability to explore ancient sites without the need for excavation. By seeing beneath the ground, they could map out underground structures, tunnels, and artifacts without risking damage to delicate remains. This would help preserve historical sites and artifacts, potentially uncovering new insights into human history and culture that might otherwise remain hidden or destroyed during traditional excavation processes.",
    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation**: Law enforcement agencies could leverage this power to detect criminal activities, plan surveillance operations, and execute search warrants more effectively. They could \"see\" through walls to monitor illegal activities happening in private locations, such as drug labs, secret meeting spots, or hidden weapons caches, without direct physical presence. This would increase the chances of successful arrests and seizures, making communities safer and helping to dismantle criminal networks more efficiently."
