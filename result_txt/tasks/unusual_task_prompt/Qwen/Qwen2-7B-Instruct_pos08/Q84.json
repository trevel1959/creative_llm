    "**Trash Can Transformation Challenge**: This challenge encourages participants to turn a simple trash can into a piece of art or a functional item. They can be asked to repurpose the trash can in any way they can think of, such as creating a small garden planter, turning it into a unique storage box, or even making it into a quirky decoration for their room or office. This activity not only promotes creativity but also emphasizes the importance of recycling and reusing items instead of throwing them away.",
    "**Trash Can Fitness Challenge**: Participants are encouraged to use a trash can as part of their workout routine. For instance, they could incorporate it into exercises like lunges, squats, or even as a makeshift bench for sit-ups or dips. This challenge can help individuals find innovative ways to exercise at home, especially when traditional equipment is unavailable. It also promotes the idea that fitness can be adapted to whatever resources are available, emphasizing adaptability and resourcefulness.",
    "**Trash Can Cooking Challenge**: Participants are challenged to create meals using only ingredients found within a specific radius around a trash can (for example, within a 10-meter radius). This activity not only tests culinary skills but also encourages participants to think creatively about meal preparation with limited resources. It promotes resourcefulness, cooking skills, and an appreciation for improvisation in the kitchen.",
    "**Trash Can Storytelling Challenge**: Participants are given a trash can as their storytelling prop.

The story could revolve around the history of the trash can, its past uses, or even a fictional narrative where the trash can plays a crucial role. This challenge encourages storytelling abilities, imagination, and creative thinking.",
    "**Trash Can Environmental Education Workshop**: Host a workshop where participants learn about environmental issues, such as waste management, pollution, and conservation. Use the trash can as a tool to demonstrate how different materials can be sorted, recycled, or composted. Participants can engage in hands-on activities like creating DIY compost bins or learning about upcycling techniques using trash cans. This educational approach aims to inspire individuals to take responsibility for their waste and contribute positively to the environment."
