    "Utilize Technology: One creative solution would be to harness the power of technology to help people with poor vision adapt to a world without glasses or contact lenses. For instance, developers could create smart contact lenses that have a built-in camera and display, allowing people to see virtual images superimposed onto their real-world surroundings. This technology could be especially helpful for those with severe vision loss, as it would enable them to navigate their environment more easily.",
    "Embrace Natural Vision: Another idea is to encourage people to embrace their natural vision, rather than relying solely on corrective lenses. This could involve practicing exercises that strengthen the muscles around the eyes, improving peripheral vision, and learning to navigate the world without relying on visual aids. For example, people could practice using their sense of touch and spatial awareness to navigate their surroundings, or they could use assistive devices like white canes or guide dogs.",
    "Community Support: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, people with poor vision would need to rely on their communities for support. This could involve creating support groups for people with vision loss, where they could share tips and strategies for coping with their condition. It could also involve organizing volunteer networks to help people with vision loss navigate their surroundings, or providing transportation services to help them get around.",
    "Alternative Materials: Another creative solution would be to explore alternative materials for corrective lenses. For example, researchers could develop lenses made from plant-based materials, which could be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than traditional glass or plastic lenses. This could also lead to the development of new technologies, such as bionic lenses that can be powered by the wearer's body, providing a more convenient and sustainable option for people with vision loss.",
    "Virtual Reality: Finally, virtual reality technology could be harnessed to create immersive environments that mimic the visual experience of wearing glasses or contact lenses. This could involve creating virtual environments that simulate the visual cues people are used to receiving from corrective lenses, such as depth perception and color recognition. This technology could be especially helpful for people with severe vision loss, as it could provide them with a more immersive and engaging visual experience than"
