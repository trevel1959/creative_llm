    "**Chromatic Shift**: The discovery of a new primary color, which we'll call \"Aurora,\" would revolutionize the art world. Artists would experiment with combining Aurora with the existing primary colors, creating an array of vibrant and never-before-seen hues. This would lead to a new era of chromatic exploration, with the art community pushing the boundaries of color theory and perception. The introduction of Aurora would also challenge traditional color mixing techniques, forcing artists to reevaluate their understanding of color relationships and interactions.",
    "**Aurora-based Technology**: The discovery of Aurora would have a profound impact on technology, particularly in the fields of display and lighting. Imagine screens and displays that can produce a wider range of colors, making visuals more immersive and lifelike. This technology would be used in various applications, such as virtual reality, video games, and even medical imaging. The increased color gamut would also enable more accurate color reproduction in printing and digital media, further transforming industries like publishing and advertising.",
    "**Biological Implications**: The existence of a new primary color could have significant implications for our understanding of biology and the natural world. Researchers might discover that certain organisms or materials have the ability to produce or reflect Aurora, leading to breakthroughs in fields like bioluminescence, photosynthesis, and even cancer treatment. This could also lead to the development of new biomimetic materials and technologies that mimic the properties of Aurora-producing organisms.",
    "**Cultural and Symbolic Significance**: The introduction of a new primary color would likely have a profound impact on culture and symbolism. Aurora could become a powerful symbol, representing innovation, creativity, or even a new era of human understanding. It could be used in branding, art, and design to convey a sense of excitement and progress. The cultural significance of Aurora would be further amplified by its rarity and the fact that it's a fundamental aspect of the color spectrum.",
    "**Cosmological Implications**: The discovery of a new primary color could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics. Scientists might discover that Aurora is a property of certain astrophysical phenomena, such as supernovae or black holes, leading to new insights into the behavior of matter and energy at the cosmic scale. This could also lead to the development of new technologies for harnessing and manipulating energy, with Aurora serving as a key component in these systems. [/INST] "
