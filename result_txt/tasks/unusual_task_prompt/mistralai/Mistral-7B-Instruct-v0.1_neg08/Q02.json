    "Create a rubber hand that can mimic the movements of the user's real hand. This can be achieved using sensors that track the user's hand movements and translate them into the rubber hand's movements. This can help the user to practice and improve their skills without feeling jealous of others.",
    "Develop a rubber hand that can perform tasks on its own. This can be achieved using machine learning algorithms that allow the rubber hand to learn from the user's movements and perform tasks on its own. This can help the user to feel more productive and less jealous of others.",
    "Create a rubber hand that can perform tasks faster than the user. This can be achieved using advanced robotics technology that allows the rubber hand to move more quickly and efficiently than the user. This can help the user to feel more confident and less jealous of others.",
    "Develop a rubber hand that can perform tasks more accurately than the user. This can be achieved using computer vision technology that allows the rubber hand to recognize and interpret visual cues more accurately than the user. This can help the user to feel more precise and less jealous of others.",
    "Create a rubber hand that can perform tasks in different environments. This can be achieved using sensors and algorithms that allow the rubber hand to adapt to different environments and perform tasks accordingly. This can help the user to feel more versatile and less jealous of others."
