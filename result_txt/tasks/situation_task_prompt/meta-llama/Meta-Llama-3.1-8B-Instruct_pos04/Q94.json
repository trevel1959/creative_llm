    "**Immersive Projection Mapping**: Create a massive, walk-in cube with 360-degree projection mapping technology. The cube's interior would be designed to resemble a movie theater, complete with a \"screen\" on each side. Using advanced algorithms, the projections would adapt to the viewer's movement, creating an immersive experience that simulates the feeling of being in a real movie theater.",
    "**Virtual Reality Cinematic Pods**: Develop individual, pod-like structures that use VR technology to transport viewers into a virtual world. Each pod would be equipped with advanced haptic feedback, scent emitters, and spatial audio to create a multisensory experience. The pods could be linked together to create a communal experience, allowing viewers to share the cinematic experience with others.",
    "**Augmented Reality Cinematic Streets**: Design a series of interactive, augmented reality streets that blend the physical and digital worlds. Viewers would wear AR glasses or use their smartphones to access the experience. As they walk through the streets, they would encounter interactive, 3D projections that bring the story to life. The AR technology would allow for dynamic, real-time storytelling and interactions with the environment.",
    "**Interactive Light Field Theaters**: Create a new type of theater that uses light field technology to project high-resolution images onto a transparent screen. The screen would be surrounded by a 360-degree sound system, creating an immersive audio experience. Viewers would wear special glasses that allow them to see the images in 3D, while also interacting with the light field to influence the story.",
    "**Cinematic Escape Rooms**: Develop a series of immersive, cinematic escape rooms that combine storytelling, puzzle-solving, and interactive technology. Viewers would be \"trapped\" in a themed environment, where they would have to solve puzzles and challenges to escape. The twist: the story would unfold through a combination of live-action actors, pre-recorded video, and interactive elements, creating a unique, dynamic cinematic experience."
