    "Laser Cutting Technology: In a world where scissors and knives have vanished, people could turn to advanced laser cutting technology to cut through various materials. Laser cutters use high-powered beams of light to make precise cuts, allowing for clean and accurate cuts in a variety of materials, including paper, fabric, wood, and even metal. With the right settings and materials, laser cutters could become the go-to tool for cutting everything from paper crafts to architectural elements.",
    "Sonic Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, sonic cutting technology could become the next best thing. Sonic cutters use high-frequency sound waves to cut through materials, allowing for precise and clean cuts without the need for physical force. This technology could be used for everything from cutting fabric to cutting through bone, providing a new and innovative way to cut materials.",
    "Plasma Cutting: Another option for cutting materials in a world without scissors or knives would be plasma cutting technology. Plasma cutters use a high-temperature plasma arc to cut through metal and other materials, providing precise and clean cuts. This technology could be used for a wide range of applications, from cutting metal sheets to creating intricate designs in metal.",
    "Magnetic Cutting: In a world without scissors or knives, magnetic cutting technology could become the next best thing. Magnetic cutters use magnetic fields to cut through materials, allowing for precise and clean cuts without the need for physical force. This technology could be used for everything from cutting metal to cutting through hard materials like stone or concrete.",
    "Shape-memory Alloys: Shape-memory alloys are a type of metal alloy that can change shape in response to temperature changes. In a world without scissors or knives, shape-memory alloys could be used to create cutting tools that can change shape to cut through different materials. For example, a shape-memory alloy tool could change from a flat shape to a curved shape to cut through a rounded material, providing a versatile and innovative cutting solution."
