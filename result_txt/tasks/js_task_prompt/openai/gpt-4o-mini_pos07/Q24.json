    "**Smart Mobility Network**: Instead of traditional cars, the city would utilize a network of autonomous electric vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrian pathways. Smart traffic management systems would optimize travel routes in real-time, reducing congestion and pollution. The city would also feature designated lanes for electric scooters and hoverboards, making it easy for residents to navigate without relying on fossil fuels. Public transportation would be frequent, efficient, and seamlessly integrated with ride-sharing options.",
    "**Civic Engagement Hubs**: The city would have multiple civic engagement hubs where residents can participate in local governance, community events, and decision-making processes. These hubs would feature interactive technology that allows citizens to vote on community projects, access information about local issues, and engage with city officials. Regular workshops and forums would foster collaboration and empower residents to take an active role in shaping their environment.",
    "**Energy-Positive Buildings**: Every building in the city would be designed to be energy-positive, meaning they generate more energy than they consume. This would be achieved through solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced energy storage systems. Buildings would also incorporate smart technology to monitor and optimize energy use, ensuring maximum efficiency. The surplus energy generated could be fed back into the city grid, creating a self-sustaining energy ecosystem.",
    "**Cultural and Artistic Zones**: The city would celebrate creativity by establishing dedicated cultural and artistic zones, featuring galleries, performance spaces, and workshops for artists and creators. These zones would host regular festivals, exhibitions, and performances, fostering a vibrant arts scene. Public art installations would be integrated throughout the city, encouraging community engagement and beautifying public spaces.",
    "**Water Management Systems**: To address water scarcity and flooding, the city would implement an innovative water management system that captures rainwater and recycles wastewater. Green roofs and permeable pavements would facilitate natural water absorption, reducing runoff and flooding. Additionally, the city would have educational programs to promote water conservation practices among residents, ensuring sustainable water use."
