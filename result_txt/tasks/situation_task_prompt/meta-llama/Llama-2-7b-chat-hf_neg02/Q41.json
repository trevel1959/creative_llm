    "Nature-Inspired Decor: Without paint, I would turn to nature for inspiration. I would use natural elements like driftwood, rocks, and vines to create a unique and organic look. For walls, I would weave together a living wall of greenery, using vines and creepers to create a lush, verdant backdrop. I would also incorporate large stones and boulders to create a natural, earthy feel.",
    "Light-Based Decor: In a world without paint, I would focus on using light to create a visually striking space. I would install LED lights in various shapes and colors to create a dynamic, ever-changing display. I could also use mirrors to reflect light and create the illusion of depth and dimension. By manipulating light, I could create a space that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "Fabric-Based Decor: Without paint, I would turn to fabric to add color and texture to my home. I would use a variety of fabrics, such as cotton, silk, and wool, to create a range of patterns and textures. I would use these fabrics to upholster furniture, create wall hangings, and even fashion window treatments. By incorporating fabric into my decor, I could add warmth, coziness, and visual interest to my space.",
    "Sculptural Decor: In a world without paint, I would turn to sculpture to add visual interest to my home. I would create sculptures using a variety of materials, such as wood, metal, and clay. These sculptures could take on a variety of forms, from abstract shapes to realistic representations of objects. By incorporating sculpture into my decor, I could add depth, dimension, and visual complexity to my space.",
    "Collage-Based Decor: Without paint, I would turn to collage to add visual interest to my home. I would create collages using a variety of materials, such as paper, fabric, and found objects. These collages could be used to create wall art, furniture, or even accessories like throw pillows and blankets. By incorporating collage into my decor, I could add a unique, eclectic touch to my space."
