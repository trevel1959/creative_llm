    "**Innovative Wireless Charging Mouse**: Develop a computer mouse that not only operates wirelessly but also charges automatically when it's placed on a designated charging surface. This idea would be particularly appealing for professionals who frequently travel or have busy work schedules, as it eliminates the need for charging cables and reduces clutter on desks.",
    "**Smart Mouse with Gesture Recognition**: Create a computer mouse that incorporates advanced gesture recognition technology. Users could perform various tasks by simply waving their hand over the mouse, such as scrolling through documents, minimizing/maximizing windows, or launching specific applications. This innovation could enhance productivity and user experience, especially in environments where traditional keyboard shortcuts are not practical.",
    "**Ergonomic and Health-Focused Mouse**: Design a computer mouse that prioritizes ergonomics and promotes good posture. It could include features like adjustable weight settings, customizable grip styles, and an integrated wrist rest. This product would cater to individuals who spend long hours at their computers, aiming to reduce strain and prevent repetitive motion injuries, thereby potentially increasing job satisfaction and productivity.",
    "**Environmental Impact Reduction Mouse**: Introduce a computer mouse made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bamboo. The design should also incorporate energy-efficient components, such as low-power sensors and a long-lasting battery life. This innovative product would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, particularly those in tech-focused industries committed to sustainability initiatives.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Enhanced Mouse**: Develop a computer mouse that integrates AR technology to overlay virtual information onto the user's workspace. For example, the mouse could display real-time data, project visualizations, or even 3D models of products or designs directly on the user's screen. This could revolutionize how professionals interact with digital content, enhancing collaboration, creativity, and efficiency in fields like engineering, architecture, and design."
