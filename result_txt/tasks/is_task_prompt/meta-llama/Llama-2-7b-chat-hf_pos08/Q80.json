    "Develop a mobile app called \"Rainbow Chaser\" that allows users to track their progress towards their goals by visualizing their journey on a virtual rainbow. When users encounter obstacles, they can use the app to \"chase\" the rainbow and find new ways to overcome them.",
    "Create a motivational poster series featuring illustrations of people embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, with the tagline \"The end of the rainbow is just the beginning.\" Each poster could feature a different person from a diverse background, showcasing their unique journey and how they overcame obstacles to achieve their goals.",
