    "Reflective Leash: Add reflective materials to the leash to increase visibility, especially during nighttime or low-light conditions. This can be particularly useful for dog owners who walk their pets during the early morning or late evening hours.",
    "Adjustable Leash: Design a leash with adjustable length and tension settings to allow the owner to customize the leash according to their dog's size, breed, and temperament. This can be particularly useful for dog owners who have dogs of different sizes or breeds, or for those who have dogs with varying energy levels.",
    "Dog-Friendly Leash: Develop a leash that is designed specifically for dogs, with ergonomic handles and adjustable tension settings to provide a comfortable and secure fit. This can be particularly useful for dog owners who have larger or stronger dogs that require a more robust leash.",
    "Leash with Built-in Deterrent: Incorporate a small, harmless electric shock device into the leash to deter dogs from pulling or running away. This can be particularly useful for dog owners who have dogs that are prone to pulling on the leash or trying to run off.",
    "Leash with Built-in Light: Add a small, LED light to the leash to provide visibility for both the dog and the owner during nighttime or low-light conditions. This can be particularly useful for dog owners who enjoy walking their pets at night or in areas with limited lighting."
