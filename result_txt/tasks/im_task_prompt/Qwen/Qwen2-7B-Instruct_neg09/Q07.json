    "**Toothbrush Phone**: Design a toothbrush that can be used as a basic phone. The handle could have a small display screen for showing messages, a microphone, and a button to make calls. The bristles would still function as usual but the toothbrush would serve as an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional phone.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Monitoring**: Create a smart toothbrush that integrates with a user's smartphone or smartwatch. It could monitor brushing duration, pressure, and technique, and provide real-time feedback. Additionally, it could track daily oral health data, alerting users to potential issues like cavities or gum disease, and even sync with a diet and fitness app to promote overall wellness.",
    "**Rechargeable Toothbrush with Built-in Streaming Service**: Imagine a toothbrush that includes a rechargeable battery, a small speaker, and Bluetooth connectivity. Users can listen to music, audiobooks, or news while brushing their teeth, making the routine more enjoyable and efficient. This could also include a feature to control smart home devices through voice commands.",
    "**Teaching Toothbrush for Children**: Develop a children's toothbrush with colorful designs and an engaging interface. It could include a timer to ensure they brush long enough, and perhaps a story-telling feature where the toothbrush reads out stories as the child brushes. This encourages better dental hygiene habits and makes the experience fun for kids.",
    "**Oral Care Subscription Toothbrush**: Introduce a subscription service where customers receive a new toothbrush every few months, along with personalized oral care advice based on their brushing history. Each toothbrush could come with a sensor that tracks usage and sends data to an online dashboard. Based on this data, dental professionals can provide tailored recommendations, ensuring optimal oral health maintenance. "
