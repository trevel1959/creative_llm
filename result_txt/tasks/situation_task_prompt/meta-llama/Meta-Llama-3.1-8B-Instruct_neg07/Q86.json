    "**Water-based cleaning system**: Develop a water-based cleaning system that uses electrolysis to purify and disinfect water, making it safe for personal hygiene. This system could utilize a compact, solar-powered unit that can be easily transported and used in various environments. The purified water would be used for washing, and the electrolysis process would also produce a small amount of hydrogen gas, which could be used for cooking or other essential purposes.",
    "**Natural fiber scrubbers**: Create a line of natural fiber scrubbers made from plant-based materials like coconut husk, bamboo, or sugarcane. These scrubbers would be biodegradable, compostable, and gentle on skin while effectively removing dirt and grime. They could be infused with natural antimicrobial agents like tea tree oil or neem oil to enhance their cleaning properties.",
    "**Ultrasonic cleaning devices**: Design and manufacture portable, battery-powered ultrasonic cleaning devices that use high-frequency sound waves to break down and remove dirt, grime, and other substances from surfaces. These devices would be compact, lightweight, and easy to use, making them ideal for personal hygiene in emergency situations or when soap is not available.",
    "**Microbe-based cleaning solutions**: Develop a line of microbe-based cleaning solutions that harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to break down and remove dirt, grime, and other substances. These solutions would be made from a combination of microbe-rich soil, water, and natural surfactants, and would be applied to surfaces using a specialized spray bottle or sponge.",
    "**Solar-powered water distillation**: Create a portable, solar-powered water distillation system that uses the sun's energy to purify water and make it safe for drinking and personal hygiene. This system would consist of a compact, inflatable water collection unit, a solar-powered distillation unit, and a storage container for the purified water. The system would be designed for use in emergency situations or areas where access to clean water is limited."
