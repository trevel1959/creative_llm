    "Temperature Extremes: Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with temperatures ranging from -125°C to 20°C. This would make it difficult to maintain a comfortable living environment without proper insulation and heating/cooling systems.",
    "Radiation Exposure: Mars lacks a magnetic field, which means that the planet is exposed to the sun's ultraviolet and cosmic radiation. This would pose a risk to both the human body and electronic equipment.",
    "Limited Water: Mars has very little water, and the water that is available is often contaminated with chemicals. This would make it difficult to maintain proper hygiene and sanitation.",
    "Gravity: Mars has only about one-third of Earth's gravity, which would make movement and balance difficult for humans. This could lead to issues with muscle strength and coordination.",
    "Communication: Mars is about 140 million miles from Earth, which means that communication with Earth would be delayed by several minutes. This would make real-time communication difficult and could lead to misunderstandings."
