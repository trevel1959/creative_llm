    "Once in a lush green forest, there lived a bear named Benny who adored honey more than anything else. His days were spent searching for the sweetest hives, often leading him into trouble. One sunny morning, Benny discovered a massive beehive atop a tall tree. Ignoring the buzzing warnings, he climbed up, dreaming of a honey feast. But as he devoured the sticky treat, the angry bees swarmed around him! Benny tumbled down, landing softly on a bed of leaves. Realizing his love for honey could lead to peril, he decided to share his bounty with friends, learning that sharing was sweeter than greed.",
