    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Sleeves**: Create a modular sweater that features detachable sleeves with different styles, lengths, and materials. This allows wearers to customize their look based on the occasion, season, or mood. For example, a chunky knit sleeve for winter could be swapped for a lighter, sleeveless option in spring.",
    "**Built-in Aromatherapy Pockets**: Integrate small, hidden pockets within the sweater designed to hold essential oil sachets or aroma beads. This would allow wearers to enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy throughout the day, with the scent being released gradually, promoting relaxation or invigoration as needed.",
    "**Interactive LED Patterns**: Design a sweater with embedded LED lights that can change colors and patterns through a smartphone app. Users could customize the look of their sweater for different occasions or moods, such as a calming blue for relaxation or a vibrant red for a night out. The lights could also pulse in response to music, creating a fun, dynamic look.",
    "**Built-in Heating Elements**: Integrate flexible heating elements powered by rechargeable batteries into the fabric. This would allow the wearer to control the warmth of the sweater through a smartphone app or a simple button, making it perfect for cold weather without the bulk of heavy layers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Fabric with Self-Cleaning Properties**: Develop a sweater made from sustainable materials that also have self-cleaning properties. Utilizing nanotechnology, the fabric could repel dirt and stains, reducing the need for frequent washing. This would not only save water but also extend the life of the garment, promoting a more sustainable wardrobe."
