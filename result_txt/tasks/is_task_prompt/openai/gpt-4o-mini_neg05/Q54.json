    "As the first rays of sunlight broke through the winter clouds, a little girl named Mia watched her snowman, Frosty, come to life. His coal eyes twinkled with mischief as he stretched his twig arms. \"Letâ€™s have an adventure!\" he exclaimed, and together they dashed through the snowy landscape. They slid down hills, built igloo forts, and shared laughter that echoed through the frosty air. As dusk approached, Frosty felt the warmth of spring creeping in. With a heavy heart, he promised Mia he would return next winter. With a wave, he melted into a sparkling puddle, leaving behind a promise of magic.",
