    "**Eco-Friendly Printing Mode**: Introduce an eco-friendly printing mode that allows users to print documents with minimal ink usage. This mode could automatically adjust the font size, margins, and even suggest alternatives like printing double-sided or on recycled paper. Additionally, it could provide a report after each print job, showing the environmental impact saved, such as trees saved or carbon emissions reduced.",
    "**Augmented Reality Printing**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology into printers, allowing users to visualize their documents in a 3D space before printing. By using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could see how their designs or documents would look in real life, enabling them to make adjustments and ensure optimal results before wasting paper and ink.",
    "**Multi-Function All-in-One with AI Assistant**: Create an all-in-one printer that includes an AI assistant capable of understanding voice commands. Users could instruct the printer to scan, copy, or print without needing to navigate through complex menus. The AI could also learn the user’s printing habits and suggest printing settings based on previous behaviors, enhancing efficiency.",
    "**Customizable Print Templates**: Design a printer that allows users to create and save customizable print templates directly on the printer. This feature would enable users to design templates for business cards, labels, flyers, and more, all from the printer’s interface. Users could select their designs and adjust settings without needing to access a computer, streamlining the printing process.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Mobile Printing**: Innovate a printer that includes a wireless charging pad on top, allowing users to charge their smartphones or tablets while printing. Additionally, enhance mobile printing capabilities by creating an app that not only allows printing but also enables users to edit documents, adjust print settings, and even preview prints directly from their mobile devices."
