    "Overcrowding: Another challenge is managing the number of visitors to the park. Overcrowding can lead to increased stress on the park's ecosystem, damage to the park's infrastructure, and a negative experience for visitors. This could lead to the need for increased visitor fees or restricted visitation hours.",
    "Poaching: Poaching is a significant concern for national parks, as it can lead to the decline of endangered species populations. Park rangers must be vigilant in enforcing anti-poaching laws and monitoring wildlife populations to ensure the long-term survival of these species.",
    "Climate Change: Climate change is causing significant changes to the environment, including rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. This can impact the park's ecosystem and make it more difficult to maintain the park's natural resources.",
    "Wildfires: Wildfires can be a significant threat to national parks, as they can damage the park's ecosystem, destroy visitor facilities, and pose a risk to visitor safety. Parks must have effective fire prevention and response strategies in place to minimize the impact of wildfires.",
    "Lack of Education and Awareness: Many visitors to national parks may not be aware of the importance of protecting these natural areas or the impact that their actions can have on the environment. This can lead to littering, vandalism, and other forms of damage to the park's resources."
