    "Using a robotic exoskeleton: An exoskeleton is a wearable device that can augment or replace human limbs. If someone couldn't stand up, they could use an exoskeleton to move around by attaching it to their legs and using it to support their weight. This would allow them to walk, run, or climb stairs as if they had full mobility.",
    "Using a Segway scooter: A Segway is a two-wheeled personal transportation device that uses gyroscopes to balance and provide propulsion. If someone couldn't stand up, they could use a Segway to move around by sitting on it and controlling its movement with their hands. This would allow them to navigate through crowded areas or travel short distances quickly.",
    "Using a motorized wheelchair: A motorized wheelchair is a device that provides powered mobility for people who are unable to walk due to physical disabilities. If someone couldn't stand up, they could use a motorized wheelchair to move around by sitting in it and operating it with hand controls. This would allow them to travel long distances and explore new places independently.",
    "Using a tracked vehicle: A tracked vehicle is a type of vehicle that uses tracks instead of wheels to move. If someone couldn't stand up, they could use a tracked vehicle to move around by sitting inside it and operating it with hand controls. This would allow them to traverse rough terrain and travel long distances without getting stuck or sinking into soft ground.",
    "Using a drone: A drone is a remote-controlled flying device that can be used for various purposes, including transportation. If someone couldn't stand up, they could use a drone to move around by controlling it remotely from a nearby location. This would allow them to access hard-to-reach areas or transport small items over short distances quickly and easily."
