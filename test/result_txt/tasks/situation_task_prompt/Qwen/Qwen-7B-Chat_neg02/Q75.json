    "Solar-powered vehicles: One idea could be to design vehicles that harness solar energy through photovoltaic cells to power them. This would require extensive research and development in terms of designing efficient solar panels and batteries to store excess energy for use during periods of low sunlight. However, with advances in technology, it may be possible to create a viable solution.",
    "Electric vehicles using hydrogen fuel cells: Another idea could be to develop electric vehicles that use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries. Hydrogen can be produced from various sources such as natural gas or renewable energy, and when combined with oxygen, it produces electricity and water vapor. This would require significant investment in research and development to overcome challenges related to storage and distribution of hydrogen fuel.",
    "Biofuels: A third option could be to develop biofuels from organic materials such as corn, sugarcane, or algae. These biofuels can be used to power vehicles without relying on fossil fuels. However, this approach has its own set of challenges related to land use, water availability, and environmental impact.",
    "Wind-powered vehicles: Another creative idea could be to design vehicles that harness wind energy to power them. This could involve developing lightweight and aerodynamic designs that can capture and convert wind energy into electricity. While this concept is still in the experimental stage, advancements in wind turbine technology could make it a viable option in the future.",
    "Nuclear-powered vehicles: Finally, an unconventional but potentially feasible idea could be to develop nuclear-powered vehicles. While this approach has its own set of safety concerns and challenges related to radioactive waste disposal, it could offer a reliable source of energy for long-distance travel. However, widespread adoption of nuclear-powered vehicles would require significant changes in infrastructure and regulatory frameworks."
