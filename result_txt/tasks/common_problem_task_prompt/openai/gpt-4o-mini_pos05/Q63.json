    "**Digital Accessibility**: In a global campaign, varying levels of internet access and digital literacy can create disparities in participation. Some regions may have limited access to online platforms, while others may not be familiar with digital payment systems. To mitigate this issue, the campaign should include offline fundraising options, such as community events, printed materials, and partnerships with local businesses that can facilitate donations in person. Additionally, providing clear, multilingual instructions on how to participate can enhance accessibility.",
    "**Time Zone Coordination**: With participants from different time zones, scheduling live events (like webinars or virtual auctions) can be challenging. A lack of synchronization may lead to low attendance or engagement. To overcome this, the campaign could record events and make them available on-demand, allowing participants to engage at their convenience. Furthermore, providing a clear schedule that highlights key events in various time zones can help keep everyone informed and involved.",
    "**Transparency in Fund Allocation**: Donors are increasingly concerned about how their contributions are used. A lack of transparency can lead to distrust and decreased participation. To address this, the campaign should commit to clear communication regarding how funds will be allocated and the impact they will have on cancer research. Regular updates and reports on fundraising progress and specific projects funded can help build trust and encourage ongoing support.",
    "**Engagement of Diverse Stakeholders**: Ensuring that the campaign engages a wide range of stakeholders—including researchers, survivors, and healthcare professionals—can be difficult. If the campaign is too focused on one group, it may fail to resonate with others. To solve this, the campaign should actively seek input and participation from various stakeholders, creating a platform for sharing personal stories and insights. This could involve social media takeovers, interviews, and collaborative events that highlight the multifaceted nature of cancer research.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Challenges**: Different countries have varying laws regarding fundraising, which can complicate a global campaign. Issues may arise concerning tax regulations, required permits, and legal obligations for international donations. To navigate this, the campaign should consult with legal experts in each region to ensure compliance with local laws. Establishing partnerships with established organizations in those regions can also help streamline the process and provide local insights."
