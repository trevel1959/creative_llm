    "**Blockchain-based Digital Currency**: We could transition to a fully digital economy where transactions are processed through blockchain technology. Each individual would have a personal digital wallet on their smartphone or other devices. Payments would be made instantly, securely, and directly from one wallet to another, eliminating the need for physical currency. This system would require widespread adoption of digital devices and internet access, which might pose challenges in less developed areas.",
    "**Universal Credit Card System**: All transactions could be conducted using a universal credit card that everyone possesses. The card would store the user's biometric data (like fingerprints or facial recognition) for secure identification. Every purchase would be made electronically, and the funds would be deducted directly from the user's account. This system requires a robust infrastructure for card production and secure transaction processing.",
    "**Cryptocurrency and Peer-to-Peer Transactions**: People could use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for transactions. These digital currencies would operate on decentralized networks, allowing users to send and receive payments directly without the need for intermediaries like banks. To ensure widespread adoption, education about cryptocurrency usage and security would be crucial.",
    "**Smart Contract Payments**: Utilizing smart contracts, agreements could be automatically executed upon meeting specific conditions. For example, when goods are delivered, a payment is automatically sent to the seller. This system reduces the risk of fraud and ensures timely payments, but it relies heavily on the reliability of the underlying blockchain network.",
    "**Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: Central banks could issue a digital version of national currencies, which would be backed by the government. This would provide a stable and trusted digital alternative to physical cash. CBDCs could be integrated into existing banking systems, allowing for easy adoption and usage."
