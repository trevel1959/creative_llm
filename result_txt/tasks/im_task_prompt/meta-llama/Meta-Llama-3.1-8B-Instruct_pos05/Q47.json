    "**Smart Cleaning Paths**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that uses AI to create an optimized cleaning path based on the room's layout and furniture. The device would map the space, identify areas with high foot traffic, and adapt its cleaning route to ensure maximum efficiency. This feature would be particularly useful for large spaces, such as offices or warehouses, where manual cleaning can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Filter**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning filter that uses UV light or other technologies to sanitize and maintain the filter's performance. This would eliminate the need for frequent filter replacements and reduce waste. The self-cleaning filter would also help maintain indoor air quality by capturing dust, pollen, and other allergens.",
    "**Automated Dust Collection**: Create a vacuum cleaner that uses a robotic arm or a small conveyor belt to collect and sort dust, dirt, and other debris. This feature would allow users to easily separate recyclable materials from trash, making it a more eco-friendly option. The collected materials could be stored in a designated container for later disposal or recycling.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Navigation**: Develop a voice-controlled vacuum cleaner that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand voice commands and navigate through the space. This feature would enable users to give voice commands to clean specific areas, such as \"clean the living room\" or \"vacuum under the couch.\" The device would use its mapping technology to locate the area and adapt its cleaning path accordingly.",
    "**Integration with Smart Home Systems**: Design a vacuum cleaner that seamlessly integrates with popular smart home systems, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. This would enable users to schedule cleaning sessions, monitor the device's performance, and receive notifications when the cleaning cycle is complete. The integration would also allow users to control the vacuum cleaner remotely, making it a convenient option for busy households."
