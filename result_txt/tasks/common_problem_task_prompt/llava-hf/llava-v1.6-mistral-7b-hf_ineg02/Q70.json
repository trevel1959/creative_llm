    "**Over-Reliance on Interpreters**: In situations where language barriers are particularly strong, there may be a tendency to rely too heavily on interpreters. This can create a dynamic in which some individuals are perceived as \"more important\" than others, which can lead to tension and dissatisfaction in the workplace.",
