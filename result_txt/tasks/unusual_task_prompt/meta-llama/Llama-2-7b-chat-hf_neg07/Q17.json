    "Personalized coffee mug with a twist: Create a coffee mug that can change its design based on the user's mood or environment. The mug could have a series of sensors that detect the user's emotions and adjust the design accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the mug could change to a soothing, calming design. If the user is feeling energized, the mug could change to a more vibrant and playful design.",
    "Coffee mug with a built-in coffee grinder: Create a coffee mug that has a built-in coffee grinder. This would allow users to grind their coffee beans directly in the mug, eliminating the need for a separate grinder. The grinder could be powered by a small motor or through the user's hand movements. This would make the coffee brewing process more convenient and efficient.",
    "Smart coffee mug with temperature control: Create a coffee mug that can maintain a precise temperature for a longer period of time. The mug could have a heating element that can be controlled through a smartphone app, allowing users to adjust the temperature of their coffee to their liking. This would be particularly useful for people who prefer their coffee at a specific temperature.",
    "Coffee mug with a built-in tea infuser: Create a coffee mug that has a built-in tea infuser. This would allow users to easily steep loose-leaf tea in their coffee mug, without the need for a separate tea infuser. The infuser could be made of a flexible material that can be inserted into the mug and removed when the tea is ready.",
    "Glow-in-the-dark coffee mug: Create a coffee mug that glows in the dark. The mug could have a special coating that absorbs light during the day and emits a soft glow at night. This would make the mug more fun and unique, and could also provide a subtle reminder to drink more coffee throughout the day."
