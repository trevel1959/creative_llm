    "**Rubber Hand Illusion 2.0**: A futuristic twist on the classic rubber hand illusion, where a person's severed hand is replaced with a prosthetic one made of a flexible, stretchy material that mimics the look and feel of human skin. The twist? The prosthetic hand is connected to a neural network that allows it to adapt to the person's thoughts and movements, creating a seamless integration between the brain and the prosthetic. As the person thinks about moving their hand, the prosthetic hand responds in kind, creating a sense of ownership and control that blurs the line between reality and illusion.",
    "**Virtual Reality Hand Transplant**: A revolutionary new treatment for amputees, where a person's severed hand is replaced with a virtual reality (VR) hand that can be controlled by their thoughts. Using advanced brain-computer interface technology, the VR hand is projected onto a screen in front of the person, allowing them to interact with virtual objects and environments in a highly immersive and realistic way. As the person thinks about grasping an object, the VR hand responds by reaching out and manipulating it, creating a sense of agency and control that's indistinguishable from reality.",
    "**The Hand of the Future**: A sci-fi inspired concept where a person's severed hand is replaced with a robotic hand that's powered by advanced nanotechnology. The robotic hand is covered in tiny, microscopic robots that work together to mimic the movements and sensations of a human hand, allowing the person to feel and interact with their environment in a highly intuitive and natural way. As the person thinks about moving their hand, the robotic hand responds by extending and flexing its fingers, creating a sense of fluidity and dexterity that's unmatched by traditional prosthetics.",
    "**Mind-Controlled Puppetry**: A innovative new form of entertainment where a person's severed hand is replaced with a puppet hand that can be controlled by their thoughts. Using advanced brain-computer interface technology, the puppet hand is manipulated by the person's thoughts, allowing them to create intricate and complex puppet shows that are indistinguishable from live performances. As the person thinks about moving the puppet's arms and legs, the puppet responds by mimicking the movements, creating a sense of wonder and enchantment that's unmatched by traditional puppetry.",
    "**The Augmented Hand**: A futuristic concept where a person's severed hand is replaced with an augmented reality (AR) hand that can be controlled by their thoughts. Using advanced AR technology, the AR hand is projected onto"
