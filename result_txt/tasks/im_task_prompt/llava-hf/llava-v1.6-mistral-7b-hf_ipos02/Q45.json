    "**Aerodynamic Design**: Improve the fan's aerodynamics by incorporating streamlined blades that move more efficiently through the air, reducing energy consumption and noise levels.",
    "**Integrated Lighting**: Incorporate LED lights into the fan's design, providing ambient lighting while the fan is in operation. This would make the fan a multifunctional lighting source, reducing the need for additional lamps.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Option**: Develop an eco-friendly version of the fan that uses sustainable materials and consumes less energy. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Noise Reduction**: Introduce sound-dampening technology to the fan's design, reducing the noise it makes when in operation. This would be particularly useful in offices or bedrooms where noise is a concern.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Combine the fan with an air purifier, using the fan's motion to draw air through a filtration system, improving indoor air quality."
