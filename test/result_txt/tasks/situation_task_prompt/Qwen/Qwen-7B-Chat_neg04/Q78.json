    "Create a world of make-believe: Without toys, children could use their imagination to create their own worlds and characters. They could build forts out of blankets, dress up in clothes they've found around the house, or act out stories they've made up.",
    "Use natural objects as toys: Children could explore nature and use items like sticks, rocks, leaves, and flowers as toys. This would encourage them to spend more time outside and learn about the environment around them.",
    "Play games: Children could come up with their own games using household items such as cards, blocks, or even their bodies. For example, they could play hide-and-seek by covering themselves with sheets or pillows, or play tag by running around the house.",
    "Create art: Children could use everyday materials such as paper, markers, and glue to create their own artwork. This would allow them to express their creativity and develop their fine motor skills.",
    "Practice problem-solving: Without toys, children would have to find ways to entertain themselves without relying on pre-made products. This could help them develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. For example, they could use cardboard boxes to build structures, or use rocks and sticks to create obstacle courses."
