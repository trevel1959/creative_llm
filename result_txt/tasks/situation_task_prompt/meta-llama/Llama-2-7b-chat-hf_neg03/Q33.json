    "Nature's Rhythm: Harness the natural rhythm of the environment to keep track of time. For instance, the rising and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, or the tides could be used as a natural clock. People could learn to read the signs and patterns in nature to measure time.",
    "Memory Mnemonics: Develop a complex mnemonic device that associates specific memories or images with different time intervals. For example, a person could create a mental image of a sunflower for every hour, a butterfly for every half-hour, or a specific smell for every 15 minutes. Each time the associated memory or image is recalled, the time would be recalled as well.",
    "Gestures and Movements: Create a system of hand gestures or body movements that represent different time intervals. For instance, a person could use a specific hand gesture to represent every hour, a different gesture for every half-hour, or a specific dance move for every 15 minutes. These gestures could be used to communicate time to others or to oneself.",
    "Music and Rhythm: Develop a musical scale or rhythm that is tied to time intervals. For example, a person could create a song with 12 different notes, each representing a different hour of the day. As the song is played, the listener could use the rhythm and melody to keep track of time.",
    "Time-Telling Art: Create a form of art that incorporates timekeeping. For example, a person could create a painting that represents different time intervals through the use of color, shape, or texture. Each element in the painting could represent a specific time interval, and the viewer could use the artwork to keep track of time."
