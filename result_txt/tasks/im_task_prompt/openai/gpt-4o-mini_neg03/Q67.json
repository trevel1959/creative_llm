    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: To enhance comfort during long painting sessions, the paintbrush could feature an ergonomic design with a grip that adjusts based on the user’s hand size and grip style. This could include soft, textured materials for better handling and a shape that reduces strain on the wrist, making it easier to create detailed work without fatigue.",
    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Instead of a single brush type, this paintbrush could come with interchangeable heads for different techniques—flat, round, fan, and detail brushes could be included. Users could easily switch heads for different effects, allowing for more versatility in their painting style without needing to buy multiple brushes.",
    "**Built-in Water Reservoir**: For watercolor artists, a paintbrush that includes a built-in water reservoir could be a game changer. This would allow artists to control the flow of water directly from the brush, enabling smoother transitions and blending without the need for a separate water container. A simple squeeze mechanism could regulate the water release for optimal control.",
    "**LED Light Feature for Precision**: A paintbrush with a built-in LED light could illuminate the workspace, especially useful for artists who work in dimly lit environments or require precision in their details. The light could be adjustable in brightness and color temperature, allowing artists to choose the best lighting for their specific needs.",
    "**Digital Feedback System**: Imagine a paintbrush that connects to a digital device to provide real-time feedback on technique and pressure applied. This could help artists refine their skills by giving tips on brush strokes, suggesting areas that need more work, or even offering tutorials based on the artist's style and progress."
