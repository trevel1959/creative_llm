    "**Human-Powered Vehicles**: If all bicycles were suddenly gone, humans could potentially invent new types of human-powered vehicles. This could include devices like pedal-powered unicycles, tricycles, or even larger contraptions that could carry multiple people. These vehicles could be made from recycled materials and designed for various terrains.",
    "**Vertical Transportation Systems**: Since bicycles are not practical for long distances, an alternative system could involve vertical transportation like elevators or a new form of personal aerial lift. People could be transported vertically in pods that descend to different levels of a city, significantly reducing the need for horizontal travel.",
    "**Innovative Footwear**: In a world without bicycles, footwear design could drastically change. Shoes might incorporate wheels, similar to the concept of \"rolling shoes\" or \"shoe-skates\". These could be worn on flat surfaces like sidewalks, allowing individuals to move faster than walking alone but not as fast as running.",
    "**Collaborative Walking Communities**: Without bicycles, communities could develop new ways to facilitate group movement. For example, a system where people walk in groups, taking turns leading and following. This could encourage social interaction and provide a sense of community while also making large-scale movement possible.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation and Tools**: Technology could play a significant role in helping people navigate without bicycles. Wearable devices or AR glasses could provide real-time directions, optimize routes based on pedestrian traffic, and even suggest alternative modes of transportation when needed, such as public transit or walking."
