    "**Decentralized Commune System**: This government structure emphasizes local autonomy and self-governance. The country would be divided into small, self-sufficient communes that operate independently but are interconnected through a federation. Each commune would have its own council elected by the residents, making decisions on local issues like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Larger issues would be addressed at the federation level, where representatives from each commune collaborate. This model promotes local culture, reduces bureaucracy, and encourages innovation tailored to the specific needs of each community.",
    "**Eco-Socialist Cooperative Governance**: In this model, the government would be structured around eco-socialist principles, emphasizing sustainability, social equity, and cooperative ownership. Citizens would form cooperatives that manage resources, businesses, and services. Each cooperative would be governed democratically by its members, who would elect representatives to a central council that coordinates efforts across cooperatives. Policies would focus on environmental stewardship, equitable resource distribution, and community welfare. This government would prioritize long-term ecological health and social justice, integrating environmental concerns into all decision-making processes.",
    "**Blockchain Democracy**: Utilizing blockchain technology, this government model would create a secure, transparent, and decentralized voting system. Citizens would have digital identities linked to a blockchain ledger, allowing them to participate in direct democracy by voting on laws and policies in real-time. This model would minimize corruption and ensure accountability, as every vote and decision would be recorded immutably. Additionally, citizens could propose legislation through a decentralized app, allowing for a more engaged and responsive government. Regular audits and community forums would ensure transparency and public trust.",
    "**Civic Lottery Government**: In this innovative model, government representatives would be selected through a lottery system from a pool of eligible citizens. This would replace traditional elections, aiming to eliminate the influence of money in politics and ensure a diverse representation of voices. Selected individuals would serve for limited terms and receive training in governance, policy-making, and civic responsibility. This model encourages civic engagement, as citizens would be more likely to participate in governance when they know they could be randomly selected to serve. Community councils would provide a platform for ongoing public input and deliberation on key issues.",
    "**Holocratic Governance**: This model is inspired by the principles of holacracy, where authority and decision-making are distributed throughout the organization rather than being centralized. The government would be structured into self-organizing teams, each responsible for specific functions (e.g., education, health, infrastructure). Each team would have the autonomy to make decisions and adapt to local needs while remaining aligned with the broader goals of the government. Regular cross-team meetings would ensure collaboration and coherence. This approach fosters innovation, agility, and responsiveness to the needs of citizens."
