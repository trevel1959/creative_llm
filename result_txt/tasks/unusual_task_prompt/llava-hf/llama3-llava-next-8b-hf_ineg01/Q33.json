    "Pest Control: Sponges can be used as a natural pest repellent. Soak a sponge in hot water and then freeze it. Once frozen, the sponge can be placed in areas where pests are a problem. The hot water will release steam, which can deter pests from the area.",
    "Cleaning Tool: A sponge can be used as a cleaning tool for small crevices and tight spaces. Dip the sponge in warm soapy water, wring it out, and use it to clean hard-to-reach areas such as the inside of a sink, between keys on a keyboard, or behind appliances.",
    "Plaything: Sponges can be used as a creative plaything for children. Cut sponges into various shapes and sizes, and let children use them to create their own imaginative play scenarios.",
    "Absorbent Barrier: Sponges can be used as an absorbent barrier in the garden. Place a sponge around the base of a plant to help retain moisture and reduce the need for frequent watering. The sponge will slowly release water as the soil dries out, providing a consistent moisture level."
