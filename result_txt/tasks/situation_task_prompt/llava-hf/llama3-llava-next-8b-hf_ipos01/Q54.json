    "Magnetic levitation boats: Develop boats that use magnetic levitation technology to glide across the water's surface without the need for propellers or rudders. These boats would be powered by electric motors and could be steered using a joystick or a touchpad.",
    "Seabed trains: Build a network of high-speed trains that run on tracks laid on the seabed. These trains would be designed to withstand the water pressure and would use advanced engineering to minimize the impact on marine ecosystems.",
    "Underwater tunnel: Construct an underwater tunnel that connects two land masses separated by a large body of water. This would allow for a direct, land-based transportation route without the need for ships or boats.",
    "Hovercraft: Develop a hovercraft that uses a combination of magnetic levitation and advanced aerodynamics to travel across water at high speeds. These vehicles would be powered by electric motors and could be steered using a joystick or a touchpad.",
    "Water-to-aircraft transition vehicles: Design a vehicle that can transition from water to air, allowing for both sea and air travel. This vehicle would use retractable wings and a retractable hull to achieve this capability."
