    "Personalized alarms: Introduce a feature that allows users to create custom alarms with their own voice, music, or even a personalized message. This would give users more control over their wake-up experience and make it more enjoyable.",
    "Smart alarm technology: Develop an alarm clock that can detect the user's sleep patterns and wake them up during their lightest sleep phase. This would ensure that users wake up feeling more refreshed and energized.",
    "Multi-functional design: Design an alarm clock that serves as a charging station for mobile devices, a display for weather forecasts, or even a small speaker for streaming music. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices in the bedroom and make the alarm clock more functional.",
    "Voice control: Develop an alarm clock that can be controlled using voice commands, allowing users to set alarms, snooze, or turn off the alarm with ease. This would be especially helpful for people who are too tired to physically interact with the alarm clock in the morning.",
    "Virtual reality alarm: Create an alarm clock that immerses users in a virtual reality environment, such as a peaceful beach or a mountain landscape, to help them wake up feeling more refreshed and energized."
