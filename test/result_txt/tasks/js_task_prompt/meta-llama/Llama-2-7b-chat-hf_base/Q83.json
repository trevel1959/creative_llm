    "A 24-hour day to accommodate a diverse circadian rhythm:  recognizing that people have different circadian rhythms, I would choose a 24-hour day to accommodate individuals who are naturally more productive at night.

    "A 28-hour day to reduce stress and improve mental health:  recognizing the impact of stress on mental health, I would choose a 28-hour day to reduce the pressure of a traditional 24-hour day.
