    "DIY Fire-Proof Shield: Create a DIY fire-proof shield using materials like sand, clay, and water. Mix these materials with a binder like sawdust or straw to create a thick, impenetrable barrier around your home. This shield will protect your home from direct flame contact and slow down the spread of fire.",
    "Hydrogen Peroxide Fire Suppressant: Hydrogen peroxide is a non-toxic and non-corrosive fire suppressant that can be used to extinguish fires. Mix equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and water in a spray bottle and use it to spray the fire. The hydrogen peroxide will break down the fire's fuel source, starving it of oxygen and extinguishing the flames.",
    "Fire-Resistant Landscaping: Plant fire-resistant plants like succulents, cacti, and bushes around your home. These plants have thick, waxy leaves that can withstand high temperatures and slow down the spread of fire. Additionally, create a fire break by clearing any flammable vegetation within a 30-foot radius of your home.",
    "Solar-Powered Fire Alarm: Create a solar-powered fire alarm using a solar panel, a battery, and a smoke detector. When smoke is detected, the alarm will sound, alerting you to the presence of fire. This will allow you to take action before the fire spreads and causes significant damage.",
    "Fire-Proof Insulation: Use fire-proof insulation materials like silica aerogel or ceramic blankets to line your home's walls and roof. These materials have a high thermal insulation value, which means they can withstand high temperatures without melting or losing their insulation properties. This will help protect your home from the heat of a fire and slow down its spread."
