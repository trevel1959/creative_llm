    "**Modular Wheelchair Design**:    A modular wheelchair that allows users to customize and modify different components based on their needs and preferences. For example, users could swap out the seat for one with better cushioning, change the armrests for ones that fit their posture, or even add attachments like a small table or a cup holder. This design would cater to individual comfort and functional needs, making the wheelchair a more personalized experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wheelchair**:    Develop a wheelchair made from sustainable materials, such as recycled aluminum or bioplastics. Additionally, integrate solar panels into the design to power electronic components like lights, a horn, or a small cooling fan. This eco-friendly approach would not only reduce the carbon footprint of wheelchair manufacturing but also promote environmental consciousness among users.",
    "**All-Terrain Wheelchair**:    Create a wheelchair with advanced suspension and all-terrain wheels that can handle various surfaces, from grass to gravel to snow. The design would include adjustable height and width settings to ensure stability and comfort on uneven ground. This would enable users to explore parks, beaches, and other outdoor environments that are typically inaccessible with standard wheelchairs.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**:    Incorporate a health monitoring system into the wheelchair that tracks vital signs like heart rate, oxygen levels, and posture. The system could provide real-time feedback to the user and alert caregivers in case of abnormalities. This feature would be especially beneficial for users with medical conditions that require constant monitoring, allowing for proactive health management.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training and Rehabilitation**:    Develop a wheelchair that integrates with virtual reality (VR) technology for training and rehabilitation purposes. Users could practice maneuvering in different environments through VR simulations, which could help improve their skills and confidence. Additionally, the wheelchair could be equipped with sensors to analyze movement and provide feedback, helping users to enhance their mobility and strength over time."
