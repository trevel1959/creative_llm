    "Create a network of pollinator-friendly communities: Encourage individuals to create their own pollinator-friendly gardens and connect them through a community-based initiative. This would create a network of interconnected gardens that would provide a habitat for pollinators. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Develop a drone-based pollination system: Design and build drones that can pollinate plants by transferring pollen from one flower to another. This could be especially useful for crops that are difficult to reach or for areas with low pollinator populations. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Utilize artificial pollinators: Create artificial pollinators, such as robotic bees or butterflies, that can mimic the behavior of real pollinators. These artificial pollinators could be used to pollinate plants in areas where real pollinators are scarce or absent. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Use light to pollinate plants: Develop a light-based pollination system that uses ultraviolet light to stimulate pollination. This could involve using LED lights to emit ultraviolet light in areas where pollinators are scarce or using mirrors to focus sunlight onto specific areas of plants. (Confidence Score: 0.7)",
    "Promote pollinator-friendly agriculture: Encourage farmers to adopt pollinator-friendly agricultural practices, such as planting a diverse range of crops and avoiding the use of pesticides that can harm pollinators. This could help to increase the number of pollinators in the area and improve the overall health of the ecosystem. (Confidence Score: 0.6)"
