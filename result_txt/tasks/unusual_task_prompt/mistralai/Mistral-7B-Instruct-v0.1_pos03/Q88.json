    "TECH: Create a tissue box that uses AI to predict how many tissues will be needed in a household based on the number of people living there, their habits, and the time of year. The tissue box would then automatically order more tissues when it runs low.",
    "ECO-FRIENDLY: Design a tissue box made entirely from recycled materials, including the box itself and the tissues inside. The box would also have a compartment for used tissues to be disposed of in an eco-friendly way.",
    "STYLISH: Create a tissue box that doubles as a decorative item for the home. The box could be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, or glass, and could be designed with intricate patterns or designs.",
    "SMART: Develop a tissue box that is equipped with sensors and can be controlled via a smartphone app. Users could set the box to dispense a certain number of tissues at a time, or they could set it to automatically dispense tissues when they approach.",
    "INNOVATIVE: Create a tissue box that uses a unique dispensing mechanism, such as a touchless system that uses sensors to detect when a tissue is needed and dispenses it automatically, or a box that uses a built-in fan to blow tissues out of the box."
