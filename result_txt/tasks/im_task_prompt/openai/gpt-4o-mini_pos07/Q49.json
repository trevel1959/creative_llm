    "**Customizable Brushing Modes via App**:    Develop a companion app that allows users to customize their brushing experience. Users could select different modes tailored to their needs, such as \"sensitive,\" \"whitening,\" or \"gum care.\" The app could also track brushing habits, suggest improvements, and offer rewards for consistent use, gamifying dental hygiene.",
    "**Replaceable Brush Heads with Integrated Sensors**:    Design brush heads that come with integrated sensors to monitor bristle wear and effectiveness. These brush heads could connect to the toothbrush or app to alert users when itâ€™s time to replace them. This would ensure optimal brushing performance and hygiene, as well as encourage regular maintenance.",
    "**UV Sanitizing Charging Base**:    Create a charging base for the electric toothbrush that incorporates UV-C light technology to sanitize the brush head while it charges. This would help eliminate bacteria and germs that can accumulate on the brush, promoting better oral health and hygiene for users.",
    "**Built-in Water Flosser Feature**:    Innovate the electric toothbrush by integrating a water flosser into the design. Users could switch between brushing and flossing modes, allowing them to achieve a more comprehensive cleaning routine without needing multiple devices. This all-in-one approach would save space and time.",
    "**AI-Powered Brushing Assistant**:    Implement an AI-powered assistant within the toothbrush that provides real-time guidance on brushing technique and duration. Using sensors to detect motion and pressure, the assistant could offer personalized tips and reminders, ensuring users brush effectively and thoroughly."
