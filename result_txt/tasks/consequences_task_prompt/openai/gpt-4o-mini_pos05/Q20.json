    "**Economic Collapse**: The global economy is heavily dependent on electronic systems for transactions, banking, and stock exchanges. With devices failing, financial markets would crash, and people would be unable to access their funds. Businesses would face immediate cash flow problems, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies. This could spiral into a recession or depression, as consumer confidence plummets and trade halts. The impact on small businesses could be particularly devastating, as many rely on digital platforms for sales and marketing.",
    "**Loss of Data and Knowledge**: The sudden halt of electronic devices would lead to a catastrophic loss of data. Billions of documents, research findings, and creative works stored digitally would become inaccessible, erasing years of knowledge and progress. Educational institutions would struggle to teach without digital resources, and students would lose access to online learning tools. This would create a significant setback in education and innovation, as society would need to find ways to recover and restore lost information.",
    "**Health Crisis**: The healthcare sector relies heavily on electronic devices for patient care, diagnostics, and record-keeping. The sudden loss of these systems could lead to disastrous consequences, including the inability to access patient records, schedule appointments, or communicate vital information among healthcare providers. Medical equipment that relies on electricity, such as ventilators and monitors, would become non-functional, potentially leading to a public health crisis. Emergency medical services would also be severely hampered, putting lives at risk.",
    "**Social Unrest and Security Issues**: The abrupt cessation of electronic devices could trigger social unrest as people grapple with the sudden loss of connectivity and information. Misinformation could spread rapidly in the absence of reliable news sources, leading to confusion and fear. As people struggle to adapt to a pre-digital lifestyle, issues of resource scarcity could arise, prompting hoarding and conflicts over essential goods. Law enforcement would face challenges in maintaining order, and the potential for crime could increase as security systems fail.",
    "**Return to Analog Living**: While the immediate consequences would be dire, society might also experience a unique shift towards analog living. People would need to rediscover traditional methods of communication, such as face-to-face interactions, handwritten letters, and physical newspapers. This could lead to a renaissance of local communities as individuals come together to share resources and knowledge. Skills like gardening, cooking, and crafting could gain renewed importance, fostering a sense of self-sufficiency and resilience."
