    "Solar-Powered Umbrellas: Design umbrellas with built-in solar panels that can harness energy from the sun's rays even when the sky is cloudy. These umbrellas could power small devices like smartphones, fitness trackers, or even charge electric cars.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a lighting system that uses cloudy skies as a natural source of illumination. Specialized LEDs or OLEDs could be installed in buildings, streets, or public spaces, which would absorb and reflect the diffused light from the clouds, providing a soft, ambient glow.",
    "Sky Mirrors: Create a network of mirrors strategically placed in the sky to reflect sunlight towards the ground. These mirrors could be made of thin, flexible materials like plastic or metal, and could be deployed from drones or airships. This would allow for a more even distribution of sunlight, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Adaptive Windows: Design windows that can change their tint and transparency in response to the amount of sunlight available. These windows could use a special coating that darkens in cloudy weather, allowing more light to enter when the sun is shining, and blocking out UV rays when it's cloudy.",
    "Cloud-Harvesting Drones: Develop small, autonomous drones that can fly through the clouds and collect water droplets, which could then be used as a source of fresh water. These drones could be equipped with specialized filters to remove impurities, making the collected water safe for consumption."
