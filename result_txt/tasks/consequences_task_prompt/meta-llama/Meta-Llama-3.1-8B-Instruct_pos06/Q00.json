    "**Sleep-Deprivation Epidemic**: Without sleep, humans would experience severe cognitive impairment, leading to a significant decline in productivity, decision-making abilities, and overall quality of life. This would result in a global economic downturn, as people would struggle to perform even the simplest tasks. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Social Chaos and Conflict**: The loss of sleep would lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and aggression, causing social relationships to deteriorate rapidly. Communities would be plagued by violence, and governments would struggle to maintain order. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Physical Health Crisis**: Prolonged sleep deprivation would lead to a massive increase in chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. The human body would be unable to repair and regenerate itself, leading to a catastrophic decline in overall health. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptation**: Without sleep, humans might undergo a rapid evolutionary adaptation, where the brain and body adapt to function on minimal rest. This could lead to a new human subspecies, with unique physiological and cognitive traits. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Neurological Breakdown**: The brain would struggle to process and consolidate memories, leading to a breakdown in cognitive function. This could result in a loss of creativity, problem-solving abilities, and even language skills, potentially leading to a new form of human \"stupidity.\" (Confidence: 0.95)"
