    "Smart Steering Wheel: Develop a smart steering wheel that utilizes sensors and AI to detect driver fatigue and provide real-time feedback to prevent accidents. The wheel could also offer personalized driving suggestions, such as avoiding traffic jams or taking alternative routes, based on the driver's preferences and past driving habits.",
    "Interactive Steering Wheel: Design a steering wheel that incorporates a touch-sensitive display, allowing drivers to access and control various in-car features without taking their hands off the wheel. This could include adjusting the climate control, changing music tracks, or using voice commands to make phone calls or send messages.",
    "Customizable Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that can be customized to fit each driver's grip and preferences. The wheel could be made of a flexible, ergonomic material and feature adjustable buttons and controls to accommodate different hand sizes and driving styles.",
    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Entertainment: Develop a steering wheel that incorporates a built-in display and speakers, allowing drivers to watch videos, play games, or listen to music without having to use a separate infotainment system. The display could be hidden when not in use to reduce distractions while driving.",
    "Motion-Sensing Steering Wheel: Design a steering wheel that uses motion sensors to detect the driver's hand movements and adjust the steering accordingly. This could help drivers with mobility or dexterity issues, such as those with arthritis or paralysis, to drive more comfortably and safely. The wheel could also offer personalized driving experiences, such as adjusting the steering resistance based on the driver's preferred level of difficulty."
