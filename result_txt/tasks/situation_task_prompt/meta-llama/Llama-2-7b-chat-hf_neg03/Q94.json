    "Immersive Virtual Reality Cinemas: With the disappearance of traditional cinemas, people could turn to immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. VR headsets and technology could allow viewers to step into the world of their favorite movies and TV shows, becoming a part of the action. For example, a group of friends could watch a horror movie together in a haunted house environment, or a couple could watch a romantic comedy in a virtual beach setting.",

Platforms like these could offer a range of features, such as choose-your-own-adventure style narratives, virtual reality experiences, and social media integration. Users could create and share their own stories, and connect with others who share similar interests.",
    "Mobile Cinematic Experiences: With the rise of mobile devices, people could turn to mobile cinematic experiences that offer a more portable and accessible alternative to traditional cinemas. This could include mobile apps that offer streaming services for movies and TV shows, as well as augmented reality experiences that bring the action to life in the user's living room.",
    "Community-driven Storytelling: In a world without cinemas, people could turn to community-driven storytelling platforms that allow them to collaborate on creating and sharing stories. These platforms could offer features such as crowdsourced funding, co-writing tools, and social media integration. Users could work together to create and share their own stories, and connect with others who share similar interests.",
    "Pop-up Outdoor Cinemas: In the absence of traditional cinemas, people could turn to pop-up outdoor cinemas that bring the movie experience to public spaces.
