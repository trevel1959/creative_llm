    "Improved quality of life: If diseases were completely eradicated, individuals would be able to live without the physical and emotional pain caused by illness. They would be able to enjoy life to the fullest and pursue their goals unhampered by illness.",
    "Reduced healthcare costs: The reduction or elimination of chronic illness would mean a decrease in the demand for healthcare services. This would result in a reduction in healthcare costs, which could be channeled into better healthcare infrastructure, facilities and new innovations.",
    "Population explosion: With increased life expectancy, the population will inevitably increase. This rapid and significant population growth could strain resources and put pressure on the environment, and thus may also bring about its own set of challenges.",
    "Increased research interest: Although all disease have been cured, there will be new areas of research and innovation not related to disease. For instance, the study of aging, improving mental health, nutrition and other aspects of overall well-being will become more prominent.",
    "Altered life expectancy patterns: If some diseases were not cured and others were, this could affect life expectancy patterns in societies. For example, if a region has a high prevalence of a certain disease that cannot be cured, life expectancy may be lower in that region."
