    "**Life Support Systems**: A significant issue is creating a sustainable life support system that can maintain a habitable environment for astronauts over extended periods. This includes recycling air and water, managing waste, and providing food. Engineers need to design systems that are efficient, reliable, and require minimal maintenance, while also being capable of functioning in the closed environment of a spaceship where resources are limited.",
    "**Propulsion Efficiency**: Developing an effective propulsion system is essential for interstellar travel. Traditional rocket propulsion may not be sufficient for long-duration missions, and alternative methods, such as ion propulsion or nuclear thermal propulsion, must be considered. The challenge lies in ensuring that the propulsion system is not only efficient in terms of fuel consumption but also capable of providing the necessary thrust to escape Earthâ€™s gravity and navigate through space.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: Spacecraft navigation presents unique challenges due to the vast distances involved and the lack of immediate feedback from Earth. The design must incorporate advanced navigation systems that can function autonomously, utilizing star trackers and gyroscopes. Additionally, communication systems must be robust enough to handle the time delays in sending signals back to Earth, as well as interference from cosmic radiation.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Spacecraft are exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation, which can pose serious health risks to astronauts. A significant design problem is how to shield the spacecraft effectively without adding excessive weight. Solutions may include using specialized materials, creating dedicated shielded areas within the ship, or employing magnetic fields to deflect radiation.",
    "**Psychological Well-being of Crew**: Long-duration space missions can take a toll on the mental health of the crew due to isolation, confinement, and distance from Earth. Designers must incorporate features that promote psychological well-being, such as recreational areas, virtual reality environments, and regular communication with loved ones back home. Creating a comfortable living space that allows for personal privacy and relaxation is crucial."
