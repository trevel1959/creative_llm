    "The Truth Booth: Create a booth where people can step in and be compelled to tell the truth about any topic they desire. The booth could be disguised as a ordinary kiosk or a fun, futuristic-looking pod. When someone steps in, they'll be enveloped in a warm, cozy light and hear a soothing voice guiding them through the process. The booth could be equipped with a facial recognition system to ensure the person is telling the truth, and the truth could be displayed on a large screen for all to see.",
    "Truth-Telling App: Develop an app that uses AI to detect lies and encourage people to tell the truth. The app could use machine learning algorithms to analyze a person's speech patterns, facial expressions, and body language to determine if they're being truthful. If the app detects a lie, it could send a gentle reminder to the user to tell the truth, and offer incentives for being honest.",
    "Truth Serum Cafe: Create a cozy cafe where people can come and drink a special \"truth serum\" coffee that will make them compelled to tell the truth.

Customers could share their experiences and insights with each other, creating a supportive community where truth and honesty are valued.",
