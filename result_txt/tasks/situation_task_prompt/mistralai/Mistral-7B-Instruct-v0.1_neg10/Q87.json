    "Invent a new cutting tool: Create a new cutting device that can be used in place of scissors and knives. It could be a combination of a saw and a brush, or a device that uses ultrasonic waves to cut through materials.",
    "Use alternative materials: If scissors and knives are no longer available, we may need to find alternative materials to cut with. This could include using natural materials like wood or stone, or finding a new material that can be used for cutting.",
    "Find new ways to cut: There may be other methods of cutting that we haven't considered before. For example, we could use a heat source to melt or vaporize materials, or use a friction-based tool to cut through materials.",
    "Use existing tools in new ways: We may be able to use existing tools in new ways to cut things. For example, we could use a drill or a saw to cut through materials, or use a screwdriver or a hammer to break materials apart.",
    "Develop new cutting techniques: We could develop new cutting techniques that don't rely on scissors or knives. For example, we could use a cutting board or a cutting board with teeth to cut through materials, or use a knife-like tool that is made of a different material."
