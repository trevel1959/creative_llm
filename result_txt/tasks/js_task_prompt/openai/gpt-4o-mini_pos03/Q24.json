    "**Smart Mobility Network**:    The city would feature a comprehensive smart mobility network that includes autonomous electric vehicles, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly pathways. Real-time data analytics would manage traffic flow, reducing congestion and emissions. Electric shuttles would connect neighborhoods, while dedicated lanes for cyclists and pedestrians would encourage eco-friendly transportation. The integration of augmented reality (AR) apps would guide users to their destinations and provide information about nearby amenities.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Hubs**:    These hubs would be strategically placed throughout the city to promote cultural diversity and inclusivity. Each hub would host rotating exhibits, performances, and workshops showcasing various cultures, art forms, and traditions. Residents could participate in language exchange programs, cooking classes, and artisan workshops, fostering a sense of belonging and understanding among diverse communities. These spaces would also double as community gathering points, equipped with green spaces and local food vendors.",
    "**Decentralized Energy Grid**:    The city would operate on a decentralized energy grid powered by renewable sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy. Each neighborhood would have its own microgrid, allowing residents to produce and share energy locally. Smart meters would monitor energy consumption, and excess energy could be sold back to the grid, incentivizing energy conservation. Community energy co-ops could be formed, promoting collective ownership and management of renewable resources.",
    "**Interactive Urban Art Installations**:    Art would be integrated into the urban landscape through interactive installations that engage residents and visitors. From augmented reality murals that tell the city's history to kinetic sculptures that respond to weather conditions, these installations would create a dynamic and immersive experience. Workshops would allow local artists to collaborate with the community, fostering creativity and a sense of ownership over public spaces.",
    "**Health and Wellness Corridors**:    Designated corridors throughout the city would prioritize health and wellness, featuring outdoor gyms, meditation gardens, and wellness centers. These corridors would promote physical activity and mental well-being, with access to fitness classes, yoga sessions, and nutritional workshops. The integration of biophilic design—bringing nature into urban environments—would create calming spaces that encourage relaxation and social interaction."
