    "Solar-Powered Clouds: Develop a new type of cloud that can harness sunlight and convert it into energy. These clouds would have special properties that allow them to absorb and store solar energy, which could then be distributed to the ground via a network of energy-transfer devices.",
    "Cloud Reflectors: Create a series of mirrors or reflective surfaces that could be deployed in the sky to reflect sunlight towards the ground. These mirrors could be made from lightweight, durable materials and could be strategically positioned to maximize the amount of sunlight reaching the ground.",
    "Sunlight-Emitting Buildings: Design buildings that can generate and emit sunlight. These buildings could use advanced photovoltaic technology to convert sunlight into electricity, which could then be used to power homes, businesses, and other structures. The excess energy could be stored in batteries or fed back into the grid.",
    "Cloud-Based Energy Harvesting: Develop a system that can harness the kinetic energy of clouds. By attaching specialized devices to clouds, such as tethers or kites, the energy generated by cloud movement could be converted into electricity. This energy could then be stored and distributed to the ground.",
    "Heliostat-Based Solar Power: Create a network of heliostats, large mirrors that can focus sunlight onto a small area. These heliostats could be positioned in strategic locations to maximize sunlight exposure, and the concentrated sunlight could be used to power a nearby energy-generating facility. The excess energy could be stored and distributed to the surrounding area."
