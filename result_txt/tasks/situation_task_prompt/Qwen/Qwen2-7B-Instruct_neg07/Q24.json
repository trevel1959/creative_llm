    "**Augmented Reality Glasses**: The concept of AR (Augmented Reality) glasses can be utilized to assist those with poor vision. These glasses could overlay a digital layer on the real world, displaying text-to-speech or visual descriptions of objects, places, and directions. For instance, when a person points the glasses at an unfamiliar street, the name of the street or nearby landmarks could be displayed in a clear font. This solution not only compensates for the absence of traditional glasses or contacts but also enhances the user's navigation abilities.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Smart contact lenses could be developed that incorporate tiny sensors and micro-LEDs to project a digital overlay onto the wearer's field of vision. These lenses could adjust their projection based on the user's visual needs and the surrounding environment, providing real-time information such as the text on a sign or the name of a plant. Additionally, these lenses could monitor eye health and alert the user if there are any issues.",
    "**Enhanced Vision Wearable Devices**: A wearable device that can be attached to the head could serve as an alternative. This device might use a combination of cameras, AI algorithms, and high-resolution displays to enhance visual perception. It could analyze the visual input, improve clarity, and highlight important details. This would allow users to perceive the world around them more clearly without relying on traditional glasses or contacts.",
    "**AI-Powered Voice Recognition and Navigation Systems**: For individuals who cannot see well enough to use the aforementioned technologies, an AI-powered voice recognition system could be employed. This system would be trained to recognize and describe the environment, objects, and people. It could provide verbal feedback about surroundings, helping the user navigate and interact with their environment safely. The system could be integrated into existing devices like smartphones or smart home systems.",
    "**Community and Social Support Programs**: In the absence of glasses or contacts, it is crucial to establish robust community support networks. These programs could include training workshops on Braille reading, orientation and mobility skills, and the use of tactile devices. Additionally, the creation of apps and online platforms where visually impaired individuals can share tips, resources, and experiences could foster a sense of community and empower them with the knowledge to adapt to their situation. This approach not only addresses the immediate need but also promotes independence and resilience among affected individuals."
