    "**Innovative Augmented Reality (AR) Technology**: Develop an advanced AR system that allows visually impaired individuals to see their surroundings in a more manageable format. The device could project 3D holograms of the environment, providing tactile feedback and visual cues that help users navigate safely and perform tasks effectively.",
    "**Enhanced Braille Innovations**: Create new forms of braille that incorporate elements of sound and touch. For instance, the letters could be embossed with unique textures or embedded with tiny, vibrating motors that produce different sensations for each letter, allowing for faster and more intuitive reading.",
    "**Smart Sensory Clothing**: Design a line of clothes that incorporates various sensors and haptic feedback technology to assist visually impaired individuals. For example, clothing could have built-in vibrations to alert the wearer when they approach obstacles or change directions while walking, helping them maintain balance and navigate more easily.",
    "**AI-Assisted Audio Navigation System**: Develop an AI-driven audio navigation app that guides visually impaired individuals through their daily activities. The app could analyze the user's environment, identify objects, and provide voice commands and descriptions to facilitate tasks such as cooking, cleaning, or organizing spaces.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training Environments**: Create immersive VR environments where individuals can practice essential skills in a safe, controlled setting. These environments could simulate various real-life scenarios, allowing users to learn and improve their spatial awareness, decision-making, and other critical abilities without the risk associated with traditional learning methods."
