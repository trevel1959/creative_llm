    "Once upon a time, in a lush green pond, there lived a little frog named Ferdinand. Tired of his slimy skin and croaky voice, he longed to be a dashing prince. One moonlit night, he stumbled upon a wise old turtle who offered him a chance. \"Speak your wish, and it shall be granted,\" she said. With a hopeful heart, Ferdinand croaked, \"I wish to be a prince!\" In a flash of light, he transformed into a handsome prince. However, he soon realized that royal duties were exhausting. Yearning for simplicity, Ferdinand returned to the pond, embracing his froggy life once more.",
