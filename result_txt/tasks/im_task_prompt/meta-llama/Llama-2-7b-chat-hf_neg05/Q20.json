    "Coffee maker with a twist: Create a coffee maker that not only brews a perfect cup of coffee but also incorporates a unique twist to make it stand out. For example, a coffee maker that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker, allowing users to stream their favorite tunes while they brew. Or a coffee maker that uses aromatherapy to enhance the coffee-drinking experience.",
    "Smart coffee maker: Develop a coffee maker that can connect to a user's smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This coffee maker can learn the user's coffee preferences and automatically adjust the brewing settings to create the perfect cup of coffee every time. It can also be programmed to brew coffee at specific times of the day, ensuring that the user wakes up to a freshly brewed cup of coffee.",
    "Coffee maker with a built-in grinder: Design a coffee maker that has a built-in grinder, eliminating the need for a separate grinder. This coffee maker would grind the beans on demand, ensuring that the coffee is always freshly ground and of the highest quality. It would also save space and make the coffee-making process more convenient.",
    "Automatic coffee maker: Create a coffee maker that can automatically measure and pour the perfect amount of coffee, milk, and sugar for each cup. This coffee maker would use sensors to detect the type of coffee cup being used and adjust the brewing settings accordingly. It would also have a built-in milk frother, allowing users to create their favorite coffee drinks with ease.",
    "Customizable coffee maker: Design a coffee maker that allows users to customize their coffee-drinking experience. This coffee maker would have interchangeable parts, such as different brewing chambers, grinders, and frothers, allowing users to experiment with different coffee flavors and styles. It would also have a built-in coffee-tasting app, allowing users to identify and track their favorite coffee flavors."
