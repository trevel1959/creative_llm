    "**Multi-Function Stapler**: Design a stapler that combines multiple office tools into one device. This stapler could also function as a paper cutter, hole puncher, and even a mini shredder for sensitive documents. By consolidating these functions, users can save space on their desks and streamline their office supplies, making it easier to handle various tasks without needing multiple tools.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: Create a stapler with an ergonomic design that includes an adjustable grip to accommodate different hand sizes and strengths. The stapler could feature a soft, cushioned handle and a mechanism that adjusts the resistance needed to press down, making it easier for individuals with limited hand strength or arthritis to use it comfortably.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Reusable Staples**: Develop a stapler that uses reusable staples made from biodegradable materials. This stapler would allow users to staple papers together without creating waste. After use, the staples could be easily removed and reused, or the materials could break down naturally, promoting sustainability in the office environment.",
    "**Color-Coding Stapler**: Introduce a stapler that comes with interchangeable colored staple cartridges. This would allow users to color-code their documents based on categories or priorities. For example, red staples could indicate urgent documents, while blue staples could signify completed tasks. This visual organization system could enhance productivity and help users manage their paperwork more effectively.",
    "**Self-Loading Stapler**: Create a stapler that automatically loads staples when they run low. This could be achieved through a small internal mechanism that senses when staples are almost depleted and uses a built-in cartridge to refill itself. Users would no longer need to worry about manually loading staples, making the stapling process seamless and efficient."
