    "**Gesture Control Integration**: Incorporate gesture control technology into the mouse. By adding a touch-sensitive surface on the top of the mouse, users could perform specific gestures (like swiping or tapping) to execute commands or shortcuts. This would allow for more fluid navigation and multitasking, as users could control applications without having to click buttons, enhancing efficiency.",
    "**Built-in Virtual Assistant**: Equip the mouse with a small microphone and speaker, allowing it to function as a virtual assistant. Users could give voice commands to perform tasks like searching the web, setting reminders, or controlling smart home devices. This integration would create a seamless experience, combining physical navigation with voice-activated assistance.",
    "**Customizable LED Feedback**: Introduce a customizable LED lighting system that provides visual feedback based on user actions. For example, the mouse could change colors when switching between applications, or flash to indicate low battery. Users could program different color schemes for various tasks, enhancing the overall user experience and making the mouse more interactive.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular mouse with interchangeable components. Users could swap out different shells, buttons, or scroll wheels to tailor the mouse to their specific needs or preferences. This could cater to gamers who prefer different button layouts or professionals who require specific features for design or coding work, making the mouse versatile and user-friendly.",
    "**Smart Tracking Technology**: Develop a mouse with advanced tracking capabilities that can adjust its sensitivity based on the surface itâ€™s being used on. Utilizing AI, the mouse could analyze the surface texture and adjust its DPI (dots per inch) settings automatically for optimal performance, ensuring smooth and accurate movement whether on a desk, fabric, or even a couch."
