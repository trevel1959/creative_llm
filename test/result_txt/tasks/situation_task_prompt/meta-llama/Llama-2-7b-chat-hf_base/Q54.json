    "Hydrofoils: One possible solution for traveling across a large body of water without ships or boats is to use hydrofoils. Hydrofoils are boats that use a wing-like structure, called a foil, to lift the hull of the boat out of the water. This reduces drag and increases speed, making it possible to travel long distances at a faster pace. With the disappearance of ships and boats, hydrofoils could become the primary mode of transportation across large bodies of water.",
    "Floating Cities: Another creative solution for traveling across a large body of water is to build floating cities. These cities would be made up of a series of interconnected platforms or islands, each with its own homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The floating cities could be propelled by wind, solar, or hydroelectric power, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation. With the disappearance of ships and boats, floating cities could become the new norm for traveling across large bodies of water.",
    "Submersibles: Submersibles are underwater vehicles that can travel through the water without surfacing. With the disappearance of ships and boats, submersibles could become the primary mode of transportation across large bodies of water. Submersibles could be used for both personal and commercial travel, and could be powered by electricity or diesel engines.",
    "Air-Inflated Boats: Another creative solution for traveling across a large body of water is to use air-inflated boats. These boats are made of a flexible, air-tight material that can be inflated with compressed air. The boats can then be propelled through the water using a combination of sails and paddles. With the disappearance of ships and boats, air-inflated boats could become a popular mode of transportation across large bodies of water.",
    "Water Gliders: Water gliders are vehicles that use the wind and currents to travel across large bodies of water. They are similar to sailboats, but are designed to be more efficient and sustainable. With the disappearance of ships and boats, water gliders could become a popular mode of transportation across large bodies of water. They could be used for both personal and commercial travel, and could be powered by solar or wind energy."
