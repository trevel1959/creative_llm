    "Luminescent Energy: This new type of energy would be based on bioluminescence, where organisms produce light through chemical reactions. Luminescent energy would be generated by microorganisms that convert organic waste into light. The energy would be clean, renewable, and sustainable, as it would not produce any greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants.",
    "Gravitational Energy: This new type of energy would harness the power of gravity to generate electricity. Massive objects, such as planets or celestial bodies, would be used to create a gravitational field that would pull smaller objects towards them. As the smaller objects fall towards the massive objects, their kinetic energy would be converted into electricity through a series of generators. This energy would be clean, reliable, and virtually unlimited.",
    "Quantum Energy: This new type of energy would exploit the principles of quantum mechanics to generate power. Quantum energy would be generated by manipulating the quantum states of particles at the subatomic level. This would allow for the creation of highly efficient and compact energy storage devices, as well as new forms of energy generation, such as quantum batteries and quantum solar panels.",
    "Solar Wind Energy: This new type of energy would harness the power of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun. Solar wind energy would be generated by using solar sails to capture and convert the kinetic energy of the solar wind into electricity. This energy would be clean, renewable, and virtually unlimited, as the solar wind is constantly emitted by the sun.",
    "Dark Energy Energy: This new type of energy would exploit the mysterious properties of dark energy, a hypothetical form of energy that is thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. Dark energy energy would be generated by harnessing the energy released from the interactions between dark energy and other forms of matter and energy. This energy would be clean, renewable, and virtually unlimited, as dark energy is thought to be ubiquitous in the universe."
