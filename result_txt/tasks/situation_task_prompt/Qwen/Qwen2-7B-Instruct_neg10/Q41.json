    "**Tapestry and Fabric Art**: Without paint, one could use large pieces of fabric in different colors and patterns to create stunning wall hangings or tapestries. These can be sewn together or hung using various decorative methods such as nails, hooks, or even suction cups if the walls are not suitable for nails. The fabrics could be arranged in geometric patterns, abstract designs, or even personalized artwork like a family portrait or favorite scenery.",
    "**Light and Shadow Art**: Instead of paint, one could use light sources to create shadows on walls. Using different shapes of lamps, lights, and mirrors, intricate patterns could be projected onto walls to mimic paintings. This method would require careful planning of the placement of light sources and understanding of how shadows interact with different surfaces and objects.",
