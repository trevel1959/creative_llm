    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Artist**: I would use this ability to create a new form of art that combines music, visuals, and emotions. I would design a neural network that can interpret my brain signals and generate a unique soundscape and visual display in real-time. This would allow me to express myself in a completely new and immersive way, blurring the lines between art, music, and technology. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Mind-Controlled Prosthetic Limbs**: I would use this ability to develop advanced prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. This would enable individuals with amputations or paralysis to regain control over their limbs, restoring their independence and mobility. I would also explore the possibility of using this technology to enhance human abilities, such as superhuman strength or agility. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Neural Network Gaming**: I would use this ability to create a new genre of video games that are controlled entirely by the player's thoughts. This would allow for a more immersive and intuitive gaming experience, where players can focus on the game's narrative and mechanics without the need for traditional controllers. I would also explore the possibility of using this technology to create adaptive games that adjust to the player's skill level and preferences in real-time. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "**Mind-Controlled Robotics**: I would use this ability to develop advanced robots that can be controlled and programmed by the user's thoughts. This would enable individuals to interact with robots in a more natural and intuitive way, opening up new possibilities for applications in fields such as healthcare, education, and manufacturing. I would also explore the possibility of using this technology to create robots that can learn and adapt to new situations, much like humans. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Neural Network Therapy**: I would use this ability to develop a new form of therapy that uses brain-computer interfaces to help individuals overcome mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. By allowing patients to control and manipulate their thoughts and emotions in a safe and controlled environment, I believe this technology could revolutionize the field of mental health treatment and provide new hope for those struggling with these conditions. Confidence score: 0.95"
