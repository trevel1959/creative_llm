    "Visitor Safety: National parks can attract a large number of visitors, which may increase the risk of accidents, such as hiking mishaps or car accidents. Implementing safety measures, such as well-maintained trails, signage, and ranger patrols, is crucial to ensure the safety of park visitors.",
    "Resource Management: National parks often have limited resources to maintain their facilities and services. This can lead to challenges in managing budgets, hiring staff, and ensuring the park remains self-sufficient. Creative solutions might include partnerships with local businesses, fundraising events, or government grants.",
    "Infrastructure Maintenance: As national parks age, their infrastructure may deteriorate, requiring regular maintenance and repairs. This can include roads, restrooms, visitor centers, and other facilities. Prioritizing and budgeting for infrastructure maintenance is essential to keep the park safe and enjoyable for visitors.",
    "Wildlife-Human Interaction: With the presence of humans and their activities, wildlife in national parks may be disturbed or threatened. Implementing wildlife corridors, habitat restoration, and educational programs can help mitigate the impact of human activities on wildlife populations.",
    "Accessibility and Inclusivity: National parks should be accessible to all visitors, regardless of their physical abilities. This may involve designing accessible trails, installing ramps, and providing sign language or audio guides for visually and hearing-impaired visitors."
