    "**Thermal Insulation Gloves**: Develop a new line of rubber gloves that not only protect hands from chemicals or hot objects but also have built-in heating elements. These gloves can be battery-powered and provide warmth to the wearer during cold weather or when working with cold substances. This would be particularly useful for industries such as food processing, laboratories, and construction.",
    "**Waterproof and Anti-Static Gloves**: Create a new type of rubber glove designed for use in electronics manufacturing or other environments where static electricity can cause damage. These gloves would be waterproof to prevent any liquid spills from affecting sensitive equipment, and they would also have anti-static properties to prevent electrical charges from accumulating on the user's body. This could significantly improve safety and efficiency in high-tech manufacturing sectors.",
    "**Garden Gloves with Built-in Tool Holders**: Design a gardening glove with multiple compartments to securely hold small tools like trowels, pruners, and screwdrivers. The rubber material ensures durability and grip while the tool holders make it easier for gardeners to multitask without constantly having to find their tools. This innovation could greatly enhance productivity and reduce frustration for avid gardeners.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Rubber Gloves**: Develop a new type of rubber glove made from biodegradable materials that are environmentally friendly. These gloves would decompose naturally, reducing waste in landfills. They could be marketed towards consumers who are conscious about sustainability, particularly those involved in food handling or cleaning tasks where traditional rubber gloves are necessary.",
    "**Touchscreen Compatible Gloves**: Create a series of rubber gloves that maintain their touch sensitivity on touchscreen devices despite being worn. This could be achieved by using conductive fibers within the gloves' material. This product would be ideal for individuals who need to handle touchscreen devices while performing tasks that require protective gloves, such as medical professionals, mechanics, or workers in cold environments."
