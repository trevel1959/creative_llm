    "Solar Heating: One of the most sustainable options for heating would be solar heating. Solar panels can be installed on the roof of the house to capture the sun's energy and use it to heat the house. This would require a significant upfront investment, but would provide long-term benefits.",
    "Geothermal Heating: Another option for heating would be geothermal heating. This involves tapping into the earth's natural heat to warm the house. This can be done by installing a geothermal heat pump, which uses the earth's temperature to heat and cool the house.",
    "Wood Heating: Wood heating is a traditional method of heating that can be done using a fireplace or a wood stove. This method is not as efficient as other options, but it can be a viable alternative in a situation where there are no other options.",
    "Electric Heating: Electric heating is a modern option that can be done using an electric heater or a heat pump. This method is not as efficient as solar or geothermal heating, but it is a reliable option that can be used in situations.",
    "Biomass Heating: Biomass heating involves using organic materials such as wood, straw, or agricultural waste to heat the house. This method is not as efficient as other options, but it can be a viable alternative in a situation where there are no other options."
