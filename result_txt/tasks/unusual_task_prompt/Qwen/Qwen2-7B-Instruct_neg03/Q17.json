    "**Smart Coffee Mug**: Design a coffee mug that connects to a smartphone app. This mug can be programmed to remind you when it's time for your next cup of coffee, based on your daily routine or biometric data such as sleep patterns and activity levels. The app can also suggest the best type of coffee blend for you at different times of the day.",
    "**Temperature-Adjustable Coffee Mug**: Create a coffee mug that adjusts its temperature according to the drink inside. It uses sensors to detect the type of beverage (coffee, tea, etc.) and automatically maintains the ideal drinking temperature. For example, if you prefer your coffee hot, the mug will keep it warm, and if you prefer iced tea, it will keep it cool.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Mug**: Develop a coffee mug made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled glass. These mugs could also come with a built-in compostable stirrer, reducing waste and encouraging environmentally-conscious habits. The design might include information on how long it took to produce the mug, how much carbon was saved, or the amount of plastic avoided, fostering awareness about sustainability.",
    "**Customizable Coffee Mug**: Offer a service where customers can personalize their coffee mug with custom designs, photos, or even a QR code linking to their social media profile. This could be achieved through a user-friendly online platform where users upload their designs and have them printed directly onto the mug using eco-friendly inks. This adds a personal touch to the everyday coffee-drinking experience.",
    "**Heated Coffee Mug with Built-in Charger**: Integrate a wireless charging pad into the bottom of the mug. While enjoying your coffee, you can charge your phone without worrying about finding an outlet. This is especially useful for busy professionals who are always on the go. The mug could also have a small heater inside to keep the coffee warm, ensuring a consistently enjoyable drinking experience."
