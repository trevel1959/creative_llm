    "**Incorporating Nature's Cycles**: Without clocks, one could use the natural cycles of the sun and moon for timekeeping. The length of a day (from sunrise to sunset) is approximately 24 hours. By observing the movement of the sun across the sky, you can estimate the passage of time. Similarly, the phases of the moon offer another way to measure longer periods. For example, a new moon to full moon cycle lasts about 29.5 days.",
    "**Water Clocks or Clepsydra**: Ancient civilizations used water clocks, also known as clepsydra, which measured time by the regulated flow of water. A container with a small hole at the bottom is filled with water. As the water drains, it indicates the passage of time. With this tool, you could track minutes, hours, and even days depending on the size of the container and the flow rate.",
    "**Mechanical Sand Timer**: A sand timer, another ancient invention, measures time through the flow of sand from one container to another. These can be made manually using a funnel, two containers, and sand. By using different-sized timers, you could measure various durations of time, from seconds to several hours.",
    "**Using a Rotating Earth Model**: Create a model of the Earth that rotates on an axis. The rotation period of the Earth is approximately 24 hours, so by tracking the rotation of your model, you can estimate the passage of time. This method might require a bit more effort but provides a tangible representation of time.",
    "**Biological Clocks**: Relying on biological rhythms, such as the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm), could help keep track of time over longer periods. This involves maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle and eating times. While not precise for shorter durations, this method ensures you maintain a sense of time within the context of daily activities and routines. "
