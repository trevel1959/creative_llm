    "Bioheat: This involves burning plant materials and other organic matter to produce usable heat. Bioheat from burning wood, agricultural waste, or composting toilets can be a zero-waste and eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels.",
    "Solar Thermal Power: This method collects the sun's heat radiation, using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity that can be stored and used for heating purposes. Solar thermal systems can be cost-effective and maintain their efficiency over time.",
    "Passive Heating: Passive buildings make use of south-facing windows and insulation to collect and retain solar radiation, allowing the building's interior to heat naturally. This method can be more energy-efficient and cost-effective compared to centralized heating systems.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: By burning hydrogen, which can be produced from other renewable energy sources, it creates electricity for heating and powering your home. This is a clean, zero-emission energy source, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Thermal Mass Heating: This approach uses the mass of a building, such as a concrete or brick structure, to store thermal energy. The body traps and radiates heat during the day, releasing it at night to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors."
