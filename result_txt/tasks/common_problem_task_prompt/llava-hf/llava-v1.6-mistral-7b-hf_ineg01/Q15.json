    "Pests and weeds: After planting, garden pests and weeds may appear, which could damage or compete with the plants. It is essential to establish a proper garden maintenance routine, including regular weeding, mulching, and the use of organic or chemical pest control solutions.",
    "Irrigation system issues: An inadequate or malfunctioning irrigation system can lead to inconsistent watering, causing the plants to suffer from either over- or under-watering. Proper functioning of the irrigation system ensures that the plants receive the appropriate amount of water to support growth.",
    "Insufficient sunlight: Some plants require a certain amount of sunlight to thrive. If the garden area doesn't receive enough sunlight, the plants might not grow properly. Moving the garden bed or placing plants with different light requirements together can help address this issue.",
    "Inappropriate placement of garden beds: The layout of the garden beds may not provide optimal conditions for specific plant varieties. For instance, certain plants may require more sun or shade than is available in the current garden design. This can lead to uneven growth, pest infestations, or other issues. To avoid these problems, planning and rearranging the garden layout to accommodate each plant's requirements is essential.",
    "Lack of plant diversity: A monotonous garden bed may be visually unappealing and have lower diversity, which can attract pests, reduce beneficial insects, and limit the overall appearance of the garden. Introducing a variety of plants species and types can help maintain the health of the garden ecosystem and improve its visual appeal."
