    "**Limited Accessibility and Inclusivity**: A new sport might inadvertently exclude certain demographics due to physical requirements, costs, or location. To combat this, the sport should be designed with inclusivity in mind, ensuring that equipment is affordable, the rules accommodate various skill levels, and that the sport can be played in diverse environments, from urban parks to rural fields.",
    "**Lack of Interest and Engagement**: Even with a great concept, a new sport may struggle to attract players and spectators. To foster interest, a robust marketing strategy should be implemented, including social media campaigns, demonstrations, and partnerships with schools and community organizations. Engaging influencers and athletes can also help raise awareness and excitement around the sport.",
    "**Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: The materials used for equipment and the locations chosen for play could have significant environmental implications. To ensure sustainability, the sport should prioritize eco-friendly materials for equipment and consider the environmental impact of its events. This could include using recycled materials, promoting outdoor play in natural settings, and minimizing waste during tournaments.",
    "**Competition with Established Sports**: A new sport will face stiff competition from established sports that already have a loyal following. To carve out a niche, the new sport must offer something uniqueâ€”whether it's a novel gameplay style, a different type of physical challenge, or an engaging community aspect. Highlighting these unique features in promotional efforts can help attract attention.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: New sports can sometimes lead to unforeseen injuries if proper safety measures are not in place. To mitigate this risk, it's vital to conduct thorough research on the potential hazards associated with the sport and implement safety guidelines. Training programs for players and coaches on injury prevention and first aid should also be established to promote a safe playing environment."
