    "Multi-Purpose Blender: Design a blender that can be used for multiple purposes beyond blending. For example, it could have attachments for chopping, grinding, and kneading dough. This would provide a more versatile appliance that could save space in the kitchen.",
    "Smart Blender: Incorporate smart technology into the blender, allowing it to connect to a mobile app or integrate with a smart home system. Users could control the blending process, set timers, and even receive notifications when their blender is ready to use.",
    "Energy-Efficient Blender: Design a blender that is more energy-efficient than current models. You could consider using low-energy motors, insulation to reduce the temperature of the blending compartment, and sensors to adjust the power required for different blending tasks.",
    "Modular Blender: Make the blender modular, allowing users to customize the blending container and attachments to suit their needs. For example, users could choose between different container sizes and shapes or attach specialized blades for specific blending tasks.",
    "Voice-Controlled Blender: Add voice recognition technology to the blender, allowing users to control the blending process without having to touch any buttons. This would provide a more hands-free blending experience and could be useful for those with disabilities or anyone who wants to keep their hands free while blending."
