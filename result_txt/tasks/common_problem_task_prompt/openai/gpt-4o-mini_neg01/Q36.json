    "**Zoning and Permitting Issues**: Each city has specific zoning laws and permitting processes that must be followed for construction projects. Installing solar panels may face bureaucratic hurdles, such as obtaining the necessary permits or dealing with neighborhood associations that may oppose the installation for aesthetic reasons.",
    "**Financial Accessibility**: While solar panels can save homeowners money in the long run, the upfront costs can be prohibitive. This could lead to disparities where only wealthier homeowners can afford to install them, potentially exacerbating social inequalities within the city.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. If homeowners are not educated on proper care or if they lack the financial means to hire professionals for repairs, this could lead to decreased efficiency and a lower return on investment for the systems installed.",
    "**Energy Grid Integration**: Integrating a large number of solar panels into the existing energy grid can create challenges. The grid may not be equipped to handle the influx of decentralized energy production, leading to potential issues with energy distribution and reliability.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While solar energy is renewable, the manufacturing and disposal of solar panels can have environmental consequences. If not managed properly, the production process can lead to pollution, and improper disposal of old or damaged panels can create hazardous waste."
