    "**Metal and Fabric**: A house could be constructed using a combination of metal frames and fabric for walls and roofs. The metal frames would provide the structural support, while the fabric would be stretched over the frames to create the walls and roofs.",
    "**Carbon Fiber and Composites**: Houses could be built using carbon fiber, a lightweight and incredibly strong material. This could be combined with composite materials like epoxy or polyester to create a sustainable and high-performance structure.",
    "**3D Printing**: In a world without natural building materials, 3D printing technology could be utilized to create complex architectural structures with minimal environmental impact.",
    "**Geodesic Domes**: Geodesic domes are naturally strong and efficient structures. They could be used as the foundation for a house, with a combination of transparent and opaque materials to create a unique and energy-efficient living space.",
    "**Floating Structures**: In the absence of natural building materials, houses could be built as floating structures on water, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional land-based construction."
