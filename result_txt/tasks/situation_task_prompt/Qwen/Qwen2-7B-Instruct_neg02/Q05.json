    "**Creating a Light-Emitting Plant**: Scientists could genetically engineer a common plant species to emit light using bioluminescent properties found in certain organisms. These plants could be strategically placed around areas that require artificial lighting during the day, like factories or homes, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution.",
    "**Utilizing Solar-Powered Infrared Cameras**: Since the sun isn't rising, sunlight wouldn't be directly available for solar panels. However, scientists can develop high-efficiency infrared solar panels that capture heat from the ground (which is warmer than outer space) and convert it into electricity. This electricity can then power LED lights which are attached to these cameras. The cameras could monitor and provide light in necessary areas, like roads and public spaces.",
    "**Innovative Cloud Engineering**: If the sun doesn't rise, it means there's no natural sunlight. By using advanced cloud engineering techniques, one might artificially manipulate the weather patterns to create clouds that reflect more sunlight. This process would require understanding atmospheric conditions and deploying large quantities of reflective particles into the stratosphere.",
    "**Development of Advanced Phosphorescent Materials**: Scientists could create new materials that glow naturally without needing any external energy source. These materials could be used in everyday objects like clothing, road signs, or even buildings. This way, the environment itself would provide light during the absence of the sun.",
    "**Space-based Solar Power Satellites**: A creative idea would be to launch satellites into space equipped with solar panels that could generate electricity continuously, even when the sun doesnâ€™t rise on Earth. This electricity would then be beamed back down to Earth using microwaves or lasers, powering the areas that need light during the day. This concept requires significant advancements in space technology and power transmission systems. "
