    "**Adaptive Blending Technology**: Develop a handheld device that uses high-pressure air jets to cut through various materials like paper, fabric, or even thin metal sheets. The device would have interchangeable nozzles, allowing users to adjust the cutting speed and precision based on the material's thickness and type. This technology would utilize a combination of pneumatics and precision engineering to achieve clean cuts.",
    "**Geodesic Cutting Tool**: Design a device that uses a network of interconnected, flexible cutting wires arranged in a geodesic dome shape. This would allow for smooth, curved cuts in materials like wood, plastic, or even glass. The geodesic design would provide maximum cutting efficiency and precision while minimizing the risk of accidents.",
    "**Ultrasonic Cutting**: Utilize high-frequency ultrasonic waves to cut through materials. This technology would involve a handheld device that generates ultrasonic vibrations, which would be transmitted to a cutting head. The vibrations would cause the material to vibrate and eventually break apart, allowing for precise cuts. This method would be particularly effective for cutting thin materials like metal foils or delicate fabrics.",
    "**Electrostatic Cutting**: Develop a device that uses electrostatic charges to cut through materials. This technology would involve applying a high-voltage electric charge to a cutting head, which would attract and then release charged particles from the material, effectively cutting it. This method would be particularly effective for cutting thin, insulating materials like plastics or ceramics.",
    "**Magnetic Cutting**: Design a device that uses a strong magnetic field to cut through materials. This technology would involve a handheld device that generates a powerful magnetic field, which would attract and then repel metal particles from the material, effectively cutting it. This method would be particularly effective for cutting metal sheets or wires. "
