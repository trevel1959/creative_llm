    "Electric Vehicles: The world could shift towards electric vehicles as a primary mode of transportation. These vehicles are powered by rechargeable batteries and have become increasingly popular in recent years. The government could invest in building more charging stations and incentivize the use of electric vehicles.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are another alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. These vehicles use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity that powers the wheels. Hydrogen fuel cells are cleaner and more efficient than traditional gasoline engines, making them a better option for the future.",
    "Battery-Powered Motorcycles: Battery-powered motorcycles are becoming more popular as an alternative to cars. These vehicles are lightweight and easy to maneuver, making them a great option for urban commuters. The government could invest in building more bike lanes and providing incentives for the use of battery-powered motorcycles.",
    "Solar-Powered Cars: Solar-powered cars use solar panels to generate electricity that powers the wheels. These vehicles are becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. The government could invest in building more solar panels on rooftops and providing incentives for the use of solar-powered cars.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Cars: Nuclear-powered cars use nuclear reactors to generate electricity that powers the wheels. These vehicles are highly efficient and produce no emissions, making them a great option for the future. However, nuclear-powered cars are still in the early stages of development and face many safety concerns. The government could invest in research and development of nuclear-powered cars, but it would need to be done carefully to ensure safety and sustainability."
