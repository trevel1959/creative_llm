Employees can learn basic phrases in each other's languages, fostering a sense of community and teamwork.",
    "**Language Learning Incentives**: Introduce incentives for employees to learn new languages. This could include offering language classes, access to language learning apps, or reimbursement for language courses. By encouraging language learning, employees can enhance their skills and communication abilities, which can lead to better collaboration and understanding in a multicultural environment.",
    "**Visual Communication Tools**: Utilize visual aids, such as infographics, diagrams, and pictograms, to convey complex information that may be difficult to communicate verbally.
