    "**Solar Panel Umbrella**: Design a portable, compact umbrella that doubles as a solar panel. The umbrella's canopy would be made of a flexible, thin-film solar panel material, allowing it to harness energy from the sun even on cloudy days. The umbrella's handle would be equipped with a battery pack and a USB port, enabling users to charge their devices on-the-go. This innovative design would provide a reliable source of light and power, even in the absence of a sunrise.",
    "**Luminescent Street Paint**: Develop a special type of street paint that contains luminescent particles. This paint would be applied to roads, sidewalks, and other surfaces, providing a soft, ethereal glow after sunset. The luminescent particles would absorb light during the day and release it at night, creating a unique and captivating ambiance. This innovative paint would not only provide light but also serve as a work of art, transforming urban landscapes into breathtaking displays of color and light.",
    "**Bioluminescent Trees**: Engineer a species of bioluminescent trees that can absorb and store energy during the day. These trees would be designed to release a soft, blue-green glow after sunset, providing a natural and sustainable source of light. The bioluminescent trees would be planted in urban areas, parks, and gardens, creating a magical and enchanting atmosphere. This innovative solution would not only provide light but also help to purify the air and improve the overall aesthetic of urban environments.",
    "**LED-Embedded Fabric**: Develop a special type of fabric that incorporates LED lights and fibers. This fabric would be woven into clothing, upholstery, and other textiles, creating a wearable and versatile source of light. The LED lights would be powered by small, rechargeable batteries or solar panels, allowing users to customize the brightness and color of the lights to suit their needs. This innovative fabric would revolutionize the way we think about light and its applications.",
    "**Atmospheric Light Harvesting**: Design a system that harnesses the energy from the atmosphere to generate light. This system would use a network of tiny, fiber-optic sensors to detect changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity. The sensors would be connected to a central hub, which would convert the atmospheric energy into a usable form of light. The light would be distributed through a network of fiber-optic cables, providing a sustainable and efficient source of illumination. This innovative system would not only provide light but also serve as a monitoring system for environmental changes"
