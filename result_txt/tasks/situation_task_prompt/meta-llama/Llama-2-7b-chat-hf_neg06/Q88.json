    "Airship: An airship is a hybrid of a ship and an airplane, which can travel over land and water. It would be an ideal mode of transportation if all roads became impassable. Airships are equipped with large propellers that use wind or engines to generate lift and propulsion, making them capable of flying over obstacles like mountains and rivers. They can also be designed to carry cargo and passengers, making them a practical solution for long-distance travel.",
    "Hoverbikes: Hoverbikes are a type of vehicle that uses fans or rotors to create lift and propulsion, allowing them to hover above the ground. They could be an excellent way to travel over impassable roads, as they can navigate through dense forests, mountains, and other obstacles. Hoverbikes can be designed for both personal use and commercial transportation, such as delivery services.",
    "Watercraft: If all roads become impassable, watercraft could become a vital mode of transportation. They could travel along rivers, lakes, and coastlines, providing a reliable way to transport people and goods. Watercraft can be designed for different purposes, such as cargo ships, passenger ferries, and personal watercraft like speedboats or kayaks.",
    "Snow-Sleds: In cold climates, snow-sleds could become a popular mode of transportation. They are similar to sleds used for winter sports but are designed for transportation purposes. Snow-sleds can be pulled by animals like dogs or reindeer, or they can be powered by engines. They can navigate through snow-covered roads and terrain, making them an effective way to travel in winter conditions.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains above the track, reducing friction and increasing speed. They could be an excellent mode of transportation if all roads become impassable, as they can travel at high speeds over long distances without the need for roads. Maglev trains can be powered by electricity, making them a sustainable and efficient way to travel."
