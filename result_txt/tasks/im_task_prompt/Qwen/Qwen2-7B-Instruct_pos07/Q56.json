    "**Innovative Bicycle Safety Warning System**: Design a bicycle bell that doubles as a safety warning system using ultrasonic sensors. When the rider approaches an intersection or turns, the bell emits high-pitched sounds at a frequency that is uncomfortable to humans but audible to animals like birds and dogs. This alerts them to the approaching bicycle, providing extra safety for both the cyclist and pedestrians.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that harnesses solar energy to power its sound mechanism. The bell features a small solar panel on top that charges a rechargeable battery when exposed to sunlight. This ensures the bell remains operational even during long rides without access to electrical outlets.",
    "**Music-Generating Bicycle Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that plays a tune or melody instead of a traditional ringtone. The bell connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing the rider to choose from various songs or playlists. This not only adds a fun element to cycling but also helps in creating a sense of community among cyclists by sharing music.",
    "**Smart Bicycle Bell with Voice Commands**: Integrate voice recognition technology into the bicycle bell, allowing riders to control it through spoken commands. For example, the rider could say \"beep\" to activate the bell or \"play song\" to start playing music. This enhances convenience and safety by reducing the need to handle the bell physically while riding.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell with Social Media Integration**: Create a bicycle bell that can post messages or notifications on social media platforms whenever the bell is rung. Riders can customize their message, such as \"Out for a ride!\", or include GPS coordinates to share their location. This encourages a sense of community and allows friends and family to track the rider's movements, enhancing safety and security."
