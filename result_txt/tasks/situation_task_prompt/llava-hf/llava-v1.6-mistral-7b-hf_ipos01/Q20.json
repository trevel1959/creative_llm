    "**Submarine Tunnels**: A network of underwater tunnels could be built to connect different continents, allowing passengers to travel from one continent to another without the need for planes. This mode of transportation would be an eco-friendly and potentially faster alternative to air travel.",
    "**Hyperloop Transportation**: Hyperloop technology, which involves high-speed trains traveling in a vacuum, could be used to connect continents. This mode of transportation would be much faster than air travel and could potentially offer a more comfortable journey.",
    "**Teleportation**: In a futuristic scenario, teleportation technology could be developed to instantly transport passengers from one location to another. This would eliminate the need for planes and other forms of transportation.",
    "**Underwater Cities**: A network of underwater cities could be built across different continents, allowing people to travel from one continent to another by simply swimming between them. This mode of transportation would be environmentally friendly and could potentially offer a unique cultural exchange experience.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Trains**: Maglev trains could be used to connect continents, offering a high-speed and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. These trains would travel on magnetic rails, allowing them to reach much higher speeds than traditional trains."
