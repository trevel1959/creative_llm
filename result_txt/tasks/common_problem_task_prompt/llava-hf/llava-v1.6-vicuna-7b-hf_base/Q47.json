    "**Component Compatibility**: Another challenge is ensuring that all components chosen will work together seamlessly. There are hundreds of different types of hardware on the market, and compatibility between brands and models can be complicated. Conducting thorough research and using guides from reputable sources can help navigate through potential compatibility issues.",
    "**Cost Inefficiency**: The cost of building a computer from scratch is not always economical compared to pre-built options. Buying components separately and then assembling can be more expensive, and users may end up overspending on parts they don't need. Building a computer with just the essentials and focusing on affordability is one way around this.",
    "**Aesthetic Design**: A visually appealing computer case is important for many users. However, finding a high-quality case within budget or with sufficient cooling capabilities can be a challenge. Creating a custom paint job or experimenting with unique designs and RGB lighting adds to the overall cost and time of the build.",
    "**Electrical Overload**: Insufficient power supply or inadequate cable management can lead to electrical overload issues. To avoid this, investing in a high-quality power supply unit (PSU) and cable management solutions is essential. Proper cable management contributes to a cleaner and more organized system.",
    "**Potential for Malfunction**: Attaching the CPU cooler incorrectly or not securing it properly during the assembly process can lead to leaks and the failure of the cooling system. Paying close attention to the installation, tightening all hardware, and following the manufacturer's instructions can help avoid this issue."
