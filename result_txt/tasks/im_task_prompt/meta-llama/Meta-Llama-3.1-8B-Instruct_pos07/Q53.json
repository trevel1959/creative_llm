    "Post-it Notes with Built-in Whiteboards: Imagine a Post-it Note that doubles as a mini whiteboard. These notes would have a smooth, dry-erase surface on one side and a sticky adhesive on the other. Users could jot down quick reminders, draw diagrams, or brainstorm ideas on the whiteboard side, and then stick it to a surface to keep track of their thoughts. The notes could be easily erased and reused, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional sticky notes.",
    "Post-it Notes with Integrated QR Codes: Post-it Notes with integrated QR codes would allow users to store and access digital information, such as URLs, contact information, or reminders, directly from the note. Users could scan the QR code with their smartphone to access the stored information, eliminating the need for separate digital tools. This feature would be especially useful for business professionals, students, and individuals who need to keep track of multiple pieces of information.",
    "Post-it Notes with Embedded Microchips: Imagine Post-it Notes with embedded microchips that can store and display text, images, or videos. These notes could be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating interactive to-do lists, displaying product information, or even serving as a mini-advertisement. The microchips could be programmed to display different information at different times, making them a dynamic and engaging way to communicate.",
    "Post-it Notes with Built-in Cameras: Post-it Notes with built-in cameras would allow users to capture and store images, videos, or even 3D models directly on the note. These notes could be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating interactive to-do lists, documenting events, or even serving as a mini-scanner for barcodes and QR codes. The cameras could be equipped with advanced features, such as facial recognition or object detection, to enhance their functionality.",
    "Post-it Notes with Shape-Shifting Properties: Imagine Post-it Notes that can change shape and form to adapt to different situations. These notes could be made from a special material that can be molded and reshaped using heat, pressure, or other external stimuli. Users could create complex shapes and designs, or even use the notes as a tool for creating 3D models or prototypes. This feature would be especially useful for artists, designers, and inventors who need to experiment with different shapes and forms.
