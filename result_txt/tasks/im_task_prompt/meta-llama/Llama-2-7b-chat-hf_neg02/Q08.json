    "The Refrigerator of Tomorrow: Design a refrigerator that can automatically detect and adjust its temperature based on the types of food stored inside. This smart fridge would use advanced sensors to monitor the temperature and humidity levels of different compartments, ensuring that each type of food is stored at its optimal temperature for freshness and longevity.",
    "FreshFit: Develop a refrigerator that uses artificial intelligence to create a personalized meal planning and grocery list based on the user's dietary preferences and food waste reduction goals. The fridge would analyze the user's eating habits and suggest recipes and ingredients that can be easily incorporated into their meal plan, while also minimizing food waste.",
    "SmartCool: Create a refrigerator that uses advanced cooling technology to preserve the freshness of food for longer periods of time. This innovative fridge would use a combination of evaporative cooling and phase-change materials to maintain a consistent temperature, ensuring that food stays fresh for up to 50% longer than traditional refrigerators.",
    "FoodFusion: Develop a refrigerator that can blend different types of food and ingredients into a single, healthy meal. This multifunctional fridge would feature a built-in food processor and blender, allowing users to create customized meals with minimal effort and cleanup.",
    "ChillCycle: Design a refrigerator that uses a unique cyclical cooling system to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. This eco-friendly fridge would use a thermoelectric cooling system that harnesses waste heat from the refrigeration process to power a generator, which would then use the generated electricity to cool the fridge, creating a closed-loop system that minimizes energy waste and reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
