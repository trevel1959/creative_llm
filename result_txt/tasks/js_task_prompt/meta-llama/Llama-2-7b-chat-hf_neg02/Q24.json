    "Self-Sustaining Energy: The city would be powered by a combination of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint and ensure that it is environmentally sustainable.",
    "Advanced Transportation System: The city would have a state-of-the-art transportation system that is powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells. This would reduce air pollution and make the city more livable. The transportation system would also be designed to be efficient and convenient, with self-driving vehicles and hyperloops for fast travel.",
    "Water Management System: The city would have a comprehensive water management system that collects and recycles rainwater, greywater, and blackwater. This would reduce the city's water consumption and make it more resilient to droughts and floods. The water management system would also include advanced wastewater treatment facilities to ensure that all water is clean and safe for use.",
    "Vertical Farming and Urban Agriculture: The city would incorporate vertical farming and urban agriculture to provide fresh produce to its residents.

The vertical farms would use hydroponics, aeroponics, or other forms of urban agriculture to grow a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs.",
    "Collaborative and Inclusive Design: The city would be designed with collaboration and inclusivity in mind. It would be a place where people from all backgrounds and socio-economic statuses can come together to work, live, and play.
