    "**Luminaris**: A nocturnal, large mammal with the ability to produce and store light within its body. Its fur would be made up of specialized cells that absorb and convert sunlight during the day, allowing it to emit a soft glow at night. This would aid in navigation, communication, and attracting prey. The Luminaris would have large, round eyes to maximize light collection and a long, slender body to minimize heat loss. Its diet would consist of bioluminescent plants and insects to supplement its light-producing capabilities. The Luminaris would be a solitary creature, using its light to mark territories and warn potential competitors.",
    "**Aeropex**: A flying mammal with a unique respiratory system that allows it to extract oxygen from the air more efficiently than any other animal. Its wings would be made of a lightweight, yet incredibly strong material that could withstand high-speed flight and turbulent air. The Aeropex would have a streamlined body, with a long, pointed snout and large, bat-like ears to enhance its hearing and echolocation abilities. Its diet would consist of flying insects and small birds, which it would catch using its agile wings and sharp claws.",
    "**Terragrim**: A massive, burrowing mammal with the ability to manipulate the earth around it. Its powerful claws and strong shoulders would allow it to dig complex networks of tunnels and dens, while its sensitive whiskers would help it navigate through the dark. The Terragrim would have a robust body, with a thick, armored hide that protects it from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Its diet would consist of underground plant roots and tubers, which it would extract using its powerful claws and specialized tongue.",
    "**Aquari**: A marine mammal with the ability to change its body shape and color to blend in with its surroundings. Its skin would be covered in specialized cells that can expand and contract to alter its texture and reflectivity, allowing it to camouflage itself from predators and sneak up on prey. The Aquari would have a streamlined body, with a dorsal fin and powerful tail that enable it to swim at high speeds. Its diet would consist of fish, squid, and other marine animals, which it would catch using its agile body and sharp teeth.",
    "**Frostbite**: A small, arctic mammal with the ability to survive"
