    "**Modular Design**: Create a laptop with a modular architecture that allows users to easily upgrade components like RAM, storage, or even the GPU. This could be achieved through a series of snap-on modules that can be replaced without specialized tools. This would not only extend the lifespan of the laptop but also reduce electronic waste, as users would not need to buy a new device for upgrades.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Develop a laptop with built-in solar panels on the lid that can supplement battery power when outdoors. This feature would be particularly useful for students or professionals who work in parks or other outdoor settings. The solar cells could be designed to be lightweight and aesthetically pleasing, ensuring they do not compromise the laptop's design while providing a sustainable power option.",
    "**Smart Touchpad with Gesture Recognition**: Innovate a touchpad that can recognize custom gestures and even the weight of a user’s finger. This could allow for advanced functionalities like zooming in and out, switching between applications, or even executing macros with simple hand movements. Such a feature would enhance productivity and make navigation more intuitive, especially for creative professionals who rely on precision.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) capabilities directly into the laptop, allowing users to project virtual screens or workspaces in their physical environment. Using a combination of cameras and sensors, users could expand their workspace virtually, making multitasking easier. This would be particularly beneficial for designers, architects, or anyone who requires multiple screens for their work.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Enhance the laptop with an integrated AI assistant that learns from the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could help manage schedules, suggest apps based on usage patterns, automate repetitive tasks, and even optimize system performance by suggesting when to run maintenance tasks. The AI could also offer personalized learning experiences for students, tailoring study schedules and resources to their individual needs."
