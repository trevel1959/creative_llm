    "**Enhanced Natural Vision Technology**: Imagine a device that enhances natural human vision. This could be in the form of an advanced eyewear system that uses artificial intelligence to process visual data and present it to the user in a more understandable format. The AI would analyze the environment, highlight important objects or people, and adjust the display according to light conditions and the user's needs.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Contact Lenses**: Develop contact lenses that incorporate micro-display technology. These lenses would project a digital overlay on the userâ€™s field of view, helping them to navigate and interact with their surroundings more easily. For instance, the AR lenses could highlight street names, provide translations for signs, or offer 3D models of objects in their environment.",
    "**Sound-Enhanced Environments**: In this scenario, the world becomes a multisensory experience where sound plays a crucial role in helping individuals with poor vision navigate. Soundscapes could be designed so that different sounds correspond to various types of objects, colors, or textures. For example, a door might have a distinctive sound, while a specific color might be associated with a particular sound frequency.",
    "**Tactile Mapping**: Instead of relying on sight, a tactile mapping system could help individuals understand their surroundings through touch. This could involve haptic feedback gloves or specialized clothing that provides information about texture, shape, and distance. For example, a user could 'feel' the shape of an object, the texture of a surface, or even the distance to a wall.",
    "**Advanced Braille and Tactile Graphics**: With traditional glasses and contacts disappearing, tactile versions of text and graphics could become more prevalent. High-tech Braille systems with improved resolution and tactile feedback could enable reading and writing. Additionally, 3D printing technology could be used to create tactile graphics that allow individuals to 'read' maps, diagrams, and other visual information by touch. "
