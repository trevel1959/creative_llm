    "Smell-a-Note: Imagine Post-it Notes with a built-in scent dispenser that releases a fragrance when you write on them. This could be a unique selling point for creative professionals, artists, and hobbyists who value the sensory experience of creating. The scents could be tailored to different types of creative work, such as citrus for brainstorming, floral for writing, or minty for artistic inspiration.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Notes: Develop Post-it Notes with a special coating that glows in the dark, allowing users to leave notes for themselves or others in low-light environments. This could be useful for students studying late at night, night owls needing to jot down reminders, or anyone who wants to leave a secret message for a friend. The glow-in-the-dark feature could also add a fun and playful touch to everyday tasks.",
    "Interactive Notes: Design Post-it Notes with a touch-sensitive surface that allows users to interact with digital content through hand gestures. For example, a user could use a flicking motion to open a link, a pinching motion to zoom in on a document, or a swiping motion to change between different apps. This would eliminate the need for a separate digital device and make it easier to quickly access and interact with digital content.",
    "Customizable Notes: Create Post-it Notes with a modular design that allows users to personalize their notes with different shapes, colors, and symbols. This could be a fun and creative way for users to express their personality and add a personal touch to their notes. The modular design could also make it easier to organize and categorize notes, as users could create different modules for different types of information.",
    "Holographic Notes: Develop Post-it Notes with a holographic design that projects a 3D image of the note when viewed from different angles. This could be a unique and eye-catching way to leave notes for others, and could also be used as a tool for creative brainstorming. The holographic design could be especially useful for artists and designers who want to create visually striking notes that will stand out from the crowd."
