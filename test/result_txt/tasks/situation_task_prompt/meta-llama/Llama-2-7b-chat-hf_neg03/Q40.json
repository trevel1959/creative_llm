    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These solar-powered batteries could be charged during the day and provide power to devices at night or during periods of low sunlight.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a battery that uses microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast to generate electricity. These bio-batteries would convert organic matter such as food waste or agricultural byproducts into electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable source of power.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Create a battery that uses phase-change materials to store thermal energy. These batteries would work by heating or cooling a material, which would then release energy as it changes phase, providing a consistent source of power.",
    "Seawater Batteries: Develop a battery that uses seawater as the primary component. These batteries would use the energy from the ocean tides or salinity differences to generate electricity, providing a renewable source of power for coastal communities.",
    "Graphene Supercapacitors: Create a new type of supercapacitor that utilizes graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material. These graphene supercapacitors would be able to store and release energy quickly, making them ideal for powering devices with high power demands such as electric vehicles or medical devices."
