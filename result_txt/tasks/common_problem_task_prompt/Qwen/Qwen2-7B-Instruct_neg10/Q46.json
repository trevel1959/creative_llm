    "**Public Resistance**: Public acceptance of the changes might be a significant hurdle. Many people are accustomed to their current modes of transportation and may resist changes, especially if they perceive them as inconvenient or too costly. This could manifest in protests, strikes, or boycotts of the new system.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Upgrading the existing infrastructure might be complex and time-consuming. Old roads, bridges, and transit stations might not be suitable for modern systems, necessitating extensive renovation or replacement. This could lead to disruptions in traffic flow, safety concerns, and increased costs.",
    "**Technological Integration**: Integrating new technologies, such as electric vehicles, smart ticketing systems, or advanced traffic management software, could pose challenges. Ensuring compatibility with existing systems, addressing cybersecurity risks, and training personnel to operate these new technologies effectively would require substantial effort.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The overhaul might involve significant environmental considerations. For instance, transitioning to more sustainable forms of transportation could disrupt ecosystems, increase construction waste, or require the use of materials with high environmental impact.",
    "**Social Equity**: Ensuring that the new system addresses the needs of all residents, including those in underserved areas, is crucial. Without proper planning, the improvements might inadvertently widen the gap between urban and rural areas, or between different socioeconomic groups within the city."
