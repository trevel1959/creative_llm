    "**EchoLocation**: A sense that allows humans to perceive and interpret the echoes of sound waves bouncing off objects in their environment. This sense would be useful for navigating through dense forests, caves, or other areas with limited visibility. People with this sense could \"see\" their surroundings through sound waves, detecting the size, shape, and movement of objects.",
    "**ElectroSense**: A sense that allows humans to perceive electrical signals in their environment. This sense would be useful for detecting the presence of electrical currents, which could be used to power devices or detect potential electrical hazards.",
    "**AeroSense**: A sense that allows humans to perceive changes in air pressure, temperature, and humidity. This sense would be useful for predicting weather patterns, detecting changes in air quality, and navigating through environments with varying atmospheric conditions.",
    "**GeoSense**: A sense that allows humans to perceive the Earth's magnetic field and subtle changes in the Earth's gravitational field. This sense would be useful for navigation, orientation, and detecting subtle changes in the Earth's magnetic field.",
    "**BiolumSense**: A sense that allows humans to perceive and interpret the bioluminescent signals of living organisms. This sense would be useful for detecting the presence of living organisms, tracking the movement of animals, and monitoring the health of ecosystems."
