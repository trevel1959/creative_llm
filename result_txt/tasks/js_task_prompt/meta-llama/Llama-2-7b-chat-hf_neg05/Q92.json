    "Eccentric Orbitals: Imagine a solar system where the planets' orbits are irregular and unpredictable, with some planets orbiting closer to the sun than others in a chaotic dance. The closest planet, \"Eccentricia,\" would be a swirling vortex of colors, with clouds of gas and dust that shift and change with each rotation.",
    "Star-Studded Skies: Redesign the solar system to include multiple stars instead of just one. Each planet would have its own star, providing unique lighting conditions and atmospheric conditions. For example, \"Luminaria\" would have a perpetual sunset due to its dual suns, while \"Crystalia\" would have icy landscapes and frozen oceans due to its cold, distant star.",
    "Magnetic Worlds: Create a solar system where the planets are magnetically charged, with powerful magnetic fields that interact with each other and the sun. \"Magneton\" would have a magnetic tail that wraps around its orbit, creating a glowing aura of light. \"Electra\" would have a field so strong it would deflect any space debris that approaches.",
    "Reflective Realms: Imagine a solar system where the planets are covered in reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or polished metals. \"Mirroria\" would be a planet of endless reflections, with every surface reflecting the light of the sun in dazzling patterns. \"Glitteria\" would have a sparkling, crystalline surface that would create a kaleidoscope of colors in the light of the sun.",
    "Time Warp Tilt: Redesign the solar system so that the planets are tilted at different angles relative to their orbits around the sun. \"Tiltoria\" would have a planet with a 90-degree tilt, creating extreme seasons and weather patterns. \"Cyclicia\" would have a planet with a tilt of 270 degrees, causing its days and nights to cycle in reverse."
