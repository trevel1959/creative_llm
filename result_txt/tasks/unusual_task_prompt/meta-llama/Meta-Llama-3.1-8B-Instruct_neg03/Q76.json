    "**Eco-Friendly City**: Design a futuristic city that runs entirely on renewable energy sources, with self-sustaining ecosystems and minimal waste production. The city would be built into a massive, curved dome that protects its inhabitants from extreme weather conditions while allowing for a constant, stable environment. This dome would be made of a specialized, transparent material that allows for maximum sunlight absorption and reduces energy consumption.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy**: Develop a VR system that allows people to confront and overcome their fears in a controlled, immersive environment. This system would use advanced AI-powered avatars and real-time feedback to simulate realistic scenarios, allowing users to gradually build confidence and overcome phobias. The VR experience would be tailored to individual users, taking into account their personal fears and anxieties.",
    "**Underwater Research Station**: Construct an underwater research station that allows scientists to study marine life and ecosystems in unprecedented detail. The station would be designed to mimic the natural environment, with artificial coral reefs, water circulation systems, and a network of underwater sensors. This would enable researchers to study the impact of climate change, ocean acidification, and other environmental factors on marine ecosystems.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Develop contact lenses that can monitor a person's vital signs, track their physical activity, and provide real-time feedback on their health and wellness. These smart lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors and a microdisplay that projects information onto the user's field of vision. This would enable people to monitor their health and receive personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "**Personalized Nutrition**: Create a system that uses AI-powered analysis of an individual's genetic profile, dietary habits, and health goals to generate personalized nutrition plans. This system would take into account factors such as nutrient deficiencies, allergies, and intolerances to create a tailored diet that optimizes the user's health and well-being. The system would also provide real-time feedback and adjust the plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcomes. </s>[INST] "
