    "**Art Installation**: Use old bicycles as part of an art installation. Artists can creatively paint or decorate the bikes and arrange them in public spaces to convey messages about sustainability, mobility, or community. This could be an interactive exhibit where people can add their own artistic touch or messages to the bicycles.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Generator**: Convert a bicycle into a generator that produces electricity as you pedal. By attaching a generator to the bike's rear wheel, individuals can create a sustainable power source for small devices, like charging a phone or powering LED lights during outdoor events. This could also be used in educational settings to teach about renewable energy.",
    "**Mobile Coffee Cart**: Turn a bicycle into a mobile coffee cart by adding a small cart or trailer that contains a coffee machine, cups, and supplies. This could serve as a unique way to bring coffee to events, parks, or neighborhoods. It can be especially appealing at local farmers' markets or community festivals, where a bicycle-powered cart can attract attention.",
    "**Fitness Challenge Station**: Set up a bicycle as part of a fitness challenge in public parks or gyms. Participants can ride the bike for a set distance or time, and the bike can be connected to a leaderboard that tracks performance. This encourages physical activity and could be part of a larger community health initiative.",
    "**Bicycle-Based Library**: Create a mobile library by attaching shelves to a bicycle. This \"book bike\" can travel around neighborhoods, allowing people to borrow or donate books. It promotes literacy and community engagement, especially in areas with limited access to traditional libraries. The bicycle can also host reading events or storytime sessions for children."
