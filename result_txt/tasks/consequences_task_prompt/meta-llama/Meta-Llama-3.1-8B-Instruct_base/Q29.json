    "**Information Overload and Mental Fatigue**: With the ability to recall every piece of information they've ever read, humans would experience a massive influx of data, leading to mental exhaustion. Their minds would be overwhelmed, making it challenging to focus on new information, and potentially causing cognitive decline.",
    "**Loss of Context and Understanding**: Remembering every detail might not necessarily mean understanding the context or significance of the information. This could lead to a disconnection between knowledge and application, causing individuals to struggle with critical thinking and decision-making.",
    "**Social and Emotional Impacts**: Humans might become overly sensitive to the emotions and experiences of others, as they would be able to recall every detail of past interactions. This could lead to emotional overload, anxiety, and difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.",
    "**Economic and Social Consequences**: The ability to recall every piece of information could disrupt traditional industries, such as education and publishing, as people would no longer need to rely on memory aids like textbooks or notes. This could lead to significant economic shifts and social changes.",
    "**Psychological Trauma and PTSD**: Remembering every traumatic event or experience could lead to a heightened sense of vulnerability and anxiety. This could exacerbate existing mental health conditions, such as PTSD, and make it challenging for individuals to cope with stressful situations."
