    "**Smart Trash Can**: Design a trash can with built-in sensors that track waste generation, recycling rates, and composting progress. This data could be synced with a mobile app, providing users with insights on their waste management habits and suggesting improvements. The trash can could also have a voice assistant, allowing users to schedule waste collection or request special pickup services.",
    "**Aesthetically Pleasing Design**: Create a trash can that doubles as a decorative piece for the home or office. The design could feature a sleek, modern aesthetic with a unique shape or color scheme that complements the surrounding environment. This would make the trash can a conversation starter and a stylish addition to any room.",
    "**Waste Sorting Assistant**: Develop a trash can with separate compartments for different types of waste, such as recyclables, compostables, and regular trash. The compartments could be designed with clear labels and dividers to make it easy for users to sort their waste correctly. The trash can could also have a built-in scale to weigh the waste and provide users with a breakdown of their waste composition.",
    "**Air-Purifying Trash Can**: Design a trash can with an integrated air-purifying system that removes odors and pollutants from the surrounding air. This could be achieved through the use of activated carbon filters or other air-purifying technologies. The trash can could also have a built-in fan to circulate clean air and improve indoor air quality.",
    "**Automated Trash Compactor**: Create a trash can with an automated compactor that compresses waste into a compact, odor-free mass. This would reduce the volume of waste and make it easier to store and transport. The compactor could be powered by a battery or connected to a household power source."
