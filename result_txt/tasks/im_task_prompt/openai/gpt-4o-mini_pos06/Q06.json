    "**Self-Cleaning Canopy**: Develop a canopy made from a special hydrophobic material that repels water and dirt. This self-cleaning technology would allow the umbrella to shake off rainwater and prevent mud and grime from sticking, making it easier to maintain. Users could simply wipe it down occasionally, rather than needing to clean it after every use.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design with Flexible Frame**: Reinvent the traditional umbrella frame using flexible materials such as carbon fiber or advanced polymers that can bend without breaking. This design would allow the umbrella to withstand strong winds by flexing and returning to its original shape, preventing it from turning inside out or breaking during storms.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Add LED lights to the ribs of the umbrella that can illuminate the area underneath when opened. This feature would be particularly useful for evening walks or events in dimly lit areas, providing safety and visibility. The lights could be solar-powered or rechargeable, and users could control them via a smartphone app.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Umbrella**: Design an umbrella that can be transformed into a portable sunshade, beach tent, or even a picnic blanket. The umbrella could have detachable parts that allow it to expand into a larger shelter, providing versatility for various outdoor activities. The canopy could also be made of materials that block UV rays, making it ideal for beach outings.",
    "**Collapsible Travel Umbrella with Built-in Battery**: Create a compact, collapsible umbrella that includes a built-in battery pack for charging devices on the go. This umbrella could have a USB port and solar panels integrated into the canopy, allowing users to charge their smartphones or other gadgets while staying dry. It would be perfect for travelers who want to stay connected without worrying about their devices running out of battery."
