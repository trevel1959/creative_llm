    "In a small village nestled between two great rivers, there lived a frog named Croaky. Croaky was unlike any other frog in the village. He was fascinated by the stories of the humans who lived in the nearby town and longed to experience life as one of them. Every night, he would sit by the riverbank and watch the humans dance, sing, and laugh together.",
    "One evening, as Croaky was gazing out at the stars, he made a wish to a wise old owl perched in a nearby tree. The owl, sensing Croaky's deep desire, looked at him with wise eyes and said, \"Your wish is granted, little frog. But be warned, the path to becoming a prince is not an easy one. You must first prove yourself worthy.\"",
    "The owl handed Croaky a small, intricately carved wooden box. Inside the box was a note that read, \"Solve the riddle of the river, and you shall be granted your wish.\" Croaky was both thrilled and terrified at the prospect of solving the riddle.",
    "The riddle read: \"What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?\" Croaky thought long and hard, trying to decipher the meaning behind the words. He asked the other animals in the village for their opinions, but none of them seemed to know the answer.",
    "Just when Croaky was about to give up, a wise old badger appeared at his side. The badger listened carefully to the riddle and then said, \"The answer is a promise. A promise is something that can be broken, but it can never be physically held in one's hands. A promise is something that can be given, but it can never be sold like a commodity.\""
