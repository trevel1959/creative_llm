    "**Adjustable Length Mechanism**: Design a leash with a retractable mechanism that allows users to easily adjust the length of the leash with a simple push-button system. This would enable dog owners to give their pets more freedom in open spaces while keeping them close in crowded areas. The adjustable lengths could be pre-set for different activities, such as walking, running, or training.",
    "**Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Incorporate a discreet waste bag dispenser into the handle of the leash. This would allow dog owners to always have bags on hand without the need for a separate holder. The dispenser could feature a refillable compartment that easily opens for quick access, ensuring that owners are always prepared for clean-up.",
    "**Reflective and LED Lighting**: Enhance the safety of evening walks by integrating reflective materials and LED lights into the leash. This would make both the dog and the owner more visible to passing cars and pedestrians. The lights could be activated with a simple switch or set to flash mode for added visibility, making night walks safer.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle Design**: Redesign the leash handle to be more ergonomic, incorporating soft-touch materials and a shape that fits comfortably in the hand. This would reduce strain during long walks and provide better grip, especially in wet conditions. The handle could also include a small storage compartment for keys or treats.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Leash**: Create a leash that can be transformed into various configurations for different activities. For instance, it could be adjustable to become a harness, a short tether for training, or even a hands-free option that clips around the waist. This versatility would cater to a variety of dog-walking scenarios, making it ideal for adventurous pet owners."
