    "Rope-based elevator replacement: Create a network of ropes and pulleys to manually pull people up the skyscraper. This system would require a team of trained personnel to operate the ropes, but it could be an efficient and sustainable solution in the short term.",
    "Stairwell climbing challenge: Set up a series of obstacles and challenges along the stairwell, such as balance beams, rope courses, and puzzles, to test people's physical and mental abilities. The first person to complete the course would reach the top of the skyscraper.",
    "Human-powered lift: Develop a system of pulleys and levers that uses the collective energy of a large group of people to lift a platform or person up the skyscraper. This could be achieved through a combination of muscle power and teamwork.",
    "Sky-diving with a twist: Offer skydiving lessons from the top of the skyscraper. Participants would jump from the roof with a specialized parachute designed for urban skydiving, taking in the breathtaking views of the city below. The parachute would be designed to slowly descend to the ground, allowing participants to land safely near the base of the skyscraper.",
    "Rube Goldberg-inspired contraption: Create a series of interconnected machines and gadgets that would work together to lift a person or object up the skyscraper. Each machine would be triggered by a small input, creating a chain reaction that would eventually reach the top of the building. This contraption could be a fun and interactive way to experience the heights of the skyscraper."
