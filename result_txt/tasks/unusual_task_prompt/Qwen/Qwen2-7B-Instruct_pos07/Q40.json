    "**Interactive Cookie Jar with Smart Technology**: Design a cookie jar that not only stores cookies but also doubles as a smart kitchen gadget. It could have features like temperature control to keep cookies fresh, a digital screen displaying the number of cookies inside, and even a built-in recipe book. Users can connect it to their smartphone app to track cookie consumption, plan recipes, or even order more cookies online.",
    "**Customizable Cookie Jar with Personalization Options**: Create a cookie jar where customers can customize every aspect of the product. This includes choosing the shape and size of the jar, selecting from a variety of colors and materials, and even having the jar personalized with names, dates, or messages. The customization options can be offered through an online platform where customers can visualize their custom cookie jar before ordering.",
    "**Sustainable Cookie Jar with Reusable Packaging**: Develop a cookie jar made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo or recycled glass. The jar should come with a lid made of a sustainable material, such as cork or recycled plastic. Additionally, consider adding a feature where customers can refill their cookie jars at local grocery stores, reducing waste and encouraging a circular economy.",
    "**Smart Recipe Jar with Voice Assistance**: Integrate a voice-activated assistant into the cookie jar that suggests recipes based on ingredients available inside the jar. The jar would have sensors to detect when ingredients are running low and automatically reorder them. This would make baking and cooking easier, especially for those who might forget to restock their pantry.",
    "**Themed Cookie Jars for Special Occasions**: Design cookie jars that are themed for specific events or holidays, such as Valentine's Day, Halloween, Christmas, or birthdays. Each jar could have a unique design and come with special recipe cards tailored to the occasion. For example, a Valentine's Day jar could include heart-shaped cookie cutters, a recipe for chocolate-covered cookies, and a romantic playlist for background music."
