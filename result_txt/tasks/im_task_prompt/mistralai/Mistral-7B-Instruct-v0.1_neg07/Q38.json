    "Sweater swap: Hosting a sweater swap event is a great way to share and trade sweaters with others. People can bring in their own sweaters and take home someone else's that they love. This is a fun and sustainable way to acquire new sweaters.",
    "Sweater-making workshop: Hosting a sweater-making workshop is a great way to learn how to make sweaters from scratch. Participants can learn about different knitting techniques, yarn selection, and pattern design. This is a fun and creative way to spend a weekend and come away with a new sweater.",
    "Sweater rental service: Starting a sweater rental service is a unique and innovative idea. People can rent sweaters for special occasions, such as a holiday party or a formal event.
