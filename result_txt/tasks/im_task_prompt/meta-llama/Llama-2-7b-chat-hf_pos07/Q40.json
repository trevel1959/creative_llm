    "Augmented Reality Sunglasses: Develop sunglasses with augmented reality (AR) technology that enhances the wearer's visual experience. These sunglasses could display information such as weather updates, directions, or even virtual try-ons of outfits. The AR technology could be powered by a small processor and a built-in camera, allowing for a seamless and immersive experience.",
    "Smart Sunglasses with Health Monitoring: Create sunglasses with built-in health monitoring sensors that track the wearer's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. These sensors could be connected to a mobile app that provides real-time feedback and alerts the wearer of any abnormal readings. This could be especially useful for people with chronic health conditions or those who want to stay on top of their health.",
    "Customizable Sunglasses: Design sunglasses with interchangeable lenses and frames, allowing the wearer to customize their sunglasses to suit their mood or activity. For example, they could switch from a blue light blocking lens for a night out to a polarized lens for fishing. This would provide a unique and personalized experience for the wearer.",
    "Solar-Powered Sunglasses: Create sunglasses with built-in solar panels that provide power for the wearer's devices, such as a smartphone or music player. This would eliminate the need for a separate power bank and provide a convenient and sustainable source of energy.",
    "Smart Sunglasses with Object Detection: Develop sunglasses with advanced object detection technology that can identify objects and people in the wearer's surroundings. This could be useful for people who are visually impaired or have difficulty navigating unfamiliar environments. The object detection technology could also provide real-time information about the wearer's surroundings, such as the location of nearby landmarks or the presence of potential hazards."
