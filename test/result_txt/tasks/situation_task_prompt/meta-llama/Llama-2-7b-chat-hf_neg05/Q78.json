    "Imagination Playdates: Children could engage in imaginative playdates with their friends, where they create their own games, characters, and scenarios using their creativity and imagination. They could pretend to be superheroes, pirates, or princesses, and use their bodies and surroundings as props to create their own adventures.",
    "Nature Play: With all toys gone, children could explore and play in nature. They could go on nature walks, collect leaves, rocks, and other natural materials to create their own toys and games. They could also play in puddles, splash in water, and create their own water games.",
    "Music and Dance: Children could use their voices, bodies, and found objects to create their own music and dance. They could make drums out of pots and pans, use sticks and rocks to create rhythms, and dance in circles, lines, or freestyle.",
    "Storytelling and Role-Playing: Children could create their own stories and act them out through role-playing. They could use their imaginations to create characters, settings, and plot lines, and take turns telling their stories to each other.",
    "Collaborative Art: Children could work together to create collaborative art projects. They could use found materials like leaves, twigs, and rocks to create sculptures, or paint and draw on large canvases or walls. They could also create mosaics, collages, and other mixed-media art projects using different materials and colors."
