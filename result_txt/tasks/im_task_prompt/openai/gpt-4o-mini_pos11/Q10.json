    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Laptops could come equipped with sensors that monitor the user's posture, eye strain, and overall health while working. Using machine learning algorithms, the laptop could provide real-time feedback and suggestions, such as reminders to take breaks, adjust seating position, or perform eye exercises. This feature could be especially beneficial for remote workers and students who spend long hours in front of screens.",
    "**Adaptive Keyboard**: A laptop could feature an adaptive keyboard that changes its layout and functionality based on the software being used. For instance, when a user opens a design application, the keyboard could reconfigure to display shortcuts and tools relevant to that program. This could be achieved through a combination of touch-sensitive technology and dynamic display screens embedded in the keys.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Incorporating solar panels into the laptop's lid could provide an eco-friendly charging option. This would allow users to charge their devices using sunlight, making it ideal for outdoor work or travel. The solar panels could be designed to be lightweight and aesthetically pleasing, ensuring that they do not detract from the laptop's overall look while providing an additional power source.",
    "**Enhanced Collaboration Features**: A laptop could integrate a virtual collaboration space that allows multiple users to interact with the same document or project in real-time, regardless of their physical location. This could include features like a shared digital whiteboard, voice and video integration, and collaborative tools that allow users to brainstorm and edit simultaneously. Such features would cater to the growing trend of remote work and team collaboration.",
    "**Customizable External Displays**: Laptops could support customizable external displays that allow users to attach different types of screens based on their needs. For instance, a user could attach a flexible OLED display for presentations, a high-refresh-rate monitor for gaming, or even a secondary screen that displays notifications and quick access tools. This would enable users to tailor their setup to specific tasks without needing multiple devices."
