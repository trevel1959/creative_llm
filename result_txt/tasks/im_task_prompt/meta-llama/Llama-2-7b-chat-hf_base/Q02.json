    "A bicycle that runs on air: Imagine a bicycle that uses air pressure to propel it forward. The tires would be designed with small holes on the side to allow air to enter and create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the tire. As the air pressure inside the tire increases, the tire would expand and the bicycle would move forward. This innovative design would not only provide a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation but also reduce the need for fossil fuels.",
    "A bicycle with a built-in sound system: Envision a bicycle with a sound system integrated into the frame. The speakers would be strategically placed to provide a 360-degree surround sound experience for the rider and passengers. The system could be powered by a rechargeable battery, ensuring a continuous music experience on the go. This unique feature would make cycling more enjoyable and provide a new way to enjoy music while getting exercise.",
    "A bicycle with a self-repairing frame: Picture a bicycle with a frame that can repair itself in case of minor scratches or damage. The frame would be made of a special material that could detect and respond to changes in its structure, such as cracks or dents. The material would be able to heal itself by reorganizing its molecular structure, making the bicycle frame virtually indestructible. This innovative feature would reduce the need for frequent repairs and maintenance, making cycling more convenient and practical.",
    "A bicycle with a built-in GPS and navigation system: Envision a bicycle with a built-in GPS and navigation system that provides real-time traffic updates and route suggestions to help riders navigate their journey more efficiently. The GPS system would be powered by a rechargeable battery, ensuring a continuous navigation experience. This innovative feature would make cycling more convenient and enjoyable, especially for long-distance riders.",
    "A bicycle with a foldable design: Picture a bicycle that can be easily folded and stored in a compact space. The frame would be designed with hinges that allow it to fold in half, making it easy to transport in a car trunk, train compart"
