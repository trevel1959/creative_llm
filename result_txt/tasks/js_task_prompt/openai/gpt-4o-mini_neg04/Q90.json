    "**Modular Limb System**: Instead of fixed limbs, humans could have a modular limb system that allows for interchangeable attachments based on needs or activities. For instance, a person could switch from a hand optimized for fine motor skills to one designed for heavy lifting, or even a flipper for swimming. This system would use advanced bioengineering to connect limbs seamlessly and would adapt to various tasks, enhancing versatility and functionality.",
    "**Bioluminescent Communication**: Inspired by deep-sea creatures, humans could have bioluminescent patches on their skin that change color or glow in response to emotions or social cues. This would enhance non-verbal communication, allowing for a deeper connection with others. For example, a soft blue glow could indicate calmness, while a vibrant red could signal excitement. This feature could foster empathy and understanding in social interactions.",
    "**Adaptive Respiratory System**: An advanced respiratory system could allow humans to breathe in a variety of environments, from high altitudes to underwater. This could involve a dual-chamber lung system that extracts oxygen efficiently from different mediums, including water, through specialized gills. Such adaptability would enable exploration of diverse ecosystems without the limitations of current breathing apparatuses.",
    "**Integrated Nutrient Absorption**: Redesigning the digestive system to allow for direct nutrient absorption through the skin could revolutionize human nutrition. This system would use specialized dermal cells that can absorb nutrients and hydration directly from the environment, reducing the need for traditional eating. This could be particularly beneficial in survival situations or for individuals with digestive disorders.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Organs**: Humans could possess augmented sensory organs that allow for a wider range of perception. For example, eyes could be designed to see a broader spectrum of light, including infrared and ultraviolet, enhancing visual acuity in various conditions. Similarly, ears could be equipped with the ability to detect ultrasonic sounds, opening up new dimensions of communication and awareness of surroundings."
