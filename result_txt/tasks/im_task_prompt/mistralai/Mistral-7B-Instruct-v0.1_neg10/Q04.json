    "Create an interactive book that allows you to choose your own adventure. Each page will have different options, and the story will change based on your choices. This will keep you engaged and excited to turn the page and see what happens next.",
    "Use augmented reality technology to bring the pages of the book to life. You can use your phone or tablet to scan the pages, and then see 3D models, animations, and videos pop up. This will add a new level of interactivity to the reading experience.",
    "Create a book that tells a story in reverse. Start with the end of the story and work your way back to the beginning. This will keep you on your toes and make you think about the story in a new way.",
    "Use artificial intelligence to generate a personalized book for you. Based on your interests, hobbies, and reading history, the AI will create a book that is tailored to your preferences. This will make the reading experience more enjoyable and relevant",
    "Create a book that is entirely made up of pictures. No words, no"
