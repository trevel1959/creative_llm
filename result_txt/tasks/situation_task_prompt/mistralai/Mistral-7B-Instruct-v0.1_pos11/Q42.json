    "Build a shelter: The first step to survival on a deserted island is to build a shelter that can protect you from the elements. You can use natural resources like branches, leaves, and vines to create a sturdy structure that will keep you dry and warm.",
    "Find food and water: Once you have built a shelter, you need to find a source of food and water. You can look for edible plants, fish in the sea, or birds in the sky. It's important to be careful about what you eat and drink, as some things on the island may be poisonous.",
    "Create a fire: Fire is essential for survival, as it can provide warmth, light, and a way to cook food. You can use dry wood, leaves, or grass to start a fire.",
    "Build a raft: If you want to leave the island, you will need a raft to get to a nearby shore. You can use materials like branches, leaves, and vines to build a sturdy raft that will float in the water.",
    "Learn to fish: If you want to catch fish for food, you will need to learn how to fish. You can use a fishing line or a spear to catch fish in the sea. It's important to be patient and to follow the fish's movements carefully."
