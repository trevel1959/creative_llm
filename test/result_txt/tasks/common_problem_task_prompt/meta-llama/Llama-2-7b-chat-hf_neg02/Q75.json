    "Eco-Tourism Hub: Establish the national park as a premier eco-tourism destination by offering unique and immersive experiences that allow visitors to connect with nature and learn about the park's diverse ecosystems. This could include guided hikes, birdwatching tours, and educational programs that focus on sustainable living practices.",
    "Sustainable Agriculture Initiative: Create a sustainable agriculture program within the park that focuses on organic farming methods, permaculture, and agroforestry. This would not only provide fresh produce for park visitors but also serve as a model for sustainable agriculture practices in other areas.",
    "Renewable Energy Hub: Convert the park's infrastructure to run on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would not only reduce the park's carbon footprint but also serve as a demonstration project for other areas to follow.",
    "Wildlife Rehabilitation and Release Program: Establish a wildlife rehabilitation program within the park to care for injured or orphaned wildlife with the goal of releasing them back into their natural habitats. This program could also serve as an educational opportunity for visitors to learn about wildlife conservation and rehabilitation techniques.",
    "Cultural Exchange Program: Develop a cultural exchange program that brings together indigenous communities and park rangers to share knowledge, traditions, and practices related to the park's ecosystems. This program could also promote cross-cultural understanding and respect, and help to preserve the cultural heritage of the communities involved."
