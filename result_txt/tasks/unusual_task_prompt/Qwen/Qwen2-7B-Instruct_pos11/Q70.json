    "**Personalized Artistic Coat Rack**: This idea combines functional utility with artistic expression. You can create a coat rack using various materials such as reclaimed wood, metal pipes, or even old bicycle parts. Each piece can be customized with unique designs, paintings, or even handcrafted elements. For example, using old bike wheels as hooks for coats and bags adds a vintage touch. This not only serves as a practical storage solution but also as a piece of art that reflects your personal style.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Develop a smart coat rack that integrates with your home automation system. It could include features like:    - **Lighting Control**: Automatically turn on or off the lights in the room when coats are hung or removed.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material**: Create a coat rack from sustainable and eco-friendly materials. Use materials like bamboo, reclaimed wood, recycled glass, or even cork. This idea aligns with the growing trend of sustainability and environmental consciousness. The design can focus on minimalism, using clean lines and natural textures to blend seamlessly into modern or minimalist interiors.",
    "**Interactive Social Media Display**: Turn your coat rack into a social media hub. It could display photos, videos, or messages from guests as they arrive. Here's how it works:    - **QR Code**: Guests scan a QR code on the wall to upload their pictures or messages directly to the display.",
    "**DIY Modular System**: Design a modular coat rack system that allows for customization and scalability. This system could consist of multiple panels or shelves that can be added or removed as needed. Each panel could have adjustable hooks or compartments, making it suitable for different spaces and needs. The modular aspect encourages creativity by allowing individuals to arrange the components in various configurations. Additionally, this approach promotes sustainability by encouraging reuse and adaptability rather than purchasing new racks every time space requirements change."
