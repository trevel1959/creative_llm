    "Customizable Fit: Design rubber gloves with adjustable straps or Velcro closures to ensure a snug and comfortable fit for each individual's hand. This feature would be especially useful for people who work with their hands in various capacities, such as chefs, musicians, or construction workers.",
    "Heat-Sensitive Technology: Incorporate thermochromic technology into the rubber gloves, allowing them to change color in response to temperature changes. For example, the gloves could turn blue when the wearer's hand is exposed to cold temperatures and turn red when it's exposed to heat. This feature would be useful for people who work in cold storage facilities or who need to check the temperature of food or drinks.",
    "Built-In Cooling System: Develop rubber gloves with built-in cooling gel packs or ice packs that can be activated when needed. This feature would be ideal for people who work in hot environments, such as warehouses or kitchens, as it would help keep their hands cool and comfortable.",
    "Grip Enhancement: Create rubber gloves with textured grips on the palmar surface to improve hand grip and dexterity. This feature would be useful for people who work with small objects, such as jewelry makers or surgeons, as it would allow them to hold and manipulate objects more easily.",
    "Smart Technology: Incorporate sensors and other smart technology into the rubber gloves to track hand movement, pressure, and temperature. This feature would be useful for people who need to monitor their hand movements and pressure, such as athletes or musicians, as it would allow them to track their progress and make adjustments as needed."
