    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a self-cleaning feature that utilizes a combination of UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and internal components of the washing machine. This would not only eliminate mold and bacteria but also reduce the need for manual cleaning, making maintenance easier for users. The machine could schedule self-cleaning cycles based on usage frequency.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a built-in dispenser that automatically releases eco-friendly detergent pods based on the load size and soil level detected. This system would minimize waste by using only the necessary amount of detergent, while also encouraging users to choose sustainable detergent options. Additionally, it could feature a compartment for adding essential oils for natural fragrance.",
    "**Multi-Function Wash and Dry System**: Develop a washing machine that can seamlessly transition from washing to drying without needing to transfer clothes. This could be achieved through a dual-chamber design where one chamber washes while the other dries, using a combination of heat pump technology and air circulation. This would save time and space, making laundry more convenient for users.",
    "**Interactive User Interface**: Introduce an augmented reality (AR) interface that can be projected onto a smartphone or tablet. Users could visualize their laundry settings and receive real-time feedback on the washing process. For example, they could see the wash cycle's progress, receive alerts for optimal drying times, or access tutorials for best practices in garment care.",
    "**Sound and Vibration Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced sound-dampening materials and vibration isolation technology to create a quieter washing machine. This would be particularly beneficial for urban living situations where noise can be a concern. The machine could feature a \"silent mode\" for nighttime use, allowing users to run their laundry without disturbing others."
