    "In a quiet village, there lived a shadow that drifted alone, unseen by all. It longed for companionship, watching as children played and lovers danced, but whenever someone turned, it would vanish into the corners. One stormy night, a curious girl, lost in her thoughts, noticed the flickering shadow against her wall. Instead of fleeing, she reached out, whispering, “You’re not alone.” The shadow, startled, felt warmth for the first time. From that night on, they shared secrets and laughter, transforming the lonely shadow into a beloved friend, finally free to dance in the moonlight, embraced by the girl’s light.",
