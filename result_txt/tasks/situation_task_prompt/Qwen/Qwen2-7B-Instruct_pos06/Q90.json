    "**Water Harvesting from Snow**: In areas where snowfall is common, one can collect water by building snow collection systems. These could be simple structures like funnel-shaped containers or more complex systems involving pipes and storage tanks. The melting snow would drip into the collection system, which can then be used for various purposes such as irrigation, drinking, or industrial use.",
    "**Desalination Plants**: Building large-scale desalination plants can convert seawater or brackish water into fresh water. This process involves using reverse osmosis, distillation, or other methods to remove salt and other minerals from the water, making it safe for human consumption and other uses.",
    "**Cloud Seeding**: This involves the controlled introduction of substances like silver nitrate into clouds to increase their water content, thus promoting rainfall. This technique, if refined for drought conditions, could potentially lead to localized water collection without waiting for natural rains.",
    "**Water Reclamation and Recycling**: Implementing advanced water treatment technologies to recycle wastewater into potable water. This could involve processes like microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet disinfection. ",
    "**Rainwater Collection from Urban Surfaces**: Designing and implementing rainwater harvesting systems on rooftops, pavements, and roads. This involves installing gutters, downpipes, and storage tanks that capture rainwater, which can then be used for non-potable purposes like gardening, car washing, or flushing toilets."
