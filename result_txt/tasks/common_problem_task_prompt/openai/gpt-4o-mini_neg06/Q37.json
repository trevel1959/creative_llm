    "**Budget Constraints**: Budgeting for an art exhibition can be challenging. Potential issues include underestimating costs for venue rental, marketing, installation, insurance for the artworks, and catering if refreshments are provided. If funding is insufficient, it could lead to cutting corners, resulting in a less professional presentation. It may also impact the ability to compensate artists fairly or afford necessary promotional materials.",
    "**Artist Coordination and Communication**: Organizing an exhibition involves collaborating with multiple artists. Miscommunication regarding deadlines, artwork specifications, or installation requirements can lead to confusion and frustration. Artists may have different expectations regarding how their work is displayed or the level of support they receive, leading to potential conflicts. Ensuring clear and consistent communication is vital to avoid misunderstandings.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the exhibition is essential to attract visitors. Problems may arise if the marketing strategy is not well-planned or if there is a lack of budget for advertising. Relying solely on social media may limit reach, especially if the target audience is not active online. Additionally, if the promotional materials do not accurately represent the exhibition's theme or quality, it could deter potential attendees.",
    "**Installation Challenges**: The physical installation of the artworks can present various problems. Issues such as damage during transport, improper hanging techniques, or lack of tools and materials can lead to delays and stress. If artworks are not displayed properly, it may affect the viewer's experience and the overall aesthetic of the exhibition. Additionally, coordinating the installation schedule with multiple artists can be complex, especially if their availability differs.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Creating an engaging experience for attendees is vital for a successful exhibition. Potential problems include a lack of interactive elements or educational materials that can enhance the viewer's understanding of the artworks. If the exhibition feels stagnant or uninviting, it may result in lower attendance and engagement. Planning activities such as artist talks, guided tours, or workshops can help foster a deeper connection with the audience."
