    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Design a leash that can easily adjust its length with a simple mechanism, allowing the owner to switch between a short leash for busy sidewalks and a longer leash for open areas. This could be achieved with a telescoping design or a retractable mechanism, enabling greater control and flexibility depending on the environment.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Leash**: Create a leash made from materials that can repel dirt and odors, or integrate a cleaning mechanism that uses UV light to sanitize the leash after each use. This would be especially beneficial for owners who walk their dogs in muddy or wet conditions, ensuring the leash stays clean and hygienic.",
    "**Interactive Leash with Training Features**: Develop a leash that includes built-in training tools, such as a clicker or vibration feedback, to help train dogs during walks. The leash could have a button that the owner can press to emit a sound or vibration to reinforce positive behavior, making walks more effective for training purposes.",
    "**Multi-Function Leash with Storage**: Design a leash that includes compartments for storing essentials like dog waste bags, treats, or keys. This would allow dog owners to carry everything they need for a walk without the hassle of juggling multiple items. The storage could be waterproof and secure, ensuring that items stay dry and safe during outings.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Leash Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a leash made from sustainable, recycled materials that are both durable and environmentally friendly. The leash could also feature biodegradable components for the parts that wear out, promoting eco-consciousness among pet owners and reducing plastic waste."
