    "**Self-Cleaning Umbrella**: Develop an umbrella that uses UV light to kill bacteria and mold, ensuring it remains hygienic between uses. This would involve integrating a small UV lamp inside the umbrella, which activates automatically when opened or closed, cleaning the fabric without the need for harsh chemicals.",
