    "**Modular Helmet Design**: Create a helmet with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize the fit, padding, and ventilation based on their riding conditions. For example, a cyclist could swap out a heavier shell for a lighter one for racing, or change the padding for better comfort during long rides. This modular approach could also allow for easy repairs, extending the lifespan of the helmet.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Develop a helmet that includes Bluetooth technology for hands-free communication with other cyclists or mobile devices. This could include voice-activated features to allow riders to take calls, listen to music, or communicate with a group without taking their hands off the handlebars. Additionally, a built-in microphone and speakers could facilitate clearer communication while riding.",
    "**Solar-Powered Safety Lights**: Incorporate solar panels into the design of the helmet to power built-in LED lights for enhanced visibility. These lights could automatically activate in low-light conditions, ensuring that cyclists are seen by drivers. The solar panels could also charge a small battery that powers other features, like the communication system or AR display.",
    "**Adaptive Impact Protection**: Utilize advanced materials that can change their properties based on the impact force. For example, the helmet could use a combination of soft and hard materials that become more rigid upon impact, providing enhanced protection without sacrificing comfort. This technology could also help to dissipate energy more effectively during a crash.",
    "**Personalized Fit with 3D Scanning**: Implement a 3D scanning feature that allows users to create a custom-fitted helmet based on the unique shape of their head. Using a smartphone app, cyclists could scan their head, and the helmet could be produced using 3D printing technology. This would ensure a perfect fit, increasing comfort and safety while also appealing to the growing trend of personalized products."
