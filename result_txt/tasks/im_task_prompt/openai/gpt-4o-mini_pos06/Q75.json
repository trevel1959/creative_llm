    "**Multi-Function Cooking Plates**: Design interchangeable cooking plates that allow the sandwich toaster to double as a grill, waffle maker, or even a pancake maker. Users could easily switch out the plates depending on what they want to prepare, making the appliance more versatile and reducing the need for multiple kitchen gadgets.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add fillings like cheese, sauces, or vegetables directly into the sandwich as it cooks. This feature would ensure even distribution of ingredients and reduce mess, while also allowing for a more streamlined sandwich-making process.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Function**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses steam or high heat to sanitize the cooking plates after use. This would save users time and effort in cleaning, making the sandwich toaster more user-friendly and appealing for everyday use.",
    "**Customizable Design**: Create a modular design that allows users to personalize their sandwich toaster with interchangeable outer shells or panels. This could include different colors, patterns, or even the option to print custom designs. Such customization would appeal to consumers looking to express their personal style in the kitchen.",
    "**Recipe Booklet with QR Codes**: Include a physical or digital recipe booklet with QR codes that link to video tutorials for making different types of sandwiches. This would not only provide inspiration but also guide users through the process of making gourmet sandwiches, enhancing their cooking experience."
