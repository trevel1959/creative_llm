    "**Modular Design**: A smartphone with a modular design that allows users to customize and upgrade specific components such as the camera, battery, and memory, would extend the lifespan of the device and provide more value over time. This would also make it easier for users to repair and replace parts, reducing electronic waste.",
    "**Dual-Screen Display**: Adding a second screen to the smartphone would provide more screen real estate for multitasking and increase productivity. The screens could be used for different purposes simultaneously, such as a full-screen display for watching videos and a smaller screen for texting or browsing.",
    "**Haptic Feedback and Touch Sensitivity**: Enhancing the haptic feedback system and increasing the touch sensitivity of the screen would improve the user experience by providing more tactile feedback when interacting with the device. This could be especially useful for gaming, where a more immersive experience is desired.",
    "**Smartphone with a Built-In Projector**: Integrating a small projector into the smartphone would allow users to project their content onto larger surfaces, making it a versatile tool for presentations, movie nights, or even gaming.",
    "**Smartphone with a Reverse Camera**: Adding a reverse camera that captures images and videos from the back of the device would enable users to take selfies without having to use a separate camera or hold the phone at an awkward angle. This would also provide new possibilities for photography and videography."
