    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with interchangeable parts, such as wheels, decks, and trucks. This would allow riders to customize their board based on their riding style, whether they prefer street skating, cruising, or tricks. Riders could swap out components easily, promoting creativity and personalization while also making it easier to replace worn-out parts.",
    "**Self-Adjusting Suspension System**: Develop a skateboard with an advanced suspension system that adjusts based on the terrain. Using sensors, the skateboard could detect whether itâ€™s on smooth pavement or rough terrain and adjust the wheel stiffness and height accordingly. This would provide a smoother ride and enhance stability, especially for those who like to ride in various environments.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features like LED lights, reflective strips, and a built-in horn or alarm system. The LED lights could be programmed to change colors based on speed or direction, improving visibility during night rides. The horn or alarm could be activated to alert pedestrians or other riders, enhancing safety in crowded areas.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign skateboards using sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or bio-composite materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a greener lifestyle. Additionally, skateboards could be manufactured using eco-friendly processes, reducing their carbon footprint.",
    "**Fitness Tracking Skateboard**: Incorporate fitness tracking technology that monitors heart rate, calories burned, and other fitness metrics while riding. This could be paired with a companion app that encourages users to set fitness goals and challenges, making skateboarding not only a recreational activity but also a fun way to stay fit."
