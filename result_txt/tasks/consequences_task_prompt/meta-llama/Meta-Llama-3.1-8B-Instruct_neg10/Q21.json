The city's inhabitants have developed a sophisticated understanding of musical theory, allowing them to convey complex ideas and emotions through intricate melodies.",

Those with the most melodically impressive voices or the rarest instruments hold positions of power, while those with less desirable voices or instruments are relegated to lower rungs. The ruling class uses their musical abilities to maintain control, with those who refuse to participate in the musical hierarchy being ostracized or even persecuted. This system has led to a culture of musical competition, where individuals are encouraged to hone their skills and rise through the ranks.",
