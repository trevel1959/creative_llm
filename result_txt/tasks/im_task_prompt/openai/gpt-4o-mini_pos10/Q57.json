    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback**:    - Integrate haptic feedback technology that simulates different textures and sensations based on the task at hand. For instance, when scrolling through a webpage, users could feel a gentle resistance mimicking the sensation of paper. This would enhance the tactile experience and provide a more immersive interaction, especially for gamers or designers who rely on precision.",
    "**Integrated Touchpad Surface**:    - Design a mouse that incorporates a touchpad on its surface. Users can swipe, pinch, and perform gestures directly on the mouse itself. This dual functionality would allow for more fluid navigation, enabling actions like zooming in/out or switching between applications without needing to move to a separate touchpad or touchscreen.",
    "**Smart Tracking and Surface Adaptation**:    - Equip the mouse with advanced sensors that can detect the surface it's being used on (wood, glass, fabric, etc.) and automatically adjust its tracking speed and sensitivity. This would ensure optimal performance regardless of the environment, enhancing user experience whether they're working on a desk, couch, or even on their lap.",
    "**Customizable Modular Design**:    - Create a mouse with interchangeable parts, allowing users to customize its shape, buttons, and even the weight. This modular design could cater to different preferences, from ergonomic shapes for comfort to lightweight components for gaming. Users could also swap out different button configurations for specific tasks, such as graphic design or gaming.",
    "**Voice Command Integration**:    - Integrate voice command capabilities into the mouse, allowing users to perform tasks hands-free. By incorporating a microphone and voice recognition software, users could execute commands like opening applications, searching the web, or controlling media playback just by speaking. This feature would enhance accessibility for users with disabilities and improve multitasking efficiency."
