    "**Integrated Holographic Display**: Introduce a laptop that features a built-in holographic projector capable of displaying 3D images and data above the keyboard. This would allow users to interact with 3D models, diagrams, or even video calls in a more immersive way. It could be particularly useful for designers, architects, and educators, enabling a more engaging and interactive experience without the need for additional equipment.",
    "**Modular Components**: Create a laptop with modular parts that can be easily swapped out or upgraded. For example, users could replace the RAM, storage, or even the processor without needing to purchase an entirely new device. This would promote sustainability by reducing electronic waste and allowing users to customize their laptops according to their evolving needs.",
    "**Biometric Personalization**: Develop a laptop that uses advanced biometric sensors to tailor the user experience. By scanning fingerprints, facial features, or even voice recognition, the laptop could automatically adjust settings such as keyboard layout, display preferences, and software shortcuts to suit individual users. This would streamline workflow in shared environments, making it easier for multiple users to operate the same device.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate a laptop made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as recycled plastics, organic composites, and bamboo. This laptop would not only reduce the carbon footprint of its production but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, it could feature a modular design that allows for easy disassembly and recycling at the end of its life cycle.",
    "**Smart Cooling System**: Implement a dynamic cooling system that utilizes AI to monitor the laptop's temperature and adjust fan speeds or activate cooling pads only when necessary. This would enhance performance while reducing noise and energy consumption. Users could also customize the cooling preferences for gaming, heavy workloads, or silent operation modes, making the laptop versatile for different tasks."
