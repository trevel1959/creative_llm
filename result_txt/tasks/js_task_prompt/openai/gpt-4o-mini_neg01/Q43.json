    "**Urban Planning and Architecture**: I would collaborate with urban planners and architects to design more efficient and sustainable buildings. By seeing through walls, I could assess the structural integrity of existing buildings, identify hidden issues like water damage or pest infestations, and propose improvements. This power could also help visualize how new constructions would fit within existing landscapes, ensuring that designs are harmonious with their surroundings and optimizing space usage.",
    "**Historical Exploration**: Imagine being able to explore ancient ruins without the need for invasive excavation. I would use this ability to peer through the walls of historical sites, uncovering hidden chambers, artifacts, or murals that have remained unseen for centuries. This could revolutionize archaeology, allowing researchers to document and preserve history while minimizing damage to the sites. I would create an interactive app that shares these discoveries with the public, fostering a deeper appreciation for history and heritage.",
    "**Medical Applications**: I would partner with medical professionals to develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool for hospitals. By utilizing the power to see through walls, I could visualize the human bodyâ€™s internal structure, allowing for early detection of tumors, fractures, or other medical conditions without the need for X-rays or MRIs. This would reduce radiation exposure for patients and provide doctors with immediate insights, improving treatment outcomes and patient care.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: I would leverage this ability to help resolve conflicts in tense situations, such as hostage scenarios or negotiations. By seeing through walls, I could gather intelligence on the dynamics of a situation without putting anyone in danger. This information would allow negotiators to strategize effectively, ensuring the safety of all parties involved and potentially saving lives. Additionally, I could assist law enforcement in tracking down missing persons or locating stolen property.",
    "**Artistic Inspiration**: As an artist, I would use my power to create immersive installations that blend the physical and digital worlds. By visualizing what lies behind walls, I could design art pieces that reveal hidden narratives or stories, encouraging viewers to reflect on the unseen aspects of life. For example, an installation could showcase the life of a building, displaying its history through projections of past inhabitants or events, allowing visitors to experience a multi-dimensional journey through time and space."
