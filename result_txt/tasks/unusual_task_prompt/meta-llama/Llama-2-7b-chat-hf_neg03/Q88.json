    "Tissue Box with a Twist: Create a tissue box with a unique shape or design that stands out from the traditional rectangular or square shape. For example, a tissue box in the form of a miniature art piece, such as a sculpture or a painting, could be created. This would not only add aesthetic appeal to the bathroom but also serve as a conversation starter.",
    "Tissue Box with a Purpose: Design a tissue box with a built-in purifying function, such as a small fan or a fragrance diffuser. This would not only provide a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the user but also make the tissue box more functional and practical.",
    "Interactive Tissue Box: Create a tissue box that responds to voice commands or gestures, such as a smart tissue box that can detect when a user needs a tissue and dispenses one automatically. This would not only add convenience to the user but also make the bathroom experience more futuristic and high-tech.",
    "Tissue Box with a Personal Touch: Design a tissue box with a customizable design or message, such as a tissue box with a personalized message or a tissue box that can be customized with a user's name or initials. This would make the tissue box more personal and meaningful to the user, and add a thoughtful touch to the bathroom.",
    "Tissue Box with a Sustainable Twist: Create a tissue box made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled paper. This would not only reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of the tissue box but also promote sustainability and eco-friendliness in the bathroom."
