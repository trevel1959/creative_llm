    "Water-saving: The idea is to create a garden hose that not only saves water but also helps to conserve energy. This hose will have a smart sensor that detects the water pressure and flow rate, and adjusts the water delivery accordingly. The hose will also have a built-in solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, which can be used to power the hose's water delivery system.",
    "-Hose: The idea is to create a garden hose that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. The hose will have a built-in WiFi module that allows users to control the flow of water, adjust the water pressure, and even turn the hose on and off from anywhere in the world.",
    "Eco-Hose: The idea is to create a garden hose that uses eco-friendly materials and technology. The hose will be made from recycled materials, such as plastic bottles and old tires, and will have a low-flow design that reduces water usage. The hose will also have a built-in filtration system that removes harmful chemicals and contaminants from the water.",
    "Hose-: The idea is to create a garden hose that can be customized to fit the specific needs of the user. The hose will have a modular design that allows users to add or remove different attachments, such as a sprinkler, nozzle, or watering can. The hose will also have a built-in pressure gauge and flow meter that allows users to monitor their water usage.",
    "Hose-: The idea is to create a garden hose that is-proof, meaning it will never run out of water. The hose will have a built-in water storage tank that allows users to store water and use it as needed. The hose will also have a low-flow design that reduces water usage, and a built-in pressure regulator that ensures consistent water pressure."
