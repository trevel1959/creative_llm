    "Sleep Pods: In a world without nighttime, people could utilize sleep pods that simulate the effects of darkness through the use of specialized lighting and sound technology. These pods would be designed to mimic the natural rhythms of the body, allowing for a restful and rejuvenating sleep.",
    "Circadian Rhythm Adjustment: With the absence of nighttime, people could adapt their circadian rhythms to a 24-hour cycle, where they would sleep for shorter periods throughout the day and night. This would allow for a more consistent sleep schedule and reduce the need for traditional sleeping arrangements.",
    "Dream Incubation: Without nighttime, people could focus on lucid dreaming and dream incubation techniques to harness the power of their subconscious during the day. This could involve practices such as meditation, visualization, and reality checking to induce lucid dreaming states.",
    "Sleep-Sharing Communities: In a world without nighttime, people could form sleep-sharing communities where they would take turns sleeping and being awake. This would allow for a social and supportive environment where people could rest and recharge without the need for individual sleeping arrangements.",
    "Solar-Powered Sleep: With the absence of nighttime, people could harness the power of the sun to power their sleep. This could involve using specialized solar-powered sleeping pods or even sleeping directly on the ground, using the earth's natural temperature and light to regulate their sleep."
