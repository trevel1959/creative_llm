    "DNA Verification: One way to prove identity without identification documents is through DNA verification. This could involve collecting a DNA sample, such as a cheek swab or blood test, and comparing it to a database of known individuals. This method is highly accurate and could be used to identify individuals with a high degree of confidence.",
    "Personal Identification Markings: Another option is to use personal identification markings, such as tattoos, scarification, or distinctive birthmarks. These markings could be unique to each individual and could be used to identify them without the need for official documents.",
    "Community Knowledge: In a society where all forms of identification have disappeared, community knowledge could play a crucial role in identifying individuals. People could rely on their personal relationships and knowledge of their community members to verify identities. This could involve asking neighbors, friends, or colleagues to vouch for an individual's identity.",
    "Skill-Based Identification: In a post-identification society, skills and abilities could become a new form of identification. For example, a person who is an expert in a particular field or trade could be recognized and respected as an authority, without the need for formal identification documents.",
    "Time-Based Identification: Time could become a new form of identification in a world without identification documents. For example, a person who has lived in a particular place for a long time could be recognized as a local and given special privileges or rights based on their length of residence. Alternatively, a person who has a unique life experience or story could become a recognized figure in their community, based on their personal history and achievements."
