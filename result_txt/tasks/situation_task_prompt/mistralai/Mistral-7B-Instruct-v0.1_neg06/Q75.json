    "Hydrogen fuel cells: In the absence of oil, hydrogen fuel cells could be used to power vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by converting hydrogen gas into electricity through a chemical reaction. The electricity generated can be used to power electric motors, which in turn can power vehicles.",
    "Solar-powered vehicles: Solar panels can be installed on vehicles to harness the power of the sun and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle's motor. This would require the development of more efficient and lightweight solar panels that can be easily integrated into vehicles.",
    "Wind-powered vehicles: Wind turbines can be installed on vehicles to harness the power of the wind and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle's motor. This would require the development of more efficient and lightweight wind turbines that can be easily integrated into vehicles.",
    "Nuclear-powered vehicles: Nuclear reactors can be used to generate electricity to power vehicles. This would require the development of smaller and safer nuclear reactors that can be easily integrated into vehicles.",
    "Biomass-powered vehicles: Biomass such as wood, agricultural waste, and other organic matter can be converted into biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. These biofuels can be used to power vehicles, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. This would require the development of more efficient and cost-effective methods for converting biomass into biofuels."
