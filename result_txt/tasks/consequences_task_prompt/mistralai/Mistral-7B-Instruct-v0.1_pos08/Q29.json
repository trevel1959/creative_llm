    "The first consequence of all humans remembering everything they read is that the spread of information would be exponentially faster. People would be able to share knowledge and ideas more easily, leading to a rapid increase in knowledge and intellectual advancement.",
    "However, the abundance of information could also lead to information overload. People may become overwhelmed with the amount of information available, leading to a decrease in productivity and efficiency.",
    "People may also become overly critical of information they read, as they would have a higher standard of knowledge and be more likely to question the accuracy of information they encounter.",
    "Additionally, people may become more self-reliant and less dependent on external sources of information, as they would have the ability to recall information they have read in the past.",
    "The ability to recall information may also have implications for personal relationships and social interactions. People may be more likely to engage in conversations about books they have read, leading to a more intellectual and well-rounded society."
