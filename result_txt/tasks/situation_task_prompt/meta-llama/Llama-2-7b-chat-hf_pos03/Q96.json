    "Artificial Sand Beaches: With the disappearance of natural sand, beachgoers could turn to artificial sand alternatives. One idea is to create man-made sand beaches using crushed recycled glass. This eco-friendly solution not only provides a similar beach experience but also helps reduce waste and promote sustainability. The crushed glass could be colored to match the natural hues of sand, and it would be durable enough to withstand the elements and provide a consistent beach texture.",
    "Sand-Free Beach Activities: Another creative solution is to focus on beach activities that don't require sand. For instance, beachgoers could enjoy water sports like surfing, kayaking, or paddleboarding. These activities would provide a thrilling experience without the need for sand. Alternatively, beachgoers could engage in land-based activities like beach volleyball, frisbee, or yoga, which would still allow for a fun and relaxing beach experience.",
    "Sand-Based Virtual Reality Experiences: In a more futuristic approach, people could enjoy virtual reality experiences that simulate the feeling of being on a beach without the need for physical sand. This could involve immersive VR environments that mimic the sights, sounds, and sensations of a beach, complete with virtual sand between one's toes. This innovative solution would allow people to enjoy the beach experience without any physical limitations.",
    "Aquatic-Themed Parks: If sand were to disappear, people could turn to aquatic-themed parks as an alternative beach destination. These parks could feature water slides, wave pools, and other water-based attractions that would provide a similar sense of excitement and relaxation as a beach. The parks could also incorporate sand-free beaches, such as man-made beaches or lagoons, where visitors could enjoy swimming and sunbathing without the need for natural sand.",
    "Floating Islands: As a more unconventional solution, people could create floating islands in the ocean as a new type of beach destination. These islands could be made from recycled materials like old shipping containers or plastic waste, and they could be designed to provide a beach experience without the need for sand. The islands could feature sand-free beaches, swimming areas, and even sand-free"
