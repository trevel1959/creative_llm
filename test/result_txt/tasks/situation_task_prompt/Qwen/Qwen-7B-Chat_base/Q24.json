    "Development of new technologies: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, there will be a significant need for alternative solutions to help individuals with poor vision. One possible solution could be the development of new technologies that can help people see better. For example, scientists could work on creating implants or artificial corneas that could restore vision.",
    "Use of natural light: Another way individuals with poor vision could cope is by making use of natural light. They could wear clothing that allows more light in, such as lighter colors or sheer fabrics. Additionally, they could move their desks closer to windows or invest in light therapy lamps to simulate sunlight.",
