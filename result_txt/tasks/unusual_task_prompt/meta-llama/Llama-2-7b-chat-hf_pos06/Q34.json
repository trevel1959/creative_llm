    "A smart tape measure that uses AI to detect the distance and calculate measurements with increased accuracy. It can also detect the type of material being measured, such as wood, metal, or fabric, and provide relevant units of measurement.",
    "A tape measure with a built-in laser distance sensor, allowing for quick and accurate measurements without the need to physically touch the object being measured. It can also project a virtual measurement line onto the object, making it easier to measure long distances.",
    "A tape measure that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to display measurements and calculations in real-time. Users can see the measurements superimposed onto the object being measured, making it easier to visualize and understand the measurements.",
    "A tape measure that uses 3D scanning technology to create a 3D model of the object being measured, allowing for more accurate measurements and calculations. It can also provide detailed information about the object's shape, size, and material composition.",
    "A tape measure that uses IoT (Internet of Things) technology to connect to a user's smartphone or tablet, allowing for remote measurements and data tracking. Users can take measurements from anywhere and access them later for reference or sharing."
