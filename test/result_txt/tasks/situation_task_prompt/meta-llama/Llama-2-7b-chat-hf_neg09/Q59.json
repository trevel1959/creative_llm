    "Solar-Powered Umbrellas: Create umbrellas with built-in solar panels that harness energy from the sun during the day. These umbrellas could have a detachable battery pack that can be recharged and used at night or on cloudy days. This would provide a reliable source of light for individuals who live in cloudy areas.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Drones: Develop drones equipped with specialized seeding materials that can be released into the clouds to stimulate the formation of rainbows. These drones could be controlled remotely and could be programmed to release the seeding materials at specific times of the day to maximize sunlight exposure. This innovative solution would provide a natural and sustainable way to increase sunlight in cloudy areas.",
    "Sun-Powered Windows: Design windows with integrated photovoltaic cells that can convert sunlight into electricity. These windows could be installed in homes, offices, and other buildings, providing a constant source of energy and reducing the need for traditional lighting sources. This would not only provide light during cloudy days but also help reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.",
    "Cloud-Busting Balloons: Develop high-altitude balloons equipped with specialized instruments that can break up clouds and create openings for sunlight to pass through. These balloons could be launched during cloudy periods and could be guided using GPS and weather tracking technology. This innovative solution would provide a temporary and targeted way to increase sunlight exposure in specific areas.",
    "Smart Lighting Systems: Develop intelligent lighting systems that can adjust their brightness and color based on the amount of sunlight available. These systems could be integrated into homes, offices, and public spaces, providing a comfortable and energy-efficient lighting solution during cloudy days. By using sensors and machine learning algorithms, these systems could optimize lighting levels based on the time of day, weather conditions, and occupancy, resulting in significant energy savings."
