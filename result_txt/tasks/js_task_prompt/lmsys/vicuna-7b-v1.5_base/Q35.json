    "Quagga: The quagga was a unique animal that lived in South Africa during the 19th century. It was a half-zebra, half-quagga hybrid that had distinctive stripes on its body. Bringing it back to life would allow us to learn more about the evolution of zebras and quaggas, as well as the impact of human activity on wildlife populations.",
    "Dodo: The dodo was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the 17th century due to human activity and the introduction of non-native species. Bringing it back to life would be a way to right a historical wrong and learn more about the ecology and evolution of the dodo.",
    "Saber-Toothed Cat: The saber-toothed cat was a large predator that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. It had long canine teeth and was one of the last species to go extinct before the arrival of humans in North America. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its hunting behavior and ecology, as well as the impact of human activity on wildlife populations.",
    "Thylacine: The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a marsupial predator that lived in Australia and Tasmania. It became extinct in the 20th century due to human activity and habitat loss. Bringing it back to life would be a way to preserve the biodiversity of Australia and learn more about the ecology and evolution of the thylacine.",
    "Passenger Pigeon: The passenger pigeon was a bird that lived in North America and was one of the most abundant species on the planet. It became extinct in the late 19th century due to hunting and habitat loss. Bringing it back to life would allow us to study its ecology and behavior, as well as the impact of human activity on wildlife populations."
