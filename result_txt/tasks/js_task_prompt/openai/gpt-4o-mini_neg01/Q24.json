    "**Smart Mobility Hubs**: The city would have integrated mobility hubs equipped with electric vehicle charging stations, bike-sharing programs, and autonomous public transport systems. Each hub would be connected to a real-time transportation app that provides residents with seamless navigation options, allowing them to choose the most efficient mode of transport based on their destination and current traffic conditions. This feature would reduce congestion and promote eco-friendly travel.",
    "**Civic Tech Platforms**: A digital platform would allow residents to engage directly with local government and community initiatives. Through this platform, citizens could propose ideas, vote on community projects, and access city services. This transparent and participatory approach would foster a sense of ownership and accountability, ensuring that the city evolves according to the needs and desires of its inhabitants.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Zones**: The city would feature designated cultural exchange zones where artists, musicians, and performers from diverse backgrounds can showcase their talents. These zones would host regular events, workshops, and festivals, encouraging cultural appreciation and dialogue among residents. This feature would not only enrich the city's cultural fabric but also promote inclusivity and community bonding.",
    "**Sustainable Energy Microgrids**: Each neighborhood would operate its own microgrid powered by renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems. This decentralized approach to energy management would ensure that each area can produce and manage its energy consumption independently, enhancing resilience against power outages and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Excess energy could be shared or sold back to the main grid, promoting energy equity.",
    "**Biophilic Architecture**: Buildings in the city would be designed with biophilic principles, integrating natural elements into their architecture. This would include large windows for natural light, indoor gardens, and water features that mimic natural ecosystems. Such designs would enhance the well-being of residents by creating a calming environment that reduces stress and improves mental health, while also optimizing energy efficiency through natural ventilation and temperature regulation."
