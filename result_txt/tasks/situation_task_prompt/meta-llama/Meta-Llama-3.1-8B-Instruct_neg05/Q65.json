    "**Glowing Fiber Optic Flooring**: I would design a special type of fiber optic flooring that uses microscopic glass fibers to transmit light from a central hub. The fibers would be embedded in the floor, creating a radiant glow that illuminates the room from the ground up, creating a futuristic and mesmerizing effect.",
    "**Bioluminescent Paint**: I would develop a special type of bioluminescent paint that uses microorganisms to produce a soft, ethereal light. The paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or even furniture, creating a unique and captivating lighting experience that is both sustainable and energy-efficient.",
    "**Smart Fabric**: I would design a special type of smart fabric that can absorb and store light energy during the day, and then release it at night in the form of a gentle, warm glow. The fabric could be used to create curtains, tablecloths, or even clothing that provides a soft, ambient light.",
    "**LED Terrarium**: I would create a self-sustaining LED terrarium that uses a miniature ecosystem to generate light.
