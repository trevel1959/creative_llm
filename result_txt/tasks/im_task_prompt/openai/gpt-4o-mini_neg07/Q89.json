    "**Interchangeable Plates for Versatility**: Design a waffle iron with interchangeable cooking plates that allow users to create different styles of waffles, such as Belgian, classic, or even stuffed waffles. The plates could be easily swapped out and could include designs for other breakfast items, like pancakes or grilled cheese, making the waffle iron a multi-functional kitchen appliance.",
    "**Built-in Batter Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in batter dispenser that allows users to pour the exact amount of batter needed for each waffle. This feature could help reduce mess and ensure uniformity in size. The dispenser could also have adjustable settings for different batter types and a heating element to keep the batter warm.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses steam to sanitize the cooking plates after use. This would make cleanup effortless, allowing users to simply add water and press a button. The steam would help loosen any stuck-on batter, making it easier to wipe down the plates afterward.",
    "**Customizable Temperature Control**: Enhance the temperature control system to allow users to set specific cooking temperatures for different batters or desired outcomes. This feature could include a digital display that shows the current temperature and a timer that alerts users when the waffles are done based on their selected settings.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Focus on sustainability by using eco-friendly materials in the construction of the waffle iron, such as recycled aluminum and biodegradable non-stick coatings. Additionally, the product could be designed for energy efficiency, consuming less power during operation and featuring an automatic shut-off function for safety."
