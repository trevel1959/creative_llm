    "**Echoes in the Mind**: A person's memories are stored as a complex network of neurons in their brain. In the absence of visual records, people would rely on their auditory and tactile memories to recall past events. They would remember the sounds, smells, and sensations associated with a particular moment, allowing them to reconstruct the past in their minds. For instance, the smell of freshly baked cookies might transport someone back to their childhood, while the sound of their grandmother's laughter could evoke memories of family gatherings.",
    "**Storytelling Sessions**: Without visual records, people would turn to oral tradition to pass down stories and memories. They would gather around to share tales of their ancestors, and the act of storytelling would become an essential part of their culture. Elders would take on the role of historians, sharing their experiences and wisdom with younger generations. This would create a rich tapestry of collective memory, where stories would be woven and passed down through the ages.",
    "**Emotional Resonance**: People would rely on their emotional connections to remember past events and people. They would recall the emotions they felt during a particular moment, such as joy, sadness, or fear, and use those emotions to recreate the experience in their minds. This would allow them to relive the past in a deeply personal and intimate way, even without visual records. For example, the feeling of excitement and nervousness on their wedding day would be etched in their memory, even if they couldn't recall the exact details of the event.",
    "**Kinesthetic Memories**: People would use their bodily memories to recall past events. They would remember the sensations of movement, posture, and touch, allowing them to reconstruct the past in a tactile way. For instance, the feeling of holding a loved one's hand could evoke memories of a family vacation, while the sensation of riding a bike could transport someone back to their childhood.",
    "**Environmental Imprinting**: People would use their surroundings to remember past events and people. They would associate specific locations, landmarks, and objects with memories, allowing them to recreate the past in their minds. For example, the smell of a particular flower might remind someone of a trip to a foreign country, while the sound of a specific song might evoke memories of a first love. This would create a rich and immersive connection to the past, where memories would be tied to specific places and objects. [/INST] "
