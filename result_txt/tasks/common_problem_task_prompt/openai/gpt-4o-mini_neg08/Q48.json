    "**Safety Concerns**: Introducing a new sport can lead to safety issues, especially if the rules and regulations are not well-defined. Without proper safety protocols, participants may be at risk of injuries. To mitigate this, a comprehensive safety manual should be developed, outlining protective gear requirements, training programs, and emergency response procedures to ensure that players can participate safely.",
    "**Establishing Rules and Regulations**: Defining clear and fair rules is crucial for any sport. A lack of consensus on the rules can lead to confusion and disputes among players and officials. To tackle this, a committee of experienced athletes, coaches, and sports officials could be formed to draft and refine the rules through a series of trial games and feedback sessions.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Getting people interested in a new sport can be challenging. Without effective marketing strategies, the sport may struggle to gain traction. To combat this, a multi-faceted marketing campaign could be launched, including social media outreach, partnerships with schools and community centers, and hosting exhibition matches to showcase the sport and engage potential players and fans.",
    "**Sustainability and Funding**: Securing funding for a new sport can be a significant hurdle, especially in the early stages when interest is still building. Without financial support, it may be difficult to organize events, create promotional materials, or provide necessary equipment. To address this, a crowdfunding campaign could be initiated, along with seeking sponsorships from local businesses and grants from sports organizations to ensure sustainability.",
    "**Cultural Acceptance**: The acceptance of a new sport can vary greatly across different cultures and communities. If the sport does not resonate with local values or traditions, it may face resistance. To overcome this, community engagement initiatives could be launched to involve local leaders and influencers in the development process, ensuring the sport aligns with cultural norms and values."
