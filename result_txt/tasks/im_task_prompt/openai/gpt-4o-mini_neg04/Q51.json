    "**Modular Table Assistant Design**:    - Create a modular table assistant that can be customized based on user needs. Different modules could include a wine cooler, a spice rack, or a tablet holder for recipes. Users could easily swap out modules depending on the occasion, making it versatile for casual dining, formal events, or family gatherings.",
    "**Interactive Projection Feature**:    - Integrate a projection system that can display recipes, cooking instructions, or even a virtual table setting on the surface of the table. This feature would allow users to visualize how to prepare a dish or set the table, enhancing the dining experience with an interactive element.",
    "**Built-in Communication Hub**:    - Transform the table assistant into a communication hub that connects family members or guests through video calls or messaging. This would allow people to stay connected during meals, especially if some family members are remote. The assistant could also facilitate group video calls for virtual dinners or family gatherings.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Solutions**:    - Design the table assistant using sustainable materials and integrate solar panels or energy-efficient systems. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint but also power the assistant with renewable energy. Additionally, it could have a built-in recycling bin for food waste, promoting eco-friendly dining practices.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Support**:    - Incorporate AR technology that allows users to see virtual elements overlaid on their dining experience. For instance, when preparing a meal, users could point their smartphone or tablet at the table assistant, and it would show step-by-step cooking instructions or visualizations of the final dish, making cooking more engaging and informative."
