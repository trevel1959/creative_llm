    "**Smart Laundry Sorting Robot**: Design a robot that utilizes AI to automatically sort laundry based on fabric type, color, and fabric care instructions. This robot can place each item of clothing into the correct washing basket, reducing confusion and misplacement. It could even include features like stain detection and treatment before washing.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Sorting System**: Create a laundry basket with a hidden mechanism that sorts clothes by size or type as they are placed inside. For example, as an item is dropped in, sensors would trigger a small flap to guide it to the correct section (like delicates, darks, etc.). This system would save time sorting clothes when it's time to wash them.",
    "**Eco-friendly Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic. The basket could also have compartments for different types of laundry (e.g., whites, colors, delicates) and include a removable mesh bottom to help air dry clothes faster. This product promotes environmentally friendly habits while addressing the need for organization.",
    "**Interactive Laundry App**: Create an app that pairs with smart laundry baskets equipped with sensors. The app would track what's in each basket, suggest sorting tips based on fabric care guidelines, and even remind users when their laundry needs attention. Users could also set preferences for sorting or receive alerts when certain items need to be washed separately due to stains or delicate fabrics.",
    "**Personalized Laundry Service Subscription**: Offer a subscription service where customers receive personalized laundry baskets with customized labels indicating which items should be washed together. The baskets could also come with a barcode scanner that links to a digital platform, providing information on fabric care, cleaning products recommendations, and tips on extending garment life. This service caters to busy individuals who may struggle with organizing their laundry tasks effectively."
