    "Increased Meteorite Impact Risk: Two moons would increase the number of potential impact points for meteorites, potentially leading to more frequent and severe meteorite impacts on the Earth's surface.",
    "Atmospheric Changes: The gravitational interactions between the Earth and two moons could lead to changes in the Earth's atmosphere, possibly affecting weather patterns and climate.",
    "Navigational Challenges: The presence of two moons would make navigation more challenging for both humans and animals, as they would need to adapt to the new celestial configuration.",
    "Geological Activity: The gravitational interactions between the Earth and two moons could lead to increased geological activity, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.",
    "Light Refraction: The presence of two moons could cause changes in the way light is refracted through the Earth's atmosphere, potentially affecting the way we perceive the sky and stars."
