    "**Incorporating a Smart Display**: Design a juicer with an integrated touch screen display. This display can not only show recipes and juicing tips but also allow users to customize their juice blends based on personal health goals or preferences. The display could also provide nutritional information about the juice being made.",
    "**Portable and Solar-Powered Juicer**: Develop a portable, battery-operated juicer that can be powered by solar energy. This would be particularly useful for outdoor activities such as camping, picnics, or events where electricity is not readily available. The device would have a compact design with a built-in solar panel and a rechargeable battery, making it eco-friendly and versatile.",
    "**Smartphone Controlled Juicer**: Create a juicer that connects to a user's smartphone through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The app can offer a variety of features like step-by-step juicing instructions, track the usage time, suggest new recipes, monitor cleaning schedules, and even order replacement parts directly from the app.",
    "**Automated Cleaning System**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature in the juicer that uses ultrasonic vibrations to clean the juicing components automatically. This would significantly reduce the time and effort required for cleaning and prevent any leftover pulp or juice from spoiling. The system could be activated through a button on the juicer or remotely via the smartphone app.",
    "**Customizable Parts and Accessories**: Offer modular components that allow users to upgrade or replace parts easily, such as different blades for different types of fruits and vegetables, or interchangeable strainers for varying juice textures. This approach would cater to a wide range of juicing needs and preferences, encouraging repeat purchases and reducing waste."
