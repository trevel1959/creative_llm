This could lead to a more democratic and just society.",
    "Increased Violence: On the other hand, if all guns suddenly disappeared, it could also lead to an increase in violence. People who are used to using guns as a means of self-defense or intimidation may resort to other methods of violence, such as physical attacks or using other weapons.",
