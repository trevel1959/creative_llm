    "**Innovative Lawn Mower Attachment System**: Develop a modular system that allows for easy attachment of various tools to the lawn mower. This could include attachments for edging, trimming, aerating, and even planting seeds. The system would consist of interchangeable components that attach securely to the mower deck, allowing homeowners to tackle multiple lawn care tasks without needing separate equipment.",
    "**Electric Lawn Mower with Solar Charging**: Create an electric lawn mower that is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and includes solar panels on its top or sides. This design would enable users to charge the mower using sunlight during periods when they're not mowing, making it an eco-friendly solution that reduces reliance on electricity from the grid. ",
    "**Smart Lawn Mower with GPS Navigation**: Introduce a smart lawn mower equipped with GPS technology that can navigate around your yard, avoiding obstacles like trees, rocks, and flower beds. The mower could also map out the most efficient cutting patterns and remember these layouts, optimizing future mowing sessions. Additionally, it could send notifications to the user's smartphone when maintenance is needed or when the mowing is complete.",
    "**Hybrid Gas-Electric Lawn Mower**: Design a hybrid lawn mower that combines the power of a gasoline engine with the efficiency of an electric motor. During high-demand tasks like thick grass cutting, the gasoline engine would provide additional power, while in lighter conditions, the electric motor would take over, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The mower would have a switch to choose between the two power sources based on the user's needs.",
    "**Self-Propelled and Self-Charging Lawn Mower**: Develop a self-propelled lawn mower that utilizes kinetic energy from the mowing process to charge its battery. The mower would have a flywheel mechanism that captures energy generated by the blades as they cut the grass, converting this energy into electricity that charges the internal battery. Over time, this would allow the mower to run longer before needing to be plugged in, significantly reducing the need for manual charging."
