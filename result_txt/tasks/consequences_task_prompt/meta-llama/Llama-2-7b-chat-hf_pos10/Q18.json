    "Temporal archeology: Time travel could allow archeologists to uncover artifacts and evidence from the past that were previously inaccessible. This could lead to a deeper understanding of human history and the development of new technologies.",
    "Temporal ethics: As time travel becomes possible, ethical considerations must be made regarding the impact of temporal travelers on the timeline.
