    "Use candles: One of the simplest and most effective ways to light up a room at night is by using candles. You can place them around the room, on the tables, and on the windowsills. This will create a warm and cozy atmosphere, and the flickering flames will add a touch of magic to the room.",
    "Use LED lights: Another option is to use LED lights. These lights are energy-efficient and long-lasting, and they can be used to light up the entire room or just a specific area. You can use them to create a soft, ambient glow or to a bright, task-oriented light.",
    "Use glow-in-the-dark furniture: If you have furniture with built-in LED lights, you can use them to light up the room at night. These lights are often designed to be unobtrusive during the day but can be turned on at night to provide a soft, warm light.",
    "Use natural light: If you have windows in your room, you can use the natural light to light up the room at night. This is especially effective if you have sheer curtains or blinds that allow the light to pass through. You can also use reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or metallic surfaces, to bounce the light around the room and create a brighter, more even light.",
    "Use solar-powered lanterns: If you have a small room or outdoor space, you can use solar-powered lanterns to light it up at night. These lanterns are charged during the day by the sun and can be used to provide a soft, warm light at night. They are also environmentally friendly and don't require any electricity."
