    "**Solar-Powered LED Indicator Bell**: This bicycle bell would be equipped with a small solar panel that powers an LED light. When the bell is rung, the LED lights up in a vibrant color, increasing visibility for cyclists, especially during twilight or nighttime rides. This feature not only enhances safety but also serves as a warning signal to pedestrians.",
    "**Multi-Tone Bell with Custom Sounds**: Instead of a single ringing sound, this bell would allow users to choose from a variety of tones and sounds, including classic bells, playful tunes, or even recorded messages. Users could personalize their bell to match their style or mood, making it a fun accessory while also providing a distinct sound that sets them apart from other cyclists.",
    "**Vibration-Enabled Handlebar Bell**: For cyclists who are hard of hearing or in noisy environments, this innovative bell would include a vibration feature that can be felt through the handlebars. When activated, it sends a strong vibration signal, ensuring that the rider is alerted to use the bell when needed, thereby enhancing safety and awareness.",
    "**Interactive Bell with Gesture Control**: This bell would be equipped with motion sensors that detect hand gestures. For instance, a simple wave of the hand could activate the bell, allowing cyclists to ring it without taking their hands off the handlebars. This feature would be particularly useful for busy city cyclists who need to alert pedestrians without compromising their grip.",
    "**Integrated GPS and Emergency Alert System**: This bicycle bell would double as an emergency alert system. It would include a GPS tracker and an SOS button that, when pressed, sends your location to emergency contacts or local authorities. Additionally, it could emit a loud sound to attract attention in case of an accident, enhancing the cyclist's safety."
