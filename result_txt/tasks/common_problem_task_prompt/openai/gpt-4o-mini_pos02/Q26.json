    "**Weather Variability**: The weather on Everest can change rapidly and unpredictably. Climbers may face sudden storms, extreme winds, or drastic temperature drops. This can lead to dangerous conditions such as frostbite or hypothermia. Planning for weather contingencies, including retreat strategies and adequate gear, is crucial for safety.",
    "**Overcrowding and Bottlenecks**: With the increasing number of climbers attempting to summit Everest, overcrowding can lead to dangerous situations, especially at critical points like the Hillary Step. Long wait times can increase the risk of exhaustion and exposure to the elements. Effective scheduling and limit-setting on permits could help manage this issue.",
    "**Inadequate Preparation and Training**: Many climbers underestimate the physical and mental demands of climbing Everest. Inadequate training can lead to poor decision-making, increased risk of injury, and inability to cope with the mountain's challenges. Comprehensive training programs that include technical climbing skills, physical conditioning, and mental resilience are essential for potential climbers.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The influx of climbers has led to significant environmental concerns, including litter, human waste, and damage to the delicate ecosystem. Without proper waste management systems, the mountain's environment is at risk. Initiatives for clean-up expeditions, stricter regulations on waste disposal, and educating climbers on Leave No Trace principles can help address this issue.",
    "**Communication Failures**: In remote areas like Everest, reliable communication can be challenging. Climbers may find themselves cut off from support teams or rescue services during emergencies. Investing in satellite communication devices and ensuring all team members are trained in emergency protocols can help improve communication and safety."
