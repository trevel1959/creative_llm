    "Thermal Mass Materials: Utilize thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. These materials can help regulate indoor temperature by storing heat energy during warm periods and releasing it during cooler periods. For example, a concrete floor can absorb heat from the sun during the day and release it at night, maintaining a comfortable temperature.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Design buildings with passive solar principles in mind, incorporating large south-facing windows, thermal mass walls, and awnings to harness the sun's energy during the day. In colder months, the building will naturally retain heat, while in warmer months, the thermal mass will absorb heat from the sun and release it at night.",
    "Phase-Change Materials: Utilize phase-change materials (PCMs) that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. These materials can be integrated into building components such as walls, floors, or roofs. When heated, the PCMs will absorb heat and release it as they cool, providing a consistent temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Incorporate evaporative cooling systems that use water to cool the air. This can be achieved through techniques such as wet pads or misting systems. As water evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, cooling it down. This process can be used in conjunction with natural ventilation to provide a cooler indoor environment.",
    "Green Roofs: Plant vegetation on rooftops to create a natural insulation layer, reducing heat gain during warm months and providing a cooler microclimate. Green roofs can also help to absorb and release heat through transpiration, providing a consistent temperature. Additionally, they can provide habitat for local wildlife and improve air quality."
