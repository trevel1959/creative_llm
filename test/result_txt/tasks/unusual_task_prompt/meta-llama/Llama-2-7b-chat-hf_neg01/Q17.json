    "A coffee mug with a built-in coffee grinder: This mug would have a small grinder embedded in the handle, allowing users to grind their coffee beans directly in the mug before pouring their morning brew. This would eliminate the need for a separate grinder and make the coffee-making process more convenient.",
    "A mug that changes color based on your mood: This mug would be made with a special type of glass that changes color based on the user's emotions. For example, if the user is feeling happy, the mug might turn a bright, sunny yellow. If the user is feeling sad, the mug might turn a more muted, melancholy blue. This would add an extra layer of personalization to the coffee-drinking experience.",
    "A mug that can keep your coffee hot for hours: This mug would be made with a special insulation material that would keep the coffee hot for an extended period of time. This would be perfect for people who are always on-the-go and need a quick caffeine fix.",
    "A mug with a built-in strainer: This mug would have a small strainer built into the lid, allowing users to strain their coffee directly in the mug without having to transfer it to a separate strainer. This would save time and make the coffee-drinking process more efficient.",
    "A mug that can identify your coffee beans: This mug would have a small sensor built into the handle that can detect the type of coffee beans used in the mug. It would then display the name of the coffee beans on a small screen on the mug, allowing users to know exactly what they are drinking. This would be especially useful for coffee connoisseurs who want to track the origin and quality of their coffee."
