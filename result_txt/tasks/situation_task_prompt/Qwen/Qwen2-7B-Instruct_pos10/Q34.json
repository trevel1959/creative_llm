    "**Rainwater Collection System:** Design a large-scale rainwater collection system using gutters and barrels or tanks. This system can be installed around your garden or specific areas where plants are located. The collected rainwater can then be used for watering during dry spells or when rain has ceased.",
    "**Aquaponics Setup:** Build an aquaponics system where fish waste is converted into plant food through bacteria. The plants then help clean the water, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. This system can provide a continuous supply of water and nutrients for your plants without the need for rain.",
    "**Recycling Water from Indoor Activities:** Capture and recycle water from daily household activities like washing dishes, bathing, and laundry. This water can be treated and used for irrigation purposes. Installing a simple filtration system can ensure that the recycled water is safe for plants.",
