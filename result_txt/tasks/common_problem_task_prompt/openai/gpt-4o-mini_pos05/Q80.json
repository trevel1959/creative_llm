    "**Eco-Friendly Attire**: Finding wedding attire that aligns with eco-friendly values can be a complex task. Many traditional wedding dresses and suits are made from synthetic materials that are not environmentally friendly. Couples may need to seek out designers who specialize in sustainable fabrics, consider renting attire, or explore second-hand options. This can also lead to issues of availability, style preferences, and budget constraints.",
    "**Sustainable Catering**: Catering can pose a significant challenge in planning an eco-friendly wedding. Sourcing local, organic ingredients can be more expensive and may limit menu options. Additionally, there may be logistical issues related to accommodating guests with dietary restrictions while maintaining a focus on sustainability. Couples will need to communicate clearly with caterers about their eco-friendly goals and may need to conduct tastings with multiple vendors to find the right fit.",
    "**Zero-Waste Decor**: Creating beautiful wedding decor without contributing to waste can be a daunting task. Many traditional decorations, such as floral arrangements, are often discarded after the event. Couples could explore options like potted plants that guests can take home, biodegradable materials, or even renting decor items. However, this may require additional planning, creativity, and research to find the right suppliers who align with their eco-friendly vision.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Ensuring that guests can travel to the wedding venue in an eco-friendly manner can be a logistical challenge. Couples may want to encourage carpooling, provide shuttles, or suggest public transportation options. However, this requires careful planning and communication with guests, as well as potential limitations based on the venue's location. Additionally, if guests are traveling from afar, coordinating sustainable travel options can become complicated.",
    "**Eco-Conscious Favors**: Selecting wedding favors that are both memorable and eco-friendly can be tricky. Many traditional favors end up as waste, so couples might consider alternatives like seed packets, reusable bags, or donations to a charity in guests' names. However, finding unique and meaningful favors that fit within the budget and align with the wedding theme may take time and creativity."
