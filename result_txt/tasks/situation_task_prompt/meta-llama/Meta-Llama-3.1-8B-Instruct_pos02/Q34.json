    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that can collect and condense water vapor from the air, even when it's dry. This could be powered by solar panels or wind energy, making it a sustainable solution. The device would be designed to work in various climates and could be used for both indoor and outdoor plants.",
    "**Rainwater Storage in Planters**: Design planters with built-in water storage tanks that can collect and store rainwater or graywater (wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines) for plants. These planters would have a self-watering system, allowing plants to draw water as needed. This would reduce the need for external watering systems and make plants more drought-resistant.",
    "**Hydrogel Watering System**: Create a hydrogel-based watering system that can absorb and store water, releasing it slowly as needed by plants. This system would be made from a non-toxic, biodegradable material and could be used for both indoor and outdoor plants. The hydrogel would be designed to work in various temperatures and could be reused multiple times.",
    "**Fog Collection System**: Develop a fog collection system that can capture and condense fog droplets, providing a reliable source of water for plants. This system would be designed for areas with high fog density and could be powered by solar panels or wind energy. The collected water would be stored in a tank and distributed to plants through a drip irrigation system.",
    "**Bio-inspired Watering System**: Create a watering system inspired by the way plants naturally absorb water from the air, such as through transpiration. This system would use a combination of micro-pumps, sensors, and a specialized membrane to mimic the plant's natural water absorption process. The system would be energy-efficient and could be used for both indoor and outdoor plants."
