    "**Customizable Weight Distribution**: Design a bowling ball with adjustable internal weights that can be moved or replaced depending on the bowler's preference. This would allow bowlers to experiment with different weight distributions to find the optimal balance for their throwing style. An accompanying app could help players understand how different weight distributions affect their game.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material**: Create a bowling ball made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable resins or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious bowlers and reduce the environmental impact of bowling equipment. The ball could be designed to decompose safely over time, minimizing waste in bowling alleys.",
    "**Temperature Regulation Technology**: Incorporate a temperature-regulating material within the bowling ball that maintains an optimal grip and feel, regardless of external conditions. This would prevent the ball from becoming too slick in humid environments or too hard in cold conditions, enhancing performance consistency across different bowling alleys.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Embed a thin, flexible LED screen on the surface of the bowling ball that can display customizable designs, patterns, or even messages. Bowlers could choose their designs for tournaments or personal events, adding a fun and personalized touch to the game. The display could also show statistics or encouragement messages as the ball rolls down the lane.",
    "**Integrated Training Aids**: Design a bowling ball with built-in training aids, such as a textured grip that helps bowlers learn proper finger placement and release techniques. The ball could have varying textures or patterns that change as the bowler improves, providing tactile feedback to help them refine their skills."
