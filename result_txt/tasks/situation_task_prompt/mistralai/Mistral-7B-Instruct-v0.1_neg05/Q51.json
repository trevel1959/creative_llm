    "Build a raft: You could use materials such as wood, rope, and leaves to construct a raft that can be used to cross the river. This would require some knowledge of boat building and the ability to navigate through rapids and strong currents.",
    "Use a helicopter: If you have access to a helicopter, you could use it to fly over the river and land on the opposite bank. This would require a pilot's license and the ability to navigate through the air.",
    "Build a zip line: You could use materials such as cables, pulleys, and anchors to build a zip line across the river. This would require a strong understanding of physics and the ability to construct a safe and stable structure.",
    "Use a kayak or canoe: If you have access to a kayak or canoe, you could use it to navigate through the river. This would require some knowledge of paddling and the ability to navigate through rapids and strong currents.",
    "Build a rope bridge: You could use materials such as ropes, pulleys, and anchors to build a rope bridge across the river. This would require a strong understanding of engineering and the ability to construct a safe and stable structure."
