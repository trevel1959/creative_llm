    "**Water Reflections**: Water has reflective properties, so people could use bodies of water—like lakes, ponds, or even large puddles—to see their reflections. This would encourage outdoor gatherings near water sources where individuals can check their looks while enjoying nature. It could also inspire new art forms focusing on the interplay of light and water, leading to artistic communities forming around water bodies.",
    "**Smartphone Screens**: In a world without mirrors, the ubiquitous use of smartphone screens would increase. People would use their phone screens as makeshift mirrors. This could lead to the development of apps specifically designed to enhance reflection quality, perhaps incorporating filters that mimic traditional mirror effects, leading to a new genre of social media content focused on \"screen reflections.\"",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: With the disappearance of mirrors, technology could evolve rapidly to create AR glasses that allow users to see their reflections overlaid on their real-world view. These glasses could provide a virtual reflection of oneself, offering real-time adjustments and filters. This could revolutionize personal grooming and fashion, leading to a surge in AR-based fashion apps and virtual try-ons.",
    "**Reflective Clothing**: Designers might start creating clothing made from reflective materials that allow individuals to see their outlines and silhouettes. These garments could incorporate smart textiles that adjust their reflectiveness based on the environment, creating a dynamic reflection experience. This would not only serve a practical purpose but also become a new fashion trend, emphasizing self-expression through unique designs.",
    "**Kaleidoscopic Rooms**: Architects and designers could create spaces filled with kaleidoscopic elements, such as reflective tiles or glass installations, that distort and multiply reflections. These environments would allow people to see their images in an artistic way, turning self-reflection into an immersive experience. This could inspire new entertainment venues, art installations, or even meditation spaces that focus on self-discovery through visual exploration."
