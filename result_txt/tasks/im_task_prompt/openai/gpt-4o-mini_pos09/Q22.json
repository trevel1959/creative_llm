    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Tools**:    Create a flashlight that combines multiple tools into one device. For instance, it could include a built-in knife, screwdriver, or bottle opener, making it perfect for camping or emergency situations. The flashlight could have a modular design, allowing users to swap out different tool attachments based on their needs, providing versatility without the need to carry multiple items.",
    "**Smart Flashlight with App Integration**:    Develop a smart flashlight that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. Users could control the flashlight's brightness, color, and strobe settings through their phones. The app could also feature a locator function, helping users find their flashlight if misplaced. Additionally, the app could include safety features, such as sending alerts to emergency contacts if the flashlight is activated in distress mode.",
    "**Adjustable Beam Focus**:    Innovate a flashlight that allows users to adjust the beam focus with a simple twist or slide mechanism. This would enable users to switch between a wide floodlight for illuminating large areas and a focused spotlight for distant visibility. A clear indicator on the flashlight could show the current beam setting, ensuring users can easily adapt the light to their environment.",
    "**Bioluminescent Flashlight**:    Explore the idea of a flashlight that uses bioluminescent materials for a softer glow. This flashlight could be perfect for situations where a bright light is not necessary, such as reading at night or providing ambient lighting. The bioluminescent feature could also be charged by regular light sources, allowing it to glow in the dark for hours without needing a battery.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in Safety Features**:    Design a flashlight that includes additional safety features such as a panic alarm, a reflective surface, and a detachable strobe light. The panic alarm could be activated with a single button press, alerting others in the vicinity. The reflective surface could enhance visibility in low-light situations, while the detachable strobe light could be used to signal for help or as a warning to others."
