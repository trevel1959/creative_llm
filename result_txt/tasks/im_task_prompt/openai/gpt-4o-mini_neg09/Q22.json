    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that incorporates a solar panel on its body, allowing it to recharge during the day when left outdoors. This eco-friendly approach not only reduces reliance on disposable batteries but also ensures that the flashlight is always ready for use, making it ideal for camping trips or emergency preparedness kits.",
    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Built-in Tools**: Create a flashlight that combines multiple tools, such as a knife, screwdriver, and bottle opener, into one compact device. This would appeal to outdoor enthusiasts and DIYers who value versatility. The flashlight could feature a magnetic base for hands-free use while allowing easy access to the integrated tools when needed.",
    "**Color-Changing LED Flashlight**: Introduce a flashlight with color-changing LED lights that can switch between different colors based on the userâ€™s needs. For instance, red light can be used for preserving night vision while camping, blue light for signaling, and white light for general illumination. This feature could be controlled via a simple button or touch interface, making it user-friendly and adaptable to various situations.",
    "**Voice-Activated Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that responds to voice commands, allowing users to turn it on or off and change brightness levels without needing to physically touch it. This could be especially useful in emergency situations where hands are occupied or for individuals with disabilities. The flashlight could also include a built-in emergency alarm that can be activated by voice for added safety.",
    "**Adjustable Beam Focus Flashlight**: Design a flashlight that allows users to easily adjust the beam focus from a wide floodlight to a narrow spotlight. This could be achieved through a telescoping design or a rotating head. Users could benefit from having a single flashlight that can adapt to various tasks, such as illuminating a large area or pinpointing a distant object."
