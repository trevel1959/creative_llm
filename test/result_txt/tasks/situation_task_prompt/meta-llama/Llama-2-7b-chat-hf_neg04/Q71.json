    "Geotextiles: Utilize geotextiles, which are permeable fabrics designed to stabilize soil and improve its water retention capacity. Plant your seeds or seedlings through the fabric, which will help to anchor them and prevent soil erosion. As the plants grow, the fabric will decompose, and the soil will become more fertile.",
    "Vertical gardening: Transform your garden into a vertical landscape by constructing a trellis or a green wall. This method allows you to maximize space while minimizing soil usage. Train your plants to climb up the structure, and use a soilless growing medium such as peat moss or coconut coir to support their growth.",
    "Hydroponics: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. Set up a hydroponic system, such as a nutrient film technique (NFT) or an ebb-and-flow system, and fill it with a soilless medium like rockwool or coco coir. This will allow you to grow a wide variety of plants without the need for soil.",
    "Living walls: Create a living wall by attaching planters to a wall or fence. This will provide a vertical space for you to grow plants without the need for soil. Use a soilless medium like peat moss or coconut coir to support the plants' growth, and select plants that are well-suited to growing in a vertical environment.",
    "Aeroponics: Aeroponics is a method of growing plants in the air without soil. Set up an aeroponic system, which consists of a grow tray, a pump, and a misting system. Place the seedlings or seeds in the grow tray, and the misting system will provide them with the necessary nutrients and water. This method is ideal for growing delicate plants like herbs and leafy greens."
