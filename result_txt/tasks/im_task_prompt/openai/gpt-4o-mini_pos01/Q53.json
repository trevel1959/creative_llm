    "**Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Introduce Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or exposure to sunlight. For example, notes could turn from yellow to pink when exposed to heat. This would not only be visually engaging but could also serve as a reminderâ€”notes left in hot places might indicate something important that needs attention.",
    "**Post-it Note Wall Art**: Create a line of Post-it Notes designed specifically for artistic expression. These could come in various shapes (like hearts, stars, etc.) and patterns (like floral or geometric designs). They could also be made from biodegradable materials, allowing users to create temporary wall art without damaging surfaces, encouraging creativity in workspaces or homes.",
    "**Post-it Notes with Integrated QR Codes**: Each note could come with a QR code printed on it, which, when scanned, leads to a digital version of the note or additional resources (like links to articles, videos, or relevant documents). This would bridge the gap between physical notes and digital information, making it easier to share and access related content.",
    "**Magnetic Post-it Notes**: Develop a version of Post-it Notes that has a magnetic backing. These notes could stick to any magnetic surface, such as a fridge or whiteboard, allowing for more versatile use. This would also make it easier to rearrange notes without losing the sticky backing, ideal for brainstorming sessions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Post-it Notes**: Create a line of Post-it Notes made entirely from recycled materials and printed with eco-friendly inks. Additionally, these notes could be embedded with wildflower seeds, allowing users to plant them after use. This would promote sustainability and encourage users to contribute positively to the environment."
