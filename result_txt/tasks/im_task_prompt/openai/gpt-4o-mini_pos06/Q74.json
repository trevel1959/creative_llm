    "**Multi-Function Watering Can**: Design a watering can that has interchangeable heads for different watering needs. One head could have a fine mist for delicate seedlings, another could be a strong jet for larger plants, and a third could be a drip irrigation attachment for slow watering. This versatility would make it suitable for various gardening tasks.",
    "**Collapsible Watering Can**: Create a collapsible watering can made from durable, lightweight materials. This would be ideal for urban gardeners with limited storage space or for those who travel and want to take their gardening supplies with them. When not in use, it can be folded down to a compact size.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Incorporate a self-watering mechanism into the design. This could involve a reservoir at the bottom of the can that slowly releases water into the soil over time. It would reduce the frequency of watering needed and help maintain consistent moisture levels, which is particularly beneficial for busy individuals or during hot weather.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Develop a watering can with a built-in compartment for liquid fertilizers. Users could mix their fertilizers with water in the can, and a controlled release mechanism could dispense the nutrients while watering. This would streamline the process of fertilizing plants, ensuring they receive nutrients simultaneously with watering.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Weight Distribution**: Redesign the watering can with an ergonomic handle and a balanced weight distribution system. This would make it easier to carry, especially when filled with water. The handle could be adjustable to fit different hand sizes, reducing strain during prolonged use and making it more comfortable for gardeners of all ages."
