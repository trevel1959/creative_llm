    "A music boom: With everyone’s singing ability being so high, musicians would have to compete to be heard in a competitive market that would result in an increase in the popularity and growth of the music industry. Many musicians would come out of the woodwork to be recognized by a new generation of audience which had never heard “perfect singing”.",
    "The rise of community choirs: With everyone’s ability to sing perfectly, community choirs would become the most popular activities in the world, with every park, school, and house having its own choir. These choirs would become a source of joy and community bonding, as people gather together to make beautiful music.",
    "The end of traditional music: With everyone's ability to sing perfectly, traditional music forms such as opera, where perfection and refinement are highly prized, would become obsolete. People would prefer the spontaneous, natural sounds of everyday singing over the formalized, rehearsed notes of traditional music.",
    "Health concerns: With constant singing, there would be an increased risk of vocal damage, which could lead to people developing hoarseness, sore throats and other related issues. Moreover, the lack of rest between singing would lead to a greater demand on the singer’s vocal cords leading to potential strain.",
    "The transformation of the film industry: The music industry is not the only one that would be affected. The film industry would also see a transformation. Instead of hiring singers and actors with perfect voices, composers would have access to a new talent pool, and the films would start using sound effects of everyday singing to achieve a more real and natural sound."
