    "**Harnessing Ambient Energy**: Develop a system that converts ambient energy from your environment into electricity. For instance, if you're in a building, you could utilize piezoelectric materials embedded in your device's casing to generate power from the mechanical vibrations of footsteps or other movements. Similarly, if you're outdoors, solar cells can be integrated into the device for direct sunlight power.",
    "**Ferromagnetic Resonance**: Explore the possibility of using ferromagnetic resonance to power your devices wirelessly. This involves placing your device near a resonant coil that's powered by an external source. The magnetic field generated by this coil induces an electrical current in your device's receiver coil, allowing it to charge or operate without wires.",
    "**Thermoelectric Power Generation**: Implement thermoelectric generators (TEGs) within your devices. These are solid-state devices that convert temperature differences into electrical energy. By designing your device to have one side exposed to warmer conditions (like your body heat) and another to cooler conditions (ambient air), you can generate electricity passively.",
    "**Biomimicry with Hydrogel Capacitors**: Create devices that incorporate hydrogel capacitors which draw water from the environment as they expand. This process releases ions into the solution, which can then be used to power your device through electrochemical reactions. This technology mimics natural biological processes like osmosis.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Design your devices with integrated kinetic energy harvesters that capture motion. Devices with moving parts, such as watches, could include tiny turbines or flywheels that convert the rotational energy of these parts into electricity. For smartphones, you could incorporate a small generator that captures the kinetic energy of button presses or swipes."
