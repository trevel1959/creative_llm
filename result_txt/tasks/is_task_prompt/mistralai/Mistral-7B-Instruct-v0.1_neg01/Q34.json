The story could explore themes of resilience, perseverance, and the power of hope.",
    "\"The Sunflower that Never Opened\": This idea is to create a story where a sunflower is trapped in a dark room, unable to open and bloom.

    "\"The Sunflower that Never Forgot\": This idea is to create a story where a sunflower is the only survivor of a devastating event, such as a natural disaster or a war.
