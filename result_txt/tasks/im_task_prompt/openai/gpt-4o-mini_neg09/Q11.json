    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology within the water bottle that activates when the lid is closed, killing 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. This feature ensures that the bottle remains clean and safe for use without the need for frequent manual cleaning, making it ideal for outdoor adventures or travel.",
    "**Collapsible Design**: Create a water bottle that can collapse down to a compact size when empty. This would make it easier to carry in a backpack or purse, especially for hikers, travelers, or anyone with limited space. The material could be durable and lightweight, allowing for easy storage without sacrificing sturdiness when filled.",
    "**Built-in Filter System**: Develop a water bottle with an integrated filtration system that allows users to fill it with tap water or from natural sources like rivers or lakes. The filter would remove impurities, making the water safe to drink. This would be particularly beneficial for outdoor enthusiasts or travelers in areas with questionable water quality.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a water bottle with a detachable chamber that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or tea. This chamber would keep the flavors separate until the user is ready to mix them, ensuring that the water stays fresh and not overly flavored. It would encourage people to drink more water by making it more enjoyable.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Create a lid that doubles as a cup, allowing users to share their water easily or use it for measuring out portions (like for mixing powdered drinks). This lid could also have compartments for storing vitamins or electrolytes, making it convenient for those who like to supplement their hydration."
