    "**Pressure**: The immense pressure at the bottom of the ocean can crush any structure, including the submersible vehicle, making it crucial to ensure the vehicle is designed and tested to withstand these extreme conditions.",
    "**Light**: Without natural light, visibility would be severely limited, which could make it difficult for the crew to navigate and observe their surroundings. This would require advanced lighting systems and backup power sources.",
    "**Communication**: Communication with the surface would be crucial for the success of the mission. However, signals may not travel well through water, and the depth could interfere with traditional radio communication. This would require alternative methods of communication, such as acoustic signals or tethered cables.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The ocean floor may contain hazards such as underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, or toxic substances that could pose a threat to the crew. These hazards would need to be carefully mapped and avoided.",
    "**Navigation**: Navigating in the dark and without landmarks would be a significant challenge. Advanced navigation systems, such as GPS, would be necessary, but they might not be reliable at such depths."
