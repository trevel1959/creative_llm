    "Floating Cities: One creative solution to rising ocean levels is to build floating cities. These cities would be designed to house people and provide all the necessary amenities, such as food, water, and energy, while floating on the ocean. The floating cities could be built using materials such as recycled plastic, which would help reduce waste and minimize the impact on the environment. The cities could be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own food production systems, waste management systems, and renewable energy sources.",
    "Underwater Bases: Another option for dealing with rising ocean levels is to build underwater bases. These bases could be designed to house people and provide all the necessary amenities, such as living quarters, laboratories, and recreational spaces. The underwater bases could be built using materials such as steel and concrete, which would provide strength and stability in the water. The bases could be equipped with advanced technology, such as hydroponic gardens for food production and solar panels for energy generation.",
    "Artificial Islands: Another creative solution to rising ocean levels is to build artificial islands. These islands could be created using sand and rock, and could be built in strategic locations to provide a safe haven for people and wildlife. The artificial islands could be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own food production systems, water treatment systems, and renewable energy sources. They could also be used as hubs for scientific research and conservation efforts.",
    "Submersible Cities: A more futuristic solution to rising ocean levels is to build submersible cities. These cities would be designed to be fully submersible, with living quarters, laboratories, and recreational spaces all located beneath the water's surface. The submersible cities could be powered by advanced technology, such as nuclear reactors or advanced solar panels, and could be equipped with advanced life support systems to sustain human life for extended periods of time.",
    "Ocean-Friendly Architecture: Finally, a creative solution to rising ocean levels is to design buildings and cities that are ocean-friendly. This could involve using materials that are durable and resistant to corrosion, such as steel and concrete, and designing buildings with sloping roofs to allow rainwater to flow off easily. Green roofs and walls could also be used to absorb excess"
