    "Smart Bicycle Helmet: Develop a smart bicycle helmet that not only protects the rider's head but also provides real-time traffic updates, navigation, and safety features. This helmet could be equipped with sensors that detect potential hazards and alert the rider through a built-in speaker or vibration.",
    "Bicycle Safety System: Create a comprehensive bicycle safety system that includes a helmet, rearview mirror, and a Bluetooth-enabled bell. The helmet would have a built-in camera that captures footage of the road ahead, providing the rider with a clear view of potential hazards. The rearview mirror would display a live feed of the road behind the rider, and the Bluetooth-enabled bell would allow the rider to alert other road users with a press of a button.",
    "Bike Lighting System: Develop a bicycle lighting system that includes a helmet-mounted LED light, a rear light, and a front light. The helmet-mounted light would be powered by a rechargeable battery and provide a wide beam of light to illuminate the road ahead. The rear light would be designed to be mounted on the back of the bicycle and provide a focused beam of light to alert other road users of the rider's presence. The front light would be positioned on the handlebars and provide a wide beam of light to illuminate the road ahead.",
    "Bicycle GPS Tracker: Create a GPS tracker that can be attached to a bicycle, providing real-time location tracking and alerts to the rider's emergency contacts in case of an accident. The GPS tracker would also have a built-in accelerometer that detects sudden movements, indicating potential accidents.",
    "Smart Bike Lock: Develop a smart bike lock that not only secures the bicycle but also provides real-time location tracking and alerts to the rider's mobile device. The lock would be equipped with sensors that detect tampering and alert the rider through a mobile app. Additionally, the lock could have a built-in GPS tracker that provides real-time location tracking of the bicycle, ensuring that it is always secure and within reach."
