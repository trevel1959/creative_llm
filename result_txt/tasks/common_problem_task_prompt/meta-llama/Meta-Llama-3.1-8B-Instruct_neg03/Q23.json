    "**Eco-Friendly Public Transportation Hubs**: Introduce a network of sustainable public transportation hubs that integrate electric or hybrid buses, trains, and bike-sharing systems. These hubs would be designed with green roofs, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems to minimize environmental impact. To encourage usage, offer discounted fares for residents who use the hubs regularly, and provide incentives for businesses to locate near these hubs.",
    "**Community Land Trusts**: Establish community land trusts (CLTs) to preserve affordable housing and community spaces. CLTs would allow residents to purchase homes at below-market rates, with the option to buy back the land at a later date. This would help maintain community character and prevent gentrification. Partner with local non-profits to provide financial assistance and educational resources for CLT participants.",
    "**Municipal Composting and Food Waste Management**: Implement a city-wide composting program that collects food waste from households and businesses. This would reduce landfill waste, create nutrient-rich soil for local gardens, and support urban agriculture initiatives. Collaborate with local farmers to create a closed-loop system where compost is used to grow produce, which is then sold to residents and businesses.",
    "**Inclusive Public Spaces**: Design and create public spaces that cater to diverse needs and abilities. This could include adaptive playgrounds, wheelchair-accessible parks, and sensory-friendly areas. Incorporate inclusive design principles, such as tactile signage and audio descriptions, to ensure that all residents can fully participate in community activities.",
    "**Participatory Budgeting and Civic Engagement**: Implement a participatory budgeting process that empowers residents to decide how a portion of the city's budget is allocated. This could involve workshops, online platforms, and town hall meetings to gather input from diverse stakeholders. By giving residents a direct say in budget decisions, you can increase transparency, accountability, and community ownership of public projects."
