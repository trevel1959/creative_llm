    "Glow-in-the-Dark Lampshade: Create a lampshade that emits a soft, ambient glow in the dark. This can be achieved through the use of phosphorescent materials, such as zinc sulfide or strontium aluminate, which absorb light and release it slowly over time. The glow-in-the-dark lampshade would add a unique and futuristic touch to any room, and could be particularly popular in kids' bedrooms or game rooms.",
    "Shape-Shifting Lampshade: Design a lampshade that changes shape in response to changes in the room's lighting conditions. For example, the lampshade could be a flat disc when the room is dimly lit, but as the lighting brightens, it could unfold into a more complex shape, such as a flower or a bird. This would add an element of surprise and playfulness to the lamp, and could be a fun and unique addition to any room.",
    "Interactive Lampshade: Create a lampshade that responds to voice commands or other gestures. For example, the lampshade could change color or brightness in response to a voice command, or it could pulse or flash in time with music. This would add an element of interactivity to the lamp, and could be a fun and engaging way to control the lighting in a room.",
    "Solar-Powered Lampshade: Design a lampshade that is powered by solar energy. This could be achieved through the use of solar panels embedded in the lampshade, which could capture sunlight during the day and convert it into electrical energy to power the lamp at night. This would be a sustainable and eco-friendly option for those looking to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint.",
    "Smart Lampshade: Create a lampshade that can be controlled and monitored remotely through a smartphone app. For example, the app could allow users to adjust the brightness or color of the lamp from anywhere in the world, or it could provide real-time energy usage data to help users monitor and manage their energy consumption. This would be a convenient and efficient way to control and monitor the lamp, and could be particularly"
