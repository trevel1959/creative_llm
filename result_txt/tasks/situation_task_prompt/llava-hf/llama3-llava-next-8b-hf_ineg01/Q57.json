    "**Submarine Dwellings**: Utilize the underwater environment for sustainable living. Building self-sustained, pressurized habitats within the ocean would allow for a new form of urban development, with residents enjoying the natural beauty of the underwater world.",
    "**Vertical Farming**: Develop vertical farming systems integrated into the sides of buildings, providing fresh produce and green spaces for the community. This would allow for food production in areas that would otherwise be unusable due to rising sea levels.",
    "**Seawall-Incorporated Community**: Design a community where the seawall is an integral part of the architecture. Buildings could be constructed with the seawall as a protective barrier, while also providing space for public amenities and green spaces.",
    "**Island Development**: Build a series of interconnected islands that could be used for various purposes, such as agriculture, housing, and recreation. This would provide a stable land base in the face of rising sea levels.",
    "**Sustainable Coastal Retreats**: Create retreats along the coast that are designed to be both self-sufficient and resilient to the impacts of climate change. These retreats could be built on stilts, using renewable energy, and incorporating green infrastructure to minimize their carbon footprint."
