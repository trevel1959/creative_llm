    "Build a community-driven bike-sharing program: In the absence of bicycles, a community-driven bike-sharing program could be established to provide an alternative mode of transportation. This program would involve creating a network of designated bike stations located throughout the city, where individuals could rent bikes for short periods of time. The program could be powered by a combination of community donations, grants, and small membership fees. To ensure the program's success, the community could come together to design and build the bike stations, and volunteer their time to maintain them.",
    "Utilize skateboards and longboards: Another option for getting around without bicycles would be to utilize skateboards and longboards. These alternative modes of transportation are already widely available and could be used for short distances. With a little creativity, skateboard and longboard parks could be created in high-traffic areas, providing a safe and fun way to get around. Additionally, skateboard and longboard rentals could be offered at local shops, making it easy for people to try out these modes of transportation.",
    "Develop a human-powered transportation system: In the absence of bicycles, a human-powered transportation system could be developed to provide an alternative mode of transportation. This system could involve the creation of a network of human-powered vehicles, such as pedal-powered cars, tricycles, or even people-powered buses. These vehicles could be designed to be efficient and comfortable, and could be used for both short and long distances.",
    "Create a car-sharing program: In the absence of bicycles, a car-sharing program could be established to provide an alternative mode of transportation. This program would involve creating a network of cars that could be rented by the hour or by the day. The cars could be electric or hybrid, to reduce their environmental impact, and could be located at designated pick-up and drop-off locations throughout the city.",
