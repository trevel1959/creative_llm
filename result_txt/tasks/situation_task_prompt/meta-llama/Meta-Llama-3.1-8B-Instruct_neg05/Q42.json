    "**Solar-Powered Water Purification System**: Utilizing a 3D-printed or locally sourced framework, I would design a system that harnesses the island's solar energy to power a water purification unit. This would involve creating a photovoltaic panel array to generate electricity, which would then be used to power a water purification system, such as a UV filter or a ceramic filter. This would provide me with a reliable source of clean drinking water, reducing the risk of waterborne illnesses.",
    "**Coconut Shell Hut and Fishing Net**: I would use coconut shells to create a sturdy and waterproof hut, providing me with shelter from the elements. The coconut shells would be arranged in a specific pattern to maximize structural integrity and insulation. Additionally, I would craft a fishing net using local materials like vines or plant fibers, allowing me to catch fish and other seafood for sustenance.",
    "**Signal Fire and Mirror Communication**: To signal for help, I would create a signal fire using dry wood and other flammable materials. This would be done during the day to maximize visibility, as smoke during the day is more likely to be seen from a distance. To amplify the signal, I would use a mirror to reflect sunlight towards any potential rescuers, increasing the chances of being spotted.",
    "**Island Exploration and Resource Mapping**: I would thoroughly explore the island to identify potential resources, such as fresh water sources, food sources, and materials for tool-making. This would involve creating a mental or physical map of the island, noting the location of these resources and any potential hazards. This would enable me to make informed decisions about where to focus my efforts and how to allocate my time.",
    "**Tool-Making and Adaptation**: I would use the island's resources to create tools, such as a fishing spear, a digging stick, or a makeshift knife. These tools would be crafted using materials like wood, stone, or bone, and would be adapted to suit the island's specific environment and needs. This would allow me to tackle tasks more efficiently, such as hunting for food or gathering materials, and would also provide a sense of accomplishment and purpose.
