    "**Integrated Grinder with Freshness Seal**: Design a coffee maker that features a built-in grinder with a freshness seal mechanism. This would allow users to grind whole beans right before brewing, preserving the aroma and flavor. The freshness seal could automatically engage when the grinder is not in use, preventing air from entering and keeping the beans fresh for longer periods.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Capsule System**: Develop a coffee maker that uses biodegradable or compostable coffee capsules, minimizing environmental impact. The machine could have a built-in composter that processes used capsules into nutrient-rich compost, allowing users to contribute to sustainability while enjoying their coffee.",
    "**Customizable Brewing Chamber**: Create a coffee maker with a modular brewing chamber that allows users to experiment with different brewing methods (e.g., pour-over, French press, espresso). The chamber could be easily swapped out or adjusted to cater to various brewing techniques, giving coffee enthusiasts the freedom to explore and perfect their coffee-making skills.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Technology**: Introduce a feature that allows users to infuse their coffee with natural flavors during the brewing process. The coffee maker could have compartments for herbs, spices, or flavored syrups that release their essence into the brew, creating unique flavor profiles without the need for artificial additives.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Equip the coffee maker with an interactive touchscreen that provides tutorials, coffee recipes, and brewing tips. Users could engage with the interface to learn about different coffee origins, brewing techniques, and flavor pairings, making the coffee-making experience educational and enjoyable."
