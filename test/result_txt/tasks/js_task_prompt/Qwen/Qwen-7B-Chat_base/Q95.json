    "A Habitat for Insects: The habitat would be designed to mimic natural environments such as forests, meadows, and deserts. It would have various levels of vegetation and rocks to provide shelter and food sources for insects. Additionally, there would be artificial lighting and temperature control systems to maintain a suitable environment for different insect species.",
    "A Habitat for Aquatic Life: The habitat would be designed to mimic underwater environments such as coral reefs, rivers, and oceans. It would have transparent walls and LED lights that simulate sunlight, and it would have water filtration systems to keep the water clean and oxygenated. There would also be artificial feeding systems to provide food for aquatic animals such as fish and sharks.",
    "A Habitat for Birds: The habitat would be designed to mimic natural habitats such as forests, savannas, and wetlands. It would have perches, nesting boxes, and artificial food sources such as seeds and fruits. Additionally, there would be bird-friendly materials used in the construction of the habitat, such as reclaimed wood and sustainable insulation.",
    "A Habitat for Small Mammals: The habitat would be designed to mimic natural habitats such as forests, grasslands, and caves. It would have burrows, tunnels, and hiding places for small mammals such as rabbits and squirrels. Additionally, there would be artificial food sources such as nuts and seeds, and there would be heating and cooling systems to maintain a comfortable environment.",
    "A Habitat for Reptiles: The habitat would be designed to mimic natural habitats such as deserts, rainforests, and coral reefs. It would have rocks, logs, and other natural elements to create hiding places for reptiles such as snakes and lizards. Additionally, there would be artificial light and temperature control systems to maintain a suitable environment for different reptile species. There would also be a system for providing fresh water and UVB lighting for reptiles that require it."
