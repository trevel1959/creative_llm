    "People with poor vision could use technology such as smart glasses or wearable cameras to enhance their vision. These devices could use computer vision algorithms to enhance the wearer's visual field, allowing them to see more clearly.",
    "People with poor vision could use their other senses to navigate and interact with their environment. For example, they could use their hearing to locate objects and people, or their sense of touch to navigate through spaces.",
    "People with poor vision could form support groups to help each other cope with the loss of glasses and contact lenses. These groups could provide emotional support, as well as practical advice on how to adapt to life without vision correction.",
    "People with poor vision could use bio-engineered contact lenses that can enhance their vision. These lenses could be designed to amplify light, reduce glare, or even correct common vision problems like nearsightedness or farsightedness.",
    "People with poor vision could turn to alternative forms of communication, such as sign language or braille, to communicate with others. This could be especially important in situations where vision is not available, such as in low-light environments or when objects are far away."
