    "**Data Privacy**: Self-driving cars collect a vast amount of data, including GPS locations, driving patterns, and sensor readings. This data needs to be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. There's also a concern about how this data might be used by third parties or governments for surveillance purposes.",
    "**Regulatory Challenges**: Implementing self-driving cars on public roads requires comprehensive regulations that address liability in accidents, cybersecurity, data privacy, and ethical considerations. Different countries and states may have varying laws and standards, leading to confusion and inconsistency.",
    "**Economic Disruption**: The introduction of self-driving cars could disrupt the traditional taxi, ride-sharing, and trucking industries. Drivers who lose their jobs due to automation might face significant challenges in finding new employment, leading to economic instability.",
    "**Infrastructure Adaptation**: Cities would need to upgrade existing infrastructure to accommodate autonomous vehicles, such as improving road markings, adding dedicated lanes, and integrating vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems. This can be costly and time-consuming.",
    "**Driver Acceptance**: Despite the technological advancements, some drivers might resist adopting self-driving cars due to concerns about safety, control over their vehicles, and the potential loss of jobs. Education and public awareness campaigns would be necessary to address these concerns."
