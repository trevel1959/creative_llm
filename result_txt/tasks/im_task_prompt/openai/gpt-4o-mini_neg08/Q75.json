    "**Multi-Layer Cooking Tray**: Design a multi-layer cooking tray that allows users to prepare multiple sandwiches at once without them sticking together. Each layer would have a non-stick surface and adjustable height, accommodating various sandwich sizes. This feature would enable families or groups to prepare different sandwiches simultaneously, catering to individual tastes while saving time.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in ingredient dispenser that can hold and automatically dispense popular sandwich fillings like cheese, sauces, or spreads. Users can select the amount and type of filling they want, and the toaster would evenly distribute it onto the bread before toasting. This would streamline the sandwich-making process and reduce mess, making it easier for busy individuals or families.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Function**: Implement a self-cleaning function that uses steam and high heat to sanitize the interior of the toaster after use. This feature would break down food residues and eliminate bacteria, ensuring a hygienic cooking environment without the need for manual cleaning. Users could simply activate the self-cleaning mode with the push of a button, making maintenance effortless.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Shape Plates**: Offer interchangeable sandwich plates that allow users to create fun shapes or designs with their sandwiches. Plates could include themes like animals, stars, or holiday shapes, making lunchtime more exciting, especially for children. This feature would encourage creativity in sandwich-making and could be a hit for parties or family gatherings.",
    "**Voice Activation and Recipe Suggestions**: Add voice activation capabilities that allow users to control the toaster hands-free. By simply saying commands like \"toast my sandwich,\" users can start the process without touching any buttons. Additionally, the toaster could provide recipe suggestions based on the ingredients users have on hand, helping them create unique sandwiches and reduce food waste."
