    "**Human-Powered Lift**: Develop a human-powered lift system, similar to a bicycle-powered elevator. This would involve a series of pulleys and a crank system that allows individuals to pull themselves up to different floors. The lift could be designed to accommodate a few people at a time, promoting teamwork and exercise. It could also incorporate a fun element, such as a leaderboard to encourage competition among users.",
    "**Zipline Adventure**: Install a zipline system that runs from the top of the skyscraper down to a lower level or a nearby building. Participants would don harnesses and glide down the zipline, which could include thrilling twists and turns. This could be marketed as an extreme adventure experience, allowing individuals to enjoy breathtaking views while making their descent. Safety measures would be paramount, including thorough training and equipment checks.",
    "**Stair Climbing Competitions**: Organize stair climbing competitions where participants race to the top of the skyscraper using the stairs. This could be a timed event with categories for different age groups and fitness levels. To add excitement, there could be themed events (like costumes or charity fundraisers) to encourage participation. The competition could also include music and entertainment on the lower levels to create a festive atmosphere.",
    "**Rappelling Experience**: Set up a rappelling experience where participants can safely descend the building using climbing gear. While this idea focuses on descending rather than ascending, it could be combined with a staircase climb to create a two-part adventure. Participants would climb the stairs to the top and then rappel down, offering a thrilling combination of cardio and adrenaline.",
    "**Artistic Climbing Installations**: Collaborate with artists to create climbing installations that transform the exterior of the skyscraper into an art piece. These installations could include climbing walls or artistic structures that allow people to climb while enjoying the artwork. This would not only provide a way to ascend the building but also turn the skyscraper into a cultural landmark that attracts tourists and art enthusiasts."
