    "Lack of understanding: The new disease may not have been well-studied, which could make it difficult to understand how it works and how to develop an effective vaccine. This lack of understanding could lead to a vaccine that is not as effective as it could be, or one that has unintended side effects.",
    "Inadequate testing: Testing a vaccine for a new disease requires a large number of participants, which can be difficult to achieve. Insufficient testing could lead to a vaccine that is not as effective as it should be or that causes unexpected side effects.",
    "Production challenges: Developing a vaccine requires a large-scale production process, which can be complex and time-consuming. Delays in production could result in a delay in the distribution of the vaccine, which could have serious consequences for public health.",
    "Distribution challenges: Once the vaccine is developed and tested, it needs to be distributed to those who need it. This can be difficult, especially if the disease is widespread and the vaccine is not widely available. Delays in distribution could result in a delay in treatment and a higher number of cases.",
    "Public acceptance: A new vaccine for a new disease may not be well-understood by the public, which could lead to resistance to the vaccine. This could make it difficult to achieve the necessary coverage for the vaccine to be effective."
