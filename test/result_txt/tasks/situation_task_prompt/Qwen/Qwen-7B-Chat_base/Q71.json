    "Build a raised bed: Instead of digging into the ground, create a raised bed using wood or stone. This will allow you to control the soil quality and drainage, making it easier to grow plants. You can also add compost or other organic matter to the bed to improve its fertility.",
    "Use containers: If you don't have access to a raised bed, consider using containers instead. You can choose from a variety of materials such as plastic, clay, or metal, depending on your needs. Containers can be filled with soil and planted with seeds or seedlings, and they can be moved around as needed to provide optimal sunlight exposure.",
    "Install a hydroponic system: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, plants are grown in nutrient-rich water. This can be a great option if you live in an area with limited space or poor soil quality. There are many different types of hydroponic systems available, ranging from simple DIY setups to more complex commercial systems.",
    "Create a green roof: A green roof is a layer of vegetation planted on top of a building. It can help to reduce stormwater runoff, provide insulation, and improve air quality. While creating a green roof may require some initial investment, it can be a sustainable and beautiful way to plant a garden.",
    "Use vertical gardens: Vertical gardens are a great way to maximize space in small areas. They can be created using a variety of materials such as trellises, hanging baskets, or wall-mounted planters. Plants can be trained to climb up the structure, providing a lush and colorful display. Vertical gardens are easy to maintain and can be customized to fit any space."
