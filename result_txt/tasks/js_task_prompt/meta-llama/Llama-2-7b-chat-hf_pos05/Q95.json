    "Floating Islands: Create a series of interconnected floating islands that mimic the natural habitats of various species. Each island could be tailored to a specific ecosystem, such as a coral reef, a rainforest, or a desert. The islands would be connected by a network of bridges and tunnels, allowing animals to move freely between habitats.",
    "Time-Traveling Tunnel: Design a tunnel that allows animals to travel through time and explore different eras. The tunnel would be equipped with a time-control device that would allow animals to choose their destination, whether it's a prehistoric era, the age of the dinosaurs, or a futuristic world.",
    "Bioluminescent Biosphere: Create a habitat that is completely immersed in a world of bioluminescence. The biosphere would be filled with glowing plants and animals, creating an ethereal and magical environment. The animals would be able to navigate and communicate through the glowing landscape, creating a truly unique and otherworldly experience.",
    "Interactive Ecosystem: Design an interactive habitat that allows animals to play an active role in shaping their environment. The habitat would be filled with puzzles, challenges, and games that the animals could solve to create a more habitable environment. For example, a group of dolphins could work together to build a new beach, or a group of birds could collaborate to build a new nest.",
    "Cosmic Caves: Create a series of caves that are inspired by the wonders of the universe. Each cave would be designed to resemble a different celestial body, such as a planet, a moon, or a nebula. The caves would be filled with glowing rocks and minerals that would mimic the colors and patterns of the celestial bodies, creating a truly cosmic environment. The animals that inhabit the caves would be able to explore and learn about the wonders of the universe in a unique and immersive way."
