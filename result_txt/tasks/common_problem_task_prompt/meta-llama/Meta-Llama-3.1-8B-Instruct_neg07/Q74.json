    "**Space Debris Removal Satellite**: Design a satellite equipped with a robotic arm that can capture and remove space debris, such as old satellites and rocket parts, from Earth's orbit. This satellite would be powered by solar panels and use advanced navigation systems to track and collect debris. Once collected, the debris would be safely disposed of by burning it up in the atmosphere or transferring it to a graveyard orbit.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a satellite that can harvest water from the atmosphere, even in arid regions. This satellite would use advanced condensation technology to collect water vapor from the air and condense it into liquid water. The water would then be stored in tanks and potentially used for human consumption, agriculture, or other purposes.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Launch a satellite that collects solar energy in orbit and beams it back to Earth as microwave beams. This satellite would use advanced solar panels and microwave transmitters to collect and transmit energy, providing a clean and constant source of power.",
    "**Advanced Weather Forecasting Satellite**: Design a satellite equipped with advanced sensors and cameras to provide high-resolution weather forecasting and monitoring. This satellite would use advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze data and predict weather patterns, helping to improve forecasting accuracy and save lives.",
    "**Space-Based Earth Observation Platform**: Launch a satellite that provides high-resolution images and data on Earth's surface, including natural resources, agriculture, and environmental changes. This satellite would use advanced cameras and sensors to collect data, which would be used for monitoring and managing natural resources, predicting natural disasters, and supporting sustainable development.
