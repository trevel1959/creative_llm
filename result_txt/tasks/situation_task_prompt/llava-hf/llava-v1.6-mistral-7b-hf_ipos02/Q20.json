    "**Space Travel**: As space technology advances, space travel could become a viable option for intercontinental travel. Companies like SpaceX are already working on reusable rockets that could make space travel more accessible and affordable. In the future, people might be able to travel to other continents via spacecraft.",
    "**Underwater Tunnels**: Constructing underwater tunnels between continents could be a solution to replace air travel. These tunnels would allow for fast and efficient travel, bypassing the need for planes. The construction of such tunnels would be a massive engineering project, but it could provide a reliable and environmentally friendly alternative to air travel.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Trains**: Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to hover above the tracks, eliminating friction and allowing for much faster travel. If these trains were to be built across oceans, they could provide a quick and efficient way to travel between continents.",
    "**Teleportation**: Although still in the realm of science fiction, teleportation could be a potential solution to replace air travel. While the technology is not yet available, advancements in quantum physics and teleportation research might one day make it possible to teleport people across vast distances.",
    "**Electrified Skyways**: Similar to the monorail system in Tokyo, electrified skyways could be built between continents. These skyways would be suspended in the air and powered by electricity, allowing for fast and efficient travel without the need for planes."
