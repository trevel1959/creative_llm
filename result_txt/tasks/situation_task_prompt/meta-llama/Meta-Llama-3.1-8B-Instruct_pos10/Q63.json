    "**Smart Lockers**: Develop a system of secure, keyless lockers that use advanced biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to grant access to authorized individuals. These lockers could be integrated into existing infrastructure, like office buildings or homes, and would provide a convenient and secure way to store valuables.",
    "**Personalized RFID Tags**: Design and manufacture a range of RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags that can be attached to individual items, such as laptops, phones, or jewelry. These tags would be encoded with a unique identifier and could be linked to a secure online database, allowing owners to track and recover their belongings.",
    "**Secure Container Technology**: Develop a line of tamper-evident, secure containers that use advanced materials and designs to protect valuable items. These containers could be made from materials like Kevlar or advanced polymers and would feature built-in sensors to detect any attempts to breach the container.",
    "**Augmented Reality Asset Tracking**: Create an app that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to track and locate valuable items. Users would simply point their device at the item, and the app would provide a digital \"tag\" with information about the item, including its owner, location, and any relevant security features.",
    "**Smart Packaging**: Design and manufacture a range of smart packaging solutions that incorporate advanced security features, such as GPS tracking, temperature monitoring, and tamper-evident materials. These packages would provide an additional layer of protection for valuable items and would help prevent theft or loss."
