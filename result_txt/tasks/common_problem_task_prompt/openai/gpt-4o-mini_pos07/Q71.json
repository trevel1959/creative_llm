    "**Casting Challenges**:    - Finding the right actors who not only fit the roles but also have the necessary talent and stage presence can be a daunting task. Additionally, there may be issues with availability, as top-tier talent often has busy schedules. If key roles are not filled with the right performers, it can negatively impact the show's reception and overall quality.",
    "**Budget Overruns**:    - Producing a Broadway musical can be incredibly expensive, and unforeseen costs often arise. From elaborate set designs to unexpected delays in production, financial mismanagement can lead to budget overruns. If the production team cannot secure additional funding or cut costs effectively, it may jeopardize the entire project, leading to potential financial loss.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**:    - Even with a stellar production, if the marketing strategy is ineffective, the musical may struggle to attract an audience. Identifying the right target demographic, utilizing social media effectively, and creating engaging promotional content are crucial. A lack of visibility can result in poor ticket sales, which can threaten the show's longevity.",
    "**Technical Difficulties During Previews**:    - Technical rehearsals and previews are critical for identifying issues with lighting, sound, and set changes. Problems such as malfunctioning equipment or miscommunication between the crew can lead to chaotic performances. These issues need to be resolved quickly, as they can tarnish the audience's experience and affect critical reviews.",
    "**Changing Audience Tastes**:    - Theatrical trends can shift rapidly, and what resonates with audiences at one point may not hold the same appeal later. Producers must stay attuned to cultural shifts and audience preferences. If a musical fails to connect with contemporary themes or lacks diversity in its storytelling, it may struggle to gain traction."
