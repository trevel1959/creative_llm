    "**Job Displacement**: With robots becoming more capable, there is a risk of job displacement as tasks that were once performed by humans are taken over by machines. This could lead to unemployment and economic instability, particularly in industries where robots can perform tasks more efficiently than humans.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Robots can pose safety risks if they malfunction or are not properly maintained. There is also the risk of robots becoming uncontrollable or turning on their creators. Ensuring the safety of both humans and robots is a significant challenge that must be addressed.",
    "**Regulation and Governance**: As robots become more prevalent, there will be a need for regulations and governance to ensure their safe and ethical use. This could involve creating new laws and standards, as well as establishing agencies to oversee the development and deployment of robots.",
    "**Integration with Human Society**: Robots will need to be integrated into human society in a way that is seamless and does not disrupt the existing social order. This could involve developing interfaces that allow humans and robots to communicate effectively, as well as designing robots that can operate in a variety of environments.",
    "**Resource Consumption**: Robots, particularly those that are powered by electricity or other resources, will consume energy and other materials. This could lead to increased resource consumption and environmental impacts, which will need to be addressed through sustainable design and manufacturing practices."
