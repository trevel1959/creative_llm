    "Once in a lush jungle, there lived a fierce tiger named Tigris, known for his strength and majesty. Yet, beneath his fearsome exterior, Tigris harbored a secret: he was terrified of mice. Every time a tiny mouse scurried by, Tigris would leap into the nearest bush, his heart racing. One day, a wise old mouse named Minu approached him, sensing his fear. “Why are you afraid of me?” she asked. Tigris sighed, “You’re so small, yet so quick!” Minu smiled and replied, “Strength isn’t about size; it’s about courage.” Inspired, Tigris learned to face his fears, and soon, he and Minu became the best of friends.",
