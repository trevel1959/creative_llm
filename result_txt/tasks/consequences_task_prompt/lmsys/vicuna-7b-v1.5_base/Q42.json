    "The concept of weight would no longer be relevant, as objects would not be pulled towards a central point. This would also mean that the idea of mass would need to be redefined.",
    "The way objects move and interact with each other would be vastly different, as there would be no force pulling them towards each other. This could lead to new and unpredictable behaviors in the physical world.",
    "The laws of motion and mechanics would need to be rewritten to account for the absence of gravity. This would be a major challenge for physicists and scientists.",
    "The way planets and other celestial bodies orbit each other would be fundamentally different, as there would be no gravitational attraction to keep them in their orbits. This could lead to chaotic and unpredictable movements in the solar system.",
    "The concept of black holes would need to be redefined, as they rely on the force of gravity to pull in matter. Without gravity, black holes would not exist in the same way."
