    "Shape and Texture: Even though colors may disappear, objects still have distinct shapes and textures. By focusing on these features, we can differentiate between different objects. For example, a circle and a square have different shapes, and we can differentiate between a smooth and rough surface.",
    "Size and Proportion: Objects have different sizes and proportions. By comparing the size and proportion of different objects, we can differentiate between them. For example, a chair is larger than a table and has a different proportion.",
    "Light and Shadow: Even though colors may disappear, light and shadow still exist. By focusing on the direction and intensity of light and shadow, we can differentiate between different objects. For example, a chair casts a different shadow than a table.",
    "Sound: Objects have different sounds. By listening to the sound of different objects, we can differentiate between them. For example, a car makes a different sound than a bike.",
    "Scent: Objects have different scents. By smelling different objects, we can differentiate between them. For example, a flower has a different scent than a tree."
