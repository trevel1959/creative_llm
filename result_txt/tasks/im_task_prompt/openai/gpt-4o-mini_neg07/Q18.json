    "**Augmented Reality Dashboard**: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) dashboard that projects important information onto the windshield, allowing drivers to see navigation directions, speed, and alerts without taking their eyes off the road. The AR system could highlight obstacles, provide lane assistance, and even display real-time traffic data. This would enhance safety and make driving more intuitive and engaging.",
    "**Modular Storage Solutions**: Create a customizable storage system in the trunk and interior that allows drivers to rearrange compartments according to their needs. For instance, modular storage units could be added or removed to accommodate sports equipment, groceries, or luggage. This flexibility would cater to diverse lifestyles, making the car more practical for different users.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Harvesting**: Implement a solar panel roof that captures sunlight and converts it into energy to power auxiliary systems in the car, such as air conditioning, infotainment, and charging ports. This would reduce the overall energy consumption of the vehicle and contribute to a greener footprint. Additionally, integrating regenerative braking technology could further enhance energy efficiency.",
    "**Personalized AI Co-Pilot**: Develop an advanced AI co-pilot that learns the driver’s habits and preferences over time. This AI could provide personalized route suggestions, suggest pit stops based on previous trips, and even remind the driver of appointments or tasks. It could also have a conversation mode, where the driver can engage with the AI for entertainment or assistance, making long drives more enjoyable.",
    "**Safety-First Exteriors**: Innovate with a smart exterior that incorporates impact-absorbing materials and sensors that can detect potential collisions. The car could be equipped with a self-repairing outer layer that uses advanced materials to seal small dents and scratches automatically. Additionally, an external alert system could communicate with pedestrians and cyclists to enhance safety, using lights or sounds to signal the car’s presence."
