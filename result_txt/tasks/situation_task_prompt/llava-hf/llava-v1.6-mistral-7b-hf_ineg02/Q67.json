    "Monitoring wind patterns: Without clouds, wind patterns would be more visible, and one could use these patterns to predict the weather. For example, strong winds might indicate an approaching storm or change in weather conditions.",
    "Analyzing temperature changes: Clouds can help regulate temperature by reflecting sunlight and releasing heat. Without clouds, temperature changes would be more apparent, allowing one to predict changes in weather based on temperature fluctuations.",
    "Studying the color of the sky: Cloudless skies often have a distinct color, such as deep blue or a hazy white. Observing the color of the sky could provide clues about the weather, such as the presence of smog, fog, or even a dust storm.",
    "Watching for signs of precipitation: Rain or snow often form in the presence of clouds. Without clouds, one could look for signs of precipitation, such as the formation of dew on surfaces or the appearance of rainbows, to predict upcoming weather changes.",
    "Analyzing wildlife behavior: Certain animals and insects have specific behaviors related to weather changes. For example, birds might fly lower or gather in large groups during storms, or certain insects might become more active before a rainstorm."
