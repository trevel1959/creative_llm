    "**Data Management and Integrity**: With a vast amount of data being generated, maintaining data integrity and proper management can pose significant challenges. Issues may arise from data entry errors, loss of data due to inadequate backup systems, or miscommunication among team members about data handling protocols. These problems could lead to flawed results, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions from the experiment.",
    "**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: In experiments involving human subjects, recruiting a diverse and representative sample can be difficult. Moreover, retaining participants throughout the study can be a challenge due to factors like dropout rates or non-compliance with study protocols. This could result in a sample size that is too small or biased, ultimately impacting the validity of the findings.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Communication**: Large-scale experiments often involve multiple disciplines and teams working together. Poor communication between these groups can lead to misunderstandings, misalignment of goals, and duplicated efforts. For example, if the biology team is unaware of the chemistry team's modifications to the experimental protocol, it could lead to inconsistent results and confusion about the experiment's direction.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Conducting a large-scale scientific experiment often raises ethical questions, particularly if it involves human or animal subjects. Issues may arise concerning informed consent, potential harm to participants, or the use of sensitive data. Navigating these ethical concerns requires thorough planning and adherence to regulatory guidelines, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Organizing the logistics of a large-scale experiment can be daunting. This includes coordinating schedules, transportation of materials, and ensuring that all necessary equipment is available and functioning. Delays in any of these logistical components can stall the experiment, resulting in wasted time and resources. For instance, if critical supplies are delayed, it could lead to a significant setback in the experiment timeline."
