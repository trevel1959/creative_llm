    "**Modular Design with Expandable Compartments**: Redesign the suitcase to feature a modular design with expandable compartments. This would allow travelers to customize the suitcase's size based on their needs. For example, a small weekend trip could utilize a compact size, while a longer journey could expand to accommodate more items. Each compartment could also have specific functions, such as a waterproof section for wet clothes or a padded area for electronics.",
    "**Built-in Solar Charging Panel**: Integrate a solar charging panel into the suitcase's exterior to allow travelers to charge their devices on the go. This eco-friendly feature would be particularly useful during long layovers or outdoor adventures. The suitcase could include USB ports for easy device connection, ensuring that travelers can keep their gadgets powered without relying on available outlets.",
    "**Self-weighing Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-weighing mechanism that automatically weighs the suitcase when it is closed. This feature could alert travelers if they exceed airline weight limits through a connected app or an LED display on the suitcase. This would save time and stress at the airport, preventing last-minute repacking and fees.",
    "**Personalized Interior with RFID Tags**: Introduce a personalized interior system using RFID tags for organizing belongings. Travelers could place RFID tags on their items, and the suitcase would have a built-in scanner that keeps track of whatâ€™s inside. An accompanying app could help users locate items quickly, making packing and unpacking more efficient. This would be especially useful for frequent travelers who often need to remember what they packed.",
    "**Integrated Digital Lock with Biometric Access**: Upgrade the security of the suitcase with an integrated digital lock that uses biometric access, such as fingerprint recognition. This would ensure that only the owner can open the suitcase, adding an extra layer of security against theft. The lock could also have a backup PIN option for emergencies, providing flexibility while maintaining safety."
