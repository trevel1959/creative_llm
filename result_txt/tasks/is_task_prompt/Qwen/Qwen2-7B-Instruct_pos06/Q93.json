    "**Innovative Snail Racing Equipment**: Create a series of racing suits or exoskeletons that provide enhanced speed and maneuverability for snails. This can include lightweight materials, aerodynamic shapes, and possibly even small electric motors to assist in movement. The idea could be to create a mini \"Formula One\" for snails, complete with tracks, races, and a championship. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Snail-powered Transportation**: Develop a micro-scale transportation system where snails are used as natural, eco-friendly vehicles. They could carry small, lightweight cargo, or even passengers in a futuristic \"snail pod\" design. This could be particularly useful in densely populated urban areas for delivering goods without emitting pollutants. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Snail-based Food Products**: Research and develop a range of food products made from snails, focusing on health benefits and sustainability. This could include snacks, supplements, and even main dishes that cater to both adventurous eaters and those looking for healthier, sustainable protein sources. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Educational Snail Racing Game**: Create an interactive game where players race snails through various terrains and obstacles. The game could teach children about biology, ecology, and environmental conservation while being engaging and fun. It could also incorporate elements of strategy and resource management. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Artistic Snail Races**: Organize artistic events where snails participate in races, but instead of measuring speed, the focus is on creativity. Participants could design their own snail racers, and the winners might be judged based on factors like originality, design, and presentation. This could be a unique form of performance art or community engagement. Confidence Score: 0.87"
