    "**Home Design Modifications**: Retrofit your home with fire-resistant materials. Replace wooden siding with stucco, brick, or metal, which can withstand higher temperatures. Install double-paned tempered glass windows that can resist heat and flames. Consider a metal roof instead of shingles, as it can prevent sparks from igniting your home. These changes can significantly reduce the risk of fire damage.",
    "**Create a Firebreak**: Establish a firebreak around your property by clearing a wide area of all combustible materials, such as dry leaves, dead plants, and firewood. Use gravel or concrete to create a barrier that can slow down the spread of fire. This technique is particularly effective in areas prone to wildfires, as it provides a buffer zone that helps protect your home.",
    "**Water Reservoir System**: Install a rainwater collection system that can be used as an emergency water supply in case of fire. Use large barrels or tanks to capture rainwater from your roof, which can be strategically placed around your property. In the event of a fire, this water can be used to douse flames or create a barrier of water around your home. Adding a simple irrigation system can also help keep your landscaping moist and less flammable.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Barriers**: Construct temporary fire-resistant barriers using materials like sandbags filled with soil or gravel. In the event of an approaching fire, these barriers can be quickly deployed around the perimeter of your home to help redirect flames and embers away from the structure. This quick-response method can be particularly useful if you have limited time to prepare.",
    "**Emergency Fire Signal System**: Develop a neighborhood watch-style fire alert system using colored flags or lights. Each household can agree on a color code that indicates different levels of fire danger (e.g., yellow for caution, red for immediate danger). This system allows neighbors to communicate effectively and take collective action, such as creating firebreaks or evacuating if necessary."
