Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Teach plants to communicate with humans: I would work on developing a language or system that allows plants to communicate their thoughts and feelings to humans. This could involve using sensors or other technology to detect and interpret plant signals, and developing a way for humans to understand and respond to these signals. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Ask plants for advice on sustainable living: I would ask plants for their insights on how humans can live more sustainably, given their unique perspective on the natural world. Plants could provide valuable advice on topics such as carbon sequestration, water conservation, and soil health. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Create a plant-based language for interspecies communication: I would work on developing a language or system that allows plants and animals to communicate with each other. This could involve creating a new vocabulary and grammar, as well as developing a way for different species to understand and respond to each other's signals. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use plants to create new materials and technologies: I would work on harnessing the unique properties of plants to create new materials and technologies. For example, I could use plant-based polymers to create sustainable plastics, or use plant-based sensors to develop new types of technology. Confidence score: 0.9"
