    "Create a telepathic remote control: I would create a remote control that can connect to any electronic device through my mind. With this remote, I could control the device by simply thinking about the commands. For example, I could turn on the TV by thinking \"TV on,\" change the channel by thinking \"change channel to ESPN,\" and adjust the volume by thinking \"volume up.\" This would eliminate the need for physical buttons and make controlling electronic devices more convenient and efficient.",
    "Develop a mind-controlled wheelchair: I would use my mind control ability to create a wheelchair that can be controlled by my thoughts.

    "Create a mind-controlled robot: I would use my mind control ability to create a robot that can be controlled by my thoughts.
