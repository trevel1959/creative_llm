    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences can hinder effective communication and collaboration among participants. To mitigate this issue, the summit could employ a diverse team of interpreters and translators proficient in the languages of all participating nations. Furthermore, providing multilingual materials and resources before the summit can ensure that all attendees are well-prepared and informed, allowing for more productive discussions.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodation, and meeting venues for a diverse group of international delegates can be complex. To streamline this process, the organizing committee could create a dedicated logistics team responsible for managing all aspects of travel arrangements, including visas, transportation, and lodging. Implementing a centralized online platform for participants to access real-time information about their travel plans and accommodations can also enhance the experience and reduce confusion.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Given the high-profile nature of an international peace summit, security threats may arise, necessitating comprehensive planning. Organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and international security experts to develop a robust security protocol. This could include risk assessments, emergency response plans, and the implementation of security measures such as controlled access points and screening procedures for attendees.",
    "**Diverse Agenda and Conflicting Interests**: Participants may have differing priorities and agendas, which could lead to conflicts during discussions. To address this, organizers could facilitate pre-summit meetings or focus groups where representatives can outline their key issues and goals. This would allow the summit to create a more structured agenda that acknowledges diverse interests while fostering collaboration on common goals. Utilizing a skilled mediator to guide discussions can also help manage conflicts and keep the dialogue productive.",
    "**Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: Organizing a large-scale international event can have a significant environmental footprint. To minimize this impact, the summit could adopt sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials, providing digital resources instead of printed materials, and encouraging participants to use public transportation or carpooling. Additionally, partnering with local environmental organizations to promote tree planting or conservation initiatives during the summit could leave a positive legacy."
