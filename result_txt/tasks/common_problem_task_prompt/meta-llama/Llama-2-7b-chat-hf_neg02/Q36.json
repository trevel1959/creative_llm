    "Solar Panel Rental Program: Create a program where homeowners can rent solar panels at a low monthly fee. This program would be beneficial for those who cannot afford the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels. The rental fee would cover the installation, maintenance, and repair of the panels. The city can partner with solar panel manufacturers to provide high-quality and efficient panels. This program would not only increase the adoption of solar panels but also provide an alternative to homeowners who cannot afford the initial investment.",
    "Community Solar Garden: Develop a community solar garden where multiple homes can share the benefits of a single solar panel system. This could be achieved by installing a large solar panel array in a central location, such as a park or a vacant lot. Each home participating in the program would receive a portion of the energy generated by the solar panel based on their contribution to the overall cost of the system. This would provide an affordable and accessible way for homeowners to adopt solar energy.",
    "Solar Panel Leasing Incentives: Offer incentives for homeowners who lease solar panels rather than purchasing them. This could include tax breaks, rebates, or low-interest loans. By making leasing solar panels more affordable, more homeowners would be willing to adopt solar energy. Additionally, the city could partner with local businesses to offer discounted leasing rates for residents who sign up for the program.",
    "Solar Panel Installation Challenges: Create a program that addresses the challenges of installing solar panels in urban areas. This could include working with building owners to find suitable roof space for solar panels, navigating complex zoning regulations, and providing education and support to homeowners who are new to solar energy. By addressing these challenges, more homeowners would be willing to adopt solar energy, and the city would become a leader in sustainable energy.",
    "Solar Panel Recycling Program: Develop a program to recycle old or damaged solar panels. As solar panels reach the end of their useful life, they can be recycled to recover valuable materials such as silicon, aluminum, and copper. By creating a recycling program, the city can ensure that these materials are handled respons"
