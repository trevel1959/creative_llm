    "**Incorporate Vertical Gardening**: Instead of spreading your garden across a large area, consider vertical gardening to save space and maximize sunlight exposure. You can use structures like trellises, wall planters, or even DIY vertical planters made from repurposed materials such as pallets or wooden boards. This approach allows you to grow a variety of plants, including tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and flowers, in a compact space.",
    "**Create a Pollinator Garden**: Focus on planting flowers that attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies. Include a mix of nectar-rich plants such as lavender, sunflowers, marigolds, and zinnias. Not only will these plants add color and beauty to your garden, but they'll also help support local ecosystems by providing essential food sources for pollinators.",
    "**Integrate Edible Landscaping**: Go beyond traditional vegetable beds and incorporate edible landscaping into your garden design. Choose plants that are not only visually appealing but also edible, such as herbs, fruits, and vegetables. For example, you could create a \"living wall\" with edible plants, or plant fruit trees interspersed among other garden elements. This dual-purpose design ensures you have both aesthetic and functional benefits.",
    "**Implement a Composting System**: Start a compost pile or bin in your garden to recycle kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil. This reduces waste and provides an excellent source of organic matter for your plants. Compost can be used to enrich the soil around your garden plants, improving their health and growth.",
    "**Incorporate Native Plants**: Select plants that are native to your region. These species are adapted to local conditions and require less water, fertilizer, and maintenance compared to non-native plants. Native plants also provide habitat for local wildlife, making your garden more biodiverse and environmentally friendly. Consider adding elements like bird baths, insect hotels, or water features to further enhance the ecosystem within your garden."
