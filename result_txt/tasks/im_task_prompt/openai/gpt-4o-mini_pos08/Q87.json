    "**Integrated LED Lighting**: Incorporate waterproof LED lights into the pool float for nighttime use. The lights could change colors or create patterns, turning the float into a glowing centerpiece during evening pool parties. Users could control the lights via a smartphone app, allowing for a fun and personalized experience that enhances the ambiance of nighttime swimming.",
    "**Self-Inflating Mechanism**: Design a pool float with a built-in self-inflating mechanism that uses a small, rechargeable battery-powered fan. Users can simply press a button to inflate the float in minutes, eliminating the need for manual pumps or breath. This feature would make it much more convenient for users to set up their floats quickly and enjoy the pool without hassle.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a pool float made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that reduce environmental impact. This float could be designed to break down naturally after a certain period, or be made from recycled plastics. Additionally, the design could incorporate patterns or messages promoting ocean conservation, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Smart Float with Safety Features**: Create a high-tech pool float that includes safety features such as a built-in flotation sensor and a GPS tracker. The float could alert users if it drifts too far from the pool area or if someone falls overboard. This would be particularly beneficial for families with young children, ensuring peace of mind while enjoying the water.",
    "**Ergonomic Support Design**: Redesign the pool float to provide better ergonomic support for users. Incorporate lumbar support, adjustable headrests, and armrests that can be repositioned to suit individual preferences. This would enhance comfort, making it easier for users to relax for extended periods, whether theyâ€™re sunbathing or reading a book."
