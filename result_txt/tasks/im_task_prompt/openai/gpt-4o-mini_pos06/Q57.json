    "**Integrated Touchpad and Gesture Control**:    - Design a mouse that incorporates a touchpad on its surface, allowing users to perform multi-touch gestures (like pinch-to-zoom or swipe) without needing a separate touchpad or keyboard shortcuts. This would streamline workflows for graphic designers, gamers, and anyone who frequently uses shortcuts, enabling them to switch between traditional clicking and gesture controls seamlessly.",
    "**Customizable Weight System**:    - Create a mouse with a customizable weight system that allows users to adjust the weight of the mouse according to their preference. This could be achieved through removable weights or a digital system that lets users select the desired weight via an app. Gamers and graphic designers often have different preferences for mouse sensitivity and control, so this feature would provide a tailored experience.",
    "**Wireless Charging Base**:    - Develop a mouse that comes with a stylish wireless charging base that not only charges the mouse but also serves as a desktop organizer. The base could include compartments for storing small items like USB drives, paper clips, or notes, keeping the workspace tidy. This would eliminate the need for batteries or charging cables, making it more convenient for users.",
    "**Smart Mouse with AI Integration**:    - Introduce a smart mouse that integrates AI capabilities to learn users' habits and preferences over time. It could suggest shortcuts based on frequently used applications, adjust sensitivity based on user activity, and even provide reminders for breaks to prevent repetitive strain injuries. The mouse could connect to a companion app that provides insights into usage patterns and productivity.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Lighting**:    - Incorporate mood-responsive LED lighting into the mouse that changes color based on the user's emotional state or activity. For example, the mouse could glow blue during focused work, red during gaming, and green during relaxation. This feature could use biofeedback sensors to gauge stress levels or heart rate, providing a unique way to visualize and manage work-life balance."
