One day, a storm threatened the village, and the turtle decided to move to safety. The house sheltered the villagers, sharing warmth and comfort. When the storm passed, they emerged to find their home had saved them. Grateful, they decorated the turtle with flowers, and from that day on, the house and its turtle companion traveled together, becoming a symbol of hope and resilience.",
