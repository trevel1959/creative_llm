    "some artificial lighting: If the sun didn't rise tomorrow, we could use artificial lighting such as lamps or LED lights to provide enough light during the day. This would allow us to continue our daily activities as usual.",
    "install solar panels: We could install solar panels on our homes or buildings to generate our own electricity. This would allow us to use the electricity to power our artificial lighting.",
    "use natural light sources: We could use natural light sources such as reflective surfaces or mirrors to reflect sunlight onto our homes or buildings. This would allow us to continue to receive some natural light during the day.",
    "use bioluminescent plants: We could use bioluminescent plants to provide light during the day. These plants produce light through a chemical reaction, which could be harnessed to provide some natural light.",
    "use geothermal energy: We could use geothermal energy to power our artificial lighting. This would involve tapping into the natural heat of the earth to generate electricity, which could then be used to power our lights."
