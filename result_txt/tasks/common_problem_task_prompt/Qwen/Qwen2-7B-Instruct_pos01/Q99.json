    "**Braille Display Screen**: This idea involves creating a portable device that can convert digital text into Braille for visually impaired individuals. The device could use advanced algorithms to translate text from any format (like PDFs or eBooks) into tactile Braille characters that can be read by touch. Users would simply connect their devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets) via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to access content. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Audio-Enhanced Environments**: This concept focuses on creating environments that enhance auditory experiences for the visually impaired. These spaces might include soundscapes designed to guide people through areas, like parks or malls, where sounds of different directions and distances help orient users. For example, a gentle breeze in one direction could indicate an exit, while a louder noise could indicate a gathering point. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Interactive Tactile Maps**: Develop large-scale tactile maps using textures, raised lines, and braille labels. These maps could be used in public spaces such as airports, train stations, and museums. Users can feel the layout of buildings, rooms, and paths, making navigation easier. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Smart Canes with AI Navigation**: Smart canes equipped with ultrasonic sensors, GPS, and AI algorithms can help visually impaired individuals navigate unfamiliar environments. These canes would detect obstacles, stairs, and other features, providing real-time audio guidance on how to proceed safely. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Virtual Reality Training Simulations**: Create immersive VR training programs for tasks like grocery shopping, cooking, or managing personal finances. These simulations provide a safe environment for individuals to practice skills they need in daily life, with feedback from AI tutors that can adjust the difficulty based on user progress.
