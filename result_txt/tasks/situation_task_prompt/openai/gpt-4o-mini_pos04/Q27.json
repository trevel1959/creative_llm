    "**Natural Ventilation Systems**: Create a system of strategically placed vents and windows that take advantage of prevailing winds and natural breezes. By designing a series of operable skylights and window louvres, you can facilitate cross-ventilation, allowing cooler air to flow in and warm air to escape. This could be complemented with a \"ventilation schedule\" to open and close windows at optimal times based on weather forecasts.",
    "**Indoor Plant Walls**: Install vertical gardens or plant walls inside the home. Plants not only help regulate humidity but also provide cooling through the process of transpiration. A wall filled with moisture-retaining plants could lower the temperature in the room, while also improving air quality and creating a pleasant aesthetic.",
    "**Reflective Window Films**: Apply reflective or tinted window films to glass surfaces to reduce heat gain during the summer months. These films can reflect a significant portion of solar energy, keeping indoor spaces cooler. In winter, you could switch to heavier curtains or thermal blinds to retain warmth, making use of these films seasonally.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling with DIY Mist Systems**: Create a simple evaporative cooling system using a network of fine misting nozzles connected to a water source. By placing these nozzles strategically around the home, they can release a fine mist that cools the air through evaporation, especially in drier climates. This system could be automated with sensors to activate during peak heat times.",
    "**Insulated Interior Spaces**: Design specific rooms within the home that can be insulated or uninsulated based on the season. For instance, in winter, you could close off certain areas and use insulating materials (like thermal curtains) to keep warmth in. In summer, those areas could be opened up to create airflow and reduce the temperature in the rest of the house."
