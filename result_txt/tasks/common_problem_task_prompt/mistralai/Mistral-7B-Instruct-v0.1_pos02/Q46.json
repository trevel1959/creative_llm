    "Develop a smart and integrated transportation network: One way to overhaul the public transportation system is to develop a smart and integrated network that uses technology to provide a seamless travel experience. This could include implementing a contactless payment system, real-time tracking of buses and trains, and the use of mobile apps to provide information on routes, schedules, and delays. By integrating different modes of transportation, such as buses, trains, and bike-sharing programs, the city can provide a more efficient and convenient transportation system for its residents.",
    "Implement a BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system: Another option for overhauling the public transportation system is to implement a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. BRT is a high-quality, high-capacity public transportation system that combines the best features of buses and trains. BRT systems typically have dedicated lanes, high-frequency service, and advanced signaling systems, which can significantly reduce travel times and improve the reliability of the system.",
    "Promote the use of electric and hybrid vehicles: To reduce the environmental impact of the public transportation system, the city can promote the use of electric and hybrid vehicles. This could include investing in electric buses and hybrid-electric trains, as well as providing incentives for individuals to use electric or hybrid vehicles for their daily commute. By reducing the reliance on fossil fuels, the city can help to mitigate climate change and improve air quality.",
    "Expand the transportation network to underserved areas: One way to improve the public transportation system is to expand the network to include areas that are currently underserved. This could include building new transit lines or improving existing ones, as well as providing better access to transportation options for low-income and marginalized communities. By providing more comprehensive transportation options, the city can help to reduce poverty and promote economic development.",
    "Implement a congestion pricing scheme: To reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of the public transportation system, the city can implement a congestion pricing scheme. This could involve charging drivers a fee for entering certain areas during peak traffic hours, or for using certain roads or bridges. The revenue generated from congestion pricing can be used to fund improvements to the public transportation system, such as new transit lines or upgrades to existing infrastructure. By reducing traffic congestion, the city can help to improve the quality of life for its residents"
