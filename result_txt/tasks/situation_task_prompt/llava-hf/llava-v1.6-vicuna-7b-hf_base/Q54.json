    "Floating devices: Another option could be to use floating devices such as inflatable rafts, inner tubes, or even large inflatable boats. These can be used to help people cross the water, but they may not be suitable for all conditions or all people.",

    "Rafting: Using a raft or a small boat to transport people across the water is another option. This can be done with a group of people working together to paddle the raft or boat, or with the assistance of an engine or oars.",
    "Hydrofoil or ferry: In some cases, there may be a hydrofoil or ferry service available to transport people across the water. These can be a convenient and efficient way to travel, but they may not be available in all locations.",
    "Swimming with a flotation device: Another option could be to use a flotation device, such as a life jacket or personal flotation device, while swimming across the water. This can provide additional buoyancy and safety, but it may not be necessary in all cases."
