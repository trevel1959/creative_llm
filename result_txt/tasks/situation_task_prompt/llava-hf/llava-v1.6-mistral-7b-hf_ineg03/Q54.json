    "**Underwater Tunnels**: Another possibility is the construction of underwater tunnels that connect different land masses. These tunnels would allow for the safe and efficient passage of people and goods across large bodies of water without the need for traditional ships or boats.",
    "**Hydrofoils and Personal Watercraft**: In the absence of large ships, hydrofoils and personal watercraft could become more popular modes of transportation. These are smaller, faster, and more maneuverable than traditional boats, making them ideal for crossing large bodies of water.",
    "**Flying Transportation**: In a future where ships and boats are no longer the primary mode of transportation across large bodies of water, flying transportation options such as seaplanes, helicopters, and drones could become more prevalent. These vehicles can take off and land on water, making them a viable alternative to traditional boats.",
    "**Submarines**: Another possibility is the use of submarines for transportation across large bodies of water. Submarines are already capable of navigating underwater, and could be used to transport people and goods across long distances.",
    "**Aquatic Robots**: In a world without ships and boats, aquatic robots could become a viable mode of transportation. These robots could be designed to navigate large bodies of water, carrying passengers or cargo from one point to another."
