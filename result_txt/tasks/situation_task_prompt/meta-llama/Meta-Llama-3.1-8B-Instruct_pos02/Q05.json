    "**Solar-Powered Emergency Light**: Develop a portable, solar-powered light that can be charged during the day and provide sufficient illumination for several hours in case of a sunless tomorrow. The device could be equipped with a rechargeable battery, a solar panel, and a high-intensity LED light. It would be compact, lightweight, and easy to carry, making it perfect for emergency situations.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant-Based Solution**: Create a system that utilizes bioluminescent plants or microorganisms to produce light. These organisms could be cultivated in a controlled environment and used to illuminate a specific area. This approach would not only provide a sustainable light source but also create a unique and fascinating display.",
    "**Quantum Dot-Based Light**: Develop a light-emitting technology that utilizes quantum dots to produce a bright, efficient, and long-lasting light source. These tiny particles could be engineered to emit specific wavelengths of light, allowing for a wide range of colors and applications. This technology could be used to create a portable light source or integrated into various devices.",
    "**Fiber Optic Illumination**: Design a network of fiber optic cables that can be used to transmit light from a central source to a specific area. This system would be highly efficient, as it would minimize energy loss and maximize light distribution. The fiber optic cables could be arranged in a grid or pattern to create a unique and adjustable lighting system.",
    "**Advanced LED Array**: Develop a highly efficient and compact LED array that can be powered by a small, portable battery or a rechargeable energy source. The LED array could be designed to emit a specific color temperature or spectrum, making it suitable for various applications, such as reading, task lighting, or ambient illumination. This technology could be used to create a range of products, from handheld lights to smart home devices."
