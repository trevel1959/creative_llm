    "Reduced Limb Loss: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, individuals would no longer have to fear losing a limb due to injury or disease. This would significantly reduce the risk of limb loss and its associated consequences, such as reduced mobility and independence.",

Patients who have undergone limb amputation could potentially regenerate their limbs, restoring their mobility and independence. This would reduce the need for prosthetic limbs and the associated costs and limitations.",
    "New Medical Applications: The ability to regenerate limbs would open up new medical applications. For instance, doctors could potentially use stem cells to regenerate damaged or diseased limbs, or even grow new limbs to replace missing ones. This could treat a wide range of conditions, including birth defects, trauma, and cancer.",
    "Ethical Considerations: With the ability to regenerate limbs, there would be new ethical considerations. For instance, would individuals have the right to choose which limbs to regenerate and which to retain? Would there be a limit to the number of limbs that could be regenerated? How would society handle the emotional and psychological impact of losing a limb, only to have it regenerated?",
    "Changes in Social Dynamics: The ability to regenerate limbs would likely have a significant impact on social dynamics. Individuals who have undergone limb regeneration may face discrimination or stigma, leading to social isolation.
