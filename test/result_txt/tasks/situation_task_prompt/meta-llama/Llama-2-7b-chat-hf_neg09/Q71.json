    "Growing a \"Rooftop Garden\": If the ground becomes too hard to dig into, you could consider planting a rooftop garden. This would allow you to grow plants in a controlled environment, such as a greenhouse or a hydroponic system, where the soil is not a limiting factor. You could grow a variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, and flowers, in a compact and efficient space.",
    "Using a \"Nutrient-Rich Soil Alternative\": If the ground is too hard to dig into, you could try using a nutrient-rich soil alternative, such as vermicompost or worm castings. These alternatives are made from decomposed organic matter and are rich in nutrients that can support plant growth. You could mix the alternative soil with other organic materials, such as peat moss or coconut coir, to create a well-draining and nutrient-rich growing medium.",
    "\"Aeroponic Gardening\": Aeroponic gardening is a method of growing plants in the air, rather than in soil. In this system, plant roots are suspended in a nutrient-rich solution, which is pumped through the system at regular intervals. This allows for maximum exposure to oxygen and nutrients, resulting in faster growth and higher yields. You could use this method to grow a variety of plants, including leafy greens, herbs, and flowers.",
    "\"Hydroponic Gardening\": Hydroponic gardening is similar to aeroponic gardening, but in this system, the plants are supported in a nutrient-rich solution rather than in the air. This allows for a more controlled environment, and you can adjust the nutrient levels and pH levels to optimize plant growth. You could use this method to grow a variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, and flowers.",
    "\"Geodesic Dome Greenhouse\": A geodesic dome greenhouse is a unique and efficient way to grow plants in a small space. The dome shape provides maximum exposure to sunlight and allows for good air circulation, while the greenhouse material provides insulation and protection from the elements. You could use this method to grow a variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, and flowers, in a compact and sustainable"
