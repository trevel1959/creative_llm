    "To combat jealousy, you could try to focus on the positive aspects of your own work and accomplishments. Keep a list of your own successes, no matter how small, and remind yourself of them when you start to feel jealous. This can help shift your focus away from others and onto your own progress.",
    "You could also try to cultivate a sense of curiosity and wonder about the deep-sea exploration mission. Instead of focusing on the success of others, focus on the excitement and potential for discovery that the mission represents. This can help you feel more motivated and engaged in your own work.",
    "Another idea is to practice mindfulness and self-compassion. When you start to feel jealous, try taking a deep breath andating your own accomplishments. Remind yourself that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and that success is not always about comparison.",
    "You could also try to learn from others and seek out their advice and guidance. Instead of feeling jealous, use their success as an opportunity to learn and grow. Ask them for tips and insights on how they were able to accomplish their tasks so seamlessly, and use this information to improve your own work.",
    "Finally, you could try to focus on the bigger picture and the impact that the deep-sea exploration mission will have on the world. Instead of feeling jealous, think about the potential for scientific discovery and the potential for the mission to advance our understanding of the ocean and its inhabitants. This can help you feel more connected to the mission and less focused on the success of others."
