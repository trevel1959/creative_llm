    "**Galactic Gardening**: Imagine a futuristic, zero-gravity garden where astronauts can grow exotic plants in space. The garden would be a self-sustaining ecosystem, with a network of tubes and containers that provide the necessary water, air, and nutrients for the plants to thrive. The plants would be genetically engineered to produce oxygen, purify water, and even help to recycle waste. This garden would serve as a vital resource for long-duration space missions, providing a sustainable source of food, oxygen, and a sense of connection to nature.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Envision contact lenses that are embedded with tiny sensors, microchips, and cameras. These lenses would monitor the wearer's vital signs, track their surroundings, and even provide augmented reality displays. The lenses could detect glucose levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics, alerting the wearer to potential health issues. They could also project virtual information, such as navigation directions, reminders, or even virtual try-on capabilities for clothing and makeup.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Floating Cities**: Picture a series of sustainable, floating cities that exist above the water's surface. These cities would be designed to minimize their impact on the environment, using renewable energy sources, advanced water management systems, and locally sourced materials. The cities would be powered by a combination of solar, wind, and hydro energy, with a focus on reducing waste and carbon emissions. They would serve as a model for sustainable urban planning, providing a unique opportunity for people to live in harmony with the ocean.",
    "**Mind-Controlled Prosthetics**: Imagine a prosthetic limb that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. Using advanced brain-computer interface technology, the prosthetic would be able to read the user's neural signals, allowing them to control the limb with precision and accuracy. This technology would enable people with paralysis or amputations to regain their independence, interacting with their environment in a more natural and intuitive way.",
    "**Bioluminescent Architecture**: Envision buildings that are infused with bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria. These organisms would be used to create sustainable, energy-efficient lighting systems, reducing the need for artificial lighting and minimizing energy consumption. The buildings would be designed to maximize the growth and proliferation of these organisms, creating a unique and breathtaking visual effect that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing."
