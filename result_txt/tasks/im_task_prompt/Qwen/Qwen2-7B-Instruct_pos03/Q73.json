    "**Keyless Entry System Integration**: Develop a new system that allows users to access their vehicles without traditional car keys. This could involve using Bluetooth technology or a smartphone app to unlock and start the vehicle. Users would simply need to bring their phone within range of the vehicle for it to recognize them and grant access. The system would ensure security through advanced encryption methods, making it difficult for unauthorized users to gain entry.",
    "**Biometric Car Key**: Create a car key that utilizes biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, to unlock and start the vehicle. This would eliminate the need for physical keys altogether and provide an even higher level of security. The system would store the biometric data securely on the vehicle's onboard computer, which would compare the user's input with the stored data to confirm identity before granting access.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Car Key**: Design a car key that is not only functional but also environmentally friendly. This could include materials like recycled plastics, biodegradable compounds, or even plant-based materials. Additionally, the design could incorporate features such as solar panels to charge the key's internal battery, reducing reliance on disposable batteries and minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Emergency Assistance Car Key**: Introduce a car key equipped with an emergency button that directly connects the driver to roadside assistance services. In case of an accident or mechanical failure, pressing this button would immediately alert the service provider, who can then dispatch help based on the location provided by GPS in the car. This feature would significantly enhance safety and response times during emergencies.",
    "**Interactive Car Key Experience**: Develop a car key that serves as an interactive entertainment device for passengers, especially children. The key could have built-in games, educational content, or multimedia options that keep passengers engaged during long trips. For example, it might include a touch screen interface with a variety of interactive games, trivia quizzes, or audio books tailored to different age groups. This would not only keep passengers occupied but also potentially reduce distractions for the driver."
