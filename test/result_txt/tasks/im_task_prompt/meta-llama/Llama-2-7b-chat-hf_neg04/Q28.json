    "Bicycle Helmet with Built-in Safety Lighting: Create a bicycle helmet with integrated LED lights that illuminate the road ahead, making the rider more visible to motorists, especially during nighttime rides. The lights could be powered by rechargeable batteries or even harness energy from the rider's motion, ensuring a constant supply of light.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet with Air Quality Monitoring: Design a helmet with a built-in air quality sensor that detects pollutants in the air and provides real-time data to the rider through a small display on the helmet. This would allow riders to take alternate routes or avoid heavily polluted areas, promoting a healthier and safer ride.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Communication System: Create a helmet with a hands-free communication system that allows riders to connect with their fellow cyclists or with traffic authorities in case of an emergency. The system could use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, to enable seamless communication.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Impact-Activated Safety Features: Design a helmet with impact-activated safety features that can deploy in case of a crash. For example, the helmet could have a built-in airbag system that inflates upon impact, cushioning the rider's head and reducing the risk of injury. Alternatively, the helmet could have a flexible outer shell that crumples upon impact, distributing the force of the impact across the helmet and reducing the risk of head injury.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Augmented Reality Display: Create a helmet with an augmented reality (AR) display that overlays virtual information onto the rider's field of view. The display could show real-time traffic data, such as the location of bike lanes, road hazards, or even offer navigation cues to help riders find their way. The AR display could also be used to display fun and interactive content, such as virtual tours or games, to make the ride more enjoyable and engaging."
