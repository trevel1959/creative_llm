    "Enhanced surveillance capabilities: Law enforcement agencies and security services would benefit from the ability to see in the dark. This would allow them to monitor and investigate crimes more effectively, as they would have a clearer view of their surroundings even in the dead of night.",
    "Increased safety in the workplace: Industries that operate in low-light environments, such as manufacturing or construction, would benefit from the ability to see in the dark. This would reduce the risk of accidents and injuries that can occur in poorly lit areas.",
    "Improved animal welfare: Zoos and animal sanctuaries could use the ability to see in the dark to monitor and care for animals more effectively. This would allow them to keep an eye on the animals during nighttime hours and ensure their well-being.",
    "Enhanced exploration of space: Space exploration would be greatly enhanced if humans could see in the dark. This would allow astronauts to navigate and explore areas of space that are currently difficult to see, such as the surface of the moon or distant planets.",
    "Increased awareness of wildlife: The ability to see in the dark would allow people to observe wildlife in their natural habitats during nighttime hours. This would provide a greater understanding of animal behavior and help raise awareness about conservation efforts."
