    "Eco-Village: Create an eco-village where residents live in harmony with nature. The community would be powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Residences would be made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, straw, and recycled materials. A central community center would provide shared spaces for food production, education, and social events.",
    "Green Roofs: Develop a community with green roofs that double as agricultural spaces. Residences would have vertical gardens and greenhouses, providing fresh produce to residents and reducing the carbon footprint of food production. The green roofs would also provide insulation, reducing energy consumption and improving air quality.",
    "Water Recycling: Create a community that recycles and reuses water. Rainwater harvesting systems would collect and store rainwater for irrigation, toilet flushing, and washing machines. Greywater from sinks and showers would be treated and reused for irrigation and flushing toilets. This would reduce the amount of potable water used in the community.",
    "Vertical Farming: Build a community that utilizes vertical farming techniques to produce food. The community would have indoor vertical farms that use hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This would reduce the carbon footprint of food production and provide fresh produce to residents year-round.",
    "Bioluminescent Community: Create a community that incorporates bioluminescent technology into its design. Residences would have bioluminescent features such as walls, floors, and furniture, providing a unique and sustainable lighting solution. The community would also have bioluminescent pathways and public spaces, providing a safe and efficient way to navigate the community at night. This would reduce the need for electric lighting, further reducing the community's carbon footprint."
