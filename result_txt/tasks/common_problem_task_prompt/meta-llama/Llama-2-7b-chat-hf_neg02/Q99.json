    "\"Echoes\": A device that uses sound waves to create a 3D visual map of the surroundings. It works by emitting high-frequency sounds through a small speaker, which are then reflected off of objects in the environment and picked up by a receiver worn on the user's wrist. The device can then use machine learning algorithms to interpret the reflected sounds and create a detailed, real-time visual representation of the user's surroundings.",
    "\"Nova\": A smart cane that not only provides tactile feedback but also uses a built-in camera and AI algorithms to detect obstacles and navigate the user's path. The cane can also be connected to a smartphone app that provides additional features such as object recognition, text-to-speech, and facial recognition.",
    "\"MindSight\": A brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows visually impaired individuals to control electronic devices using their thoughts. The BCI uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect electrical activity in the brain and translate it into commands for devices such as smartphones, tablets, and even wheelchairs.",
    "\"VoiceWeaver\": A device that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's voice patterns and generate a visual representation of their surroundings. The device can be worn as a pendant or a wristband and uses the user's voice to detect and recognize objects in their environment.",
    "\"EyeSphere\": A virtual reality (VR) headset designed specifically for visually impaired individuals. The headset uses advanced AI algorithms to enhance the user's visual experience by highlighting objects and details that may be difficult to see. It also provides tactile feedback through haptic technology, allowing the user to feel objects and textures in the virtual environment."
