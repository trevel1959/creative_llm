    "Once upon a winter's night, in a small village blanketed by snow, a lonely snowman named Frosty stood silently in the moonlight. One magical evening, as the clock struck midnight, a sprinkle of stardust fell from the sky, enveloping him. To his astonishment, Frosty blinked his coal eyes and stretched his twig arms. With a laugh that echoed like tinkling bells, he danced through the village, spreading joy and laughter. Children awoke to find their beloved snowman alive, leading snowball fights and building igloos. As dawn approached, Frosty knew he must return to his snowy form, but his heart was forever warmed by the magic of friendship.",
