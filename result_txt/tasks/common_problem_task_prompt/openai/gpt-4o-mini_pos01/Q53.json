    "**Pacing Issues**: Maintaining an appropriate pace throughout the screenplay is crucial. If scenes are too drawn out or rushed, it can disrupt the flow of the story. This can lead to audience disengagement. To combat this, the writer can utilize feedback from table reads or workshops to identify sections that may need tightening or expanding.",
    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay evolves, itâ€™s easy to introduce plot holes or inconsistencies in the storyline. This can confuse viewers and undermine the credibility of the narrative. Regularly revisiting the script and mapping out the plot points can help in identifying and resolving these issues early in the writing process.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing dialogue that feels natural and authentic can be challenging, especially if the characters come from diverse backgrounds. If the dialogue feels forced or unrealistic, it can take the audience out of the experience. Conducting research or interviews with individuals from different demographics can provide insight into authentic speech patterns and colloquialisms.",
    "**Theme Clarity**: A screenplay can suffer if the central theme is not clear or is muddled by subplots. This can lead to a lack of coherence in the story. To ensure thematic clarity, the writer can define the main theme before writing and check back regularly to ensure that all elements of the screenplay align with this central idea.",
    "**Marketability and Audience Appeal**: The screenplay may face challenges in appealing to the target audience or fitting into market trends. If it is too niche or unconventional, it may struggle to find a producer or distributor. Conducting market research and understanding current industry trends can help tailor the screenplay to enhance its appeal without compromising creative integrity."
