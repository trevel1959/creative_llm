    "**MoodNotes**: Develop a Post-it Note with a built-in mood-tracking feature. The note would have a small, color-changing strip that indicates your current mood. For example, a blue strip could represent a calm day, while a red strip could indicate a stressful day. This feature would allow users to track their emotions and reflect on their moods over time.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Notes**: Create a Post-it Note with a built-in AR chip. When you point your smartphone camera at the note, it would display additional information, such as reminders, to-do lists, or even fun facts. This feature would turn a simple note into a dynamic, interactive tool.",
    "**EcoNotes**: Design a Post-it Note made from biodegradable, compostable materials. The note would be made from a plant-based material, such as cornstarch or sugarcane, and would be fully compostable at the end of its life cycle. This feature would appeal to environmentally conscious users.",
    "**SoundNotes**: Develop a Post-it Note with a built-in speaker and microphone. The note would play a sound or music when you peel it from the roll, making it easier to remember important information. For example, a note with a reminder to pick up milk would play a sound effect of a cow mooing.",
    "**HealthNotes**: Create a Post-it Note with a built-in health tracker. The note would monitor your daily activity levels, sleep patterns, and other health metrics. When you peel the note from the roll, it would display a summary of your health data, providing valuable insights into your well-being."
