    "**Nature-Based Fitness**: I'd focus on bodyweight exercises, like push-ups, squats, and lunges, using natural features like hills, stairs, and logs to create a varied and challenging workout routine. I'd also incorporate activities like rock climbing, tree climbing, and hiking to maintain strength, endurance, and agility.",
    "**Water-Based Exercise**: Since I'd have access to water sources, I'd utilize them for swimming, kayaking, or paddleboarding to maintain cardiovascular fitness and build strength. I'd also use the water to create resistance exercises, like water-based squats or lunges, to work my muscles.",
    "**Parkour and Urban Exploration**: I'd adapt to urban environments by using obstacles like stairs, walls, and rails to create a challenging and engaging workout routine. I'd also incorporate parkour techniques, like vaulting and jumping, to improve agility, balance, and coordination.",
    "**Animal-Assisted Fitness**: I'd form symbiotic relationships with animals, like horses, dogs, or birds, to create a unique and engaging workout routine. For example, I'd ride horses for cardio and strength training, or use dogs for agility training and fetch exercises.",
    "**Environmental Adaptation**: I'd focus on adapting to the environment to stay active and fit. For example, I'd use the wind to create resistance exercises, like wind-sprinting or wind-resisted squats. I'd also use the sun to create a challenging workout routine, like sun-based yoga or sun-bathing-based stretching exercises."
