    "**Integrate Solar-Powered LED Lighting System**: Design a skateboard with a built-in solar panel on the deck that charges an internal battery. This battery powers an integrated LED lighting system, which illuminates the skateboard during night rides or low-light conditions. The lights not only improve visibility but also add a unique, customizable aesthetic to the board.",
    "**Customizable Modular Components**: Create a skateboard that allows users to swap out various components such as wheels, trucks, decks, and even graphics. This modularity encourages personalization and experimentation, keeping the skateboard fresh and exciting for the rider. Additionally, this approach promotes sustainability by reducing waste and encouraging the reuse of parts.",
    "**Virtual Reality (VR) Training Platform**: Develop a VR headset that simulates skateboarding environments, allowing riders to practice in various settings (e.g., parks, streets, or extreme terrain) without leaving their homes. The VR platform could also offer personalized training sessions based on the rider's skill level, providing an immersive and effective learning experience.",
    "**Smart Skateboard with Built-In Health Tracking**: Integrate sensors into the skateboard to track metrics like distance traveled, speed, calories burned, and even heart rate. The data can be synced with a smartphone app, offering insights into the user's performance and progress. This feature can help skateboarders monitor their fitness and improve their routines accordingly.",
    "**Interactive Skatepark Integration**: Partner with skatepark designers to incorporate interactive elements into the skateboard park itself. For example, use RFID technology to engage with the skateboard when it enters specific zones, triggering audio cues, animations, or mini-games. This creates a more dynamic and entertaining experience for skateboarders."
