    "Create a virtual reality experience where users can place their own hand in a virtual space and interact with a rubber hand. The virtual rubber hand will mimic the user's real hand movements, creating a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual limb. Users can then use the virtual rubber hand to perform tasks, such as picking up objects or playing musical instruments, and experience the sensation of being in a different body.",
    "Develop a wearable device that projects a virtual rubber hand onto the user's real hand. The device uses sensors to track the user's hand movements and mirrors them onto the virtual hand, creating a seamless and immersive experience. Users can wear the device on their hand like a glove and interact with the virtual rubber hand as if it were their own.",
    "Create a series of interactive art installations that use rubber hands to explore the concept of body ownership and identity. Each installation will feature a large rubber hand that visitors can touch and interact with, and will be designed to challenge visitors' perceptions of their own bodies and their relationship to the rubber hand. For example, one installation might feature a rubber hand that is larger or smaller than the visitor's own hand, or one that is colored or shaped differently.",
    "Develop a mobile app that uses augmented reality to place a virtual rubber hand on the user's real hand. The app will use the user's camera and sensors to track the position and movement of their hand, and will superimpose a 3D virtual rubber hand onto their real hand in real-time. Users can then use their real hand to manipulate the virtual rubber hand, allowing them to experience the sensation of having a different body.",
    "Create a theatrical performance that incorporates rubber hands into the storytelling. The performance will feature actors who wear gloves with rubber hands attached, and will use the rubber hands to convey different emotions and characters. The actors will also use the rubber hands to interact with the audience, creating a sense of immersion and connection between the actors and the audience. The performance will explore themes of identity, body ownership, and the relationship between the self and the body."
