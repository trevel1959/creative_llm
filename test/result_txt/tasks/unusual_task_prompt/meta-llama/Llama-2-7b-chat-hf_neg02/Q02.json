    "Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience where users wear a VR headset and are placed in a room with a real rubber hand. The hand is covered in sensors that track the user's movements, allowing the virtual hand in the VR world to mimic the real hand's movements in real-time. As the user interacts with the virtual hand, they will begin to feel a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual limb, leading to a greater sense of empathy and understanding of the concept of the rubber hand illusion.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Design an interactive art installation that features a large, inflatable rubber hand. Visitors can step inside the hand and interact with it, using sensors to detect their movements and create a unique, immersive experience. The installation can also include audio and visual effects to enhance the sense of presence and agency. By engaging with the installation, visitors will gain a deeper understanding of the concept of the rubber hand illusion and its implications for our perception of self and reality.",
    "Virtual Mirror: Create a virtual mirror that uses augmented reality technology to superimpose a 3D model of a rubber hand onto the user's real hand. As the user moves their real hand, the virtual hand will move in synchrony, creating a disorienting and uncanny effect. The mirror can be used in a variety of settings, from therapy sessions to art installations, to explore the concept of body ownership and the relationship between the self and the body.",
    "Interactive Game: Develop an interactive game that uses the rubber hand illusion as a central mechanic. Players take on the role of a rubber hand that is being manipulated by an unseen force. As the hand is moved and manipulated, players must use their real hand to resist the force and maintain control. The game can be designed for a variety of platforms, from VR headsets to smartphones, and can be used to explore the concept of body ownership and agency in a fun and engaging way.",
