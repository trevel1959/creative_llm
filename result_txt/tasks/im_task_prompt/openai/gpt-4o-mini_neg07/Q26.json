    "**Compartmentalized Recycling Trash Can**: Create a trash can that has built-in compartments for different types of wasteâ€”plastic, paper, organic, and general trash. Each compartment could have a color-coded lid and a small digital display that provides information on recycling guidelines. This would make it easier for users to separate their waste properly and educate them on recycling.",
    "**Odor Neutralizing System**: Integrate an odor-neutralizing mechanism that uses activated charcoal or a similar material to absorb smells. Additionally, it could have a small fan that circulates air to keep the inside fresh. This would be especially useful for households that produce a lot of organic waste.",
    "**Trash Can with Composting Feature**: Design a trash can that includes a small, built-in composting unit for organic waste. It could use a combination of heat and aeration to speed up the composting process, allowing users to turn their food scraps into compost for gardening, thereby reducing landfill waste.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can with Gamification**: Develop a trash can that features a screen or LED display that encourages users to dispose of their waste properly through a game. For example, when someone throws trash in the correct compartment, they earn points that can be redeemed for rewards or discounts at local businesses. This would engage the community and promote better waste management practices.",
    "**Portable Trash Can with Solar-Powered Charging**: Create a portable trash can designed for outdoor use that features solar panels. This trash can could power a small device like a phone charger or a Bluetooth speaker, making it ideal for parks, beaches, and events. This would encourage people to use the trash can rather than littering, as it offers added functionality."
