    "Wear a Solar Scarf: Design a scarf that has built-in UV protection, similar to sunscreen. The scarf could be made of a lightweight, breathable fabric and have a special coating that absorbs or reflects UV rays. This would provide protection for the head and neck without the need for additional sunscreen.",
    "Hairless Hats: Create a line of hats specifically designed for individuals with alopecia. These hats could be made of breathable materials, such as cotton or linen, and have a wide brim to protect the face and neck from sun exposure. The hats could also have a built-in UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating to ensure maximum protection.",
    "Sun-Shielding Turbans: Design a stylish turban that provides complete coverage for the head and neck. The turban could be made of a lightweight, breathable fabric and have a special coating that blocks UV rays. This would provide protection for individuals who want to maintain their cultural or religious traditions while still staying protected from the sun.",
    "Hair-Like Shades: Create a line of sunglasses with built-in hair-like structures that provide natural UV protection. These sunglasses could be made of a special material that mimics the structure of human hair, with tiny fibers that absorb or reflect UV rays. This would provide protection for the eyes and face without the need for additional sunscreen.",
    "Sun-Sensitive Tattoos: Develop a tattoo ink that changes color when exposed to UV rays. This tattoo could be placed on the scalp or face and would provide a visual indicator of sun exposure. When the tattoo changes color, it would signal that the individual needs to reapply sunscreen or seek shade. This would be a creative and stylish way to monitor sun exposure and stay protected."
