    "**Eco-Friendly Ink Cartridge Recycling**: Develop a built-in mechanism that allows users to return used ink cartridges directly through the printer. The printer could have a compartment that collects cartridges, which can then be sent back to the manufacturer for recycling. This feature would not only promote sustainability but also encourage users to think about their environmental impact when printing.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Print Preview**: Create an augmented reality feature that allows users to visualize how their printed materials will look in a real-world context. By using a smartphone or tablet, users could scan the document and see a virtual preview of it placed in its intended location (like a flyer on a wall or a poster in a room). This would help in making design adjustments before the actual printing, reducing waste.",
    "**Multi-Functionality with 3D Printing**: Enhance traditional printers by integrating a 3D printing capability. This would allow users to switch between 2D printing for documents and 3D printing for prototypes or models. The printer could have interchangeable nozzles and materials, making it versatile for both home and office use. A user-friendly interface could guide users through the different functionalities.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing Assistant**: Incorporate a voice-activated assistant that allows users to control the printer through voice commands. Users could instruct the printer to print specific documents, adjust settings, or even troubleshoot issues without needing to navigate through menus. This feature would enhance accessibility for individuals with disabilities and streamline the printing process for everyone.",
    "**Adaptive Print Quality Settings**: Introduce an AI-powered adaptive print quality setting that learns from user habits and preferences. The printer could analyze the types of documents being printed (like text-heavy, images, or graphics) and automatically adjust the print quality settings for optimal results. Over time, it could provide recommendations for the best settings based on past prints, reducing ink and paper waste."
