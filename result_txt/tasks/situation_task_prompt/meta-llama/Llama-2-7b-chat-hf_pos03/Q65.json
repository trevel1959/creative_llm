    "Mirror-based lighting: One creative solution to light up a room without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use mirrors. By placing mirrors strategically around the room, you can use the reflected light to illuminate the space. For example, you could place a mirror opposite a window to reflect natural light into the room, or you could place mirrors on walls that face each other to create a \"light tunnel\" effect. This method is not only energy-efficient but also adds an artistic touch to the room's decor.",
    "Glowing plants: Another creative solution is to use plants that have a glowing effect. There are certain plants, such as glowing mushrooms or luminous plants, that emit a soft, ambient light. By placing these plants around the room, you can create a warm and cozy ambiance without the need for traditional lighting. This idea not only provides light but also adds a touch of nature to the space.",
    "Light-emitting paint: What if walls could emit light? With light-emitting paint, you can turn any wall into a source of light. This paint contains tiny light-emitting particles that can be applied to any surface, providing a soft, even glow. By painting one or more walls in a room with this special paint, you can create a subtle and creative lighting solution. This idea is perfect for a bedroom or meditation room, where a soft, calming light is desired.",
    "Holographic projections: For a more futuristic and high-tech solution, you could use holographic projections to light up a room. By projecting holographic images onto walls or other surfaces, you can create a three-dimensional lighting effect that is both visually striking and energy-efficient. This method can be used to create a variety of different lighting effects, from soft, ambient lighting to more dramatic, dynamic displays.",
    "Solar-powered windows: Finally, you could use solar-powered windows to light up a room without the need for any additional lighting sources. By installing special windows that are capable of capturing and converting sunlight into electricity, you can create a natural and sustainable lighting solution. This idea is perfect for a room that receives plenty of natural light during the day, as the windows can provide a"
