    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Batteries**: Create rechargeable batteries that can be powered by solar panels. This involves developing advanced solar cells that can convert sunlight into electricity efficiently. These batteries could be used to power electronic devices during the day when sunlight is available, and store the energy for use at night or in low-light conditions. ",
    "**Human Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Develop wearable devices that can harness the kinetic energy from human movement. For example, shoes could have built-in generators that produce electricity as the wearer walks or runs. This electricity could then be stored in a small battery to power the device itself or other connected gadgets.",
    "**Wind Power Mini-Generators**: Design mini wind turbines that are compact enough to fit inside smartphones, tablets, or laptops. These could be activated when the device is stationary, such as on a desk or in a bag. The turbines would generate electricity which would be stored in the device's battery.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Utilize the heat generated by devices themselves (like CPU heat) to generate electricity. This could involve creating thermoelectric materials that convert temperature differences into electrical power. This method could be particularly useful for powering devices that generate significant amounts of heat, like laptops or gaming consoles.",
    "**Biodegradable Battery Technology**: Create batteries that degrade naturally over time without causing environmental harm. These batteries could be made from biodegradable materials and designed to release their components slowly over time, providing a steady flow of power. This technology would not only solve the problem of dead batteries but also address the issue of electronic waste by reducing the need for frequent replacement. "
