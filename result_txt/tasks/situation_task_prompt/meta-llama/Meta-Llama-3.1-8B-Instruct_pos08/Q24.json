    "**Adaptive Technology**: People with poor vision would rely heavily on advanced technologies such as AI-powered glasses, smart contact lenses, and augmented reality (AR) devices. These technologies would use machine learning algorithms to enhance vision, provide real-time object recognition, and offer personalized assistance. For instance, AR glasses could display high-contrast images, highlight important details, and even provide audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: As people with poor vision would need to rely more on their other senses, they would develop heightened sensory perception. They would become more attuned to sounds, smells, and even tactile sensations, allowing them to navigate their surroundings more effectively. This could lead to a new appreciation for the world around them and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of senses.",
    "**Community Support**: The disappearance of glasses and contact lenses would foster a sense of community and cooperation among people with poor vision. They would rely on each other for support, guidance, and assistance, leading to stronger social bonds and a greater sense of empathy. This could result in the development of new forms of assistive technology and innovative solutions that prioritize accessibility and inclusivity.",
    "**Evolution of Language**: The absence of glasses and contact lenses would likely lead to changes in language and communication. People with poor vision would develop new ways of describing their surroundings, using metaphors and analogies to convey visual information. This could result in a richer, more descriptive language that highlights the importance of sensory experience and creative expression.",
    "**Biomechanical Enhancements**: In response to the loss of glasses and contact lenses, scientists and engineers would focus on developing biomechanical enhancements that integrate directly with the human body. This could involve implantable devices, neural interfaces, or even genetic engineering to enhance vision. These advancements would push the boundaries of human enhancement and raise questions about the ethics of augmenting the human body. "
