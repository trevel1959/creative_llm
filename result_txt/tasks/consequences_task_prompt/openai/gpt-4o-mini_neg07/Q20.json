    "**Economic Collapse**: The sudden halt of electronic devices would paralyze financial systems worldwide. Banks rely heavily on electronic transactions; without them, ATMs would stop working, credit and debit cards would be useless, and cash would become the only means of transaction. This could lead to a rush on physical cash, causing shortages and further destabilizing economies. Stock markets would crash, and businesses that depend on digital operations would face immediate closure, resulting in mass unemployment.",
    "**Transportation Chaos**: Modern transportation systems are heavily reliant on electronic devices. Air traffic control, GPS navigation, and automated systems in cars would fail, leading to widespread travel disruptions. Planes would be grounded, trains would stop running, and traffic would come to a standstill. People would be stranded in various locations, unable to reach their destinations, and emergency services would struggle to respond to accidents or medical emergencies due to the lack of communication.",
    "**Healthcare Crisis**: Hospitals and healthcare facilities would face a dire situation as electronic medical records, diagnostic equipment, and communication systems fail. Patients relying on life-saving machines would be at risk, and medical professionals would struggle to provide care without access to critical information. The inability to contact emergency services would exacerbate health crises, leading to increased mortality rates and a collapse of public health infrastructure.",
    "**Social Unrest and Panic**: The sudden absence of electronic devices would lead to widespread panic and social unrest. People accustomed to instant access to information and entertainment would feel disoriented and frustrated. As basic needs become harder to meet, such as food and water supply management, communities might turn against each other in a struggle for resources. This could lead to looting, violence, and a breakdown of social order as trust erodes and desperation takes hold.",
    "**Reversion to Primitive Skills**: With the reliance on technology stripped away, society would have to revert to more primitive skills for survival. People would need to rediscover traditional methods of communication, such as writing letters or using signal fires. Skills like farming, hunting, and gathering would become essential for sustenance. Communities might form around shared skills, leading to a renaissance of local craftsmanship and barter systems, as people learn to live without modern conveniences."
