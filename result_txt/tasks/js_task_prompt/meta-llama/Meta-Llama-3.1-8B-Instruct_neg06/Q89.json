    "**Echo**: A language that incorporates echoes as a fundamental aspect of its grammar and syntax. Words and phrases would be designed to create a layered effect, where the speaker's voice is repeated back to them, creating a sense of resonance and connection with the listener. For example, the word \"hello\" would be pronounced as \"hello-hello,\" with the second \"hello\" being a gentle echo of the first. This would create a sense of intimacy and shared experience between the speaker and listener.",
    "**Chroma**: A language that uses color as a primary means of expression. Words and phrases would be associated with specific colors, which would be used to convey meaning and emotion. For example, the word \"happy\" might be represented by a bright yellow, while \"sad\" might be represented by a deep blue. This would create a visually stunning and immersive language experience.",
    "**Aria**: A language that is sung rather than spoken. Words and melodies would be combined to create a rich, musical quality. Each word would have a specific melody associated with it, and the speaker would sing the word in its corresponding melody. This would create a sense of beauty and expressiveness, and would be particularly well-suited to poetic or emotional communication.",
    "**Kairos**: A language that incorporates time and timing as a fundamental aspect of its grammar and syntax. Words and phrases would be designed to create a sense of temporal tension and release, with speakers using pauses, emphasis, and rhythm to convey meaning and create a sense of drama. For example, the word \"now\" might be pronounced with a sudden, sharp emphasis, while the word \"later\" might be pronounced with a gentle, soothing cadence.",
    "**Nexus**: A language that uses connections and relationships as a primary means of expression. Words and phrases would be designed to create a web of associations and connections between ideas, people, and things. For example, the word \"friend\" might be associated with a network of interconnected words and concepts, such as \"shared experiences,\" \"trust,\" and \"support.\" This would create a sense of depth and complexity, and would be particularly well-suited to abstract or philosophical communication.
