The hanger can be controlled through a mobile app, allowing users to monitor and manage their wardrobe remotely.",
    "\"Hanger-Game\": A social platform where users can challenge friends to a \"hanger- challenge\" where they have to guess the type of garment hung on a hanger without looking at it. The twist? The hanger can change the color, texture, or shape of the garment to make it harder to guess. Users can earn points and badges for correct guesses, and the person with the most points wins.",

    "\"Hanger-Scavenger\": A augmented reality (AR) experience that allows users to scan their closet and see a virtual \"hanger\" appear on their phone or tablet. The hanger can then guide users through a scavenger hunt, pointing out items that need to be donated, sold, or repaired. Users can earn rewards and discounts for completing the scavenger hunt and maintaining their closet.",
    "\"Hanger-Hero\": A community-driven platform where users can share their fashion tips, tricks, and hacks for organizing and maintaining their closet. The platform can include a leaderboard that ranks users based on their closet organization skills, and a \"hanger- hero\" award for the user who has the most organized and stylish closet.
