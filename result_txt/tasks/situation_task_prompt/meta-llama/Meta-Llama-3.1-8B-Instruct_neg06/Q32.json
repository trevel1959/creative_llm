    "**Portable Tooth Cleaning Kits**: In a world without dentists, individuals would need to rely on portable, self-sustaining tooth cleaning kits. These kits could be designed to be compact, lightweight, and easy to use.

The kit could also include a small LED light for illuminating the teeth, making it easier to clean hard-to-reach areas.",

This could include regular group cleanings, oral health workshops, and even community-led dental clinics.",

People could also share their own DIY solutions online, creating a community-driven approach to oral health.",
    "**Subscription-Based Oral Health Services**: With no professional dental care, subscription-based oral health services could become a viable alternative. These services could provide users with regular shipments of oral health products, such as toothpaste, mouthwash, and dental floss. They could also offer personalized advice and guidance on maintaining good oral health.",
    "**Oral Health Cooperatives**: In a world without dentists, oral health cooperatives could become a vital part of the community. These cooperatives would be member-owned and operated, providing access to shared resources, expertise, and equipment for maintaining good oral health. Members could pool their resources to purchase dental equipment, share knowledge, and support one another in their oral health journeys.
