    "**Creating a Daytime Sleep Environment**: You could create a comfortable and darkened sleep environment during daytime hours. This might involve using blackout curtains or eye masks to block out sunlight, and using white noise machines or earplugs to drown out external sounds. Additionally, investing in a good quality mattress and pillows that suit your sleeping preferences can also enhance your daytime sleep experience.",
    "**Daytime Napping Techniques**: If you're unable to get adequate rest during the day, consider learning techniques for effective daytime napping. This includes creating a short, 20-30 minute nap routine that includes a cool room temperature, comfortable bedding, and possibly a white noise machine. It's also important to ensure that your naps are not too long as this could lead to feeling groggy upon waking up.",
    "**Adjusting Your Work Schedule**: If possible, you might want to discuss with your employer the possibility of adjusting your work schedule. For instance, if you find it difficult to stay productive during certain times of the day, you could request a shift change or a flexible working arrangement. This could help you optimize your energy levels for tasks that require the most focus and creativity.",
    "**Developing a Productive Routine**: Creating a daily routine can help you manage your time better and improve your productivity. Include tasks such as regular exercise, healthy eating habits, sufficient breaks, and a consistent sleep schedule. A routine helps in reducing stress and enhances overall well-being, making it easier to cope with feelings of jealousy.",
    "**Embracing and Utilizing Your Unique Skills**: Recognize that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. Instead of focusing on what others achieve, identify your own unique skills and how you can leverage them effectively. For example, if you excel in creative problem-solving, focus on projects that allow you to utilize this strength rather than comparing yourself to others who may be better at tasks that don't align with your skills. This approach can boost self-confidence and satisfaction, diminishing feelings of jealousy."
