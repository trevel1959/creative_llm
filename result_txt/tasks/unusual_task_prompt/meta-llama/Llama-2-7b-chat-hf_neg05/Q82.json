    "Smart Iron: Create an iron that can iron clothes while you're on the go. This smart iron can be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing you to iron your clothes remotely. With the app, you can set the temperature, timer, and even check the iron's battery level from anywhere in the world.",
    "Automatic Ironing System: Design an automatic ironing system that can sort, iron, and fold your clothes. This system would consist of a conveyor belt with multiple stations, each one dedicated to a specific step of the ironing process. As your clothes pass through the system, they will be sorted by fabric type, ironed to perfection, and then folded and stored in a designated area.",
    "Anti-Crease Iron: Create an iron that uses nanotechnology to eliminate wrinkles and creases from your clothes. This iron would release tiny nanoparticles that penetrate the fabric and relax the fibers, leaving your clothes looking crisp and fresh. The iron would also come with a built-in steamer function for added versatility.",
    "Customizable Iron Designs: Design an iron that allows you to customize the design of your clothes while they're being ironed. This iron would feature a built-in heat-sensitive screen that allows you to choose from a variety of designs, such as stripes, polka dots, or even your favorite cartoon character. As the iron heats up, the design will appear on your clothes, giving you a unique and personalized touch.",
    "Sustainable Iron: Create an iron that is not only eco-friendly but also helps to reduce waste. This iron would be made from recycled materials and feature a built-in compactor that can compress your clothes, reducing their volume and making them easier to store. Additionally, the iron would come with a built-in water filtration system, allowing you to use less water and reduce your environmental impact."
