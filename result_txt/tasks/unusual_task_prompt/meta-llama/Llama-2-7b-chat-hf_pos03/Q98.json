    "Smart Power Strip: Create a power strip that can be controlled and monitored through a smartphone app. This power strip can detect which devices are connected to it and automatically cut off power to devices that are not in use to save energy. It can also provide real-time energy consumption data and alert users when they have reached their daily energy usage goals.",
    "Motion-Sensing Power Strip: Design a power strip with built-in motion sensors that can detect when a device is nearby and automatically turn on or off based on the user's preferences. This can be especially useful for devices that are used infrequently, such as a TV or computer in a guest room.",
    "Multi-Socket Power Strip: Create a power strip with multiple sockets that can be arranged in different configurations to suit the user's needs. For example, one configuration could have two sockets for a laptop and a phone, while another configuration could have three sockets for a laptop, a printer, and a lamp.",
    "Power Strip with USB Charging Ports: Design a power strip with built-in USB charging ports that can charge multiple devices at once. This can be especially useful for people who have multiple devices that need to be charged, such as a phone, tablet, and laptop.",
    "Adjustable Power Strip: Create a power strip with adjustable voltage settings that can be customized to suit the needs of different devices. For example, a device that requires 12 volts for charging can be set to receive 12 volts from the power strip, while a device that requires 5 volts for charging can be set to receive 5 volts. This can help prevent damage to devices and ensure that they are charged properly."
