    "**Self-Adjusting Clothing**: Create a set of clothes that automatically adjust to your body movements. This can be done using smart textiles that sense your movement patterns and adjust their structure in real-time to prevent strain or injury. For example, if you're about to perform an action that might cause a muscle strain, the fabric would adjust to provide extra support.",
    "**Magnetic Protection System**: Develop a wearable device that uses magnetic fields to protect sensitive areas. For instance, a helmet equipped with magnets could guide your head movements to avoid sudden impacts or jolts. This system could also be applied to limbs, using braces that adjust position as needed.",
    "**Smart Skin Technology**: Design a layer of 'smart skin' that covers your body, capable of sensing potential injuries before they occur. This skin could monitor your posture, detect when you're in a high-risk position (like reaching upwards), and either physically guide you into a safer position or alert you to change it. ",
    "**Virtual Reality Safety Training**: Create a virtual reality environment where users can practice tasks while being monitored for potential injury. The VR platform could simulate various scenarios and environments, providing feedback on correct movements and actions to prevent injuries. Users could wear VR goggles and gloves that track their hand movements, offering real-time corrections based on the simulated environment's physics.",
    "**Adaptive Rehabilitation Exercises**: Develop a personalized exercise program that adjusts to your body's limitations and changes over time. This program could use sensors to track your physical abilities and suggest exercises that help build strength in areas prone to injury, like the neck or wrists. The exercises could be tailored to improve flexibility, balance, and coordination, thereby reducing the risk of injury."
