    "Ethical Concerns: Self-driving cars could raise ethical concerns regarding liability, privacy, and bias in artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident? How are the personal data of passengers handled? And how do we ensure the vehicle makes decisions that are both fair and ethical?",
    "Public Perception and Adoption: The idea of self-driving cars could be met with skepticism or fear from the public, especially those who are uncomfortable with the concept of giving control to a machine. Building trust in the technology and addressing public concerns will be crucial to the successful implementation and widespread adoption of self-driving cars.",
    "Cybersecurity Risks: As with any connected device, self-driving cars could be vulnerable to cyber attacks. Hackers could potentially gain control over the vehicle, creating a serious threat to the safety of passengers and other road users. Advanced security measures and regular software updates will be necessary to protect against such risks.",
    "Environmental Impact: While self-driving cars may reduce human error and save lives in terms of traffic accidents, they could also contribute to increased traffic congestion, leading to more pollution and stress on existing infrastructure. This highlights the importance of integrating self-driving cars into a broader urban planning strategy that focuses on reducing overall road congestion.",
    "Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Self-driving cars could change how cities and towns are designed and laid out, as they could change the way people move around. Traffic regulations, public transportation systems, and urban planning strategies will need to be updated to accommodate seamless integration with self-driving cars."
