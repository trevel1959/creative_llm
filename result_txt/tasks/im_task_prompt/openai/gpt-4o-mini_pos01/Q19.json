    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Develop glasses that incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to access information overlaid on their field of vision. This could include navigation directions, notifications from smartphones, or even translations of text in real-time. By using a lightweight heads-up display, users can stay connected without looking down at their devices.",
    "**Smart Lens with Health Monitoring**: Create smart glasses equipped with lenses that monitor health metrics such as eye strain, UV exposure, and even blood sugar levels through non-invasive sensors. The glasses could connect to a smartphone app, providing users with insights into their eye health and overall wellness, while also sending alerts when it's time to take a break or adjust screen time.",
    "**Interchangeable Frame System**: Design a modular glasses system where users can easily swap out frames, temples, and colors to match their outfit or mood. This would allow for personalization and reduce the need for multiple pairs of glasses. The components could snap together using a secure magnetic mechanism, ensuring durability while allowing for quick changes.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Coating**: Develop a special coating for lenses that utilizes nanotechnology to repel dirt, dust, and smudges. This self-cleaning feature would significantly reduce the need for frequent cleaning and enhance the longevity of the glasses. The coating could work by creating a superhydrophobic surface that allows water to bead up and roll off, taking debris with it.",
    "**Built-in Audio System**: Integrate a discreet audio system into the glasses that allows users to listen to music, take phone calls, or receive audio notifications without the need for additional headphones. This could be achieved through bone conduction technology, which transmits sound through the bones of the skull, allowing for a more immersive experience while keeping the ears free to hear the environment."
