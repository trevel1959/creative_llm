    "A global economic shift: If all world debt was erased, it would have a significant impact on the global economy. It would mean that countries would no longer have to allocate resources towards paying off debt, which could potentially lead to increased spending on other areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.",
    "Changes in interest rates: The erasure of world debt could also lead to changes in interest rates. With less debt, central banks may be able to lower interest rates, which could stimulate economic growth and encourage borrowing.",
    "Reduced poverty: The elimination of world debt could also lead to a reduction in poverty. With more resources available for investment, countries could focus on poverty reduction initiatives such as education, healthcare, and job creation.",
    "Changes in political power: The erasure of world debt could also have political implications. Countries with significant debt may lose political power, as they may be more beholden to lenders than to their own citizens. This could lead to a more democratic and equitable global political landscape.",
    "Changes in investment patterns: The elimination of world debt could also lead to changes in investment patterns. With more resources available for investment, countries could focus on sustainable and environmentally-friendly projects, which could lead to a more sustainable future for the planet."
