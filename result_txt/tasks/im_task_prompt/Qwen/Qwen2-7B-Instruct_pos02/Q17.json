    "**Smart Washing Machine with AI Integration:** Develop a washing machine that incorporates artificial intelligence for improved performance and user experience. The machine can learn from user habits and preferences over time, adjusting its settings accordingly. It could also monitor water and energy usage, suggesting ways to reduce waste and save resources. This innovation not only saves time but also promotes sustainability.",
    "**Wearable Washing Machine Technology:** Design a wearable device that cleans clothes while on-the-go. This concept could be particularly useful for individuals who travel frequently or live in smaller spaces without access to traditional laundry facilities. Users can wear their dirty clothes under the device, which utilizes ultrasonic waves or other advanced cleaning technologies to remove stains and odors effectively.",
    "**Energy-Conserving Washing Machine System:** Create a system that uses kinetic energy generated by the movement of the washing machine itself to power its operations. For example, the drum's rotation could drive an internal generator, converting mechanical energy into electricity. This would significantly reduce the overall energy consumption of the appliance, making it more environmentally friendly and cost-effective for consumers.",
    "**Automated Laundry Delivery Service:** Partner with a laundry service to offer a complete solution for customers, from pickup to delivery. Utilize smart washing machines equipped with sensors that detect when a load is completed, automatically triggering a notification to the laundry service. This partnership ensures that users have clean, freshly laundered clothes without having to leave their homes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Compartment:** Introduce a washing machine with a compartment that houses biodegradable and eco-friendly detergents. The machine could be programmed to dispense the correct amount of detergent based on the load size and fabric type, minimizing waste and reducing environmental impact. Additionally, this feature could include a refill subscription service, encouraging sustainable practices and convenience for the user."
