    "Texture Analysis: Even though color may disappear, texture can still be felt. You can differentiate between different objects by examining their textures, such as the smoothness or roughness of a surface.",
    "Light Reflection: Different objects reflect light differently. You can differentiate between objects by examining the patterns of light reflection on their surfaces.",
    "Shape and Form: Shape and form can still be distinguished even if color is absent. You can differentiate between objects by examining their shapes and forms, such as the curvature of a surface or the angles of a structure.",
    "Sound: Different objects produce different sounds. You can differentiate between objects by examining the sounds they produce, such as the resonance of a hollow object or the vibration of a solid one.",
    "Taste and Smell: Even though color may disappear, taste and smell can still be experienced. You can differentiate between objects by examining their taste and smell, such as the sweetness of a fruit or the pungency of a spice."
