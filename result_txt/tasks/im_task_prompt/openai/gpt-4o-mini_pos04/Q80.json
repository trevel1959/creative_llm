    "**Ergonomic Multi-Functional Whisk**: Redesign the whisk with an ergonomic handle that adjusts to the userâ€™s grip. This handle could also feature interchangeable heads (e.g., balloon whisk, flat whisk, and silicone spatula) that can be easily swapped out for different cooking tasks, making it a versatile tool in the kitchen while reducing the need for multiple utensils.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism into the whisk. This could involve a small, detachable compartment at the base of the whisk that can be filled with soapy water. After use, the user could simply press a button to activate a gentle vibration that shakes the soapy water through the whisk's wires, effectively cleaning it without needing to scrub.",
    "**Whisk with Adjustable Tension**: Create a whisk that allows users to adjust the tension of the wires or the stiffness of the whisk head. This feature would enable cooks to customize their whisking experience based on the task at hand, such as whipping cream or mixing thick batter, by providing a firmer or more flexible whisking action.",
    "**Whisk with Integrated Timer and LED Lights**: This whisk could have a built-in timer that allows users to set the duration for whisking. It could also feature LED lights that change color based on the time elapsed or the intensity of whisking, providing a visual cue for the user to know when to stop whisking or when the desired consistency has been reached.",
    "**Magnetic Whisk Holder**: Develop a whisk with a magnetic handle that can stick to any metal surface, such as a refrigerator or a magnetic knife strip. This would provide a convenient storage solution that keeps the whisk easily accessible while also saving drawer space. The whisk could also come with a matching magnetic holder that can be mounted on a wall or cabinet."
