    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a surfboard made from recycled plastic waste, such as plastic bottles and fishing nets. The board would be created using a combination of traditional surfboard manufacturing techniques and innovative recycling methods. The eco-friendly surfboard would not only reduce waste but also provide a unique aesthetic, with a textured, organic look that reflects the natural world.",
    "**Smart Surfboard with Integrated Sensors and AI**: Develop a surfboard equipped with sensors that track and analyze the rider's performance, providing real-time feedback on speed, distance, and wave size. The board would also feature an AI-powered system that learns the rider's preferences and adjusts the surfboard's performance accordingly, ensuring a more enjoyable and challenging experience.",
    "**Surfboard with Integrated Solar Panel**: Design a surfboard with an integrated solar panel that harnesses energy from the sun to power a built-in speaker system, allowing riders to enjoy their favorite music while catching waves. The solar panel would also charge the board's battery, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for surfers.",
    "**Modular Surfboard with Interchangeable Components**: Create a modular surfboard system that allows riders to customize and upgrade their board as needed. The system would feature interchangeable components, such as fins, tails, and nose sections, enabling riders to experiment with different designs and configurations to find their perfect setup.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in Water Purification System**: Develop a surfboard with a built-in water purification system that removes pollutants and contaminants from the water, providing a safe and clean drinking source for riders. The system would use advanced nanotechnology to filter out bacteria, viruses, and other impurities, making it an innovative solution for surfers and beachgoers alike."
