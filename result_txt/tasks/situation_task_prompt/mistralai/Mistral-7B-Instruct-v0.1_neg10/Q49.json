    "Use natural fire-fighting methods: One way to protect your home from a fire without fire-fighting equipment is to use natural methods. For example, you can try to smother the fire with water, sand, or dirt. You can also use baking soda or salt to help put out the fire.",
    "Evacuate the premises: If you cannot put out the fire, it is important to evacuate the premises as soon as possible. Make sure to close all doors and windows to prevent the fire from spreading.",
    "Call the fire department: Even if you don't have fire-fighting equipment, you should still call the fire department. They will be able to assess the situation and determine the best course of action.",
    "Create a fire break: If you have a garden or any flammable material nearby, you can create a fire break to prevent the fire from spreading. This can be done by digging a trench or creating a barrier around the fire.",
    "Use smoke detectors and alarms: Smoke detectors and alarms can help you detect a fire early and evacuate the premises before it gets out of control. Make sure to test your smoke detectors and alarms regularly to ensure they are working properly."
