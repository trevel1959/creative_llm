    "**Eco-Friendly Olympic Village**: The Olympic Village could be designed with sustainable and eco-friendly materials, incorporating green roofs, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the event but also serves as a model for future Olympic host cities. The village could also feature a \"zero-waste\" policy, with all waste being recycled or composted. This would not only reduce waste but also create a unique educational experience for visitors.",
    "**Virtual Reality Olympic Experience**: The Olympics could be taken to the next level by incorporating virtual reality technology. This would allow spectators to immerse themselves in the action, even if they are not physically present at the event. The VR experience could include real-time commentary, 360-degree views, and even interactive elements that allow viewers to influence the game. This would be especially beneficial for spectators who are unable to attend the event in person due to distance or mobility issues.",
    "**Intergenerational Olympic Mentorship Program**: The Olympics could be used as a platform to bring together athletes of different ages and backgrounds. A mentorship program could be established, where experienced athletes are paired with younger athletes, providing guidance and support as they prepare for their own Olympic debut. This would not only create a sense of community and camaraderie among athletes but also provide a unique learning opportunity for both mentors and mentees.",
    "**Inclusive Olympic Sports**: The Olympics could be used to promote inclusivity and diversity by introducing new sports that are accessible to athletes with disabilities. For example, adaptive sports such as para-sailing, wheelchair basketball, or deaflympic sports could be included in the Olympic program. This would not only provide opportunities for athletes with disabilities to compete at the highest level but also raise awareness and promote inclusivity among spectators.",
    "**Olympic Legacy Project**: The Olympics could be used as a platform to leave a lasting legacy for the host city. A community-based project could be established, where athletes, volunteers, and local residents come together to create a public art installation, park, or community center. This would not only provide a lasting legacy for the host city but also create a sense of community and ownership among local residents.
