    "Global Transportation Overhaul: If the world were to run out of oil, the transportation sector would need a complete overhaul. Electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would become the primary mode of transportation, reducing the need for oil-based fuels. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and mitigating climate change. Additionally, new forms of transportation such as hyperloop systems and high-speed rail could become more prevalent.",
    "Renewable Energy Investment: A world without oil would require a massive investment in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal. This would lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions and a shift towards a more sustainable energy mix. Governments and corporations would need to invest heavily in research and development to create more efficient and cost-effective renewable energy technologies.",
    "Circular Economy: A world without oil would necessitate a shift towards a circular economy, where resources are used efficiently and waste is minimized. This would involve designing products and production processes that are more durable, repairable, and recyclable. Consumers would need to adopt more sustainable consumption habits, such as buying second-hand products and reducing waste.",
    "Carbon Capture and Utilization: Without oil, carbon capture and utilization technologies would become more crucial for reducing carbon emissions. These technologies would capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes, and convert them into valuable products such as fuels, chemicals, and building materials. This would help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.",
    "Space Exploration: In a world without oil, space exploration and colonization could become more feasible and necessary. With the abundance of space available, humanity could focus on establishing self-sustaining colonies on the moon or other planets, reducing the pressure on Earth's resources. This would require significant advancements in space technology, including propulsion systems, life support systems, and materials science."
