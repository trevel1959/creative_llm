    "**Thermos-based Solar Energy Collector:** Design a thermos flask with an integrated solar panel on top. This thermos would collect sunlight during the day, store it in a battery, and use this stored energy to heat water when needed. This idea combines the efficiency of solar energy collection with the practicality of a thermos for hot beverages or food.",
    "**Thermal Insulated Lunch Box for Pets:** Create a pet-friendly lunch box similar to a thermos but designed specifically for dogs or cats. This box can keep their food warm or cool throughout the day, ensuring they have fresh and at-appropriate temperature meals anytime they need them. It includes a detachable container for easy cleaning and can be made from eco-friendly materials.",
    "**Portable Thermos Speaker System:** Develop a thermos flask that doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. This innovative device could be filled with water or other liquid for insulation, but also contains a built-in speaker system. The thermos would provide sound output while keeping your favorite tunes warm (or cold) at the same time.",
    "**Thermos-based Emergency Water Purification Kit:** Design a thermos flask that can also purify water. The thermos would contain a water filter cartridge inside, which is activated by heating the water through a small, integrated solar-powered heater. Once heated, the water flows through the filter, removing contaminants. This invention could be crucial in emergency situations where clean water is hard to come by.",
    "**Smart Thermos for Personal Health Monitoring:** Create a smart thermos that not only keeps liquids at a specific temperature but also monitors and records the temperature of the contents. The data could be transmitted to a smartphone app, allowing users to track the temperature of their drinks over time, which could be useful for medications that need to be taken at specific temperatures or for tracking the health of perishable foods.
