    "**Nature-made Shelter**: I would use natural resources to create a shelter that would provide protection from the elements. This could involve finding or creating materials like branches, leaves, vines, and mud. The shelter could be a simple dome structure that uses these materials to provide insulation against heat and cold. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "**Inflatable Tent**: If technology were available, I would use an inflatable tent made of durable materials that can withstand extreme weather conditions. These tents are lightweight and easy to set up, providing a safe haven in various climates. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Wearable Thermal Armor**: I would design a set of wearable armor made of advanced composite materials that provide both protection and insulation. This could include body suits, gloves, boots, and headgear, each tailored to protect against different elements. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Waterproof and Windproof Garments**: Utilizing nanotechnology, I would create a series of garments that are completely waterproof and windproof. These could be made from fabric that is treated with special coatings or fibers that repel water and resist wind. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Reflective Clothing**: I would develop a set of clothing that reflects sunlight during hot weather and absorbs heat during cold weather, thus maintaining a comfortable body temperature regardless of environmental conditions. The fabrics would be designed with microscopic reflective and absorbing particles. Confidence score: 0.6"
