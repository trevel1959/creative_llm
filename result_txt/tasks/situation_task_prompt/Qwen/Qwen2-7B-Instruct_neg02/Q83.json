    "**Innovative Sleepwear**: Develop sleepwear that uses advanced technology to mimic natural night-time conditions in a light-free environment. This could involve using special fabrics that emit a calming wavelength of light or sound systems that play white noise or ambient sounds, helping users relax and drift off into sleep.",
    "**Sleep Environment Enhancement**: Create an innovative sleep environment by designing a room that adapts to simulate night-time conditions. This can include temperature control systems, light filters, and even air quality enhancements to mimic the clean, fresh air of night-time outdoors. Additionally, incorporating plants known for their ability to purify air can improve sleep quality.",
    "**Daytime Sleep Aids**: Develop new sleep aids that are specifically designed for use during daylight hours. These could be in the form of wearable devices that stimulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, or perhaps supplements that help regulate melatonin levels without relying on darkness.",
    "**Daytime Sleep Education**: Launch a comprehensive educational campaign to change perceptions about daytime sleep. This could include workshops, online courses, and interactive apps that educate people on the benefits of napping during the day, how to do it effectively, and debunk myths about its impact on nighttime sleep.",
    "**Adaptive Sleep Technologies**: Innovate sleep technologies that can automatically adjust to the user's environment and needs. For instance, smart beds that can sense when it is no longer night-time based on the location's latitude and time zone, then adjust their settings accordingly. This might include features like changing colors, vibrations, or even aromatherapy diffusers to promote sleep during daylight hours."
