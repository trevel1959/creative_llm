    "**Eco-Friendly Venue Selection**:    Choose a venue that supports sustainability practices. This could be a garden or park, a historic building that uses renewable energy sources like solar panels, or a venue that has a policy of zero waste. You can also consider a venue that supports local agriculture by serving locally-sourced food and using organic decorations.",
    "**Sustainable Wedding Favors**:    Instead of traditional favors that might end up as clutter, opt for items that are useful and sustainable. These could include things like reusable beeswax wraps, bamboo straws with cleaning brushes, or a plant in a biodegradable pot. Each favor can also come with a note explaining its environmental benefits.",
    "**Vegetarian or Vegan Menu**:    Promote sustainability by offering a menu that is primarily vegetarian or even fully vegan. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with meat production. Work with your caterer to create a delicious, diverse menu featuring local and seasonal ingredients. ",
    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**:    Encourage guests to use public transportation, carpool, or bike to the wedding venue. Offer shuttle services from nearby public transport hubs if needed. Provide bike racks at the venue and consider renting electric scooters or bicycles for guests to use on the day.",
    "**Sustainable Wedding Dress and Suits**:    Instead of buying new attire, consider renting a wedding dress or suit made from sustainable materials such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled fabrics. Alternatively, you can purchase second-hand clothing or create a custom piece using eco-friendly materials. Encourage your bridal party to do the same, perhaps even matching the color palette to reduce the need for new items."
