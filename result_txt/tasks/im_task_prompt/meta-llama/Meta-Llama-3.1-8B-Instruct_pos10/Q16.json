    "**Smart Hairbrush with Built-in Hair Analyzer**: Design a hairbrush that not only detangles and styles hair but also analyzes its health. The brush would have a built-in sensor that detects the moisture level, protein content, and elasticity of the hair. It would then provide personalized recommendations for hair care products, treatments, and styling techniques based on the analysis. The brush could also track hair growth and provide insights on how to promote healthy hair development.",
    "**Hair Color-Changing Brush**: Create a hairbrush that can change hair color temporarily. The brush would have a special coating that releases color pigments when it comes into contact with the hair. Users could choose from a variety of colors and even create their own custom shades. The color-changing effect would be temporary, lasting only until the next wash, making it a fun and safe way to experiment with new looks.",
    "**Vibrating Hair Brush for Hair Growth**: Design a hairbrush that uses gentle vibrations to stimulate hair growth. The brush would have a built-in motor that produces soothing vibrations, which would increase blood flow to the scalp and promote healthy hair growth. The vibrations would also help to reduce dandruff and itchiness, leaving the scalp feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.",
    "**Smart Hairbrush with Integrated Camera and Augmented Reality**: Develop a hairbrush that has a built-in camera and uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide users with a virtual try-on experience. Users could take a photo of themselves with the brush and virtually try on different hairstyles, colors, and accessories. The brush could also detect hair texture, length, and style, providing personalized recommendations for hair care and styling.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a hairbrush that is made from 100% recycled materials, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. The brush would be designed to be biodegradable and compostable, making it a sustainable alternative to traditional hairbrushes. The handle could be made from recycled plastic, while the bristles could be made from natural fibers or bioplastics. The brush would also come with a reusable travel case made from recycled materials, further reducing waste.
