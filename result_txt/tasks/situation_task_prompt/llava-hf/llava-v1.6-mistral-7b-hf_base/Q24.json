    "Vision aids such as magnifying glasses and screen magnifiers: Before the invention of eyeglasses, people with poor vision relied on devices like magnifying glasses and screen magnifiers to improve their vision. These devices can help individuals zoom in on objects or text, making it easier for them to read, write, or see distant objects.",
    "Braille printing and education: For people with severe vision impairments, Braille could serve as an alternative form of visual communication. Braille is a tactile form of writing that can be read using the sense of touch by reading the raised dots on specialized paper. By implementing broader education programs on Braille languages, people with poor vision could learn to read and write in this format, and the availability of Braille-printed materials could also increase significantly.",
    "Virtual and augmented reality glasses: A more futuristic alternative is the development of advanced virtual and augmented reality glasses that could overlay visual data onto a person's field of vision. These glasses could enhance vision by adding visual elements and can be adjustable based on the user's needs.",
    "Improved access to low-vision aids: Increase the accessibility and affordability of low-vision aids like large-print books, audio books, and tactile graphics, allowing people with vision impairments to access information without relying on corrective eyewear.",
    "Voice-controlled devices and AI assistants: As voice-controlled devices and AI assistants become more prevalent, people with poor vision could rely on these technologies to interact with their surroundings, perform everyday tasks, and access information without the need for visual aids."
