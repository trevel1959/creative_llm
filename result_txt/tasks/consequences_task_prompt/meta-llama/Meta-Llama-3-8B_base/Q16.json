    "Insects are a vital part of the ecosystem. They are pollinators and decomposers. Without insects, the ecosystem would be imbalanced. There would be no pollination, which means no reproduction of plants. There would also be no decomposition of dead organisms, which would result in a buildup of waste. This would eventually lead to the extinction of many plant and animal species.",
