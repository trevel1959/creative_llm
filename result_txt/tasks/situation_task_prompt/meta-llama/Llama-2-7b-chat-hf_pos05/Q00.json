    "Build a network of pedal-powered highways: With cars no longer an option, people could use pedal-powered vehicles to travel long distances. This could include recumbent bicycles, tandem bicycles, or even human-powered cars. These vehicles could be equipped with specialized gearing systems to allow for efficient travel over long distances.",
    "Develop a system of magnetic levitation trains: Harnessing magnetic levitation technology, trains could be propelled through vacuum-sealed tubes, eliminating the need for fossil fuels. This would provide a fast and efficient means of transportation, with minimal environmental impact.",
    "Create a network of underground tunnels: With cars off the road, people could use a network of underground tunnels to travel between cities. These tunnels could be built using advanced materials and technology, such as smart tunnels that adjust their temperature and humidity levels to optimize comfort and safety.",
    "Establish a fleet of solar-powered airships: Using large, rigid-framed airships equipped with solar panels, people could travel between cities with minimal environmental impact. These airships could be propelled by electric motors, powered by batteries charged by the solar panels.",
    "Develop a system of personal, autonomous flying vehicles: With the absence of cars, people could use personal, autonomous flying vehicles to travel between cities. These vehicles could be powered by electricity or even solar energy, and could be equipped with advanced navigation systems to ensure safe and efficient travel."
