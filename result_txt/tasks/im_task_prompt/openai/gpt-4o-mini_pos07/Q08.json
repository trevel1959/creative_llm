    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light technology to sanitize the interior surfaces of the refrigerator. This system could activate at scheduled intervals or when the door has been closed for a certain period. It would help eliminate bacteria and odors, ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment for food storage.",
    "**Modular Shelving System**: Design a customizable shelving system that allows users to easily adjust the height and configuration of shelves and compartments. Magnetic or sliding shelves could enable users to create more space for larger items or to rearrange the layout based on their storage needs. This flexibility would enhance usability and organization.",
    "**Dual Climate Zones**: Introduce dual climate zones within the refrigerator, allowing users to set different temperatures and humidity levels for various sections. For instance, one area could be optimized for fruits and vegetables, while another could be tailored for dairy products or meats. This would preserve the freshness of items longer and improve overall food quality.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Technology**: Implement energy harvesting technology that captures excess heat generated by the refrigerator's compressor and converts it into electricity to power small appliances or charge devices. This eco-friendly feature would reduce overall energy consumption and promote sustainability, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion System**: Create a built-in water filtration system that allows users to infuse their water with fruits, herbs, or spices directly in the refrigerator. This feature would encourage healthier hydration habits and could include options for carbonated water. Users could easily switch out infusion ingredients based on their preferences, promoting creativity in hydration."
