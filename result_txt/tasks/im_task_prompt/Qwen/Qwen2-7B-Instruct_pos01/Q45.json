    "**Ceiling Fan with Built-in Smart Lights**: This idea combines functionality and aesthetics by integrating LED lights into the ceiling fan design. The lights can be color-changing or adjustable in brightness, providing ambient lighting while the fan operates. Users can control the lights through voice commands or a smartphone app, making it easy to adjust the lighting based on their needs.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Built-in Air Purification System**: Incorporating an air purification system into the ceiling fan would not only cool the room but also improve air quality. This system could include HEPA filters, activated carbon filters, or other technologies that capture and eliminate airborne pollutants like dust, pollen, and allergens. The fan would distribute cleaner air throughout the space, enhancing overall comfort.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Adjustable Wind Speed and Direction**: This innovative ceiling fan would feature a mechanism allowing users to adjust the wind speed and direction independently. This customization enables users to create their ideal breeze pattern, whether they prefer a gentle breeze or a stronger gust. It could also have sensors that detect temperature changes, automatically adjusting the fan settings accordingly.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Built-in Humidifier**: For rooms where humidity levels are too low, this idea adds a humidifier function to the ceiling fan. The fan could distribute moisture evenly throughout the space, improving air quality and comfort, especially during dry seasons or in heated environments. The fan's motor would help disperse the humidified air more effectively than traditional humidifiers.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Removable Blades for Ventilation Modes**: This concept allows the user to switch between different ventilation modes by removing or rotating the blades. For example, removing the blades completely turns the ceiling fan into a vent, allowing for maximum airflow. Conversely, using smaller, more compact blades creates a quieter, less powerful airflow when needed. This flexibility caters to various room conditions and personal preferences."
