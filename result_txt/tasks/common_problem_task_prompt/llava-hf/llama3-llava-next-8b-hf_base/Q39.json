    "Cost: Implementing a UBI would require significant funding, which could be difficult to generate without increasing taxes or borrowing money. This could lead to higher costs for taxpayers and potentially a higher national debt.",
    "Inefficiency: A UBI may not be an efficient way to address poverty and income inequality, as it does not target specific individuals or groups who may be in need of assistance. This could lead to a waste of resources and a lack of effectiveness in addressing poverty.",
    "Dependence: A UBI may encourage people to become more dependent on government assistance, rather than pursuing self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth.",
    "Lack of motivation: A UBI may reduce the incentive for people to work and contribute to society, as they would receive a basic income regardless of their efforts. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth.",
    "Lack of control: A UBI may take away control over one's own income and financial decisions, as the government would be responsible for providing a basic income. This could lead to a lack of autonomy and personal freedom."
