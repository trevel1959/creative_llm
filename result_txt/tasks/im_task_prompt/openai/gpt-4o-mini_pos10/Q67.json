    "**Adjustable Brush Tip**: Design a paintbrush with an adjustable tip that can change its shape and size at the touch of a button. Users could switch from a fine point for detailed work to a broader flat edge for washes, all with the same brush. This would eliminate the need for multiple brushes and streamline the painting process, making it more efficient and versatile.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a paintbrush with self-cleaning capabilities using a special polymer that repels paint and cleans itself with a simple water spray. This feature would save artists time on cleaning their brushes and reduce the amount of paint waste, leading to a more sustainable art practice.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Pressure Sensors**: Create a paintbrush with an ergonomic grip that incorporates pressure sensors. This feature would allow artists to monitor how much pressure theyâ€™re applying while painting, providing real-time feedback on their technique. It could even connect to an app that offers tips and tutorials based on the artist's pressure patterns, helping them improve their skills.",
    "**Multi-Functional Paintbrush with Built-in Palette**: Design a paintbrush that has a detachable palette attached to the handle. This palette would include compartments for different colors and even a small mixing area. Artists could carry their colors with them, allowing for easy access and reducing the need for separate palettes, thus promoting a more mobile painting experience.",
    "**LED Light-Up Brush for Night Painting**: Introduce a paintbrush with an integrated LED light at the tip. This feature would illuminate the painting surface, making it easier to see details in low-light conditions. Ideal for artists who enjoy painting outdoors during dusk or in dimly lit studios, this brush would enhance visibility without disturbing the creative atmosphere."
