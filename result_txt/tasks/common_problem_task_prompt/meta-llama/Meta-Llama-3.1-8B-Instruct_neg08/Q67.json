    "**Limited Access to Organic Inputs**: Organic farming relies heavily on natural and organic inputs such as compost, manure, and crop rotation. However, the farm might not have access to these resources, leading to difficulties in maintaining soil health and fertility. This could result in reduced crop yields or lower quality produce.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Organic farms must adhere to strict regulations and certifications, such as those set by the USDA Organic program. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, loss of certification, or even closure of the farm.",
    "**Pests and Diseases**: Organic farms are more susceptible to pests and diseases due to the absence of synthetic pesticides and fungicides. This could lead to significant crop losses if not managed effectively. The farm might need to invest in integrated pest management (IPM) strategies or employ natural pest control methods.",
    "**Water Scarcity**: Organic farming often requires more water than conventional farming due to the emphasis on crop rotation and soil health. However, if the farm is located in an area with limited water resources, this could become a significant challenge. The farm might need to implement water-saving techniques or explore alternative water sources.",
    "**Labor Shortages**: Organic farming often requires more labor than conventional farming due to the need for manual tasks such as crop rotation, weeding, and harvesting. If the farm cannot find sufficient labor, this could impact productivity and profitability."
