    "**Radiation Protection**: Spacecraft are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation than Earth, which poses health risks to astronauts over extended missions. A potential problem could be inadequate shielding against this radiation. To mitigate this, the spaceship could be designed with specialized materials that offer better radiation absorption, such as polyethylene or hydrogen-rich materials. Moreover, incorporating modular design elements that allow for the relocation of crew quarters to shielded areas during solar flares could enhance safety.",
    "**Psychological Well-being of Crew**: Long-duration space missions can lead to isolation and psychological stress among crew members. A potential issue is the impact of confinement and the lack of social interaction. To counter this, the spaceship could include recreational areas, virtual reality environments for relaxation, and regular communication with loved ones on Earth. Additionally, integrating a diverse crew with varied backgrounds and skills could help create a supportive community onboard.",
    "**Resource Management and Waste Recycling**: Efficient management of resources, including food, water, and energy, is crucial for a spaceship. A potential problem could arise from the inability to recycle waste effectively, leading to resource depletion. To solve this, designers could implement advanced bioregenerative life support systems that utilize waste materials to produce food and clean water. Research into closed-loop systems that mimic Earthâ€™s ecosystems could also be beneficial, promoting sustainability throughout the mission.",
    "**Structural Integrity in Extreme Conditions**: Spacecraft must withstand various extreme conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, micrometeoroid impacts, and vacuum pressure. A potential problem is the structural integrity of the spaceship over time. To address this, engineers could use innovative materials like carbon nanotubes or graphene composites that offer strength without adding excessive weight. Regular structural health monitoring systems could be installed to detect any wear and tear in real-time, allowing for preventive maintenance.",
    "**Navigation and Communication Challenges**: Navigating in deep space presents challenges due to the vast distances and the time delay in communication with Earth. A potential issue could be loss of signal or navigation errors. To mitigate this, the spaceship could be equipped with autonomous navigation systems that utilize advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to make real-time adjustments. Additionally, a network of relay satellites could be deployed to maintain continuous communication with the crew, reducing the risks associated with navigation errors."
