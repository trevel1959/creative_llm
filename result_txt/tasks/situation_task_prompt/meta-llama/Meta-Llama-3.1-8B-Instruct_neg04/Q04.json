    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop large-scale atmospheric water harvesting systems that can extract water vapor from the air, even in arid regions. This technology could provide a sustainable source of clean drinking water, reducing the need for desalination and groundwater extraction.",
    "**Urban Algae Farms**: Establish massive urban algae farms that can produce biofuels, animal feed, and nutritional supplements. Algae are a highly efficient photosynthetic organism that can thrive in urban environments, providing a sustainable source of renewable energy and food.",
    "**Artificial Photosynthesis**: Develop artificial photosynthesis systems that can mimic the process of plant photosynthesis, converting sunlight into chemical energy. This technology could provide a sustainable source of energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.",
    "**Ocean Fertilization**: Implement large-scale ocean fertilization programs that add nutrients to the oceans to stimulate phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton are a primary producer of oxygen and can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Develop space-based solar power systems that collect solar energy in orbit and beam it back to Earth as a microwave beam. This technology could provide a constant and reliable source of renewable energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change."
