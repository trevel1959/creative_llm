    "Build an Atmospheric Water Harvester: Create a large-scale, vertically-integrated system that can extract water directly from the atmosphere using a proprietary process called \"condensation capture.\" This system would use a network of towers strategically placed around the world to collect and condense water vapor from the atmosphere, purify it using advanced technologies, and then distribute it to communities in need.",
    "Desalination using Artificial Photosynthesis: Develop a revolutionary new technology that mimics the process of photosynthesis to desalinate seawater. This technology would use a specially designed membrane that harnesses the energy of the sun to split seawater into fresh water and salt, making it possible to produce fresh drinking water in areas with limited access to traditional desalination methods.",
    "Floating Water Farms: Create large-scale, modular water farms that float on the ocean's surface. These farms would use a combination of hydroponics, aquaponics, and algae cultivation to produce fresh, clean drinking water while also providing a sustainable source of food. The water produced would be collected and purified using advanced technologies, making it safe for consumption.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Develop a cloud seeding technology that can enhance natural precipitation patterns to produce clean drinking water. This technology would use a network of ground-based generators that emit electrically charged particles into the atmosphere to stimulate the formation of clouds and increase precipitation in areas where clean water is scarce.",
    "Bacteriophage-based Water Purification: Create a novel water purification system that uses bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target and destroy harmful bacteria, to clean water. This system would involve injecting bacteriophages into the water source, which would then target and eliminate harmful bacteria, producing clean and safe drinking water."
