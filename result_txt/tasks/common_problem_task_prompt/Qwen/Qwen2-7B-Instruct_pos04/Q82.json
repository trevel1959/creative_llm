    "**Innovative Multi-functional Spaces**: Design your tiny house to have walls that can be easily adjusted or removed to transform spaces. For instance, a wall might slide away to create an open-plan living area when needed, but fold back to provide privacy for sleeping areas. This design could include modular furniture that doubles as storage or serves multiple purposes, like a bed that converts into a desk or a sofa.",
    "**Sustainable Living**: Incorporate eco-friendly elements such as solar panels for energy, rainwater harvesting systems for water conservation, and composting toilets to reduce environmental impact. The exterior could be covered in greenery, such as climbing plants, not only for aesthetic appeal but also for insulation benefits. ",
    "**Vertical Farming**: Integrate space-saving vertical farming techniques within your tiny house. Utilize the height of the space by installing grow lights and shelving systems for growing herbs, vegetables, and even some fruits. This could provide fresh produce and potentially reduce reliance on grocery stores.",
    "**Smart Home Technology**: Build your tiny house with smart home technology to enhance both functionality and comfort. This could include automated lighting, climate control, and security systems that are easy to manage through a smartphone app. Smart appliances like a connected refrigerator or a self-cleaning oven can further streamline daily life.",
    "**Flexible Layout for Multiple Uses**: Design your tiny house with the ability to adapt to different lifestyles and needs over time. For example, the central part of the house could be designed as a living room with a pull-out couch for guests, while the annex can be converted between a home office, a hobby space, or a guest bedroom depending on current needs. This adaptable design ensures longevity and reduces the need for frequent redesigns."
