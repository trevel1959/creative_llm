    "**Integrating Smart Technology**: Develop a smart wheelchair that utilizes sensors and AI to predict and respond to user needs. It could learn from the user's habits and preferences, adjusting its speed, braking, and navigation accordingly. For example, if the user frequently visits a specific store, the wheelchair can automatically plan routes based on the user's historical data.",
    "**Augmented Reality Guidance System**: Incorporate an AR display into the wheelchair, providing real-time navigation instructions, maps, and obstacle warnings. This feature would enhance safety and independence by guiding users through unfamiliar environments without the need for external assistance or GPS devices.",
    "**Power-Assist and Energy Recovery**: Integrate a motorized system that assists in moving the wheelchair, reducing physical strain on the user. Additionally, this motor could harness kinetic energy from the user's movements (like pedaling) to recharge the battery, making the wheelchair more sustainable and self-sufficient.",
    "**Customizable Comfort and Support**: Allow users to customize the seating position, backrest, and armrests to fit their specific needs and preferences. This includes options for varying degrees of recline, lumbar support, and cushioning levels. The wheelchair should also have adjustable footrests to ensure proper posture and comfort during long periods of use.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Equip the wheelchair with sensors that monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This information can be transmitted to healthcare providers or caregivers in real-time, ensuring prompt medical attention when necessary. The wheelchair could also include a built-in emergency button for quick access to help."
