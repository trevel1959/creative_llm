    "**Insufficient Training**: The success of a new curriculum often hinges on proper training for teachers. If adequate professional development is not provided, educators may feel unprepared to teach the new content, leading to frustration and potential failure to deliver the intended educational outcomes.",
    "**Lack of Resources**: Implementing a new curriculum typically requires new textbooks, technology, and materials. Schools may face budget constraints that prevent them from acquiring these necessary resources, leading to an incomplete or ineffective implementation of the curriculum.",
    "**Parental Concerns**: Parents may have concerns about the new curriculum, particularly if it deviates significantly from what they experienced or if it is perceived to be less rigorous. This could result in pushback from the community, protests, or demands for reconsideration, which could undermine the schoolâ€™s efforts.",
    "**Student Adjustment**: Students may struggle to adapt to a new curriculum, especially if it involves different teaching methods or assessment strategies. This could lead to decreased motivation, anxiety, or confusion, particularly for students who thrive under familiar structures.",
    "**Assessment Alignment**: The new curriculum may not align with existing standardized tests or assessment methods, creating a gap between what is taught and what is evaluated. This misalignment can cause stress for both teachers and students and may ultimately affect student performance on standardized assessments."
