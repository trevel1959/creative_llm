    "Carrier Pigeons: Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries as a reliable means of communication, especially during times of war or natural disasters. In the event of an electronic communication blackout, carrier pigeons could be trained to carry messages between countries. Each pigeon could be equipped with a small GPS device to track its journey and ensure delivery.",
    "Mirror Signals: Mirrors can be used to reflect sunlight towards a target location, creating a visual signal that can be seen from a distance. In the absence of electronic communication, mirror signals could be used to convey messages between countries. For example, a series of mirror signals could be arranged in a specific pattern to spell out a message or a symbol.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Homing pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location, even when released far away. In a post-electronic communication world, homing pigeons could be used to carry messages between countries. Each pigeon could be equipped with a small tracking device to ensure its safe delivery.",
    "Driftwood Messages: In the absence of electronic communication, messages could be inscribed on pieces of driftwood and floated towards the intended destination. The movement of the ocean currents could help carry the messages across long distances. This method would be slow but reliable, and the messages could be retrieved from the shore or from boats.",
    "Fire Signals: Fire signals have been used throughout history to communicate over long distances. In a post-electronic communication world, fire signals could be used to convey messages between countries. Different colored flames could be used to represent different messages or symbols, and the smoke could be used to convey information over long distances."
