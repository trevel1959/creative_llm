    "**Sunhat with a Wide Brim and UV Protection:** After losing your hair, it's crucial to protect your scalp from harmful UV rays that can cause sunburn and increase the risk of skin cancer. You could invest in a wide-brimmed sun hat specifically designed for UV protection. These hats are often made from tightly woven fabrics or special UV-blocking materials, ensuring maximum coverage and sun protection.",
    "**Reflective Cap:** Create a custom cap with reflective material that covers the top of your head and part of your forehead. This can help reflect sunlight away from your scalp, reducing the amount of UV radiation absorbed. The cap could be made from a lightweight, breathable fabric like mesh, so it doesn't feel too heavy or hot when worn outdoors.",
    "**UV-Blocking Hairnet:** A UV-blocking hairnet can provide an additional layer of protection for your scalp. These hairnets are designed to block harmful UV rays while still allowing air to circulate around the head. They can be made from special UV-blocking fibers or coated with a UV-blocking substance, ensuring they effectively shield your scalp from sunburn.",
    "**Sunglasses with UV Protection:** While primarily meant to protect your eyes, sunglasses can also provide some shade on your face and ears. Look for sunglasses with UV protection ratings and consider purchasing a pair with a larger frame that covers more of your face, providing additional sun coverage for your scalp.",
    "**Sunscreen-Shielded Headband:** Make a custom headband that includes a strip of sunscreen. This can be done by sewing a thin, absorbent material with a high SPF sunscreen into the headband. As you wear the headband, the sunscreen will slowly release onto your scalp, providing continuous sun protection throughout the day. Ensure the sunscreen is waterproof or water-resistant if you plan to engage in activities near water or during exercise."
