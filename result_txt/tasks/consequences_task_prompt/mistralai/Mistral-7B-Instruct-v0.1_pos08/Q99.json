    "A world where everyone can choose their physical appearance would lead to a more diverse and accepting society. People would be able to express themselves freely and the societal norms and expectations that dictate beauty standards.",
    "It would lead to a significant increase in the beauty industry, as people would have more options to choose from and would be more willing to spend money on products and services that help them achieve their desired look.",
    "It would also lead to a significant increase in the number of plastic surgeries and cosmetic procedures, as people would be more willing to undergo such procedures to achieve their desired appearance.",
    "It would also lead to a significant increase in body dysmorphia and other mental health issues, as people would be more critical of their appearance and would feel the need to constantly compare themselves to others.",
    "It would also lead to a significant increase in the number of hate crimes and discrimination against people who do not conform to the societal beauty standards, as people would be more critical of those who do not look like they do."
