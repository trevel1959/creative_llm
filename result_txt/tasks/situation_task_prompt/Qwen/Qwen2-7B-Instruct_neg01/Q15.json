    "**Non-Dominant Hand Musical Instrument Learning**: Choose a musical instrument you've always wanted to learn but never had the opportunity to do so due to being left-handed (if you're right-handed) or vice versa. Learning to play an instrument with your non-dominant hand could lead to new insights into music theory, timing, and coordination. You might find that playing an instrument with your non-dominant hand forces you to think about music in a completely different way, enhancing your overall musical understanding and skill.",

For instance, in tennis, you could practice forehand shots with your non-dominant hand to improve your overall game.",
    "**Non-Dominant Hand Writing Journal**: Commit to writing a journal exclusively with your non-dominant hand for a month.
