    "**Ecosystem Changes**: The increase in animal size would dramatically impact ecosystems. Predators might become dominant, potentially leading to a food chain imbalance where smaller species are at risk of extinction. This could cause a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, affecting the availability of resources for other organisms.",
    "**Evolutionary Shifts**: Over time, the larger size of animals could drive evolutionary changes. For example, some animals might develop new adaptations such as longer legs for faster movement or stronger jaws for efficient feeding. Others might evolve into aquatic forms to avoid land-based predators, creating new aquatic ecosystems.",
    "**Conservation Challenges**: With animals growing to such large sizes, conservation efforts would face unprecedented challenges. Protecting habitats would require much larger territories, and there would be increased pressure on biodiversity due to habitat destruction and fragmentation.",
    "**Human-Animal Interactions**: The scale-up of animals would significantly alter interactions between humans and wildlife. Larger animals could pose threats to human safety and property, necessitating stricter regulations and possibly new technologies for managing these encounters, such as automated deterrent systems.",
    "**Impact on Food Webs**: The presence of larger animals could disrupt food webs, potentially leading to overgrazing of certain plant species and over-predation of smaller fauna. This could have cascading effects on the entire food web, influencing the distribution and abundance of all species within the ecosystem."
