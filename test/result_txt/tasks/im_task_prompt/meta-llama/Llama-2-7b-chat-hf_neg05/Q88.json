    "Glow-in-the-Dark Ski Poles: These ski poles would be made with a special coating that absorbs light and emits a soft, glowing light. This would make skiing at night or in low-light conditions much safer and more enjoyable. The glowing poles would also add a unique and fun element to the skiing experience, making it more memorable for both the skier and other skiers on the slopes.",
    "Smart Ski Poles: These ski poles would be equipped with advanced technology, such as GPS, altimeters, and temperature sensors. This would allow skiers to track their speed, distance, and altitude in real-time, as well as monitor the temperature of the surrounding environment. This information could be displayed on a small screen on the handle of the pole or through a companion app on a smartphone.",
    "Customizable Ski Poles: These ski poles would allow skiers to customize the length, grip size, and even the color of their poles to fit their individual preferences. This would provide a more personalized and comfortable skiing experience, as skiers could choose the exact poles that suit their needs and style.",
    "Heated Ski Poles: These ski poles would be equipped with built-in heating elements, such as carbon fiber or thermoelectric materials, that would keep the hands of the skier warm and toasty during long ski sessions. This would be especially useful for skiers in cold climates or at high elevations, where the cold can be intense.",
    "Augmented Reality Ski Poles: These ski poles would be equipped with augmented reality (AR) technology, such as a small display screen or projector, that would provide additional information and enhance the skiing experience. For example, the poles could display information about the surrounding terrain, such as the location of obstacles or the best routes to take. They could also display fun and interactive elements, such as games or challenges, to make the skiing experience more engaging and enjoyable."
