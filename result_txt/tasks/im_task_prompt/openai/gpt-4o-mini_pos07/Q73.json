    "**Solar-Powered Key Fob**: Design a key fob that harnesses solar energy to power itself. By integrating solar panels into the fob's design, users could eliminate the need for battery replacements. This would be especially beneficial for those who frequently forget to replace batteries, making the fob more environmentally friendly and sustainable.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Key Finder**: Create a key fob that works with an augmented reality app. When users misplace their keys, they can use their smartphone to activate the AR feature, which overlays a virtual map or directional arrows on their screen, guiding them to the keys' last known location. This would combine technology with everyday life, making it easier to find misplaced items.",
    "**Customizable Key Fob Covers**: Offer a line of customizable key fob covers that allow users to express their personality. These covers could come in various colors, textures, and designs, and even include options for adding personal engravings or photos. This would not only make the keys more aesthetically pleasing but also help users easily identify their keys among a sea of similar-looking fobs.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Imagine a key fob that includes a small health monitoring system. It could track the owner's heart rate, stress levels, or even send alerts in case of a medical emergency (like a fall). This would add a layer of safety and convenience, as users could carry their health monitoring device in their pocket without needing an additional gadget.",
    "**Keyless Entry with Voice Activation**: Develop a keyless entry system that allows users to unlock their car using voice commands. By integrating voice recognition technology, users could simply say a designated phrase to unlock their vehicle. This would be especially useful when hands are full or in situations where traditional keys are impractical."
