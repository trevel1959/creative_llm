    "**Communication and Coordination**: Establishing and maintaining communication with the surface is crucial. The distance from the surface to the bottom of the ocean is greater than the depth of Mount Everest, so any communication system must be reliable and robust.",
    "**Lighting**: The ocean floor is in complete darkness, which requires the use of powerful lights to illuminate the area. These lights must be able to withstand the pressure and function reliably for the duration of the mission.",
    "**Environmental Hazards**: The ocean floor is home to a variety of hazards, including underwater volcanoes, methane hydrates, and unstable seafloor. These can pose significant risks to the crew and the mission.",
    "**Navigation**: The crew must navigate the ocean floor, which is a challenging task due to the lack of landmarks and the potential for underwater currents and tides to disorient the crew.",
    "**Emergency Procedures**: In case of an emergency, the crew must be prepared to react quickly and effectively. This includes having emergency procedures in place for dealing with equipment failure, injuries, or other unexpected situations."
