    "**Dusting Mitt**: Use a clean sock as a dusting mitt. Simply slide your hand into the sock and use it to wipe down surfaces like shelves, furniture, or electronics. The sock's fabric can attract dust, making it a quick and easy way to keep your home tidy without needing extra cleaning supplies.",
    "**Potted Plant Watering Aid**: Fill a sock with soil and plant seeds inside to create a small potted plant. The sock acts as a biodegradable pot that allows for moisture retention while also providing drainage. As the plant grows, the sock will decompose, enriching the soil.",
    "**Travel Laundry Bag**: Use a sock as a compact laundry bag when traveling. Simply stuff your dirty clothes into the sock, tie it off, and toss it in your suitcase. This keeps your dirty laundry separate from clean clothes and can be easily carried or hung up.",
    "**Scented Sachet**: Fill a sock with dried lavender, cedar chips, or potpourri to create a scented sachet. Tie off the opening and place it in your closet, drawers, or car to keep things smelling fresh. The breathable fabric allows the scent to permeate while keeping the contents contained.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Turn an old sock into a fun pet toy. Fill it with crinkly paper or another sock, tie it off, and give it to your dog or cat. The soft texture makes it safe for chewing, and the unique shape can provide hours of entertainment."
