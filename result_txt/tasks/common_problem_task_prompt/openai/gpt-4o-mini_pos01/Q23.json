    "**Insufficient Training for Implementation**: Government employees and officials may not receive adequate training to implement the new policy effectively. This could result in inconsistent application of the policy, leading to public frustration and a lack of trust in government processes. To mitigate this, a structured training program should be developed, including workshops, online courses, and ongoing support to ensure that all stakeholders are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills.",
    "**Budget Constraints**: Implementing a new policy often requires financial resources, which may not be readily available. Budget constraints can hinder the execution of the policy, leading to delays or partial implementation. To overcome this, a detailed cost analysis should be conducted to identify funding sources, and a phased implementation plan could be created to spread out costs over time.",
    "**Resistance from Stakeholders**: Various stakeholders, including interest groups, local businesses, or even other government entities, may resist the new policy due to perceived negative impacts on their operations or interests. To address this, the government should engage stakeholders early in the policy-making process, soliciting feedback and making adjustments based on their concerns to foster collaboration and support.",
    "**Unintended Consequences**: The new policy might lead to unintended consequences that could undermine its objectives. For example, if the policy aims to reduce traffic congestion but leads to increased public transport fares, it may deter people from using public transport. To minimize this risk, a thorough impact assessment should be conducted before implementation, and a monitoring system should be established to track the policy's effects and allow for timely adjustments.",
    "**Technology Integration Issues**: If the new policy relies on technology (e.g., a digital platform for service delivery), there may be challenges related to system integration, user accessibility, or cybersecurity. This could result in service disruptions or data breaches. To mitigate these risks, the government should invest in robust technology infrastructure, conduct thorough testing before launch, and provide technical support for users."
