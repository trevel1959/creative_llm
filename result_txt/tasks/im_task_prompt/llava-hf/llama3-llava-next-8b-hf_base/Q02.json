    "Aerodynamics Optimizing Design: In high-speed cycling, the shape of the bike plays a significant role in reducing wind resistance. The bicycle could be designed with an aerodynamic frame, rounded edges, and larger wheels, along with a streamlined seat and handlebars. The benefits include improved speed, power, and reduced fatigue for the rider.",
    "Electric Propulsion: Integrate an electric power system that integrates rechargeable batteries with an electric motor. This allows the bicycle to be powered by the motor, providing assistance at higher speeds or in hilly terrain. It also improves the range for touring, commuting, and long-distance cycling.",
    "Self-Monitoring Technology: Installing a GPS-enabled device that tracks distance, speed, and calories burned, along with a built-in heart rate monitor, allows cyclists to track their performance and monitor their fitness level. The data is stored and displayed on a companion app to assist in workout planning and training.",
    "Automatic Braking System: An enhanced braking system, such as regenerative braking, that captures kinetic energy and converts it to electricity or stores it in a supercapacitor to be used as assistance in acceleration, braking, or powering lights.",
    "Smart Integration: Integrate a range of sensors, such as a weather sensor, air quality monitor, traffic flow sensor, and bicycle theft sensor, into the bicycle's control unit. This would provide real-time feedback to the rider, allowing them to monitor the environment and plan their route accordingly, improving both safety and convenience."
