    "**LED Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that integrates LED lights in its bristles. The lights can change colors or brightness depending on the brushing technique, reminding users to brush correctly. This not only enhances the user experience but also adds an interactive element for children who might find brushing more enjoyable.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with AI Feedback**: Develop a toothbrush equipped with sensors that communicate with a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app provides real-time feedback on brushing habits, such as the duration of brushing, pressure applied, and areas of the mouth that need more attention. This technology can help users improve their oral hygiene practices over time.",
    "**Heated Toothbrush for Cold Sensitivity**: Create a toothbrush that has the capability to heat up the bristles gently. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with sensitive teeth or gum problems, as it can make brushing more comfortable and less painful.",
    "**Rechargeable Toothbrush with Built-in Humidifier**: Design a toothbrush with a small humidifier inside, which can add moisture to the air in the bathroom during use. This can help prevent dryness in the mouth, which is often exacerbated by regular brushing and flossing. It's especially useful for those who suffer from dry mouth conditions.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care System**: Develop a toothbrush system that allows users to swap out different heads tailored to specific needs, such as whitening, sensitivity relief, gum health, or plaque removal. This system could include a base station that connects to an app where users can select and customize their brushing routine based on their dental health goals. "
