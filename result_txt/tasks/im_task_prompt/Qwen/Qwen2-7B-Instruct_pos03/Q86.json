    "**Customized Wheelchair Upholstery Design**: Create a unique and personalized wheelchair upholstery design that reflects the user's personality or interests. This could involve designing the fabric to resemble favorite sports team logos, artistic patterns, or even custom images of places they've visited or want to visit. This not only enhances comfort but also boosts the user's self-esteem and pride in their wheelchair.",
    "**Smart Wheelchair Navigation System**: Develop a system integrated into the wheelchair that uses sensors, GPS, and AI to navigate through environments autonomously. This could include obstacle detection, route planning, and even real-time traffic updates. This would make mobility easier for users who have difficulty controlling the wheelchair manually, especially in busy or unfamiliar environments.",
    "**Interactive Wheelchair Armrests**: Implement touch-sensitive technology on the armrests that allow users to control various functions of the wheelchair, such as speed, direction, and braking, using gestures like swipes or taps. This could also include features like music controls, phone calls, and app access, making the wheelchair more interactive and user-friendly.",
    "**Ergonomic Wheelchair Cushion with Memory Foam**: Design a cushion that utilizes memory foam technology to provide exceptional support and reduce pressure points. The cushion could be tailored to match the contours of the userâ€™s body, offering maximum comfort during extended periods of sitting. Additionally, it could incorporate heating elements for therapeutic warmth, particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions like Raynaud's disease.",
    "**Portable Power Bank for Electronic Aids**: Integrate a power bank into the wheelchair frame that can charge electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and assistive tech tools directly from the wheelchair. This would ensure that users always have access to necessary communication, entertainment, or health monitoring devices without the need for additional cables or chargers."
