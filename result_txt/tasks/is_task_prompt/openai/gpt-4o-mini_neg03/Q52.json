    "In a tranquil pond, a little frog named Ferdinand gazed longingly at the shimmering moonlight. He dreamt of being a prince, wearing a golden crown and dancing in grand ballrooms. One fateful night, a wise old owl perched nearby overheard his wishes. \"To become a prince, you must show kindness,\" she advised. Inspired, Ferdinand began helping other creatures in the pond, rescuing a drowning fish and guiding lost fireflies home. As dawn broke, a magical light enveloped him, transforming him into a charming prince. Ferdinand realized that true royalty comes from compassion, and he ruled the forest with a gentle heart.",
