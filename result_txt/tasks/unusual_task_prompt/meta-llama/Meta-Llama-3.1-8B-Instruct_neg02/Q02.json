    "**Augmented Reality Hand**: Design a prosthetic hand that uses AR technology to simulate the sensation of touch. The hand would be equipped with sensors that detect temperature, texture, and vibrations, which would be translated into a digital representation of the sensation. This information would be projected onto the user's brain through a headset, creating a convincing illusion of touch. The user could then manipulate virtual objects in mid-air, feeling as if they're interacting with real objects.",
    "**Neurofeedback-Controlled Prosthetic**: Develop a prosthetic hand that uses EEG sensors to monitor the user's brain activity. The system would analyze the brain signals and adjust the hand's movements accordingly, allowing the user to control the prosthetic with their thoughts. This would enable people with paralysis or amputations to regain a sense of agency and independence.",
    "**Soft Exosuit**: Create a wearable exosuit that resembles a glove. The soft, flexible material would provide support and stability to the user's hand, while also allowing for a full range of motion. The exosuit would be equipped with sensors that track the user's movements, providing real-time feedback and assistance to help improve dexterity and coordination.",
    "**Mind-Controlled Robotics**: Design a robotic hand that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. Using a combination of EEG sensors and machine learning algorithms, the system would learn the user's brain patterns and adapt to their unique control style. The robotic hand would be able to perform complex tasks, such as grasping and manipulating objects, with precision and accuracy.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Glove**: Develop a glove that provides haptic feedback to the user, simulating the sensation of touch and texture. The glove would be equipped with tactile sensors that detect the user's movements and translate them into a digital representation of the sensation. This information would be projected onto the user's brain through a headset, creating a convincing illusion of touch. The user could then explore virtual environments, feeling as if they're interacting with real objects."
