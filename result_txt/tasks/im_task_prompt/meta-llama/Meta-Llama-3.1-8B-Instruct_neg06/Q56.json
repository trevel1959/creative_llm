    "**Smart Ring System**: Design a smart bicycle bell that uses a ring-shaped sensor to detect the rider's hand position and speed. When the rider approaches a pedestrian or another cyclist, the bell emits a gentle chime, and as the rider approaches a specific speed threshold (e.g., 10 mph), the bell emits a louder, more insistent chime to alert others of the rider's approach.",
    "**LED Light Show**: Develop a bicycle bell that incorporates LED lights to create a visually engaging display. As the rider approaches a pedestrian or another cyclist, the lights flash in a specific pattern to grab attention. The bell could also be programmed to display a custom message or a warning symbol (e.g., a flashing \"X\" for \"Caution: Pedestrian Ahead\").",
    "**Voice Assistant Integration**: Create a bicycle bell that integrates with popular voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant. When the rider approaches a pedestrian or another cyclist, the bell emits a gentle chime and announces the rider's approach through the voice assistant, saying something like, \"Approaching pedestrian on your left\" or \"Cyclist approaching from behind.\"",
    "**Vibration Feedback**: Design a bicycle bell that provides vibration feedback to the rider, alerting them to potential hazards. As the rider approaches a pedestrian or another cyclist, the bell vibrates in the rider's hand, providing a subtle yet effective warning. This feature could be especially useful for riders with hearing impairments or those who prefer a more discreet warning system.",
    "**Social Responsibility Indicator**: Develop a bicycle bell that tracks and displays the rider's social responsibility score, encouraging riders to be more mindful of their interactions with pedestrians and other cyclists. The bell could display a score based on factors like the number of times the rider has alerted others, the number of near-misses avoided, or the number of friendly interactions initiated. This feature could foster a sense of community and promote more considerate cycling behavior."
