    "**Scented Cooking Classes**: Leverage the natural aromas found in food by offering cooking classes that focus on using aromatic herbs and spices. Participants could learn how to incorporate ingredients like cinnamon, vanilla, and citrus zest into their dishes. The delightful smells produced during cooking could be bottled and used as home fragrances or personal scents, creating a culinary experience that tantalizes both the taste buds and the sense of smell.",
    "**Scented Craft Workshops**: Organize workshops where participants can create their own scented products using natural materials. This could include making scented candles with beeswax and essential oils, crafting potpourri from dried flowers and herbs, or creating incense from natural resins. Participants would not only enjoy the process of making these items but would also leave with unique scents that reflect their personal preferences.",
    "**Aromatherapy Soundscapes**: Develop a multi-sensory experience that combines sound and scent. Create soundscapes inspired by different environments, such as a forest, ocean, or garden, and pair them with corresponding natural scents. For example, the sound of waves crashing could be accompanied by the fresh scent of ocean breeze (using sea salt and citrus notes). This immersive experience would allow people to engage their senses in a holistic way, even in the absence of traditional perfumes.",
    "**Scented Clothing**: Innovate clothing made from natural fibers infused with aromatic plants. Fabrics could be treated with natural oils from eucalyptus, lavender, or cedar, allowing the scent to last longer. This concept would not only offer a way to wear pleasant scents but also promote sustainable fashion by using eco-friendly materials. The clothing could be designed to release fragrances over time, providing a continuous sensory experience.",
    "**Personal Scent Diffusers**: Design small, portable diffusers that can be filled with natural materials like dried flowers, spices, or essential oils. These diffusers could be worn as jewelry or carried as accessories, allowing individuals to personalize their scent experience throughout the day. Users could refill their diffusers with different combinations of natural materials, allowing for a variety of scent options based on mood or occasion."
