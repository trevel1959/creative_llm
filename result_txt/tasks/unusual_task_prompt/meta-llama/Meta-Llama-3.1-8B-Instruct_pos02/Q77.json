    "A **Magnetic Mirror**: A device that can reflect light and magnetic fields, allowing users to manipulate magnetic objects in mid-air. This device could be used for entertainment, education, or even in industries like manufacturing or healthcare. Imagine being able to create 3D sculptures with magnets, or using it to study the behavior of magnetic fields in a controlled environment.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Contact lenses with integrated microchips and sensors that can monitor vital signs, provide augmented reality displays, or even project images onto surfaces. These lenses could revolutionize the way we interact with information, allowing users to access virtual displays, receive notifications, or even control devices with their thoughts.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: A device that can extract clean water from the air, even in arid environments, using advanced nanotechnology and condensation techniques. This invention could provide clean drinking water for communities in need, reduce waste, and help mitigate the effects of climate change.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Robotics**: Robots that mimic the movement and agility of animals, such as birds, insects, or even fish. These robots could be used for search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, or even in medical research. Imagine robots that can navigate through tight spaces, climb walls, or even fly through the air.",
    "**Neuro-Feedback Headband**: A wearable device that uses EEG sensors and AI-powered algorithms to monitor and control brain activity, helping users manage stress, anxiety, or even enhance cognitive performance. This device could be used in therapy, education, or even in professional sports to improve focus and concentration."
