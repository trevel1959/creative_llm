    "**Long-Term Consequences of Unchecked Population Growth**: With an extended lifespan, the human population could grow exponentially, leading to severe strain on resources, infrastructure, and the environment. This could result in widespread poverty, inequality, and social unrest. Governments and international organizations would need to adapt and implement sustainable solutions to manage the population growth and its impact.",
    "**Economic Shifts and Inequality**: A 500-year lifespan would create a new class of ultra-high-net-worth individuals who accumulate wealth over centuries, exacerbating income inequality. This could lead to a concentration of power and wealth among the elite, potentially destabilizing societies and economies. Governments might need to introduce policies to mitigate this effect, such as progressive taxation, inheritance laws, and social welfare programs.",
    "**Psychological and Sociological Impacts**: Living for 500 years would fundamentally change human relationships, social structures, and personal identity. People would experience multiple generations of family and friends, leading to complex emotional dynamics and potential psychological strain. This could result in a reevaluation of traditional social norms, family values, and community structures.",
    "**Technological Advancements and Obsolescence**: With centuries to innovate and adapt, humans might accelerate technological progress, leading to breakthroughs in fields like medicine, energy, and space exploration. However, this could also lead to rapid obsolescence of skills and knowledge, as new technologies emerge and older ones become outdated. Education systems and workforce development would need to adapt to keep pace with the changing job market.",
    "**Evolutionary Consequences**: A 500-year lifespan would allow humans to accumulate genetic mutations and adaptations over time, potentially leading to the emergence of new subspecies or even a new human species. This could raise questions about the ethics of genetic engineering, the definition of humanity, and the responsibility that comes with extended lifespan and potential evolutionary changes.
