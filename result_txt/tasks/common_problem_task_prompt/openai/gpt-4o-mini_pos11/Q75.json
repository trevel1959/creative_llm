    "**Wildlife Conflicts**: As more visitors flock to national parks, the chances of human-wildlife conflicts increase. Animals may become accustomed to human presence, leading to dangerous encounters. To mitigate this, educational programs could be established to inform visitors about wildlife behavior and safe practices, along with designated viewing areas to minimize close encounters.",
    "**Resource Management**: National parks often have limited resources for maintenance and conservation. This can lead to deteriorating facilities, trails, and habitats. A potential solution could involve the establishment of partnerships with local businesses and organizations to sponsor conservation efforts or adopt-a-trail programs, encouraging community involvement and funding.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems, outcompeting native flora and fauna. Park management can implement strict protocols for visitor activities, such as cleaning gear and equipment before entering the park, and conduct regular monitoring and removal of invasive species to protect the native biodiversity.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a significant threat to national parks, affecting weather patterns, water sources, and habitats. To combat this, park managers could develop a comprehensive climate adaptation plan that includes habitat restoration projects, monitoring of climate-related changes, and public awareness campaigns about the importance of climate action.",
    "**Infrastructure Strain**: The infrastructure within a national park, including roads, restrooms, and visitor centers, can become strained due to increased visitor numbers. This can lead to inadequate facilities and poor visitor experiences. A potential approach could be the development of eco-friendly infrastructure upgrades, such as composting toilets and solar-powered facilities, to improve sustainability while enhancing visitor comfort."
