    "**Canopy Bridge:** Create a canopy bridge using large leaves, branches, and ropes. Weave the branches together to create a stable walkway and use the leaves to provide shade and protection from the elements.",
    "**Raft and Paddle:** Construct a raft using logs and other materials. If you have access to a paddle or a piece of wood that can be shaped into a paddle, use it to propel yourself across the river."
