    "A world-wide amnesia epidemic would occur, leading to a complete loss of individual and collective memory. People would not remember their names, addresses, family members, or any other important information. This would lead to a complete breakdown of society as we know it, as people would be unable to function in their daily lives.",
    "People would have to rely solely on their instincts and physical abilities to survive. Without memory, people would not be able to recall important skills or knowledge that they have acquired over time, such as how to cook, drive, or read. This would lead to a very primitive way of life.",
    "There would be a rise in crime and chaos as people would not be able to remember the consequences of their actions. Without memory, people would not be able to learn from their mistakes or the mistakes of others, leading to a world where people would be more likely to commit crimes without fear of retribution.",
    "The loss of memory would also have a significant impact on mental health. Without memory, people would not be able to cope with the trauma and stress of their daily lives. This would lead to a rise in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.",
    "The world would be forced to adapt to a new way of functioning without memory. People would have to develop new ways of communicating and interacting with each other, as well as new ways of learning and acquiring knowledge. This would lead to a world where people would be more open-minded and adaptable, as they would have to rely on their instincts and physical abilities to survive."
