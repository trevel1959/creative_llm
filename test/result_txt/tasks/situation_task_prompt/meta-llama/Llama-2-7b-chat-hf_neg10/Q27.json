    "Thermal Blankets: Utilize thermal blankets to maintain a comfortable temperature. These blankets are designed to retain body heat and can be used to keep indoor spaces warm or cool. They are lightweight, portable, and can be easily distributed among occupants.",
    "Greenhouse Windows: Install greenhouse windows in place of regular windows to allow for natural ventilation and temperature regulation. Greenhouse windows are designed to allow sunlight to enter while keeping warm air inside and cool air outside, creating a more stable indoor temperature.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Implement evaporative cooling systems, such as misting fans or evaporative coolers, to cool indoor spaces. These systems use water to cool the air through evaporation, providing a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional air conditioning.",
    "Radiant Floor Heating: Install radiant floor heating systems that use warm water or electricity to heat the floor, rather than the air. This can help maintain a consistent temperature throughout the space and reduce the need for heating and cooling.",
    "Natural Ventilation: Utilize natural ventilation techniques, such as opening windows and doors, to regulate indoor temperature. By strategically placing windows and doors, a natural ventilation system can be created that allows for efficient temperature regulation without the need for heaters or air conditioners."
