    "Bug Hotels: Build insect hotels using natural materials like twigs, leaves, and branches. These structures provide a safe haven for insects to live and thrive, reducing their presence in homes and gardens.",
    "Pheromone Traps: Develop pheromone-based traps that mimic the chemical signals insects use to communicate. By attracting the pests with these traps, they can be easily collected and removed without harming them.",
    "Underground Barriers: Create a network of underground barriers using non-toxic materials like clay and wax. These barriers would prevent insects from burrowing into homes and gardens, while allowing beneficial insects to pass through.",
    "Sonic Repellents: Develop devices that emit a high-frequency sound wave that is undetectable to humans but unpleasant for insects. These devices could be placed around homes and gardens to keep pests at bay.",
    "Insect-Friendly Crops: Breed crops that are less attractive to insects, such as using genetic modification or natural pest-repellent compounds. By growing these crops, farmers can reduce their reliance on pesticides and minimize the presence of pests in their fields."
