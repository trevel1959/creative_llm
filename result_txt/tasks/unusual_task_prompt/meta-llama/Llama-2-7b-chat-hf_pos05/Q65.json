    "AI-Powered Personalized Shopping Cart: Create an AI-powered shopping cart that learns the user's preferences and suggests relevant products based on their past purchases and browsing history. This feature would enhance the user experience by providing a more personalized shopping experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.",
    "Virtual Reality Try-On: Develop a virtual reality (VR) try-on feature that allows customers to try on clothes virtually before making a purchase. This feature would be particularly useful for clothing items that are difficult to return, such as lingerie or tailored suits. With VR try-on, customers can get a more accurate fit and feel without having to physically try on the item, reducing returns and increasing customer satisfaction.",
    "Augmented Reality Product Visualization: Create an augmented reality (AR) feature that allows customers to see how products would look in their own space before making a purchase. For example, customers could use AR to see how a piece of furniture would look in their living room or how a dress would look on them in front of a virtual mirror. This feature would help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and reduce the likelihood of buyer's remorse.",
    "Social Media Influencer Integration: Partner with social media influencers to showcase their personalized shopping carts on the platform. This feature would allow customers to see how their favorite influencers shop and make purchases, providing inspiration and ideas for their own shopping experiences. Influencers could also receive a commission for any purchases made through their personalized shopping cart, incentivizing them to promote the platform to their followers.",
    "Gamified Shopping Experience: Create a gamified shopping experience that rewards customers for completing certain tasks or achieving specific goals. For example, customers could earn points for completing a purchase, referring friends, or completing a product review. These points could be redeemed for discounts, free products, or other rewards, incentivizing customers to engage more with the platform and make more purchases."
