    "Modular Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that can be easily assembled and disassembled, allowing users to customize the size and configuration of their rack as needed. The rack could be made up of interlocking modules, each one holding a different number of hooks or shelves, allowing users to create a rack that fits their specific needs.",
    "Smart Coat Rack: Develop a coat rack that can track and organize items using RFID technology. Users can simply place their items on the rack, and the rack will automatically organize and categorize them based on their location and frequency of use. This would be especially useful for busy households with multiple people, as it would help to reduce clutter and make it easier to find items.",
    "Vertical Garden Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that doubles as a living wall. The rack could be designed with built-in planters, allowing users to grow herbs, succulents, or other plants on the rack itself. This would not only add a touch of greenery to any room, but also provide a unique and functional way to store coats and other items.",
    "Motion-Activated Coat Rack: Design a coat rack that can sense when someone is approaching and automatically opens or closes its doors to provide easy access to coats and other items. This would be especially useful in entryways or mudrooms, where it can be difficult to find the time or energy to hang up coats after a long day.",
    "Multifunctional Coat Rack: Create a coat rack that serves multiple purposes. For example, the rack could have a built-in shoe rack, a storage compartment for bags or briefcases, and even a small table or shelf for holding keys or other small items. This would provide a convenient and space-saving solution for people who need to store a variety of items in a small space."
