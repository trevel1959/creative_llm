    "**Built-in Mosquito Netting**: Design a sleeping bag with an integrated, retractable mosquito net that can be deployed when needed. This would be particularly useful for camping in areas with high insect populations, allowing for a peaceful night's sleep without the worry of bites.",
    "**Self-Inflating Pillow Compartment**: Incorporate a pocket in the sleeping bag that houses a self-inflating pillow. This compartment could be designed to fold out and inflate with a simple push or pull mechanism, providing head support without the need for carrying an extra pillow.",
    "**Multi-Function Zipper System**: Create a zipper system that allows the sleeping bag to be transformed into various configurations. For instance, it could zip apart to create two separate blankets, or zip together with another sleeping bag for couples or friends camping together. The zipper could also allow for ventilation at the feet or torso without fully unzipping.",
    "**Integrated Sleep Tracker**: Equip the sleeping bag with a lightweight sleep tracker that monitors sleep patterns, temperature, and movement. This data could be synced to a smartphone app, providing insights into sleep quality and tips for improvement, making it a great tool for both casual campers and serious outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Waterproof and Sandproof Bottom Layer**: Design the bottom layer of the sleeping bag with a waterproof and sandproof material. This would prevent moisture from the ground or sand from getting inside the bag, ensuring a dry and clean sleeping surface no matter the conditions."
