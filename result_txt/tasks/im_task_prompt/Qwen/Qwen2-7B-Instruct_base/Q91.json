    "**Interactive Luggage Tag**: This innovative luggage tag integrates a QR code or NFC technology, allowing it to be scanned by a smartphone. Once scanned, it provides real-time tracking of your luggage through an app, showing its location in airports or hotels. It also includes an emergency contact feature, which can be activated if you lose your luggage or are separated from it.",
    "**Personalized Pet Luggage Tag**: Design a series of luggage tags that not only have a pet's name and owner's contact information but also include a small picture or a description of the pet on the back. This can be particularly useful when pets are traveling with their owners. The idea is to create a more personalized experience for both the pet and the owner, making it easier to locate lost pets at airports or other travel destinations.",
    "**Sustainable Luggage Tag**: Develop a luggage tag made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastics, cork, or biodegradable materials. This tag would not only serve its functional purpose but also promote environmental responsibility. Additionally, it could include a message or slogan encouraging sustainable practices, acting as a subtle form of advertising for eco-conscious brands or campaigns.",
    "**Thermal Luggage Tag**: Create a smart luggage tag that includes temperature sensors. If the temperature inside the luggage exceeds a certain threshold (for example, too hot or too cold), the tag will send an alert to the userâ€™s phone. This is particularly useful for protecting delicate items like electronics or food during long trips or extreme weather conditions.",
    "**Smart Locking Luggage Tag**: This tag integrates with a smart lock system that can be controlled via an app. Users can lock their luggage and set a password or a PIN, ensuring that the tag and the contents remain secure. The tag can also send alerts to the user's phone if the luggage is moved without authorization, providing an additional layer of security for valuable items. "
