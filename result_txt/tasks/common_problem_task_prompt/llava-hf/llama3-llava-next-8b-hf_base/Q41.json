    "Radiation Exposure: Space is a harsh environment with high levels of radiation that can damage electronic components and pose a health risk to astronauts. Designing a shielding system is crucial, but finding materials that can protect the ship and its occupants for extended durations is a major challenge.",
    "Gravity and Airflow: In space, the lack of gravity can cause fluid dynamics to behave differently. The design should account for the consequences of these differences, including how air and gases flow within the ship.",
    "Materials Selection: Selecting suitable materials for construction, considering factors such as strength, weight, thermal conductivity, oxidation resistance, and compatibility with space environments is critical. Finding materials that balance performance and cost is a challenge.",
    "Communication Systems: Establishing communication pathways between the spaceship and Earth is vital. The equipment should be designed for reliable and efficient communication, accounting for propagation delays in space.",
    "Propulsion System: The propulsion system requires a reliable, powerful, and efficient means of propelling the ship. Developing an affordable and sustainable propulsion technology is a significant challenge."
