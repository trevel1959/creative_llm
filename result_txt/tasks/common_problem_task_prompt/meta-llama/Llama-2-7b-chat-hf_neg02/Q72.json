    "Floating Wind Turbine Power Plant: Instead of constructing traditional wind turbines on land, a floating wind turbine power plant could be built in the ocean or large lakes. This would allow for the harnessing of wind energy in areas with consistent wind speeds, such as offshore or near coastal regions. The floating turbines would be designed to withstand harsh marine environments and could be connected to underwater cables for transmission of electricity to the mainland. This innovative approach could help increase the global share of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.",
    "Solar-Powered Desalination Plant: A solar-powered desalination plant could be built in regions with high levels of sunlight and water scarcity. The plant would use solar panels to generate electricity, which would power a reverse osmosis system to desalinate seawater or brackish water. The resulting freshwater could be used for drinking, irrigation, and industrial purposes, providing a reliable and sustainable source of water for communities in need. This innovative solution could help address the global water crisis and promote sustainable development.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power Plant: A hydrogen fuel cell power plant could be built using a combination of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to produce hydrogen through electrolysis. The hydrogen would then be used to power fuel cells, which would generate electricity with zero emissions. This innovative approach could help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and provide a clean and reliable source of energy for industries and transportation.",
    "Biomass-Powered District Heating System: A biomass-powered district heating system could be built in urban areas to provide heating and hot water to residential and commercial buildings. The system would use biomass waste, such as agricultural waste or waste from industrial processes, to generate heat through combustion or anaerobic digestion. The heat would be distributed through a network of insulated pipes, providing efficient and sustainable heating to the surrounding community. This innovative solution could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable waste management.",
