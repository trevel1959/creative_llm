    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a bicycle with a modular frame that allows users to easily swap out components such as wheels, handlebars, and seats. This would cater to different riding styles and preferences. For instance, a commuter could switch to wider tires for stability on city streets, while a mountain biker could opt for rugged tires and a shock-absorbing seat. The modular parts could be designed to snap on and off quickly, promoting easy customization.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Solar-Powered Features**: Construct the bicycle using sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled aluminum. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the frame to power built-in lights and charging ports for devices. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the bike but also enhances safety with lights powered by renewable energy, and allows cyclists to charge their phones during long rides.",
    "**Automatic Gear Shifting System**: Develop a bicycle equipped with an automatic gear shifting system that adjusts based on terrain and rider effort. Utilizing sensors to detect incline and speed, the bike would seamlessly shift gears to optimize performance without requiring manual adjustments. This feature would be particularly beneficial for urban riders navigating hilly areas or those who may struggle with traditional gear systems.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Innovate a bicycle with advanced safety features such as built-in collision detection and warning systems. Using sensors, the bike could alert the rider to potential hazards or vehicles approaching from behind. Additionally, a smart helmet could be designed to communicate with the bike, providing turn signals through LED lights on the back of the helmet, ensuring better visibility and communication with drivers.",
    "**Multi-Functional Storage Solutions**: Design a bicycle with integrated storage compartments that serve multiple purposes. For example, the bike could have a detachable front basket that transforms into a backpack, or a rear rack that doubles as a portable picnic table. These storage solutions would be designed to be lightweight and easy to remove, making them practical for everyday use while enhancing the bike's functionality."
