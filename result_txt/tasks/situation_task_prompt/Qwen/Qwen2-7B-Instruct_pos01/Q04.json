    "**Bioengineering Trees**: Develop genetically modified trees that grow faster, have higher yields of timber or biofuel, and are more resilient to environmental stresses like drought and disease. These trees could be planted on a massive scale, potentially regenerating the lost forest resources within a few decades. The confidence score for this idea is 0.9 because it leverages current advancements in biotechnology.",
    "**Urban Forests and Vertical Gardens**: Transform urban areas into living ecosystems by installing vertical gardens, green roofs, and extensive urban forests. This not only provides habitats for wildlife but also helps in sequestering carbon, reducing urban heat islands, and improving air quality. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85 as it addresses the need for sustainable land use in densely populated areas.",
    "**Recycling Wood Products**: Implement a comprehensive recycling system for wood products, turning old buildings, furniture, and other wooden materials into new ones. This could include repurposing wood waste into biochar, which improves soil fertility and sequesters carbon. The confidence score for this idea is 0.75 because it focuses on utilizing existing resources more efficiently.",
    "**Smart Planting Algorithms**: Create an advanced AI system that optimizes tree planting based on geographical data, climate patterns, and local ecosystems. This algorithm could suggest the most suitable species for specific locations, ensuring the fastest possible reforestation while maintaining biodiversity. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8 as it utilizes technology to address environmental challenges effectively.",
    "**Innovative Tree Farming Techniques**: Introduce new farming techniques such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and vertical farming specifically designed for growing trees. These methods can increase productivity per unit area and reduce the dependency on land for reforestation. The confidence score for this idea is 0.8 because it adapts modern agricultural practices to forestry, which is a promising direction given the increasing global population."
