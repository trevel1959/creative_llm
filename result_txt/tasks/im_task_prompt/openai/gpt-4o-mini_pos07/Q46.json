    "**Integrated Safety Lock with LED Indicator**: Incorporate a safety lock mechanism that automatically engages when the scissors are not in use, accompanied by an LED indicator that lights up when the scissors are locked. This would prevent accidental cuts, especially in households with children. The LED could also serve as a battery indicator if the scissors have additional features, such as a built-in sharpener.",
    "**Dual-Function Blades**: Develop scissors with interchangeable blades that can switch between different cutting styles, such as straight, serrated, or decorative (zig-zag). This would allow users to easily adapt to various materials and projects without needing multiple tools. The blade change could be as simple as pressing a button or twisting a dial.",
    "**Smart Scissors with Built-in Measuring Tool**: Create a pair of scissors equipped with a digital measuring tool that displays measurements on a small screen. Users could set the desired length, and the scissors would provide a visual guide or beep when the cut reaches the specified measurement. This would be particularly useful for crafting, sewing, or any precision cutting tasks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Recyclable Parts**: Redesign scissors using biodegradable and sustainable materials, such as plant-based plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, incorporate a take-back program where users can return old scissors for recycling or refurbishing, promoting environmental responsibility and reducing waste.",
    "**Multi-Purpose Scissors with Attachments**: Create a base pair of scissors that can accommodate various attachments for additional functionalities, such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, or a mini ruler. Users could easily switch out attachments based on their current needs, making these scissors a versatile tool for home, office, or outdoor activities."
