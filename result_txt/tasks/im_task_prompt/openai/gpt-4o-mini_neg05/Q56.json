    "**LED Notification Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that incorporates LED lights that flash when the bell is rung. This would not only provide an auditory signal but also a visual cue, making it easier for pedestrians and other cyclists to notice the rider. The LED lights could be programmed to change colors based on the time of day or the weather conditions, enhancing visibility.",
    "**Integrated Horn and Bell Combo**: Design a dual-function bell that combines a traditional bell sound with a horn. Riders could use the bell for casual notifications and the horn for more urgent alerts. The horn could have different sound options (like a car horn or a train whistle) that can be easily toggled, providing versatility for various riding situations.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that is powered by a small solar panel. This bell would charge during the day while the bike is parked and would not require batteries, making it environmentally friendly. It could also include a small LED light that activates when the bell is used, providing additional safety for night riding.",
    "**Voice-Activated Bell**: Innovate a voice-activated bicycle bell that responds to simple commands like “ring” or “alert.” This would allow riders to keep their hands on the handlebars while still being able to alert others. The bell could also have a built-in microphone that recognizes commands in different languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.",
    "**Multi-Functional Bell with Navigation Alerts**: Create a bicycle bell that doubles as a navigation assistant. By integrating GPS technology, the bell could emit different sounds or tones based on the rider’s route or upcoming turns. For example, a gentle chime could indicate a left turn, while a more urgent sound could signal a right turn, helping cyclists navigate without having to look at their phones."
