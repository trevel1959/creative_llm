    "**Create a Homemade Fire Extinguisher:** Gather materials such as soda cans, baking soda, and water. Crush the soda can to create a small opening, then fill it with half baking soda and half water. Seal the can with duct tape, poke a few holes in the side for powder release, and you have a makeshift fire extinguisher. The baking soda works as an insulator, preventing the fire from spreading, while the water cools down the heat.",
    "**Design a Smoke-Resistant House:** Build your home with non-flammable materials like concrete or steel. Ensure that all windows and doors are fitted with fire-resistant glass and steel frames. Use thick insulation and fireproof roofing materials to minimize the risk of fire spread. This strategy requires substantial upfront investment but offers long-term safety.",
    "**Install Water Tanks and Pipes Throughout Your Home:** Equip your house with a comprehensive water distribution system, including pipes connected to water tanks on higher floors. In case of a fire, you can direct water from these tanks to any part of your home, helping to extinguish flames and cool down hot spots. This setup requires careful planning and professional installation.",
    "**Develop a Personalized Evacuation Plan:** Since fire-fighting equipment is unavailable, focus on creating a well-thought-out evacuation plan. Designate safe meeting points outside your home, practice the plan with family members, and ensure everyone knows what to do during an emergency. Consider having a list of emergency contacts and a clear understanding of escape routes.",
    "**Utilize Natural Fire Suppressants:** Create a barrier around your home using natural fire suppressants such as sand, dirt, or specially formulated fire retardant. Spread these materials in areas prone to fire hazards, like near woodpiles or dry grass. These barriers can slow down or prevent the spread of fire until you can evacuate or take other necessary actions. "
