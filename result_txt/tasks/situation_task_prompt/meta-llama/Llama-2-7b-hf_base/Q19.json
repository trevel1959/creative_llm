    "Halt production of excess mucus. It could be related to overeating and dehydration, and it's excess of course increases congestion along with inflamed drain pipes (sinuses). It seems reasonable with good diet then that drinking as best as possible would slow mucus production and allow our immune system to more aggresively combat the actual cold since mucus and congestion tends to act as a shield of sorts against the body, allowing the foreign bacteria to remain in their \"safe haven\" behind which the body will be unable to destroy them or weaken their effects. Thus reducing one of our symptoms (namely congestion) will make all remaining symptoms easier to deal with and eliminate in turn.",
    "Exercise. Exersise makes us sweat more than most things we consume. Exercising will increase our respiration and cause our body to breakthrough more water, therefore increasing its' temperature and ability to destroy bacteria or lower its rate of reproduction.",
    "Consume the perfect amount of saline water which reduces pressure at our body, especially at our lungs by filling our lung space and reducing air consumption without affecting breathing depth which increases infection in a lung that is constricted because its unable to expel exhasive fluids, as it should. Drinking the perfect amount of saline will keep this from happening.",
    "Wear sun glasses during day/ outdoor time. Darkness has no effect on bacterial infections of the cold. So darkness is counterproductive in our efforts to recover while light has the opposite effect. Wearing sunglasses during the day allows the light to reach the inner most layers of a sick body, while the glasses protect our eyes. Since there are also certain medicaments that do their best under specific light conditions this would also help us.",
    "Increase warmth and dry our skin. Dry skin reduces congestion while a dry skin surface allows our heatersystem and our immune sysem to better destroy bacteria of the cold. Heavyladen clothes, extra layers as well as avoiding moist areas, such as bath rooms tend to prolong effects and cause further discomfort, possibly even creating health issues such as sore throats because of cold and water. So take a nice sunshine walk as your last catharsis for the cold."
