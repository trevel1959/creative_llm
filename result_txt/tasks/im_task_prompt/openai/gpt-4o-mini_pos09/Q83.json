    "**Modular Cart Design**: Introduce a modular shopping cart that can be adjusted based on the size of the shopping trip. For small trips, users can detach sections of the cart, making it more compact and easier to maneuver. For larger trips, they can add additional sections or even stackable baskets that can hold more items without compromising stability.",
    "**Built-in Payment System**: Enhance the shopping cart with a built-in payment system that allows users to scan items as they place them in the cart. At checkout, they can simply push a button to complete the transaction, eliminating the need for waiting in long lines. This feature could be paired with a digital receipt sent directly to their mobile device.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cart Materials**: Develop shopping carts made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the cart's handle to power a small LED light for nighttime shopping, or to charge devices like smartphones, making it both eco-friendly and functional.",
    "**Health and Wellness Tracker**: Equip the shopping cart with sensors that can track the nutritional value of items placed inside. Users could receive real-time feedback on their purchases, including calorie counts and dietary suggestions based on their shopping habits. This feature could also sync with a mobile app that tracks health goals and provides personalized meal plans.",
    "**Customizable Cart Accessories**: Create a line of customizable accessories for shopping carts, such as detachable cup holders, snack trays, or even small portable coolers for perishable items. Users could personalize their carts based on their shopping style and needs, making the shopping experience more enjoyable and tailored."
