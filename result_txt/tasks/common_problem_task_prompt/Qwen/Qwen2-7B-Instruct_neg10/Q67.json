    "**Water Management Challenges**: Organic farming often requires more water than conventional methods due to the need for crop rotation, natural pest control, and maintaining soil health. Identifying sustainable water sources, developing irrigation systems that conserve water, and implementing efficient water usage practices are critical challenges.",
    "**Pest and Disease Control**: Without synthetic pesticides, organic farmers must rely on natural methods to manage pests and diseases. Strategies like crop rotation, companion planting, and biological controls (using beneficial insects) can be effective but require careful planning and continuous monitoring to ensure they work effectively.",
    "**Soil Health Maintenance**: Building and maintaining healthy soil is essential in organic farming. Farmers need to implement practices like cover cropping, composting, and minimizing tillage to improve soil structure, nutrient content, and water retention. Ensuring these practices are sustainable over time can be challenging.",
    "**Market Access and Consumer Education**: Organic products often command premium prices but face barriers in reaching consumers. Establishing reliable markets, educating consumers about the benefits of organic produce, and overcoming skepticism about organic food quality are significant challenges.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Organic farming can be less profitable due to higher initial costs and lower yields compared to conventional farming. Managing finances by securing grants, loans, and seeking investment opportunities, while balancing expenses with revenue, is crucial for long-term success."
