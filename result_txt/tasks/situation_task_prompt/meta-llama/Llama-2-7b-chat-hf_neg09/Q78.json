    "Nature-based Play: Without toys, children could engage in nature-based play, using elements of their surroundings to create their own playthings. For example, they could use sticks to build structures, rocks to create patterns, and leaves to make crowns. This type of play would encourage creativity, problem-solving, and a deeper connection with nature.",
    "Imaginative Storytelling: Without toys, children could use their imaginations to create stories and characters, and act them out through role-playing. They could use their bodies, faces, and voices to bring their stories to life, and invent new games and challenges for themselves. This type of play would foster creativity, emotional intelligence, and social skills.",
    "Collaborative Building: Without toys, children could work together to build their own play spaces using materials like cardboard, fabric, and other recycled materials. They could create their own playgrounds, with ramps, tunnels, and other structures that encourage physical activity and creativity. This type of play would promote teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.",
    "Sensory Play: Without toys, children could engage in sensory play, using their senses to explore and experience the world around them. They could play with different textures, smells, and sounds, and create their own sensory experiences using household items like rice, beans, and sand. This type of play would help children develop their sensory awareness and fine motor skills.",
    "Music and Dance: Without toys, children could use music and dance to create their own playthings. They could use household items like pots, pans, and wooden spoons to create their own instruments, and use their bodies to create rhythms and melodies. This type of play would foster creativity, self-expression, and physical coordination."
