    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is essential for preserving perishable foods. Without electricity, people will face difficulties in keeping food fresh, leading to spoilage and waste. This could result in food insecurity, especially for families relying on perishable items, and may necessitate a shift to a diet consisting of non-perishable foods, which may not be nutritionally balanced.",
    "**Healthcare Access and Medical Needs**: Many medical devices, such as oxygen concentrators, insulin refrigerators, and other life-sustaining equipment, require electricity. Patients with chronic conditions may face health crises if they cannot access necessary medical care or if their devices fail. Additionally, without electricity, healthcare facilities may struggle to operate efficiently, leading to compromised patient care.",
    "**Water Supply and Sanitation Issues**: In many areas, electricity powers water pumps and treatment facilities. A lack of electricity could disrupt the water supply, making it difficult for residents to access clean drinking water. Furthermore, sanitation systems may fail, leading to hygiene issues and increased risk of waterborne diseases, creating a public health crisis.",
    "**Increased Security Risks**: With no electricity, homes and neighborhoods may become more vulnerable to crime. Security systems that rely on electricity will be inoperative, and street lighting will be absent, creating dark areas that could facilitate criminal activity. This may lead to increased fear and anxiety among residents, impacting their sense of safety.",
    "**Impact on Education**: Students rely on electricity for online learning, studying with digital resources, and conducting research. Without access to electronic devices and the internet, education can be severely disrupted. This could lead to learning gaps, especially for students in higher grades who require access to specific educational materials and resources for their coursework."
