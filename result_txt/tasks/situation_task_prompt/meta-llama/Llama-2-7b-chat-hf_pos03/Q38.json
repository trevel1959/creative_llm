    "Use plants for cleaning: One creative solution to maintain hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to use plants as natural cleaning agents. For example, baking soda and lemon juice can be used to clean surfaces, while tea tree oil has antibacterial properties that can be used to disinfect surfaces. Other plants like lavender and chamomile can be used to create natural disinfectant sprays.",
    "Create a water filtration system: With the absence of soap and cleaning products, a water filtration system can be used to purify water for drinking and cleaning purposes. This can be achieved by using a combination of sand, activated charcoal, and other natural materials to filter out impurities and bacteria from water.",
    "Use solar power for cleaning: Another creative solution is to use solar power to generate electricity for cleaning purposes. This can be achieved by using solar-powered water purifiers that can purify water using UV light, or by using solar-powered cleaning tools like robotic vacuum cleaners that can clean floors and surfaces without the need for electricity.",
    "Create a composting toilet: With the absence of soap and cleaning products, a composting toilet can be used to dispose of human waste in a hygienic and sustainable way. Composting toilets use natural processes to break down human waste into compost, which can then be used as fertilizer for plants. This eliminates the need for toilet paper and reduces the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of.",
    "Use sound waves for cleaning: Finally, a creative solution to maintain hygiene without soap and cleaning products is to use sound waves to clean surfaces. This can be achieved by using a device that emits high-frequency sound waves that can dislodge dirt and grime from surfaces, leaving them clean and hygienic. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we clean in the future."
