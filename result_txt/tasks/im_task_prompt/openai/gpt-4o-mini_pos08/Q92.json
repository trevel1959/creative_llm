    "**Multi-Functional Wine Tool**: Design a wine opener that combines multiple functions, such as a corkscrew, foil cutter, and wine aerator in one compact device. This all-in-one tool would eliminate the need for multiple gadgets, making it easier for wine enthusiasts to carry and use, especially during picnics or travel.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adaptive Grip**: Create a wine opener with an ergonomic design that features an adaptive grip, allowing users to adjust the handle size according to their hand size or grip strength. This would make it accessible for people with arthritis or reduced hand strength, ensuring everyone can enjoy their favorite bottle of wine without discomfort.",
    "**Self-Pulling Corkscrew**: Innovate a self-pulling corkscrew that uses a battery-powered mechanism to extract the cork with minimal effort. With just the press of a button, the opener would grip the cork and pull it out smoothly, making it an ideal choice for those who struggle with traditional manual openers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a wine opener made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in wine-related products, while also maintaining durability and functionality.",
    "**Built-in Wine Preserver**: Design a wine opener that includes a built-in vacuum seal or wine preserver. After opening the bottle, the device could create a vacuum seal to preserve the remaining wine, extending its shelf life and ensuring that users can enjoy the wine over several days without losing flavor."
