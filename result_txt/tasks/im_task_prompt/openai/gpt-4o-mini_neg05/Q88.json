    "**Adjustable Grip and Length**: Design ski poles with an ergonomic grip that can be adjusted based on the skier's hand size and preference. The length of the poles could also be adjustable on-the-fly with a simple locking mechanism, allowing skiers to easily switch between different terrains or styles of skiing without needing tools.",
    "**Integrated Avalanche Safety Features**: Incorporate a beacon and avalanche probe into the ski poles. This would provide skiers with a way to signal for help in case of an avalanche and offer a quick way to probe the snow for buried victims. The poles could also have a detachable section that functions as a shovel, making them multifunctional for safety.",
    "**Shock Absorption Technology**: Develop ski poles with built-in shock absorption systems that reduce the impact on the skier's wrists and arms during descents. This could be achieved through a spring mechanism or a material that absorbs vibrations, making skiing more comfortable and reducing fatigue over long periods.",
    "**Built-in Lighting**: Equip ski poles with LED lights at the tips or handles that can be activated for night skiing or low-visibility conditions. These lights could be adjustable in brightness and color to suit different environments, ensuring that skiers remain visible and can see their surroundings better.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create ski poles from sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics, emphasizing environmental responsibility. Additionally, these poles could be designed for easy disassembly, allowing for repairs or upgrades instead of complete replacements, thus reducing waste."
