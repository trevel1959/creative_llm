    "**Floating Coral Reef Islands**: Design a habitat consisting of floating islands made from recycled materials that mimic coral reefs. These islands would host diverse marine life and be anchored to the ocean floor, providing stability. Each island could be tailored to support different species, such as fish, sea turtles, and seabirds. The structure would include underwater tunnels for marine animals to travel between islands and a network of above-water perches for birds. This habitat would promote biodiversity while also serving as a sustainable solution to rising sea levels.",
    "**Underground Oasis**: Create an underground habitat that mimics a desert oasis, complete with artificial sunlight, water features, and a variety of plant life. This habitat would allow for species that are typically found in arid environments to thrive in a controlled setting. The underground environment would be climate-controlled, ensuring a consistent temperature and humidity level. The oasis would have reflective surfaces to mimic sunlight and provide plants with the necessary light for photosynthesis. Species such as desert foxes, reptiles, and unique desert plants could coexist, creating a dynamic ecosystem.",
    "**Vertical Jungle Towers**: Design towering vertical jungles that rise high above the ground, featuring multiple layers of plant life and habitats for different species. Each level of the tower would replicate various jungle ecosystems, from the forest floor to the canopy. Animals such as monkeys, birds, and insects would inhabit different levels, promoting interaction and movement between species. The towers would be equipped with climbing structures, bridges, and zip lines for animals to navigate, encouraging natural behaviors and social interactions.",
    "**Arctic Biome Dome**: Construct a massive dome that replicates an Arctic environment, complete with ice formations, snow, and cold-water pools. The habitat would include climate-controlled zones that simulate seasonal changes, allowing animals like polar bears, seals, and arctic foxes to experience natural behaviors. The dome would also feature educational areas for visitors to learn about climate change and its impact on polar ecosystems. Interactive displays could allow guests to see how animals adapt to extreme cold and changing environments.",
    "**Subterranean Aquatic World**: Envision a habitat that combines land and water in an underground setting, where animals can transition between both environments. This habitat would feature a network of tunnels filled with water, creating a unique ecosystem for amphibians, fish, and small mammals. Above the water, lush vegetation would provide shelter and food for various species. The subterranean world would be illuminated with natural light through skylights, allowing for a diverse range of plant life and fostering a unique balance between aquatic and terrestrial animals."
