The clothing line would be a fun and creative way to showcase the versatility of bricks and inspire people to think outside the box.",
    "Brick-based Games: Develop a board game or card game that incorporates bricks as a central theme. Players would have to strategically place and remove bricks to achieve their goals, and they would learn important skills like problem-solving and critical thinking along the way.",
