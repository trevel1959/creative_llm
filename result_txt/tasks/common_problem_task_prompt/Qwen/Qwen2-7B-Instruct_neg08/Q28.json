    "**Insufficient Infrastructure**: Another problem might be the lack of adequate infrastructure to support a city-wide recycling initiative. This includes the need for sufficient recycling collection points, recycling facilities with the capacity to handle the expected volume, and transportation systems to move recyclable materials efficiently.",
    "**Financial Constraints**: Funding for a city-wide recycling initiative might be limited, making it difficult to implement all necessary components effectively. This could include costs associated with education, infrastructure, staffing, and ongoing operations.",
    "**Inadequate Policy Support**: Without strong policy support from local governments, the initiative might face challenges in terms of regulation, enforcement, and incentives for participation.",
    "**Behavioral Resistance**: Some residents might resist the idea of recycling due to personal convenience, cost, or skepticism about its effectiveness. Overcoming these barriers requires addressing concerns directly and highlighting the benefits of recycling, such as environmental conservation, reduced waste, and economic opportunities.",
    "**Recycling Contamination**: Contamination occurs when non-recyclable materials are mixed with recyclables, making it difficult for recycling facilities to process the materials effectively. This can lead to increased costs and lower quality of recycled products."
