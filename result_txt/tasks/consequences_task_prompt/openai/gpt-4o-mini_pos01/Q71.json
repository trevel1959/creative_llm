    "**Economic Impact**: The economy could experience drastic changes. Industries that rely on constant turnover, such as healthcare and funeral services, might collapse, while others, like technology and entertainment, could flourish as people seek new experiences and innovations. Additionally, the concept of wealth accumulation could shift dramatically; if people live forever, the rich might become infinitely richer, leading to a stark divide between the wealthy and the poor.",
    "**Psychological Consequences**: The mental health implications of immortality could be profound. While some might revel in eternal life, others could experience existential crises, boredom, or depression. The inability to escape life’s hardships could lead to an increase in mental health issues, prompting a need for new therapeutic approaches and support systems tailored for individuals facing eternal existence.",
    "**Cultural Evolution**: Immortality could lead to significant cultural shifts. Art, literature, and philosophy might evolve to reflect the new human experience. Artists could explore themes of eternal love, the weight of time, and the meaning of existence in a world where life is limitless. Additionally, cultural practices surrounding death and mourning would likely change, as the concept of loss becomes less relevant.",
    "**Environmental Challenges**: With an immortal population, the strain on Earth’s resources could intensify. Overpopulation could lead to increased pollution, depletion of natural resources, and habitat destruction. This could necessitate drastic measures to manage resources sustainably, potentially leading to conflicts over land, water, and food. Society may need to prioritize environmental conservation and develop new technologies to support a larger, immortal population.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: The advent of immortality would raise numerous ethical questions. Issues such as access to immortality (who gets it and who doesn’t), the implications of overpopulation, and the potential for immortality to be weaponized or commodified could lead to significant moral debates. Society would need to navigate the complexities of equality, justice, and the value of life in a world where death is no longer a natural conclusion."
