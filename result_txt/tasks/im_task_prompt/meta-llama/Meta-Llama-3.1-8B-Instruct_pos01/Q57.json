    "**Ergonomic Evolution**: Design a computer mouse with a built-in, AI-powered ergonomic assistant that adjusts the mouse's shape and size to fit the user's hand perfectly. The assistant would use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's hand shape, grip style, and movement patterns, and make real-time adjustments to the mouse's design to prevent fatigue, discomfort, and repetitive strain injuries. This innovative design would revolutionize the way we interact with computers and promote healthier working habits.",
    "**Smart Surface**: Create a computer mouse that doubles as a smart surface, allowing users to interact with their computer using gestures, touch, and even handwriting. The mouse would feature a high-resolution touchscreen display, advanced gesture recognition, and a stylus for precise input. This smart surface would enable users to work more efficiently, access information quickly, and even create digital art and documents with ease.",
    "**Haptic Feedback**: Develop a computer mouse that provides immersive haptic feedback, simulating the sensation of clicking, scrolling, and interacting with virtual objects. The mouse would use advanced actuators and sensors to create a realistic tactile experience, allowing users to feel the texture, weight, and resistance of virtual objects. This innovative design would enhance the sense of presence and immersion in virtual environments, making gaming and interactive experiences more engaging and realistic.",
    "**Wireless Charging**: Design a computer mouse that features built-in wireless charging, allowing users to charge their mouse without the need for cables or docking stations. The mouse would use advanced wireless charging technology, such as Qi or resonant charging, to recharge its battery from a distance. This convenient feature would reduce clutter, increase mobility, and provide a seamless user experience.",
    "**Environmental Awareness**: Create a computer mouse that incorporates environmental awareness features, such as air quality monitoring, noise pollution tracking, and energy consumption analysis. The mouse would use sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor the user's surroundings and provide real-time feedback on environmental factors. This innovative design would raise awareness about environmental issues, promote sustainable practices, and encourage users to make eco-friendly choices."
