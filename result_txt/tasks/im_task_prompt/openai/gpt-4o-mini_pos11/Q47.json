    "**Multi-Surface Adaptability**: Design a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable cleaning heads that can easily switch between different surfaces such as hardwood, carpet, tile, and upholstery. Each head could have specialized bristles and suction settings tailored to the surface type, ensuring optimal cleaning performance. This feature would allow users to clean their entire home with one device, enhancing convenience and efficiency.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning function where the vacuum can automatically clean its filters and brushes after each use. This could involve a built-in cleaning station that uses water and a specialized cleaning solution to rinse and dry the components. By maintaining cleanliness, the vacuum would operate more efficiently and have a longer lifespan, reducing maintenance for the user.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Create a vacuum cleaner that utilizes sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies. For instance, the vacuum could be made from recycled plastics, and it could feature a low-energy motor that still provides powerful suction. Additionally, it could incorporate a built-in composting system for dust and debris collected, allowing users to contribute to a more sustainable environment.",
    "**Customizable Cleaning Modes**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a user-friendly app that allows for customizable cleaning modes based on specific needs. Users could set the vacuum to focus on pet hair removal, deep cleaning, or allergen reduction, adjusting suction power and brush speed accordingly. The app could also provide cleaning tips and reminders based on the user's cleaning habits.",
    "**Interactive Cleaning Assistant**: Integrate a voice-activated AI assistant into the vacuum cleaner, allowing users to control it through voice commands. The assistant could provide real-time feedback during cleaning, suggest cleaning schedules based on the userâ€™s routine, and even remind users to empty the dustbin or replace filters. This interactive feature would enhance user experience and convenience."
