The waves whispered secrets to him, revealing hidden treasures and lost cities beneath the surface. Each day, he explored the vibrant underwater world, befriending colorful fish and wise sea turtles. One day, he stumbled upon a mermaid in distress, trapped in a fishing net. Using his newfound abilities, Kai freed her, earning her gratitude.
