    "**Pest Infestation**: A common problem in backyard gardening is pest infestations, which can destroy plants. To mitigate this, gardeners can implement integrated pest management strategies, such as introducing beneficial insects (like ladybugs), using organic repellents, or setting up traps. Additionally, planting companion plants that deter pests can create a natural defense system.",
    "**Inadequate Sunlight**: Not all backyards receive the same amount of sunlight throughout the day. Some plants require full sun (6-8 hours), while others thrive in partial shade. Assessing the sunlight patterns in the garden area is essential. If certain spots are too shady, consider pruning nearby trees or selecting shade-tolerant plants that can flourish in lower light conditions.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Overwatering or underwatering can severely affect plant health. A garden with poor drainage may lead to root rot, while drought conditions can cause plants to wilt. To solve this, installing a drip irrigation system can provide consistent moisture levels. Additionally, using mulch can help retain soil moisture and reduce evaporation.",
    "**Invasive Species**: Certain plants may be invasive in your area, outcompeting native species and disrupting local ecosystems. Before planting, it's important to research which plants are considered invasive and avoid them. Instead, opt for native plants that are well-adapted to the local environment and can support local wildlife.",
    "**Seasonal Planting Confusion**: Timing is critical when it comes to planting. Many gardeners may plant too early or too late, leading to poor growth or crop failure. To address this, create a planting calendar based on local climate conditions and frost dates. This will help in determining the optimal times for sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings."
