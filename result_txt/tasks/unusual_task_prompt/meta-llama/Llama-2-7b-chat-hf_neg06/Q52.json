    "\"Miniature Marvels\": Create a series of miniature Matchbox cars that are not only replicas of popular vehicles but also functional in their own right. Each car could have a unique feature, such as a hidden compartment or a removable engine, that makes them fun to play with and collect.",
    "\"Matchbox Masterpieces\": Collaborate with a team of artists to create a line of Matchbox cars that are not only beautiful but also functional. Each car could be designed to resemble a famous work of art, such as the Mona Lisa or Starry Night, and could even come with a small canvas or painting surface for kids to create their own masterpieces.",
    "\"Matchbox Magic\": Develop a line of Matchbox cars that are not only toy cars but also magic tricks in disguise. Each car could have a hidden compartment or mechanism that allows kids to perform simple magic tricks, such as making a coin disappear or pulling a rabbit out of a hat.",
    "\"Matchbox Mashups\": Create a line of Matchbox cars that combine two or more different vehicles into one. For example, a car that is part sports car and part spaceship, or a car that is part police car and part fire truck. This would allow kids to imagine and create their own unique vehicles and play scenarios.",
    "\"Matchbox Mods\": Develop a line of Matchbox cars that allow kids to customize and modify their vehicles. Each car could come with a set of interchangeable parts, such as different wheels, spoilers, and decals, that kids can use to create their own personalized cars. This would encourage creativity and problem-solving skills, as kids would have to figure out how to combine the different parts to create their desired design."
