    "Digital recording: If paper were no longer available, the most logical solution would be to switch to digital recording. This could involve using electronic devices such as laptops, tablets, or smartphones to document important information. With the rise of cloud computing, data could be stored online and easily accessible from anywhere in the world.",
    "Holographic recording: Another option would be to use holographic technology to record important information. Holographic displays are capable of storing large amounts of data in a small space, and can be viewed from any angle. This technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and access information.",
    "3D printing: With the ability to create objects from digital files, 3D printing could be used to create physical copies of important documents. This technology is already being used in a variety of industries, and could be adapted for use in recording important information.",
    "Audio and video recording: If paper were no longer available, audio and video recording could be used to document important information. This could involve using smartphones or other devices to record audio and video, and then storing the files online or on a physical device.",
    "Morse code: If all else fails, Morse code could be used to communicate important information. This code uses a series of dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers, and can be transmitted using a variety of devices, including radios and computers. While it may not be as convenient as traditional methods of communication, it could be a useful tool in a world without paper."
