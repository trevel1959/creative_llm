    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback**: Integrate haptic feedback and auditory cues into the mouse to enhance user experience. For instance, when clicking or scrolling, the mouse could provide vibrations or sounds that mimic the action, giving users a more tactile and immersive experience. This feature would be particularly beneficial for gamers who rely on quick reactions and feedback during gameplay.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular mouse that allows users to swap out different components, such as buttons, scroll wheels, and sensors, to suit their specific needs. This would enable gamers to customize their mouse for different types of games or allow professionals to adjust the mouse for tasks like graphic design or data entry. Users could easily purchase and replace parts as technology advances or their preferences change.",
    "**Gesture Control Integration**: Incorporate gesture control technology into the mouse, allowing users to perform actions by moving their hands in specific patterns above the mouse. This could reduce repetitive strain injuries and make multitasking easier. For example, a simple swipe could switch between applications, or a circle motion could adjust volume levels.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a mouse made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials. By using plant-based plastics and recycled components, the mouse would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, a portion of the sales could be donated to environmental initiatives, encouraging users to make eco-friendly choices.",
    "**Built-in Wireless Charging**: Design a mouse with integrated wireless charging capabilities, eliminating the need for batteries or cables. Users could simply place the mouse on a designated charging pad when not in use. This would ensure that the mouse is always ready for use and reduce electronic waste from disposable batteries."
