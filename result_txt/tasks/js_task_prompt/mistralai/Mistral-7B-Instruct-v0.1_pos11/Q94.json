    "Energy Ball: A type of energy that is stored in small, spherical balls that can be used as a source of power. These energy balls can be charged by using solar panels or other renewable energy sources, and can be used to power small devices or even homes.",
    "Bio-Fuel: A type of energy that is generated from organic matter, such as plants or waste. This energy can be harnessed through processes such as pyrolysis or gasification, and can be used to power vehicles or generate electricity.",
    "Nuclear Fusion: A type of energy that is generated by combining atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat, which can be used to generate electricity.",
    "Quantum Energy: A type of energy that is generated by manipulating the properties of subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. This energy can be harnessed through processes such as quantum tunneling or quantum entanglement, and can be used to power small devices or even entire cities.",
    "Geothermal Energy: A type of energy that is generated by tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. This energy can be harnessed through processes such as steam turbines or binary cycle power plants, and can be used to generate electricity or heat for homes and businesses."
