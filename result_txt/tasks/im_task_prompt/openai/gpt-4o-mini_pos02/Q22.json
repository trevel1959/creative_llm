    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight with Battery Backup**:    Design a flashlight that incorporates solar panels for charging during the day. This eco-friendly flashlight could also include a rechargeable battery that stores energy for nighttime use. Additionally, it could feature a power bank function, allowing users to charge their devices in emergencies. This dual functionality would make it perfect for camping trips or outdoor adventures where access to electricity is limited.",
    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Built-In Tools**:    Develop a flashlight that integrates several essential tools into its design. This could include a small knife, screwdriver, bottle opener, and even a mini compass. The flashlight would have a modular design, allowing users to customize the tools they want to include based on their activities (e.g., hiking, camping, or emergency preparedness). This all-in-one tool would be especially appealing to outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "**Interactive Projection Flashlight**:    Create a flashlight that can project images or messages onto surfaces. This could be useful for presentations, guiding people in the dark, or even for entertainment purposes. The flashlight could connect to a smartphone app that allows users to upload images or text, which can then be projected. This feature would be especially valuable for educators, event planners, or those who want to leave messages in unique ways.",
    "**Modular Flashlight System**:    Introduce a flashlight system that allows users to customize the length, brightness, and beam type by interchanging different modules. For instance, users could attach a wide-angle lens for a broader beam or a focused lens for long-distance visibility. The flashlight could also have interchangeable battery packs with varying capacities, enabling users to tailor the flashlight to their specific needs, whether for a short outing or an extended camping trip.",
    "**Emergency Signal Flashlight**:    Design a flashlight that includes multiple emergency signaling features, such as an SOS strobe light, a red alert mode, and a sound alarm. The flashlight could automatically switch to these modes if it detects sudden movements or if the user presses a panic button. This feature would be invaluable for hikers, campers, or anyone who may find themselves in a dangerous situation, providing a way to signal for help."
