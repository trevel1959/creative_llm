    "People would also use gravity to pick things up, by standing on them or having them stuck to us and that could cause many injuries which could become more harmful.",
    "We might never see people fall when they are already standing on something.",
    "If someone wants to jump higher than ever before they would have to make their gravity stronger. But if that doesn’t work they would have to go around the world 18 times in their life in which we would never be able to fly back to our home cities or country! (That means we'd have to do the long way around through Asia and all the way down to South America on foot/running/hiking) In the summer days their gravity would go so strong!",
    "Because gravity could become optional we might not know the meaning of 'gravity'. When someone falls over we usually go there and hold them, why? Because we feel the weight of their body. Gravity could become optional, so we all have our own ability to use it or not use it. That leads to a situation: that doesn’t include us and leaves the other person, where you had to hold him/her at. We know the meaning of ‘grace’ now, but it wouldn't sound/feel as special, if it didn’t mean this anymore/wasn’t anymore 'God in space' as it sounds now. That might take it’s ability away.",
    "Because it becomes optional it could become free! Because gravity could possibly be something like money is today and not something that anyone who wants has to pay. The gravity then would have a negative effect and it could create another 'currency'. Gravity can also be a reason a person can go upward. If this happens, then people would only come/stay near flat lands or be able to get to the sea level, but if there would be rivers and roads near flatlands the whole civilazations of earth or the flat lands’ citizens could have a huge crisis of how a town would get people or things to other parts of the cities and when the time when they are running out of energy and they can no longer walk back home. But that’s when the people have another choice ‘flying’."
