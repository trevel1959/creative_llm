    "**Budget Constraints**: Managing the festival budget is crucial and can be a significant challenge. Costs can escalate quickly with venue rental, marketing, equipment rentals, and licensing fees for the films. Unexpected expenses, such as last-minute technical issues or increased costs for services, can put the festival in a financial bind. Fundraising and sponsorship may not meet expectations, leading to a compromised festival experience.",
    "**Film Selection and Curation**: Choosing the right films to showcase can be a double-edged sword. Thereâ€™s a risk of not appealing to the target audience or excluding important genres or filmmakers. Additionally, securing the rights to screen films can be complicated, especially for popular or independent films. If the selection process lacks transparency or inclusivity, it could lead to backlash from filmmakers and audiences alike.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the festival to attract attendees can be challenging. There may be competition from other local events, making it difficult to stand out. Moreover, if the marketing strategy does not resonate with the intended audience or utilize the right channels (social media, local press, etc.), ticket sales may suffer. Failure to build a strong online presence can limit outreach and awareness.",
    "**Volunteer and Staffing Issues**: Organizing a film festival often relies on a team of volunteers or part-time staff. Challenges may include recruiting reliable volunteers, managing schedules, and ensuring adequate training. High turnover rates or a lack of commitment can lead to operational inefficiencies, creating stress for the organizers and impacting the festival's overall execution.",
    "**Audience Engagement and Experience**: Ensuring a positive experience for festival-goers is essential. Problems can arise if the festival lacks engaging programming, such as Q&A sessions with filmmakers, workshops, or networking opportunities. Additionally, logistical issues like long lines, insufficient seating, or poor concession services can frustrate attendees, potentially discouraging them from returning in the future."
