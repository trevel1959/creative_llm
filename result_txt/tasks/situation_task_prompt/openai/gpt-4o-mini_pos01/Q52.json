    "**Fire Pit Cooking**: Create a fire pit using stones or bricks to contain the fire safely. Once the fire is going, you can use skewers or sticks to roast vegetables, meats, or fruits over the open flame. For more complex dishes, wrap food in large leaves (like banana leaves) and place them in the hot coals, allowing the food to steam and infuse with flavor.",
    "**Caveman Style Pit Cooking**: Dig a shallow pit in the ground, fill it with hot stones, and place your food wrapped in leaves or directly on the stones. Cover the pit with soil to trap the heat and steam. After several hours, unearth the pit to find a tender, flavorful meal. This method can be used for meats, root vegetables, and even breads made from foraged grains.",
    "**Fermentation**: Explore the art of fermentation to create meals without cooking. Gather vegetables, fruits, or grains and place them in jars with water and salt to create a brine. Let them sit for several days to weeks, allowing beneficial bacteria to transform the ingredients into tangy, flavorful dishes. For example, fermented cabbage can become sauerkraut, while cucumbers can turn into pickles.",
    "**Raw Food Preparation**: Embrace a raw food diet by utilizing fresh, uncooked ingredients. Create salads, smoothies, and wraps using a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. You can also marinate ingredients in acid (like lemon juice or vinegar) to enhance flavors and tenderize them without cooking.",
    "**Natural Heat Sources**: Use natural heat sources like hot springs, geothermal vents, or even heated rocks from a campfire. Place food wrapped in natural materials (like seaweed or large leaves) directly on the heated surface to cook. This method could also be applied to steam food using the steam from hot springs."
