    "Lack of funding: Developing a vaccine requires significant financial resources. Governments and private organizations may not have the funds to invest in the research and development process.",
    "Ethical considerations: Vaccines are often tested on human subjects, which raises ethical concerns about the use of human subjects in medical research.",
    "Time constraints: A new disease may be spreading rapidly, which means that there is a need for a vaccine to be developed quickly. However, the development process can be slow and may not be able to keep up with the speed of the disease.",
    "Distribution and accessibility: Once a vaccine is developed, it needs to be distributed and made accessible to the public. This can be a logistical challenge, particularly in remote or underdeveloped areas.",
    "Adverse reactions: Vaccines can cause adverse reactions, which can lead to legal and public relations issues."
