    "Design a satellite that can capture and store solar energy for use on Earth. This satellite can be placed in a stable orbit around the Earth and used to power remote locations or even entire cities with clean and renewable energy.",
    "Create a satellite that can detect and monitor air pollution in real-time. This satellite can collect data on air quality and transmit it back to Earth, allowing scientists to track pollution levels and take action to reduce them.",
    "Develop a satellite that can monitor natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. This satellite can provide real-time data and imagery to emergency responders, allowing them to quickly and effectively respond to these events.",
    "Create a satellite that can study the Earth's atmosphere and climate. This satellite can collect data on temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions, helping scientists to better understand the Earth's climate and its effects on the planet.",
    "Design a satellite that can help to detect and prevent space debris. This satellite can use advanced sensors and imaging technology to detect and track debris in space, helping to prevent collisions with other satellites and spacecraft."
