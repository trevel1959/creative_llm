    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that extracts water from the air, even in arid environments, and use it to generate electricity through hydrogen fuel cells. This would power electric vehicles, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. The device would work by condensing water vapor from the air, which would then be converted into hydrogen gas. This hydrogen would be used to fuel fuel cells, producing electricity to power electric vehicles.",
    "**Solar Roadways**: Design and implement a network of solar panels integrated into roads, highways, and parking lots. These solar panels would generate electricity, which would be stored in batteries and used to power electric vehicles. This would not only reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but also provide a sustainable source of energy for transportation.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Bacteria**: Harness the power of bio-luminescent bacteria to generate electricity. These bacteria would be used to produce electricity through a process called microbial fuel cells. The bacteria would break down organic matter, releasing electrons that would be used to generate electricity. This electricity would power electric vehicles, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses kinetic energy from the movement of vehicles to generate electricity. This would be achieved through piezoelectric materials or electromagnetic induction. The kinetic energy would be converted into electricity, which would be stored in batteries and used to power electric vehicles.",
    "**Advanced Nuclear Power**: Develop a new generation of nuclear reactors that are safer, more efficient, and produce less waste. These reactors would use advanced materials and designs to generate electricity, which would be used to power electric vehicles. This would provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy for transportation, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. [/INST] "
