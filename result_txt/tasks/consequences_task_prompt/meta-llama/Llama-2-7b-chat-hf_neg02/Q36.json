    "Reduced need for amputations: If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, the number of amputations performed in hospitals and clinics would significantly decrease. This would lead to a reduction in medical costs, as well as a decrease in the emotional and psychological toll on patients and their families.",
    "Enhanced military capabilities: Military personnel who lose limbs in combat could regenerate new ones, allowing them to return to duty more quickly and with greater mobility. This would give them a significant advantage on the battlefield, as they could recover from injuries more quickly and continue to fight more effectively.",
    "New forms of transportation: With the ability to regenerate limbs, humans could potentially develop new forms of transportation that utilize limbs as propulsion systems. For example, a person could regenerate a new limb that acts as a propeller, allowing them to swim or fly through the air. This could open up new possibilities for travel and exploration.",
    "Increased understanding of regeneration: By studying how starfish regenerate their limbs, scientists could gain a deeper understanding of the biological processes involved in regeneration. This could lead to new insights into the treatment of injuries and diseases in humans, as well as the development of new therapies and treatments.",
    "Ethical considerations: With the ability to regenerate limbs, there would be new ethical considerations to take into account. For example, would people with more wealth or social status be able to afford to regenerate more limbs than those with less? Would there be a limit to the number of limbs that could be regenerated? These questions would need to be addressed in order to ensure that the technology is used fairly and ethically."
