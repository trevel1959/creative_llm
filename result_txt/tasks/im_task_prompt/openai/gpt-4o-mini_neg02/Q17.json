    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a washing machine that integrates a compartment for eco-friendly, concentrated detergent pods. The machine would dispense the exact amount needed based on load size and soil level, reducing waste and promoting the use of environmentally safe cleaning products. This feature could also remind users to purchase more detergent when running low.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Drum Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum after each wash cycle. This would eliminate odors, reduce mold and mildew buildup, and keep the washing machine fresh without the need for chemical cleaners. Users could be notified when the self-cleaning cycle has been completed through a connected app.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional knobs and buttons with a full-color touchscreen interface that offers a more intuitive user experience. The screen could display tutorials, maintenance reminders, and customizable wash cycles. Users could even create and save their own wash programs, and the interface could provide visual feedback during the wash cycle.",
    "**Foldable and Compact Design**: Innovate a washing machine that can be folded down or reconfigured for compact living spaces. This machine could have a sleek design that allows it to fit into closets or under countertops when not in use. Additionally, it could have wheels for easy mobility, making it perfect for apartments or homes with limited laundry space.",
    "**Laundry Assistant Robot**: Integrate a small robotic assistant that helps with laundry tasks. This robot could sort clothes based on color and fabric type, transfer them from the washer to the dryer, and even fold clean clothes. It could be programmed with machine learning to adapt to the userâ€™s preferences over time, making laundry day more efficient and less tedious."
