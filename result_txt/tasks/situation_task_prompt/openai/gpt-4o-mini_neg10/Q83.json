    "**Sleep Pods with Time Capsules**: Imagine a futuristic sleep pod that allows individuals to enter a state of suspended animation during their designated sleep hours. These pods would be equipped with advanced technology to monitor the body’s needs, including temperature control, soundproofing, and a gentle rocking motion. Users could set their preferred sleep duration, and the pod would create a personalized environment that feels like a time capsule, allowing them to emerge feeling refreshed, regardless of the absence of night.",
    "**Sleep Routines with Natural Cues**: Without the night, we would need to establish new routines based on other natural cues. People could engage in a community-driven initiative where everyone participates in a synchronized \"wind-down\" hour. This could involve activities like yoga, meditation, or reading, where the community collectively engages in relaxing practices. At the end of this hour, a soft, calming sound would signal the start of sleep time, creating a communal rhythm that encourages restful sleep even in a constant daylight scenario.",
    "**Virtual Reality Dreamscapes**: To combat the lack of night-time, individuals could use virtual reality (VR) technology to create immersive dreamscapes. Users would wear VR headsets that transport them to serene environments, such as tranquil forests or peaceful beaches. These environments would be programmed with soothing sounds and visuals that mimic night-time, helping the brain relax and prepare for sleep. The experience could also include guided meditations or sleep stories, allowing users to escape into their dream worlds while their bodies rest.",
    "**Bioluminescent Sleep Aids**: Inspired by nature, create sleep aids that utilize bioluminescent materials. These could be pillows, blankets, or wall decorations that emit a soft, glowing light during the \"sleep\" hours. The glow would be gentle and soothing, resembling the light of the moon. This calming illumination would help signal to the brain that it's time to wind down, encouraging relaxation and sleep even in the absence of natural darkness.",
    "**Adaptive Sleepwear**: Develop sleepwear made from smart textiles that adapt to the wearer’s body temperature and light exposure. These garments would change color and texture based on the time of day, transitioning from breathable and cooling fabrics during the \"day\" to warmer, cozier materials at \"night.\" They could also feature embedded sensors that monitor sleep quality and provide feedback through a connected app, helping individuals optimize their sleep routines in a perpetual daylight environment."
