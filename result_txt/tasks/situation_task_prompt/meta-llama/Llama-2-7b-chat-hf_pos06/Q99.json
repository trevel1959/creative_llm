    "Shape and Form: One way to differentiate between objects would be by their shape and form. Even in a black and white world, objects would still have unique shapes and contours that could be used to identify them. For example, a round ball would be easily distinguishable from a flat pancake or a long, thin stick. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Texture: Another way to identify objects would be by their texture. Different materials have distinct textures that can be felt even in a black and white world. For instance, a rough, bumpy surface would be different from a smooth, glossy one. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Size and Proportion: Objects would still have different sizes and proportions, even in a black and white world. A small toy car would be different from a large building, and a tiny mouse would be distinct from a large cat. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Shadows and Reflections: The shadows and reflections of objects could also be used to differentiate between them. Even in a black and white world, shadows and reflections would still have unique shapes and patterns that could be used to identify objects. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Patterns and Markings: Many objects have unique patterns or markings that could be used to identify them. For example, a leopard's spots or a giraffe's distinctive patches would still be visible in a black and white world. (Confidence Score: 0.9)"
