    "Robotic Pollination: Create robots that can move from one flower to another, transferring pollen between them. These robots could be programmed to follow specific patterns or to learn from their environment.",
    "Hydroponic Pollination: Develop a hydroponic system that uses water to transport pollen between flowers. This system could be designed to mimic the natural process of pollination in aquatic plants.",
    "Magnetic Pollination: Create a device that uses magnetic fields to attract pollen and transfer it between flowers. This device could be placed near the flowers to facilitate pollination.",
    "Sonic Pollination: Develop a device that uses sound waves to transfer pollen between flowers. This device could be placed near the flowers to facilitate pollination.",
    "Thermal Pollination: Create a device that uses heat to facilitate pollination. This device could be placed near the flowers to warm them up and encourage pollination."
