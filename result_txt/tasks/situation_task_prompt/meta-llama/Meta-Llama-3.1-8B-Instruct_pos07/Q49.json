    "**Solar-Powered Fire Suppression System**: Develop a network of solar-powered water pumps and sprinkler systems that can be easily installed in homes. These systems would be connected to a central control unit, allowing homeowners to monitor and control the system remotely. In the event of a fire, the system would automatically activate, providing a rapid response to extinguish the flames.",
    "**Portable Fire Extinguisher with Integrated Air Purification**: Design a portable fire extinguisher that not only puts out fires but also removes toxic fumes and particles from the air. This device would use advanced nanotechnology to filter out pollutants, creating a safer environment for occupants to escape or for firefighters to enter.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Building Materials with Integrated Fire Suppression**: Develop new building materials that are inherently fire-resistant and can also release a fire-suppressing agent when exposed to high temperatures. These materials would be used for walls, ceilings, and other structural elements, providing an additional layer of protection against fires.",
    "**Fire-Drone System**: Deploy a fleet of drones equipped with water tanks, fire suppressants, or other extinguishing agents. These drones would be programmed to navigate through buildings and fight fires in hard-to-reach areas, reducing the risk of injury to firefighters and minimizing damage to property.",
    "**Smart Home Fire Detection and Response System**: Create an AI-powered system that integrates with a home's electrical and HVAC systems to detect early signs of a fire. The system would alert homeowners and emergency services, and automatically activate a fire suppression system or deploy a fire-drone to respond to the emergency. This system would also provide real-time monitoring and analysis to identify potential fire hazards and provide recommendations for mitigation.
