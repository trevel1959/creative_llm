    "Smart Clothes Hanger with Weight Sensors:** This innovative hanger would feature built-in weight sensors that detect the weight of the clothing hung on it. When the user hangs an item, the hanger would send a notification to a connected app, indicating how much weight is on the hanger. This could help users track their wardrobe usage, encourage them to wear underutilized pieces, and even suggest outfit combinations based on whatâ€™s been worn less frequently."
