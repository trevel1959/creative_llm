    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Gaining the support of the local community is crucial for the success of a nature conservation park. Potential issues may arise if the community feels excluded from the planning process or if they perceive the park as a threat to their livelihoods (e.g., land use for agriculture or tourism). Engaging with local stakeholders through meetings, workshops, and collaborative initiatives is essential to address concerns and foster a sense of ownership.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing sufficient funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant hurdle. Budget constraints may limit the ability to hire staff, conduct research, or implement conservation programs. Additionally, misallocation of resources could lead to inadequate facilities, insufficient enforcement of regulations, and a lack of educational programs for visitors.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Navigating the legal and regulatory landscape can pose a challenge when establishing a conservation park. This may involve obtaining permits, complying with environmental regulations, and addressing land ownership disputes. Any legal hurdles can delay the project and increase costs, potentially jeopardizing the park's establishment and long-term sustainability.",
    "**Visitor Management and Impact**: As the park attracts visitors, managing their impact on the environment becomes critical. Issues such as littering, trail erosion, and disturbance to wildlife can arise if visitor numbers are not regulated. Implementing visitor management strategies, such as designated trails, educational signage, and capacity limits, is essential to minimize negative effects while promoting responsible tourism.",
    "**Climate Change Adaptation**: The effects of climate change pose a significant risk to conservation efforts. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can alter habitats and species distributions. Developing adaptive management strategies that consider climate projections and promote resilience in ecosystems is vital for the long-term success of the park."
