    "**Adjustable Length Leash**: Design a leash that can be easily adjusted to different lengths depending on the environment. For example, it could extend up to 10 feet for open areas and retract to 3 feet for crowded spaces. This feature would provide flexibility and control, allowing owners to give their dogs more freedom in safe areas while keeping them close in busy environments.",
    "**Built-in Waste Bag Dispenser**: Create a leash that has a built-in compartment for waste bags, complete with a dispenser. This would ensure that dog owners are always prepared for clean-up during walks without having to carry a separate bag. The compartment could be designed to hold a roll of bags and have a small opening for easy access, making it convenient and practical.",
    "**Reflective and LED Lighting**: Incorporate reflective materials and LED lights into the leash for enhanced visibility during nighttime walks. This would increase safety for both the dog and the owner by making them more visible to passing cars and pedestrians. The lights could be set to different modes (steady, flashing) and be rechargeable via USB, ensuring they are always ready for use.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Comfort Grip**: Design the leash handle with an ergonomic shape and a soft, non-slip grip to provide comfort during long walks. The handle could also include a shock-absorbing mechanism to reduce strain on the owner's hand and wrist when the dog pulls. This feature would make walks more enjoyable and less tiring for the owner, encouraging longer and more frequent outings.",
    "**Multi-Function Leash with Training Features**: Develop a leash that doubles as a training tool, featuring built-in sound cues or vibration alerts to reinforce commands. For instance, the leash could have a button that emits a sound when the dog pulls too hard, helping to train them to walk calmly. Additionally, it could include a clicker mechanism for positive reinforcement during training sessions, making it easier for owners to teach their dogs new behaviors."
