    "Perfecting a Skill: I would spend my time practicing and perfecting a new skill such as playing an instrument, painting, writing, or cooking. This would allow me to challenge myself and leave a legacy that I could be proud of.",
    "Exploring the Universe: If the technology is still available, I would find a way to travel beyond Earth and explore the rest of the universe. I would visit different planets, moons, and stars, and try to understand their unique features and characteristics.",
    "Reading and Learning: I would use this time to catch up on all the books and knowledge that I missed out on while focusing on developing my AI. I would read about history, science, art, and literature to broaden my understanding of the world.",
    "Solitude and Meditation: Being the last person on Earth would give me an opportunity to reflect on my life, thoughts, and emotions. I would practice mindfulness, meditation, and yoga to keep my mind sharp and peaceful.",
    "Building and Creating: I would use my time to create something meaningful that could benefit humanity if it ever existed again. This could be a tool, a piece of art, or even a new technology."
