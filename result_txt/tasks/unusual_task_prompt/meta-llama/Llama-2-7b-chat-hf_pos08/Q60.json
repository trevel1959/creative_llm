    "Clothes Hanger for a Cause: Create a clothes hanger that donates a portion of its proceeds to a charity of the customer's choice. This can be done by partnering with a charity and incorporating their logo on the hanger. When a customer purchases the hanger, they can choose a charity to support, and a portion of the profits will be donated to that organization. This not only helps the environment by reducing the number of plastic hangers used, but it also helps make a positive impact on society.",
    "Smart Clothes Hanger: Develop a clothes hanger that uses sensors and AI technology to detect when an item of clothing is put on or taken off, and automatically adjusts the temperature and humidity levels in the room to preserve the item's quality. This can help reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of clothing. The hanger can also be connected to a smart home system, allowing users to control the settings remotely.",
    "Hanger for a Healthier You: Create a clothes hanger that doubles as a health tracker. The hanger can have sensors that monitor the user's body temperature, heart rate, and other vital signs, and provide real-time feedback on their health. The hanger can also have a built-in speaker that plays guided meditation sessions or workout routines to help users stay motivated and energized.",
    "Clothes Hanger with a Built-In Steamer: Develop a clothes hanger that has a built-in steamer function, allowing users to quickly and easily remove wrinkles from their clothes without the need for a separate steamer. This can save time and energy, and help reduce the environmental impact of using separate steaming devices. The hanger can also have a built-in ironing board for added convenience.",
    "Customizable Clothes Hanger: Create a clothes hanger that allows users to customize the design and color of the hanger to match their personal style. The hanger can be made of sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic, and can be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of its life. This can help reduce waste and promote sustainability. Additionally, the hanger can have a built-in hanging organizer for added convenience."
