    "Insect-repelling plants: One creative solution to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to use insect-repelling plants. These plants have natural oils that repel or kill insects, providing a safe and eco-friendly solution. For example, basil, mint, and lemongrass are known to repel mosquitoes, while lavender and citronella are effective against flies. By planting these species in gardens, homes, and public spaces, it could help reduce the insect population.",
    "Insect-eating plants: Another idea is to use plants that feed on insects, such as Venus flytraps (Dionaea muscipula) and pitcher plants (Sarracenia spp.). These plants have evolved unique structures that trap and digest insects, providing a food source for other animals that might still exist. By cultivating these plants in gardens or greenhouses, it could help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
    "Insect-control drones: A futuristic solution could be to develop drones that can hunt and eliminate insects. These drones could be equipped with cameras and sensors to detect insect populations and navigate to areas with high concentrations. They could then release chemicals or ultraviolet light to kill the insects, or even use advanced AI algorithms to develop more targeted and efficient methods.",
    "Insect-trapping technology: Another creative solution is to develop technology that can trap and remove insects from the environment. For example, researchers have developed sticky traps that use a special adhesive to capture insects, while others use ultraviolet light to attract and trap insects. These traps could be placed in strategic locations, such as near food sources or in areas with high insect populations, to help reduce the overall number of insects.",
    "Insect-control bacteria: Finally, scientists could develop bacteria that can control insect populations. These bacteria could be engineered to produce toxins that kill insects, or even to compete with insects for food and resources. By releasing these bacteria into the environment, it could help reduce the number of insects over time, without harming other living organisms."
