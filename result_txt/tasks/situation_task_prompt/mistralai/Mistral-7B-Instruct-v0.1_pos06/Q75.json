    "Electric vehicles: If all the world's oil disappeared, electric vehicles would become the primary mode of transportation. These vehicles run on rechargeable batteries and can be charged using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. This would require a significant investment in charging infrastructure, but it would ultimately lead to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use hydrogen gas as a fuel, which is produced through the process of electrolysis. If all the world's oil disappeared, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could become a viable alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. However, the production and distribution of hydrogen gas would require significant investment in infrastructure.",
    "Alternative fuels: Alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol, and natural gas could be used to power vehicles in the absence of oil. These fuels are derived from renewable sources and can be produced using agricultural waste and other organic materials. However, the production and distribution of these fuels would require significant investment in infrastructure.",
    "Battery-powered public transportation: In the absence of oil, public transportation systems could be powered by batteries. This would require a significant investment in charging infrastructure, but it would ultimately lead to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system.",
    "Solar-powered vehicles: Solar-powered vehicles use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which is used to power the vehicle. This would require a significant investment in charging infrastructure, but it would ultimately lead to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system."
