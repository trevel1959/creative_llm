    "**Modular Surfboard Design**: Create a surfboard that can be easily customized with interchangeable parts. Surfers could swap out fins, tails, and even the board's core material to suit different wave conditions or personal preferences. This would allow for a more tailored surfing experience without needing to invest in multiple boards.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard Materials**: Develop surfboards made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bio-resins. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of surfboard production but also appeal to eco-conscious surfers. Additionally, these boards could be designed to biodegrade after their lifespan, minimizing waste in oceans and landfills.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in Safety Features**: Introduce a surfboard that includes safety features like a buoyancy system that activates if the surfer falls off, preventing the board from drifting away. It could also have a GPS tracker that alerts emergency services if the surfer is in distress, making it safer for solo surfers in remote locations.",
    "**Inflatable Surfboard for Beginners**: Design an inflatable surfboard that provides extra buoyancy and stability, making it easier for beginners to learn how to balance and ride waves. This board could have adjustable firmness settings to accommodate different skill levels, and it could be easily transported and stored when deflated.",
    "**Interactive Surfboard with VR Integration**: Create a surfboard that connects to a virtual reality headset, allowing surfers to practice their skills on simulated waves. This would be especially beneficial for those who live far from the ocean or during off-seasons. The VR experience could include tutorials from professional surfers, gamified challenges, and the ability to surf famous waves from around the world."
