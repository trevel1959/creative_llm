    "**DIY Raspberry Pi Supercomputer**: Create a compact, energy-efficient supercomputer using Raspberry Pi 4 models, stacking them vertically in a custom-made case. Each Raspberry Pi will serve as a node in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing tasks. The nodes can be connected using a high-speed interconnect like PCIe or USB. This setup can be used for tasks such as data mining, machine learning, and complex simulations.",
    "**Custom Modular PC**: Design a modular computer that allows users to easily swap out components such as CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and storage modules. The system uses a standardized interface, making it easy to upgrade or repair parts without requiring advanced technical skills. This design promotes sustainability by extending the lifespan of the computer and encouraging users to replace only the necessary components.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Desktop**: Build a desktop computer powered entirely by solar energy. The system includes solar panels on the desk, which provide power to both the computer and any connected devices. To maximize efficiency, use components that consume less power and are optimized for low-power operation. Additionally, incorporate features like dynamic power management and energy storage (e.g., batteries) to ensure the system remains operational even when sunlight is insufficient.",
    "**AI-Driven Personalized Learning Machine**: Develop a computer system that learns your preferences, habits, and learning style to create personalized educational experiences. The system adapts its content, pace, and teaching methods based on real-time feedback and performance data. It can be integrated into various educational platforms, providing tailored lessons in subjects like math, science, language arts, and more. This concept leverages AI algorithms and machine learning to enhance individual learning outcomes.",
    "**VR/AR Enhanced Gaming Console**: Design a gaming console that integrates virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies to provide immersive gaming experiences. The console supports high-end VR headsets and AR overlays, enabling players to engage with games in new dimensions. This system could feature a custom-built GPU, specialized VR/AR processing units, and a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless integration of these advanced features into existing games and new titles developed specifically for this platform."
