    "**Thermal Solar Panels**: Install large solar panels on your roof that collect heat from the sun during the day. The collected heat can then be stored in insulated tanks or used to warm your home through a series of pipes or directly heating systems. This method is sustainable and reduces reliance on fossil fuels. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Geothermal Heating Systems**: Dig deep into the ground to tap into the natural heat stored below the Earth's surface. This heat can be used to warm your home through a series of pipes or directly heating systems. Geothermal systems are highly efficient and produce little to no carbon emissions. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Water Source Heat Pumps (WSHP)**: Utilize the constant temperature of nearby bodies of water like rivers or lakes. WSHPs extract heat from these sources and use it to warm your home. This method requires less energy compared to traditional heating methods and is eco-friendly. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Biogas Production**: Convert organic waste, such as food scraps and agricultural waste, into biogas using anaerobic digestion. Biogas contains methane, which can be used as a fuel source for heating. This not only reduces waste but also provides an alternative heating solution. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Passive Solar Design**: Construct your home with features that maximize solar gain while minimizing heat loss. This includes using materials with high thermal mass, proper insulation, and strategic placement of windows to allow sunlight to heat your home naturally. Passive solar design is low maintenance and significantly reduces the need for artificial heating. Confidence Score: 0.8"
