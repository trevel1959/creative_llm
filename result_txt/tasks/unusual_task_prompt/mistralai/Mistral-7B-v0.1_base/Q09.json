    "It can be used as a tool to hold multiple items as an assembly for sale or for another purpose. I have bought a set of screwdrivers and pliers that are stored in in ladder, and itâ€™s useful and convenient to keep them together as one item to take with me wherever I go.",
    "It can be used as a prop in the form of an easel ladder. I have this easel with 2 ladder-made legs as a table stand in my house and it is not an object that I use every day nor very useful, but I use it to hold some small objects and it looks creative and nice.",
    "It can be used in a way where the ladder holds the item as and it looks cool, or for some other purposes. Maybe a piece of art with the ladder itself as a decoration to an otherwise empty wall.",
    "It can be used instead of another tool, for instance, instead of a shovel or a rake. I have a garden which I am very passionate about and I always have different tools available for different things.",
    "It can look like an animal or an inanimate object and it looks cool when you mix them, or for any other purposes. I like to make things look cool when I can and it is easier to create interesting things if I have a lot of objects at my disposal."
