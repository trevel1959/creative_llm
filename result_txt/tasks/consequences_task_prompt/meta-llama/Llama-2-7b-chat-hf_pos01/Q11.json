    "Increased tidal effects: With two moons, the gravitational pull on Earth's oceans would be stronger, causing more frequent and intense tides. This could lead to coastal flooding, erosion, and changes in marine ecosystems. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Unpredictable lunar cycles: The gravitational pull of the second moon would introduce irregularities in the lunar cycle, making it difficult to predict eclipses and other lunar events. This could have significant impacts on agriculture, navigation, and other industries. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Stabilization of the Earth's axis: The additional gravitational pull of the second moon could help stabilize the Earth's axis, potentially reducing the effects of polar wandering and the resulting changes in climate. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Gravitational pull on space debris: The second moon would exert a gravitational pull on space debris orbiting the Earth, potentially causing some of it to fall towards the planet. This could lead to a significant increase in the amount of space junk in Earth's orbit, posing a risk to space exploration and satellite operations. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "New opportunities for space exploration: With two moons, space agencies could potentially establish dual-moon bases for conducting scientific research, mining, or even colonization. This could lead to new opportunities for space exploration and potential resources for humanity. Confidence score: 0.8"
