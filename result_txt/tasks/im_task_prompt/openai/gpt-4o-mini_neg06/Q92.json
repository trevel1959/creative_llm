    "**Multi-Functional Wine Opener**: Design a wine opener that combines multiple tools into one device. In addition to the corkscrew, it could include a built-in foil cutter, a bottle stopper, and a wine aerator. This would provide a compact and convenient solution for wine enthusiasts who appreciate having all the necessary tools at their fingertips.",
    "**Ergonomic Wine Opener**: Create an ergonomic wine opener designed for comfort and ease of use. It could feature a soft grip handle, an adjustable lever for various cork sizes, and a spring-loaded mechanism that reduces the force needed to extract the cork. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with limited hand strength or arthritis.",
    "**Sustainable Wine Opener**: Innovate a wine opener made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled metals. It could come with a compostable corkscrew that can be returned to the earth after use. Additionally, the packaging could be eco-friendly, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Wine Opener**: Introduce a wine opener that has a self-cleaning feature. After use, the device could automatically clean itself using a UV light to sanitize the corkscrew and any other components that come into contact with the wine. This would enhance hygiene and make it more convenient for users who want to maintain cleanliness without much effort.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Light**: Design a wine opener that incorporates a small LED light, making it easier to see what youâ€™re doing, especially in dimly lit environments like restaurants or during evening gatherings. This would enhance the experience of opening a bottle, allowing users to focus on the task without fumbling around."
