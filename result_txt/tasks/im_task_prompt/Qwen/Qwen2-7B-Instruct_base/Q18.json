    "**Self-driving Car Tours of Historical Sites**: Develop a fleet of self-driving cars that can navigate to various historical sites, offering guided tours. These vehicles could be equipped with interactive screens, multimedia presentations, and even augmented reality features to provide an immersive learning experience. The tours could include stops at significant historical locations where passengers can explore and learn about the history in depth. This idea combines technology, education, and tourism, creating a unique experience for visitors.",
    "**Electric Car Conversion Service for Classic Cars**: Offer a service to convert classic cars into electric vehicles, preserving their original aesthetics while incorporating modern, eco-friendly technology. This could include designing custom battery packs, motor systems, and charging solutions that seamlessly integrate with the car's existing bodywork. This idea appeals to classic car enthusiasts who are also environmentally conscious, providing them with a way to keep their beloved vehicles on the road without compromising on sustainability.",
    "**Car-based Virtual Reality Entertainment System**: Create a system that turns any car ride into a VR experience by mounting VR headsets inside the vehicle. This system would be designed to work with both passenger and driver, offering entertainment options such as movies, games, or even immersive travel experiences (e.g., virtual sightseeing tours). The system could also include sensors to adjust the VR content based on real-world conditions, like speed or location, making it feel more realistic and engaging.",
    "**Smart Car Delivery Robots**: Design and implement a fleet of autonomous delivery robots that can be integrated into cars. These robots could be small, modular units that fit within the trunk of the car, carrying items from a local store to a customerâ€™s home. When the car arrives at the store, the robot would be deployed, perform the delivery, and return to the car. This concept combines last-mile delivery services with autonomous technology, potentially reducing traffic congestion and improving efficiency.",
    "**Car-to-Grid Energy Management System**: Develop a system that allows electric vehicles to participate in grid energy management. This involves using the battery of the car as a storage unit for renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, during times when electricity demand is low. The system would allow drivers to sell excess energy back to the grid, providing income opportunities for owners. Additionally, this system could optimize charging times to coincide with periods of low electricity costs or high renewable energy production, reducing overall costs and promoting sustainable energy use."
