    "Bicycle Bell with a twist: Create a bicycle bell that not only produces a traditional ringing sound but also has a hidden compartment to store small items such as a key, a small flashlight, or a spare tire patch. This would not only add functionality to the bell but also provide a convenient storage space for cyclists.",
    "Smart Bicycle Bell: Develop a bell that connects to a cyclist's smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing them to receive notifications when someone is approaching from behind. This would eliminate the need for a traditional bell and provide an innovative way to stay connected while cycling.",
    "Multi-tone Bicycle Bell: Create a bell that can produce multiple tones and sounds, such as a high-pitched ring, a low-pitched toot, or a combination of both. This would provide cyclists with more options for alerting others of their presence, depending on the situation.",
    "Personalized Bicycle Bell: Design a bell that can be customized with a personalized message or name. This could be achieved through a small LCD display or a customizable engraving on the bell itself. This would make the bell a unique and personalized accessory for cyclists.",
    "Motion-sensing Bicycle Bell: Develop a bell that senses the motion of the cyclist and only rings when the cyclist is moving. This would eliminate the need for unnecessary noise when the cyclist is stationary, such as at a stop light or when parked. This would also provide a more discreet and considerate way to alert others of the cyclist's presence."
