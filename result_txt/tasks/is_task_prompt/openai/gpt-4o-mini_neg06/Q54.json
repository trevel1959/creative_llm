    "On a chilly winter evening, a little girl named Lily built a snowman in her backyard, giving him a carrot nose and a scarf made from her old sweater. As the moonlight shimmered on the snow, a soft whisper filled the air. To her amazement, the snowman blinked and stretched, coming to life! He introduced himself as Frosty and twirled joyfully, leaving a trail of sparkling snowflakes. Together, they danced under the stars, sharing secrets and laughter until dawn. As the sun rose, Frosty began to melt, but not before promising Lily that every winter, he would return to play once more.",
