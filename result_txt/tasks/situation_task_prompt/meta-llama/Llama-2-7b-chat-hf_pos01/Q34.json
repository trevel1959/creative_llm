    "Create a rainwater harvesting system: I would create a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. This system would involve installing a large tank or series of tanks underground or above ground, with a filtering and purification system to ensure the water is safe for plants. I would also consider installing a pump or gravity-fed system to distribute the water to the plants. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Utilize greywater: Greywater is the wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines. I would use this water for irrigation purposes by installing a greywater system that collects and treats the water before distributing it to the plants. This system would involve installing pipes and filters to remove contaminants and bacteria from the water. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Use misting systems: Misting systems use fine droplets of water to provide plants with a fine layer of moisture. I would install a misting system that can be powered by solar energy or a battery, providing a consistent and efficient way to water plants without relying on rainwater. This system would be especially useful for plants that require high humidity levels. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Implement hydroponics: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. I would set up a hydroponics system that uses a nutrient-rich solution to feed the plants, eliminating the need for rainwater. This system would involve installing a series of pipes and tanks to hold the solution and a pump to distribute the solution to the plants. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Create a rainmaker: A rainmaker is a device that can generate artificial rain. I would create a rainmaker that uses a combination of wind and water to create a fine mist of water that can be used for irrigation purposes. This device would be powered by solar energy and could be placed in a location with good wind conditions. Confidence score: 0.9"
