    "**Multi-Tone Bicycle Bell**: Instead of a single sound, this bell would feature multiple tones that the rider can select based on their environment. For instance, a soft chime for quiet parks, a loud, attention-grabbing sound for busy streets, or a musical tone for friendly encounters. Riders could switch tones easily using a button or a mobile app, allowing for personalized and context-appropriate alerts.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Bell**: This eco-friendly bell would be equipped with small solar panels that charge a built-in battery. This would ensure that the bell is always operational without the need for frequent battery replacements. The solar-powered design would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists, and it could also feature a small LED light that activates in low-light conditions to increase visibility.",
    "**Voice-Activated Bicycle Bell**: Imagine a bell that responds to voice commands! Riders could activate the bell by saying \"ring\" or \"alert,\" allowing for hands-free operation. This would be particularly useful when navigating busy streets, as it allows cyclists to keep their hands on the handlebars while still signaling their presence to others. The bell could also feature customizable phrases or sounds that the rider can choose from.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell with LED Display**: This bell would come with a small LED screen that displays messages or symbols when the bell is rung. For example, it could show a friendly smiley face when approaching pedestrians or a warning sign when near other cyclists. The display could be customizable via a smartphone app, allowing riders to set different messages based on their riding environment.",
    "**Bicycle Bell with Vibration Alerts**: In addition to sound, this bell could incorporate a vibration feature that alerts the rider when they are in a high-traffic area or when they need to signal to others. The vibrations could be felt through the handlebars, providing a tactile warning system that complements the auditory alerts, ensuring that cyclists are aware of their surroundings even in noisy environments."
