    "**Rainwater harvesting system**: Install a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater in a large tank, which can then be used for watering plants and other household needs. This reduces the reliance on external water sources and helps conserve water.",
    "**Mist irrigation system**: Implement a mist irrigation system that uses fine droplets of water to deliver moisture to the plants. This method is efficient, as it reduces water loss through evaporation and runoff.",
    "**Drip irrigation**: Develop a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants through a network of small tubes and emitters. This method reduces water waste and ensures the plants receive the right amount of moisture.",
    "**Smart watering system**: Create a smart watering system that uses sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering schedules accordingly. This system can also be connected to a weather app to adjust for changes in temperature and humidity.",
    "**Geothermal water collection**: Harness geothermal energy to heat water and create steam, which can then be used for irrigation. This method is renewable and sustainable, and it doesn't consume fossil fuels."
