    "**Integrated Solar Charging System**: Equip bicycles with solar panels embedded in the frame or fenders to charge small electronic devices like smartphones or GPS units while riding. The energy harnessed from the sun could power LED lights for safety, providing a sustainable way to enhance visibility during nighttime rides. This feature would promote eco-friendliness and convenience for urban cyclists.",
    "**Self-Inflating Tires**: Develop a tire system that uses a built-in air compressor powered by pedaling to maintain optimal tire pressure. This technology would reduce the risk of flat tires and enhance ride quality. Riders would receive real-time pressure feedback via a handlebar display, ensuring they can adjust pressure as needed, leading to improved efficiency and safety.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular design for bicycle accessories, allowing riders to easily attach and detach components like storage baskets, lights, or even a small electric motor. This system would utilize a universal mounting interface that enables quick changes based on the rider's needs, whether commuting, running errands, or leisurely riding.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation Glasses**: Design AR glasses that provide cyclists with real-time navigation information, such as turn-by-turn directions, speed, and distance traveled, all displayed in the rider's line of sight. These glasses could also show nearby bike lanes, hazards, and points of interest, allowing cyclists to keep their focus on the road while staying informed.",
    "**Enhanced Safety Features**: Introduce a bicycle with built-in collision detection technology that alerts the rider to potential hazards using vibrations in the handlebars or visual signals on a display. This system could use ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicles and obstacles, enhancing safety in urban environments and reducing the likelihood of accidents."
