    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback**: Enhance the listening experience by incorporating haptic feedback and visual elements. For instance, the speaker could vibrate subtly with the bass beats or display colorful LED patterns that sync with the music. This would create a more immersive experience, making it feel like the sound is not just heard but felt and seen, appealing to users' senses beyond just audio.",
    "**Personalized Voice Assistant**: Develop a customizable voice assistant that can adapt its personality and tone based on user preferences. Users could choose from various voice styles (e.g., calming, energetic, humorous) and even train the assistant to recognize their specific commands and preferences over time, making interactions feel more personal and engaging.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a Bluetooth speaker with a modular design that allows users to attach or detach different components based on their needs. For example, users could add a battery pack for extended playtime, a solar panel for outdoor use, or even a small projector for visual displays. This would not only enhance functionality but also promote sustainability by allowing users to upgrade rather than replace their devices.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Hub**: Transform the Bluetooth speaker into a central smart home hub that controls other devices in the home. Users could manage lights, thermostats, and security systems directly through voice commands or a dedicated app. This would streamline home automation and make the speaker an essential part of the user's daily routine, combining entertainment with convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign the speaker using sustainable and recyclable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, the packaging could be biodegradable or made from recycled materials. By promoting eco-friendliness, the speaker would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing electronic waste."
