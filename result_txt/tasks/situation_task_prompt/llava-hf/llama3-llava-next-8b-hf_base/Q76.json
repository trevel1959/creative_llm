    "Telegram services - Although not a common option today due to advancements in technology, in some countries, telegrams are still available. These can be sent from local post offices. While it might not be as quick as modern means, it's still possible.",
    "Emergency contacts - Users can make arrangements with friends or family to be their point of contact in case of emergencies. In cases where phones don't work, these people can help communicate important messages.",
    "Messenger services - In countries where landline phones are still functional or where people live close by, messengers can be used to relay messages. This approach can be slow compared to modern options but could help bridge communication gaps.",
    "Local community networks - Neighbors could utilize neighborhood message boards or local social media groups to exchange information. This would require community networks to function optimally, so communication would be limited to local areas.",
    "Signal networks using other forms of technology - Even if phones stopped functioning, other forms of technology, such as internet-based communication services, could still be used. In some cases, satellite networks or even walkie-talkies or CB radios could serve as alternatives."
