Problems can arise from delays in shipping, quality control issues with suppliers, or unexpected demand surges. To mitigate these risks, establish strong relationships with multiple suppliers, maintain a safety stock, and use technology to forecast demand accurately. Additionally, consider implementing dropshipping as a flexible option to reduce inventory costs.",

Regularly test the siteâ€™s functionality and gather user feedback to make continuous improvements.",

Utilize analytics tools to track performance and adjust strategies based on data-driven insights.",
