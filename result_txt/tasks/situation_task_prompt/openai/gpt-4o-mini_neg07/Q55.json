    "**Interactive News Boards**: Set up public news boards in high-traffic areas, such as coffee shops, universities, and public transportation hubs.

This immersive experience would allow users to engage with news in a more meaningful way, blending real-world exploration with current events.",
    "**Mobile News Journals**: Launch a mobile news journal service where reporters use bicycles or electric scooters to deliver news summaries to neighborhoods.
