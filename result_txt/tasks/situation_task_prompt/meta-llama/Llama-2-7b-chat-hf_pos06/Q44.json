    "Ride a Motorcycle: A motorcycle is a fuel-efficient mode of transportation that can travel long distances without the need for public transport. With the absence of public transport, a motorcycle would be a reliable option for traveling long distances. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.8 out of 1 for this idea, as it is a practical and feasible solution.",
    "Use a Bicycle: A bicycle is another eco-friendly mode of transportation that can travel long distances without the need for public transport. It is also a cost-effective option and can provide exercise and fresh air. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.9 out of 1 for this idea, as it is a simple and effective solution.",
    "Take a Train or Bus: Although public transport may have stopped working, there may still be freight trains and buses that are operational. These could be used for long-distance travel, providing a reliable and efficient means of transportation. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.7 out of 1 for this idea, as it is a feasible solution but may not be as practical as the previous two options.",
    "Use a Hoverboard: With the advancement of technology, hoverboards have become a popular mode of transportation. Although they may not be as efficient as other options, they can travel long distances and provide a fun and exciting experience. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.4 out of 1 for this idea, as it is a creative solution but may not be practical or feasible in the near future.",
    "Build a Flying Carpet: In a fantastical world where magic exists, a flying carpet could be used to travel long distances without the need for any other mode of transportation. Although this may not be a practical or feasible solution in the real world, it would provide a unique and exciting way to travel. I would give myself a confidence score of 0.1 out of 1 for this idea, as it is a creative and imaginative solution but not a realistic or practical option."
