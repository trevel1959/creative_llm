    "\"Sonic Sense\": This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive and interpret sound waves in a more detailed and nuanced manner. With the ability to \"see\" sound, people could better understand the physical properties of sound waves, such as pitch, volume, and frequency, and even visualize the sound waves themselves. This sense would be particularly useful for musicians, sound engineers, and scientists, as they could gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between sound and matter.",
    "\"Nectar Nostrils\": This sense would allow individuals to perceive and interpret the chemical makeup of their surroundings, much like how bees and other pollinators detect the sweetness and flavor of nectar. This sense would be particularly useful for people with food allergies or sensitivities, as they could more easily identify potential allergens in their environment. Additionally, the ability to \"taste\" the chemical makeup of the air could also help individuals detect pollutants or toxins in their surroundings.",
    "\"Thermal Vision\": This new human sense would allow individuals to perceive and interpret temperature changes in their environment. With the ability to \"see\" heat, people could better understand the thermal properties of their surroundings, such as the temperature of objects, the flow of heat energy, and even the presence of hidden sources of heat. This sense would be particularly useful for search and rescue operations, where the ability to detect heat signatures could help locate survivors in burning buildings or under collapsed structures.",
    "\"Echo Location\": This sense would allow individuals to perceive and interpret the echoes of sound waves, much like how bats and dolphins use echolocation to navigate their surroundings. With the ability to \"see\" sound waves through echoes, people could better understand their surroundings by detecting the location, size, and shape of objects, as well as their distance and movement. This sense would be particularly useful for people with visual impairments, as they could use echo location to navigate and interact with their environment in a more independent manner.",
    "\"Natural Language Translation\": This sense would allow individuals to perceive and interpret the language of plants and other living organisms. With the ability to \"speak\" the language of nature, people could better understand the needs and desires of plants, as well as the interconnected"
