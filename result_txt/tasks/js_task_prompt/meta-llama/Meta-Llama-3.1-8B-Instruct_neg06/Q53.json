    "**Aerius**: A high-flying sport that combines elements of parkour, trampolining, and volleyball. Players would wear specialized suits with built-in propulsion systems, allowing them to jump, flip, and soar through the air with incredible agility and precision. The objective would be to score points by hitting a hovering ball with a specialized racket, while navigating an obstacle course of trampolines, tunnels, and zip lines.",
    "**Lumin**: A futuristic sport that takes place in a darkened arena, where players wear special suits that emit a unique, glowing aura. The objective would be to score points by collecting and combining different colored \"light orbs\" that are scattered throughout the arena. Players would need to work together, using their auras to create a harmonious resonance that would attract and trap the orbs, while defending against opposing teams that would try to disrupt their resonance.",
    "**Aquilon**: A high-intensity water sport that combines elements of surfing, wakeboarding, and freediving. Players would ride a specially designed, motorized board that can propel them at high speeds through the water, while performing acrobatic stunts and tricks. The objective would be to navigate through a challenging course of waves, tunnels, and underwater obstacles, while collecting and returning to a designated \"treasure chest\" filled with points.",
    "**EchoPlex**: A mental and physical sport that combines elements of escape rooms, puzzle-solving, and strategy. Players would be divided into teams and placed in a complex, maze-like arena filled with cryptic clues, hidden passages, and secret rooms. The objective would be to work together to solve a series of interconnected puzzles, unlocking new areas and progressing through the arena, while competing against opposing teams to reach the final \"escape point\" first.",
    "**NovaSpire**: A high-speed, high-stakes sport that combines elements of motocross, BMX racing, and parkour. Players would ride specially designed, high-tech bicycles with advanced suspension systems and AI-powered navigation. The objective would be to navigate through a challenging, obstacle-filled course that includes ramps, jumps, and tunnels, while collecting and returning to a designated \"checkpoint\" filled with points. The twist: players would need to use their bicycles' AI to predict and adapt to the course's ever-changing layout, which would be generated in real-time by a sophisticated algorithm.
