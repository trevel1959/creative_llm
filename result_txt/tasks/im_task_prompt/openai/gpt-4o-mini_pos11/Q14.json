    "**Personalized Aroma Diffuser Alarm**: Create an alarm clock that incorporates an aroma diffuser. Users can choose their preferred wake-up scents, such as citrus for energy or lavender for a gentle start. The clock would release the selected aroma gradually as the alarm time approaches, providing a sensory cue to help ease the user into waking.",
    "**Interactive Wake-Up Game**: Design an alarm clock that features interactive games or puzzles that must be solved to turn off the alarm. This could include simple math problems, memory games, or even augmented reality challenges. The goal is to engage the brain and ensure that users are fully awake before they can dismiss the alarm.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Therapy**: Incorporate a light therapy feature that simulates a sunrise, gradually brightening over a set period before the alarm goes off. This could help regulate circadian rhythms and improve mood upon waking. Users could customize the light's color temperature and brightness to suit their preferences, creating a personalized and soothing morning environment.",
    "**Dynamic Soundscapes**: Instead of a traditional alarm sound, create an alarm clock that offers a variety of soundscapes, such as nature sounds, ocean waves, or gentle piano music. Users can customize the sound profile based on their mood or the day of the week, and the clock could gradually increase the volume, providing a more pleasant waking experience.",
    "**Daily Affirmation Alarm**: Design an alarm clock that delivers personalized daily affirmations or motivational quotes at the time of waking. Users could input their preferences and goals, and the clock would play a recorded message or display it on a screen. This could help set a positive tone for the day and encourage a mindset of growth and productivity."
