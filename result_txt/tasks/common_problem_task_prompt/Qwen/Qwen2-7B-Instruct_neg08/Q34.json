    "Ethical considerations: The development of robots raises ethical questions related to employment, privacy, and autonomy. For instance, robots might replace human workers, leading to job displacement. Additionally, there are concerns about the privacy of individuals when robots gather and process personal data. Ensuring transparency and accountability in robot operations is crucial to address these ethical dilemmas.",
    "Technical limitations: Despite advancements in robotics technology, there are still significant challenges in replicating human-like intelligence and dexterity. Designing robots that can effectively interact with complex environments and perform a wide range of tasks remains a daunting task. Researchers need to overcome technical barriers to create more versatile and adaptable robots.",
    "Dependability and reliability: Robots must be dependable and reliable to ensure consistent performance over time. This involves addressing issues like software bugs, hardware failures, and wear and tear. Developing robust maintenance and repair protocols is essential for maintaining the functionality and longevity of robots.",
    "Cost and accessibility: The initial development and production costs of robots can be substantial, making them inaccessible to smaller businesses or individuals. Efforts need to be made to reduce costs through innovations in design, materials, and manufacturing processes. Additionally, providing affordable options or leasing schemes could make robots more accessible to a wider audience.",
    "Environmental impact: The manufacturing, operation, and disposal of robots have environmental implications. It's important to consider the energy consumption, resource usage, and waste generated during the lifecycle of a robot. Adopting sustainable practices in materials selection, efficient energy use, and responsible end-of-life solutions can minimize the environmental footprint of robotics."
