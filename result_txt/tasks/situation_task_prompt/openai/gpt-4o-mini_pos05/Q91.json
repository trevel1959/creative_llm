    "**Visual and Auditory Alerts**: Create a smart home environment equipped with cameras and sound sensors that can detect potential hazards. For example, if you’re near a hot stove or a sharp object, the system could project a visual alert on a screen or emit a loud sound to draw your attention. This system could also integrate with smart assistants, providing verbal warnings when you’re in danger.",
    "**Protective Gear with Impact Sensors**: Design clothing and accessories embedded with impact sensors that can detect when you are in a potentially harmful situation. For example, a helmet could have sensors that trigger an alert if you’re about to hit your head on a low ceiling, or padded gloves could alert you if you’re gripping something too tightly. This gear would help you maintain awareness of your surroundings and prevent injuries.",
    "**Training and Simulation Programs**: Implement training programs that teach you to navigate your environment without physical sensation. These programs could use virtual reality simulations to help you practice recognizing dangers through other senses, like sight and sound. For instance, you could learn to identify the sound of breaking glass or the visual cues of a slippery floor, enhancing your ability to avoid accidents.",
    "**Buddy System**: Establish a support network of friends or family members who can help monitor your safety. This system would involve regular check-ins where your companions would inform you of any potential hazards in your environment. They could also accompany you in unfamiliar places, providing guidance and assistance to ensure you avoid injury.",
    "**Environmental Modifications**: Adapt your living and working spaces to minimize risks. This could include installing rounded furniture edges, non-slip flooring, and soft barriers around sharp corners. Additionally, using color-coded warning signs for hazardous areas (like stairs or slippery surfaces) can enhance your awareness of potential dangers, even without physical sensations."
