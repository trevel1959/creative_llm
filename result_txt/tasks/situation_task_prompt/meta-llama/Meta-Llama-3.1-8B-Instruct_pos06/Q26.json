    "**Star Mapping**: I would use the constellations to navigate. By recognizing patterns and familiar shapes in the night sky, I could estimate my direction and location. For example, the Big Dipper is always in the northern sky, and the Southern Cross is always in the southern sky. I would also use the North Star (Polaris) to determine my direction, as it is aligned with the Earth's axis and remains stationary in the sky while the other stars appear to rotate around it. This method would be more accurate during clear, moonless nights. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Dead Reckoning**: I would use dead reckoning, a method of estimating my position by tracking my speed, direction, and time traveled. This involves using a mental or physical log to record my movements, including distance traveled, speed, and direction. By analyzing this data, I could estimate my current position and make adjustments as needed. This method would be more accurate if I had a reliable way to measure time and distance. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Magnetic Compass**: I would use a magnetic compass to determine my direction. While a traditional compass relies on a magnetized needle, I could use a natural magnet like a lodestone or a piece of iron to create a makeshift compass. By balancing the magnet on a pivot, I could use the Earth's magnetic field to indicate direction. This method would be more accurate in areas with minimal magnetic interference. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Topographic Mapping**: I would use topographic features to navigate. By recognizing patterns of hills, valleys, and ridges, I could estimate my location and direction. This method would be more accurate in areas with distinct topography, such as mountains or canyons. I would also use my knowledge of geology and hydrology to identify landmarks like rivers, lakes, and waterfalls. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Orienteering**: I would use orienteering, a method of navigation that involves using a map and compass to navigate through unfamiliar terrain. While I wouldn't have a physical map, I could use mental images of the terrain and my surroundings to create a makeshift map. By using my knowledge of geography and spatial reasoning, I could estimate my position and direction. This method would be more accurate if I had a good understanding of the terrain and could recognize patterns and landmarks. (Confidence"
