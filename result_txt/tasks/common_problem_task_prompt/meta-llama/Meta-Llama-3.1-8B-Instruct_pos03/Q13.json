You'd need to have a specialized enclosure to house the dragon, and a system for feeding and exercising them.

With a little creativity, you could turn this into a lucrative business, and even offer packages for dragon owners who want to leave their pets in the care of a trusted professional.",
    "**Dragon Riding Lessons**: Who wouldn't want to learn how to ride a dragon?

As your business grows, you could expand to offer more advanced lessons, such as aerial acrobatics and dragon agility training.",
    "**Dragon Conservation**: With great power comes great responsibility. You could use your dragon-owning experience to contribute to dragon conservation efforts.

    "**Dragon Breeding Program**: You could establish a dragon breeding program, working with experienced breeders to develop new dragon breeds and improve existing ones.
