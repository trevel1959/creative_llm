    "**Self-Standing Umbrella**: Design an umbrella with a weighted base that allows it to stand on its own when not in use. This would be especially useful in outdoor settings like picnics or beach outings, where users can set the umbrella down without needing to hold it or find a place to lean it against.",
    "**Convertible Umbrella**: Create an umbrella that can transform into a sunshade or a tent. With adjustable poles and a detachable canopy, users can easily switch from a rain umbrella to a beach umbrella or a small tent for shade, making it versatile for various weather conditions and outdoor activities.",
    "**UV-Blocking Umbrella**: Enhance the fabric of the umbrella with advanced UV-blocking technology that not only protects against rain but also provides superior sun protection. This umbrella could have a reflective inner lining that cools the user and protects against harmful UV rays, making it perfect for sunny days.",
    "**Built-in LED Lights**: Incorporate LED lights into the ribs of the umbrella, providing illumination for nighttime use. These lights could be solar-powered or rechargeable, allowing users to navigate in the dark or make themselves visible during evening walks in the rain.",
    "**Wind-Resistant Design**: Innovate a double-layered canopy with vents that allow wind to pass through without turning the umbrella inside out. This design would reduce the risk of damage during storms and ensure that the umbrella remains stable and functional even in high winds."
