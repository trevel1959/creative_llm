    "Lack of user testing: Failing to test the software with real users can lead to design flaws and usability issues that may not be discovered until after the product has been released. This can result in costly fixes and delays.",
    "Inadequate security measures: Failing to incorporate proper security measures can leave the software vulnerable to hacking and data breaches. This can result in lost revenue, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liability.",
    "Poor collaboration between teams: If the software is a complex product that requires input from multiple teams or departments, poor communication and collaboration can lead to delays, miscommunications, and a final product that does not meet the needs of the users.",
    "Insufficient documentation: Failing to document the software thoroughly can make it difficult for users to learn how to use the product and may lead to support issues. Additionally, if the company decides to update or change the software in the future, lack of documentation can make it difficult to understand the current codebase.",
    "Lack of scalability: If the software is not designed with scalability in mind, it may not be able to handle a large number of users or data, leading to performance issues and downtime."
