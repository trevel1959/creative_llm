    "**Smart Lock Integration**: Create a smart lock system for car keys that can be managed through a mobile app or wearable technology. This allows users to remotely unlock their cars from a distance, ensuring they never lose their keys again. Additionally, it provides an added layer of security by allowing temporary access to others and setting up geofences around the vehicle to trigger notifications when the key is outside a certain area.",
    "**Keyless Entry System**: Develop a keyless entry system for vehicles that uses biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or even heartbeat patterns. This would eliminate the need for physical keys entirely, making the car more secure and convenient for the user. The system could also be integrated with smartphones, allowing users to activate or deactivate the feature based on their proximity to the vehicle.",
    "**Customizable Car Key Fobs**: Design car key fobs that are not only functional but also customizable in terms of design and features. Users could choose from a variety of colors, materials, and add-ons like built-in flashlights, USB chargers, or emergency SOS buttons. This personalization would enhance user satisfaction and make the product stand out in the market.",
    "**Emergency Service Integration**: Integrate a direct line to emergency services into the car key fob itself. In case of an accident or breakdown, pressing a specific button on the key fob would immediately connect the driver to roadside assistance or local emergency responders, providing faster response times and potentially saving lives.",
    "**Automated Maintenance Notifications**: Incorporate a maintenance tracking system within the car key fob that monitors the vehicle's health and sends alerts to the owner when scheduled services are due or when there are potential issues that need attention. This proactive approach would help prevent costly repairs and ensure the vehicle remains in optimal condition, thus enhancing both safety and reliability."
