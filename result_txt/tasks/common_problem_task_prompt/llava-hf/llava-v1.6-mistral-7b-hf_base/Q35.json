    "Financial Problems: Another problem faced by zoos is financial difficulties. Maintaining and operating a zoo is expensive, with the costs of food, veterinary care, and staff being particularly high. Ensuring adequate funding is a constant challenge, especially for small and specialized zoos that may not be able to attract enough visitors.",
    "Limited Space: Zoos often have limited space to house animals, particularly those that require large naturalistic enclosures or are geographically restricted to certain regions. This limits the ability of zoos to house a diverse range of species, which can be a problem as it can lead to incompatible animal combinations or a lack of genetic diversity.",
    "Conservation Efforts: One of the primary goals of zoos is often to contribute to conservation efforts, but this can be challenging, particularly when it comes to protecting endangered species. Many zoos struggle to balance the need to breed and conserve species in captivity while supporting conservation efforts in the wild.",
    "Public Education: While zoos provide important educational opportunities for the public, they can also contribute to misconceptions or negative perceptions of wildlife. The way in which animals are displayed and the messaging around them must be carefully managed to ensure that zoos are not contributing to exploitative or harmful practices.",
    "Habitat Destruction: Another issue that zoos face is the impact of habitat destruction on the species they house. Many animals are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, which can make breeding and reintroduction efforts difficult or impossible."
