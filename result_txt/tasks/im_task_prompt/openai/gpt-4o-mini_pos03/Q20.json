    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a coffee maker with a built-in self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge coffee oils and residues. This could be complemented with a biodegradable cleaning solution that is automatically dispensed during the cleaning cycle. Users would simply need to refill the cleaning solution every few weeks, significantly reducing maintenance time and ensuring a consistently fresh brew.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Add a flavor infusion chamber to the coffee maker that allows users to infuse their coffee with natural flavors like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut. This chamber would heat the flavoring agents and mix them with the brewing water, enhancing the coffeeâ€™s aroma and taste. Users could also experiment with their own flavor combinations, making each cup unique.",
    "**Sustainable Brew Pods**: Create a line of reusable, biodegradable coffee pods designed specifically for the coffee maker. These pods could be filled with freshly ground coffee or tea leaves, and after use, they would break down naturally without harming the environment. The coffee maker would have a built-in grinder to freshly grind beans before brewing, ensuring maximum flavor while promoting sustainability.",
    "**Personalized Brew Strength**: Implement a customizable brewing strength feature that allows users to adjust the extraction time and temperature based on their taste preferences. The coffee maker could have a dial or touchscreen interface where users can select from options like \"mild,\" \"medium,\" or \"bold,\" or even create their own custom settings for a tailored experience.",
    "**Integrated Coffee Recipe Book**: Include an interactive touchscreen display on the coffee maker that features a comprehensive coffee recipe book. Users could browse various coffee styles, from lattes to cold brews, and follow step-by-step instructions. The machine could even provide video tutorials for complex drinks and allow users to save their favorite recipes for easy access."
