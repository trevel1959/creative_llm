To make it easier, plan ahead and create a detailed menu that includes all the dishes you need to make. This will help you organize your time and resources, ensuring that everything is ready on time.",
    "Use a slow cooker: A slow cooker is a great tool for preparing a holiday dinner for a large family. You can add all the ingredients for a dish, set it to cook, and then forget about it until it's ready. This will free up your time to focus on other dishes.",
    "Cook with your family: Cooking with your family can be a fun and rewarding experience. Assign tasks to different family members, and make the preparation of the holiday dinner a group effort. This will not only make the process more enjoyable, but it will also bring your family closer together.",
    "Use leftovers creatively: Leftovers from a holiday dinner can be used in a variety of creative ways. For example, you can use leftover turkey to make turkey sandwiches or turkey soup. Leftover vegetables can be used in a stir-fry or added to a soup. This will not only save you time and effort, but it will also reduce food waste.",
    "Consider a potluck: A potluck is a great option for a holiday dinner for a large family. Each family member can bring a dish to share, reducing the amount of work you have to do. This will also give you the opportunity to try new recipes and dishes that you may not have made before."
