    "**Innovative Educational Toy**: Design a magnet-based puzzle toy for children that promotes learning about magnetism. The toy could include various magnetic shapes (circles, squares, triangles) and different colored magnets that fit together in specific ways to form a complete picture or model. The design would also incorporate a simple explanation of how magnets work, helping children understand the principles of attraction and repulsion.",
    "**Smart Refrigerator Integration**: Create a smart refrigerator that uses magnetic strips to track food items and expiration dates. By scanning barcodes on food containers, the fridge can store this information. As the food approaches its expiration date, it sends notifications to your smartphone, reminding you to use or discard it. This helps reduce food waste and ensures that you always have fresh ingredients at hand.",
    "**Portable Solar Charger**: Develop a portable solar charger that utilizes magnets to hold the device securely in place while charging. The charger could be made from lightweight materials and have a magnetic base to attach to any metallic surface. It could also feature an integrated LED flashlight for nighttime use, making it a versatile tool for camping, hiking, or emergency situations.",
    "**Artistic Magnet Wall Installation**: Create a magnetic wall installation that allows users to hang art pieces without damaging the walls. Each piece of artwork would come with a special magnetic backing, which adheres to the wall-mounted magnets. The installation could also include a system for easily repositioning the art pieces or swapping them out as desired, making it a dynamic and customizable art display.",
    "**Interactive Museum Exhibit**: Design an interactive museum exhibit focused on the history and science of magnetism. Visitors could interact with various exhibits that demonstrate the principles of magnetism through hands-on activities, such as creating their own magnetic field using a coil of wire, or experimenting with magnetic levitation. The exhibit could also include multimedia presentations and interactive games to educate and entertain visitors of all ages."
