    "Thermal Mass Design: Utilize thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. These materials can maintain a consistent temperature by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. This approach can be particularly effective in well-insulated buildings with limited windows.",
    "Passive Solar Design: Design buildings with large south-facing windows to maximize solar gain during the winter months. In the summer, open windows on opposite sides of the building to create cross ventilation and cooling. This approach can be combined with thermal mass materials for optimal temperature regulation.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Utilize evaporative cooling systems that use water to cool the air. These systems can be as simple as a wet towel hung in front of a fan or a more complex system involving a water-soaked pad and a fan. This approach can be particularly effective in dry climates.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into building design. These materials can absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. PCMs can be integrated into walls, floors, or ceilings to regulate temperature.",
    "Green Roofs: Plant vegetation on rooftops to provide insulation and reduce heat gain during the summer months. In colder climates, green roofs can also provide additional thermal mass to absorb and release heat. This approach can also help with rainwater management and create aesthetically pleasing green spaces."
