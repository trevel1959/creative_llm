    "**Animal Health Crisis**: Zoos are responsible for the health and well-being of thousands of animals. However, disease outbreaks, injuries, or illnesses can spread quickly through the animal population, putting the entire zoo at risk. A severe animal health crisis could require significant resources to contain and treat, potentially disrupting zoo operations and affecting visitor safety.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Zoos have a significant environmental footprint, from energy consumption and waste management to habitat destruction and greenhouse gas emissions. As public awareness of environmental issues grows, zoos must balance their educational mission with the need to reduce their ecological impact. Failure to do so could damage the zoo's reputation and lead to decreased visitor numbers.",
    "**Visitor Safety**: With thousands of visitors passing through the zoo each day, ensuring their safety is a top priority. However, accidents can still occur, and the zoo must be prepared to respond quickly and effectively in the event of an emergency. A major incident could lead to lawsuits, damage to the zoo's reputation, and even closure.",
    "**Boredom and Enrichment**: Animals in zoos can become bored and stressed if their enclosures are not stimulating or challenging enough. This can lead to behavioral problems, decreased animal well-being, and a negative impact on visitor experiences. Providing adequate enrichment activities and stimulating environments is crucial to maintaining a healthy and happy animal population.",
    "**Funding and Budget Constraints**: Running a zoo is expensive, with costs including animal care, staffing, facilities maintenance, and educational programs. Funding constraints can limit the zoo's ability to invest in new exhibits, animal acquisitions, or staff development, potentially affecting the quality of care and visitor experiences."
