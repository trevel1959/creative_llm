    "A Smart Power Strip with Integrated Energy Monitoring and Automation: Imagine a power strip that not only provides additional outlets but also tracks energy consumption in real-time, allowing users to monitor and optimize their energy usage. This smart power strip could be equipped with sensors that detect when devices are turned on or off, automatically adjusting the power supply to match the device's needs. For example, when a laptop is turned on, the power strip could detect the device's power requirements and adjust the voltage accordingly, reducing energy waste and prolonging the lifespan of the device.",
    "A Modular, Interchangeable Outlet System for Easy Upgrades and Repurposing: Envision a power strip with interchangeable outlets that can be swapped out as needed, allowing users to upgrade or repurpose their outlets without having to replace the entire power strip. This modular design could include different types of outlets (e.g., USB, HDMI, or Ethernet) that can be easily inserted or removed, making it simple to adapt to changing device needs or upgrade to newer technologies.",
    "A Power Strip with Built-in Surge Protection and Automatic Backup Power: Picture a power strip that not only provides surge protection but also includes a built-in battery backup system, ensuring that critical devices remain powered during outages or brownouts. This feature could be particularly useful for businesses or individuals with essential equipment that requires a stable power supply. The built-in battery could be rechargeable, and the power strip could even include a notification system to alert users when the battery is low or when the power strip is detecting a surge.",
    "A Smart Power Strip with Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energy Integration: Imagine a power strip that can harness energy from the environment, such as solar panels or kinetic energy, and use it to power devices. This innovative design could include a built-in solar panel or piezoelectric material that captures and converts environmental energy into electrical energy, reducing the need for traditional power sources. The power strip could also be designed to integrate with renewable energy systems, allowing users to optimize their energy usage and reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "A Power Strip with Integrated Wireless Charging and Energy Storage: Envision a power strip that combines wireless charging capabilities with energy storage, allowing users to charge devices wirelessly and store excess energy for later use. This feature could be particularly useful for devices that require constant power, such as smartphones or laptops. The power strip could include a rechargeable battery that stores excess energy, which can then be used to charge devices when the power strip is not connected to a traditional power"
