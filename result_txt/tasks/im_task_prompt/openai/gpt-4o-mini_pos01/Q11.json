    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology into the cap of the water bottle that activates when the bottle is closed. This feature would sanitize the inner surfaces of the bottle and the water, killing bacteria and viruses without the need for harsh chemicals or manual cleaning. Users would benefit from having a consistently clean drinking environment.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a water bottle with interchangeable components, allowing users to customize it based on their needs. For example, users could switch out the base for a larger capacity, add a compartment for snacks, or attach a filter for purifying water from natural sources. This would make the bottle versatile for different activities, such as hiking, gym sessions, or daily commuting.",
    "**Built-in Infuser and Flavoring System**: Design a water bottle that includes a built-in infuser chamber where users can add fruits, herbs, or even flavor pods. The bottle would have a mechanism to release the flavors gradually, allowing users to enjoy flavored water without the mess of traditional infusers. This would encourage more people to drink water by making it more enjoyable.",
    "**Temperature Regulation**: Implement a double-walled vacuum insulation with a built-in temperature regulation system that can keep beverages cold or hot for extended periods. Users could set their desired temperature through a touch-sensitive panel on the bottle, and it would use a battery-powered system to maintain that temperature, ensuring that drinks are always at the preferred temperature.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Recycling Program**: Create a water bottle made entirely from biodegradable or recycled materials, along with a program that encourages users to return their old bottles for recycling. Each returned bottle could earn users discounts on future purchases. This initiative would not only reduce plastic waste but also promote sustainability among consumers."
