    "**Space Constraints**: Office spaces are often limited, and finding enough space for group exercises or fitness activities can be a challenge. This could limit the types of activities that can be offered and may discourage participation.",

    "**Resistance to Change**: Some employees may be resistant to change and may not be willing to participate in a fitness program. This could lead to a lack of motivation and a low participation rate.",
    "**Lack of Support**: Without proper support from management and HR, employees may feel that their fitness goals are not being taken seriously and may not be motivated to participate in the program.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: Introducing fitness activities in an office setting could raise safety concerns, especially if the activities are not properly supervised or if the office space is not conducive to physical activity."
