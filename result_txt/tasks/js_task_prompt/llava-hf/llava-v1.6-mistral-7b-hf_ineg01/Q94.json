    "Kinetic Energy Harvesting from Ocean Waves: This energy would be generated by installing underwater turbines that capture the kinetic energy of ocean waves. These turbines would be designed to move with the waves, using their motion to generate electricity. The electricity would then be transmitted through underwater cables to the shore, where it would be distributed to homes and businesses. This would provide a clean and renewable source of energy that is not dependent on weather conditions like wind.",
    "Thermoelectric Energy Generation: This type of energy would be generated by using the heat difference between hot and cold environments to produce electricity. For example, the heat generated by industrial processes could be used to power a thermoelectric generator, which would convert the heat into electricity. This electricity could then be used to power the industry and, if surplus, be fed into the grid for wider distribution.",
    "Nuclear Energy with Advanced Fuel Cycles: While nuclear energy is already in use, this type of energy would utilize advanced fuel cycles to minimize waste and improve efficiency. This would involve the development of new nuclear reactors that use advanced fuels, such as molten salt reactors or liquid metal fast breeder reactors, which would reduce the amount of waste generated and increase the energy output. The energy produced would be used to power homes, businesses, and industries.",
    "Geothermal Energy from the Earth's Core: This type of energy would be generated by drilling deep into the Earth's crust to access the geothermal energy stored in the Earth's core. This energy could be used to power homes, businesses, and industries, providing a clean and renewable source of energy that is not dependent on weather conditions. The energy would be extracted through a series of pipes that would circulate water or other fluids to heat exchangers, which would then convert the heat into electricity.",
    "Human-Powered Energy: This type of energy would be generated by capturing the kinetic energy of human movement. This could be achieved by installing power-generating floors in public spaces, such as shopping malls, where people walk or stand for extended periods. The energy generated would be used to power lighting and other electrical systems within the building, with any surplus being fed into the grid."
