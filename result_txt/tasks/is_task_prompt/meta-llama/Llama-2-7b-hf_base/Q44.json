    "(T, F) Talk about his dog, but try not to bring her up to girls. F's mad that he didn't ask me out in high school. But there are no do-overs so she got over that pretty quick. You never want to look stupid on the first date. I mean when I did my college resume, it was a banger, but... the one I showed the guys, man let's just, I'll never do another one. Sorry dad. I always wanted to be someone you'd be proud of. You're going to have the worst parent in the office. Sorry for your colleagues dad.",
    "(T, F) Talk about girls. Taking the girls, he's like me right?",
    "Tip the waiter/waitress, you're on a date it's not about spending.",
    "(T, F). Talk in circles for hours on the first couple dates, it takes forever to connect. He likes my laugh and says my eyes light up and that's always cute. Man, I try to hide the eyes awhile but that didn't go so well so I just started doing \"money\" gestures but then I felt like he said \"don't bother\". Never know how good of luck you had 'til time moves. I didn't believe guys with the looks or all \"cops, fireman and soldiers\". After all their stories, well it's easy to make them up in that industry. I liked that we didn't work together so I got over that. You'd kill to go back at the start would you? Ohh well you always learn new information by accident, but I'm glad you're done with the boring one and ready to roll with somebody less... annoying like my dog, F (she isn't annoying when she's on your chest though). It takes a while, so you never know your in a boring story or not, but hey this place used to be fun, I mean you guys were a lot less stuck up before. The thing I liked was how fast things turned from just me and 2 friends here at this place eating alone to here comes this boss who's trying sooo hard with me. And everyone in the office wants to talk about what happened? So, all we have to do now... well not all the dating... and I am not interested so just... yeah. I'm good for now.",
    "(T, F) He got into talking about my old boss and said all that shit was the best... then \"ok let's go\""
