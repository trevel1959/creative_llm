    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop a calculator app that uses augmented reality to visualize complex mathematical concepts. For instance, when a user inputs a geometric calculation, the app could project a 3D model of the shape involved. This could help users better understand spatial relationships and improve their grasp of geometry through interactive visualization.",
    "**Voice-Activated Functionality**: Create a voice-activated calculator that allows users to perform calculations hands-free. This feature would be particularly useful for professionals in fields like engineering or construction, where they may need to calculate while handling materials. Users could simply speak their calculations, and the calculator would provide audible results and feedback.",
    "**Social Collaboration Feature**: Implement a social collaboration feature within a calculator app that allows users to share problems and solutions with peers in real-time. This could be especially beneficial for students working on homework together or professionals collaborating on projects. Users could discuss methods, share tips, and even challenge each other with math puzzles.",
    "**Gamified Learning Experience**: Transform the calculator into a gamified learning tool where users earn points or rewards for completing calculations or solving math challenges. Users could progress through levels, unlocking new features and capabilities as they improve their skills. This approach could make learning math more engaging and motivate users to practice more frequently.",
    "**Environmental Impact Calculator**: Add a feature that allows users to calculate the environmental impact of their choices. For example, when inputting data related to travel, energy consumption, or food choices, the calculator could provide insights into carbon footprints or resource usage. This could help users make more informed decisions and promote sustainability."
