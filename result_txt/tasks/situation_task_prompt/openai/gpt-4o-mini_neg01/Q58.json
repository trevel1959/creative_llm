    "**Insect-Specific Traps with AI**: Create advanced traps equipped with AI technology that can identify and capture specific pest species based on their behavior and movement patterns. These traps could use visual recognition software to distinguish between harmful insects and harmless ones, ensuring that only pests are removed from the environment while allowing beneficial insects to thrive.",
    "**Ecological Engineering**: Design urban and agricultural environments that mimic natural ecosystems, using plant diversity to create habitats that attract beneficial insects like pollinators and predatory insects. This approach would involve planting a variety of flora that naturally repels pests or attracts their natural enemies, thereby maintaining a balanced ecosystem without the need for chemical interventions.",
    "**Sound-Based Repellents**: Develop devices that emit sound frequencies specifically designed to repel certain pest species. Research has shown that certain insects are sensitive to specific sound wavelengths, so creating devices that can produce these frequencies could help deter pests from invading homes or crops without causing harm to other wildlife.",
    "**Insect-Specific Biopesticides**: Formulate biopesticides derived from natural plant extracts or organic compounds that specifically target pest insects. By using compounds that are less harmful to humans and the environment, these biopesticides can effectively manage pest populations while promoting ecological health.",
    "**Educational Campaigns for DIY Solutions**: Launch educational initiatives that teach communities how to create their own pest deterrents using common household items. Workshops could cover topics such as making natural insect repellents from essential oils, building homemade traps, and cultivating plants that deter pests. This grassroots approach empowers individuals to manage pest problems sustainably."
