    "**Pencil and Paper Method**: In this creative idea, you could use traditional methods of information storage. Write down important information on paper or in a notebook. This would require a lot of time and effort, but it's a viable solution if all digital infrastructure is unavailable. The confidence score for this idea is high because it relies on basic human skills that have been used for centuries.",
    "**Physical Books and Libraries**: If you have access to a physical book or a library, you can read and take notes manually. This method ensures you have the information you need without relying on digital resources. However, it might not be practical for large amounts of data or quick access to information. The confidence score for this idea is moderate because it depends on location and availability of physical resources.",
    "**Memory and Mental Note-Taking**: In an extreme scenario where digital resources are unavailable, one could try to memorize information and later write it down when possible. This method is limited by personal memory capacity and is only feasible for short-term or less complex information. The confidence score for this idea is low due to its limitations in terms of information retention and accessibility.",
    "**Pre-Recorded Audio or Video Tapes**: Using older technology such as cassette tapes or VHS tapes could provide a way to store and retrieve information. This method is labor-intensive and requires proper equipment for playback. It's also limited by the size and format of pre-recorded content. The confidence score for this idea is medium-low because it's not practical for accessing large amounts of information quickly.",
    "**Personalized Information Retrieval System (PIRS)**: A creative concept could involve developing a system that allows individuals to store information on removable media (like flash drives) and then manually retrieve it when needed. This system could include a database of important information organized by categories, with each category containing subcategories for specific topics. When information is needed, the user would access their PIRS, locate the relevant section, and manually retrieve the data. The confidence score for this idea is high because it combines traditional methods with some modern concepts, offering a potential solution for accessing information in a digital infrastructure failure scenario."
