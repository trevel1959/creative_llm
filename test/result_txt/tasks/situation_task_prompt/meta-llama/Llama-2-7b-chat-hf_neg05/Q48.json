    "Sunrise Simulation: In a world without birds, the sunrise could be simulated using advanced LED technology. Each morning, a series of colored lights could be projected onto the sky, mimicking the gradual brightening of the sun. This would allow people to still experience the natural beauty of a sunrise without the need for an alarm clock.",
    "Sonic Alarm: Instead of birds chirping, a new type of sonic alarm could be developed that uses a combination of high-pitched frequencies and nature sounds to wake people up. For example, a gentle ocean wave or a gentle breeze could be programmed to gradually increase in volume until the alarm goes off.",
    "Personalized Dreams: In a world without birds, people could use advanced technology to record and analyze their dreams. Each night, a personalized dream sequence could be created based on the individual's subconscious desires and fears. When the dream sequence is over, the alarm could go off, signaling the start of a new day.",
    "Light Harvesting: In a world without birds, light could be harvested from the sun and stored in special devices called \"light banks.\" These devices could be placed in strategic locations around the home, such as windowsills or corners, and would gradually release light throughout the day to simulate the natural light-dark cycle. When it's time to wake up, the light bank could be programmed to release a burst of light to signal the start of the day.",
    "Smell-O-Scope: In a world without birds, a new type of alarm clock could be developed that uses scent to wake people up. The device could be programmed to release a specific scent at a set time each day, such as the smell of freshly brewed coffee or a citrusy fragrance. The scent could be released through a small device that hangs on the wall or through a wearable device that can be worn on the wrist. As the scent fills the room, it would signal the start of a new day."
