    "**Wearable Umbrella Hat**: Design a wearable umbrella that can be worn like a hat. This would have adjustable clips to fit different head sizes, and could be made of lightweight, UV-protective materials. The umbrella would fold down when not in use for convenience.",
    "**Reflective Sun Cap**: Create a cap made of a reflective material such as aluminum or mirror-polished stainless steel. The cap would reflect sunlight away from the head, reducing the risk of sunburn. It could be lined with a soft fabric for comfort.",
    "**Solar-Powered Cooling Hat**: Develop a hat that incorporates solar panels on its crown, which power fans or cooling mechanisms built into the inner layer of the hat. This would provide both sun protection and a cooling effect, keeping the head comfortable during hot days.",
    "**Smart Headwear with Built-in Sunscreen**: Design a cap or headband that contains a micro-dosing system for sunscreen. The device could release small doses of sunscreen through tiny dispensers when triggered by ultraviolet light sensors. This would ensure continuous protection without the need for manual application.",
    "**Invisible Sunscreen Paint**: Create a transparent, odorless, and tasteless paint that can be applied directly to the scalp and hairline. This paint would contain active sunscreen ingredients and could be reapplied throughout the day. It could also be designed to blend seamlessly with the hair color for an undetectable appearance."
