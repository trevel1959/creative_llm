    "A house that has the power to teleport itself and its occupants to different locations, making it seem like magic. The jealousy you feel is because you wish you had a house that could take you places without the need for transportation.",
    "A house that can transform into a giant robot and go on missions to complete tasks for its occupants. The jealousy you feel is because you wish you had a house that could do things for you that you don't have the time or ability to do yourself.",
    "A house that has a team of tiny, miniature robots that work together to complete tasks, making it seem like a well-oiled machine. The jealousy you feel is because you wish you had a team of tiny helpers that could take care of tasks for you with ease."
