    "Interactive Cereal Box: Create a cereal box that doubles as a game console. The box could have different sections that, when pressed, reveal hidden surprises or games. For example, a \"breakfast bingo\" game where the player has to find and scratch off different breakfast foods to win prizes.",
    "Smart Cereal Box: Develop a cereal box that tracks your breakfast routine and provides personalized recommendations based on your eating habits. The box could have a built-in scale, accelerometer, and AI assistant to monitor your daily breakfast choices and suggest healthier options based on your dietary needs.",
    "Customizable Cereal Box: Create a cereal box that allows consumers to customize their breakfast experience. The box could have different compartments for different cereals, and a built-in mixer that allows the consumer to create their perfect blend. The box could also have a QR code that links to a customizable recipe app, where consumers can find new and exciting breakfast ideas.",
    "Sustainable Cereal Box: Develop a cereal box that is fully compostable and biodegradable. The box could be made from plant-based materials and designed to break down quickly in the environment, reducing waste and minimizing the impact on landfills. The box could also have a built-in compost bin, where consumers can add their food scraps and help reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "Augmented Reality Cereal Box: Create a cereal box that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to bring the breakfast experience to life. The box could have a special AR filter that, when activated, shows animated characters, games, or stories that are related to the cereal brand. This would provide a fun and engaging way for kids to eat their breakfast and make the experience more memorable."
