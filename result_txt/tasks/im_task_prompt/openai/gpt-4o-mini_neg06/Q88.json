    "**Adjustable Shock Absorption System**: Develop ski poles with an adjustable shock absorption mechanism that can be customized based on the skier's weight, skill level, and terrain. This system would allow skiers to switch between softer settings for powder snow and firmer settings for icy conditions, providing better stability and reducing strain on the joints during downhill runs.",
    "**Built-in Fitness Tracker**: Incorporate a fitness tracker into the ski poles that monitors heart rate, calories burned, and distance traveled. The poles could sync with a mobile app to provide skiers with detailed analytics about their performance, helping them set goals and improve their fitness levels while skiing. This feature would be especially appealing to those looking to maintain their health while enjoying the slopes.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Design ski poles with built-in safety features such as an emergency whistle, reflective materials for visibility in low light, and a small LED light at the tip of the pole. This would enhance visibility during night skiing or in poor weather conditions and provide skiers with a means to signal for help in case of an emergency.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip with Heating Elements**: Create ski poles with an ergonomic grip that includes built-in heating elements. These grips could be activated to warm up the hands on particularly cold days, improving comfort and control. The heating could be powered by a rechargeable battery that also charges via USB, making it convenient for skiers to stay warm.",
    "**Modular Design for Multi-Functionality**: Innovate ski poles with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out different attachments for various functions. For example, poles could have interchangeable tips for different snow conditions, a detachable camera mount for capturing action shots, or a built-in bottle opener for apr√®s-ski relaxation. This versatility would appeal to skiers who want a multi-functional tool on the slopes."
