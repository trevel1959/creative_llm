    "**Eco-Floats**: Design a series of interconnected, floating eco-villages made from recycled and sustainable materials. These villages would be built on top of large, floating platforms, providing a unique and adaptive solution to rising sea levels. Each Eco-Float would be equipped with: \t* Vertical farms and greenhouses for food production",
    "**The Arc**: Envision a sustainable living community built into the sides of hills or mountains, using a combination of natural and artificial terrain shaping. The Arc would feature: \t* A series of interconnected, curved structures that blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape",
    "**BioMorph**: Develop a community that incorporates living, breathing organisms into its design. BioMorph would feature: \t* A mix of natural and synthetic materials, including mycelium, algae, and other bioluminescent organisms",
    "**The Nest**: Design a community that incorporates modular, prefabricated housing units made from sustainable materials. The Nest would feature: \t* A series of interconnected, curved structures that resemble a bird's nest",
    "**The Hive**: Envision a community that incorporates advanced, decentralized energy systems and a focus on community-driven decision-making. The Hive would feature: \t* A network of interconnected, modular energy harvesting and storage units"
