    "**Economic Rebalancing**: The immediate impact of erasing all world debt would likely result in an economic rebalancing across nations. Countries heavily burdened by debt, such as those in the Global South, would experience a significant boost in their economies, allowing for increased spending on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social programs. This could lead to a reduction in poverty and an improvement in overall living standards.",
    "**Financial System Overhaul**: The global financial system would need to undergo a major overhaul. Banks and financial institutions would need to adjust their business models to accommodate the new reality where traditional lending mechanisms might become less necessary. This could lead to the development of alternative financing methods, such as community lending circles, cooperative banking, or digital currencies designed to support economic transactions without relying on debt.",
    "**Investment and Innovation**: With the burden of debt lifted, individuals and businesses worldwide would have more disposable income, potentially leading to a surge in investment and innovation. People would be more inclined to invest in long-term projects and startups, knowing they are not tied down by debt obligations. This could drive growth in sectors like renewable energy, biotechnology, and space exploration.",
    "**Global Cooperation**: Erasing all world debt could catalyze a new era of global cooperation. Nations might be more willing to work together on shared goals such as climate change mitigation, pandemic response, and global health initiatives. The sense of collective responsibility would encourage countries to share resources and knowledge, leading to more equitable solutions to global challenges.",
    "**Long-term Sustainability Challenges**: While the short-term effects could be positive, there would also be long-term sustainability challenges. For instance, countries might face pressure to maintain high levels of spending, which could lead to inflation or over-spending if not managed carefully. Additionally, the absence of debt could shift the focus from paying off loans to ensuring consistent economic growth, potentially requiring new strategies in fiscal management and international trade agreements."
