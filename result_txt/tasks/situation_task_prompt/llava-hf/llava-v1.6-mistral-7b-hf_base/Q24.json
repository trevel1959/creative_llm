    "Assistive Technology: The development of assistive technology, such as smart glasses with built-in magnification or augmented reality glasses, could help people with poor vision see more clearly. These devices can be designed to enhance visual acuity and provide real-time feedback to users.",
    "Haptic Feedback Devices: Haptic feedback devices, such as tactile gloves or vests, could be used to provide tactile cues to people with poor vision. These devices can be programmed to alert users to obstacles or other hazards in their environment, allowing them to navigate safely.",
    "Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality: Virtual and augmented reality technologies can be used to create immersive environments that simulate the effects of vision correction. This could help people with poor vision adapt to their environment and improve their overall quality of life.",
    "Genetic Engineering: Scientists could explore genetic engineering techniques to modify genes associated with vision and develop new treatments for vision impairments. This could lead to the development of new vision correction methods that are more effective and longer-lasting.",
    "Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology could be used to create tiny robots that can be injected into the eye to repair damaged cells or stimulate the growth of new ones. This could help restore vision in people with age-related macular degeneration or other vision impairments."
