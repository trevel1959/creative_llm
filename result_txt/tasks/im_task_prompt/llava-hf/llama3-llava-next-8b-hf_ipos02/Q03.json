    "Energy Efficiency: Implement an energy-saving mode that reduces power consumption when the microwave is not in use. This could be activated automatically when the appliance is not in use for a certain period or when it's not being actively heated.",
    "Customizable Settings: Allow users to customize the microwave's settings, such as adjusting the heating time or temperature, to better suit their specific needs. This could be done through a digital interface or by adjusting the dials on the appliance.",
    "Multi-Functional Cooking: Expand the microwave's functionality to include multiple cooking modes, such as convection baking, broiling, or air frying. This would make the appliance more versatile and potentially reduce the need for additional kitchen appliances.",
    "Self-Cleaning Features: Incorporate self-cleaning features, such as a self-cleaning mode that uses a combination of steam and gentle cleaning agents to remove food residue and stains. This would make cleaning the microwave easier and more efficient.",
    "Built-in Storage: Add built-in storage compartments for storing microwave-safe containers, utensils, or accessories. This would keep the appliance organized and make it easier to find the necessary items when needed."
