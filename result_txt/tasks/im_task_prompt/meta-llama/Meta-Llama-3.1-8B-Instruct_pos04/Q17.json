    "**Smart Laundry Sorter**: Develop a smart laundry sorter that uses AI-powered sensors to identify the type of fabric, color, and soil level of each garment. It would then sort the clothes into different compartments, ensuring that delicate items are washed separately from heavier or bulkier items. The device could also provide real-time feedback on the most efficient washing cycle, detergent usage, and energy consumption.",
    "**Laundry Chute with Automated Folding**: Design a laundry chute with an integrated automated folding system. Clothes would be sorted and folded as they fall into the chute, saving time and effort. The system could use robotic arms or a series of rollers to gently fold and stack clothes, making it easier to put away clean laundry.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Washing Machine**: Create a washing machine that uses advanced nanotechnology to clean itself. The device would have a self-healing coating that prevents bacterial growth and odor buildup. It could also detect and remove any remaining detergent residue, ensuring a fresh and clean environment for each wash cycle.",
    "**Laundry Tracking System**: Develop a laundry tracking system that uses RFID tags or QR codes to monitor the status of each garment. Users could track the washing cycle, drying time, and folding process in real-time, receiving notifications when their clothes are ready. The system could also provide personalized recommendations for fabric care and stain removal.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Washing Machine with Biodegradable Detergent**: Design a washing machine that uses a biodegradable detergent made from natural ingredients, reducing the environmental impact of laundry day. The device could also incorporate a built-in water recycling system, minimizing water waste and conserving resources. The machine would use advanced sensors to detect the type of fabric and adjust the washing cycle accordingly, ensuring optimal cleaning while minimizing energy consumption."
