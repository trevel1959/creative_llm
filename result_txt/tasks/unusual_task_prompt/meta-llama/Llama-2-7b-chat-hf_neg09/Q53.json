    "Virtual Keyboard: Create a virtual keyboard that allows users to type on a virtual surface. This can be projected onto a wall or screen, providing a more immersive experience for gamers, writers, and those who prefer a larger typing surface. The virtual keyboard can be customized with different layouts, themes, and fonts, and can even include features like a built-in grammar and spelling checker.",
    "Smart Keyboard Case: Design a keyboard case that can transform into a smart keyboard. The case can be used to protect a user's keyboard when not in use, and can also provide additional features like a built-in touchpad, gesture recognition, and even a small display for viewing notifications. This would be particularly useful for those who use their keyboard frequently, such as gamers or writers.",
    "Keyboard-Controlled Game Console: Create a game console that can be controlled entirely through a keyboard. This would be a unique and innovative way for gamers to play their favorite games without the need for a controller. The keyboard can be used to control game characters, navigate menus, and even interact with other players. This would be especially useful for those who prefer a more tactile and precise way of controlling their games.",
    "Customizable Keyboard Lighting: Develop a keyboard with customizable lighting options. The keyboard can be programmed to change colors, patterns, or even react to different in-game events or music. This can provide a unique and personalized gaming experience, and can even be used to create a customized light show for parties or events.",
    "Haptic Feedback Keyboard: Create a keyboard that provides haptic feedback to the user. This can take the form of vibrations, textured surfaces, or even temperature changes. The haptic feedback can be used to enhance the gaming experience by providing a more immersive and realistic feel, or can be used to provide subtle cues and feedback during typing. This can be particularly useful for gamers who prefer a more tactile and immersive experience."
