    "**Coastal Exploration**: With mountains out of the picture, coastlines would take center stage. Activities like beach volleyball, kayaking, and paddleboarding would thrive. New eco-tourism opportunities could arise, such as guided tours to explore tide pools, marine life, and coastal ecosystems. You could also engage in beach clean-up events that promote environmental awareness while enjoying the sun and surf.",
    "**Urban Green Spaces**: Cities could enhance their parks and green spaces to compensate for the loss of mountains. Think of multi-level urban parks with walking trails, bike paths, and community gardens.

Rooftop gardens could offer a unique perspective of the city, creating spaces for relaxation and social gatherings.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Trails**: Without mountains, there would be a shift towards exploring cultural and historical sites. You could embark on hiking trails that lead to ancient ruins, historical landmarks, or traditional villages. This would provide an opportunity for cultural immersion, where you could participate in local crafts, cooking classes, and storytelling sessions, enriching your outdoor experience with knowledge and connection to different cultures.",
    "**River and Lake Activities**: With the absence of mountains, rivers and lakes would become the focal points for outdoor activities. You could engage in fishing, canoeing, or sailing, exploring the natural beauty of waterways. Campsites along riverbanks could host weekend getaways with bonfires, storytelling, and stargazing. Nature photography excursions could become popular, capturing the serene beauty of the landscapes and wildlife that thrive around these water bodies.",
    "**Wildflower Trails**: In a mountain-less world, plains and meadows would burst with wildflowers, creating picturesque hiking trails. You could enjoy leisurely walks or organized wildflower festivals, where participants can learn about local plant species and their ecological importance. Photography workshops could also be held, teaching enthusiasts how to capture the vibrant colors and textures of blooming fields, turning outdoor exploration into an artistic endeavor."
