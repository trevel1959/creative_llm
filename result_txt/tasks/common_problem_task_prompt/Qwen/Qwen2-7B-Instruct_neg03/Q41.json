    "**Integrating Living Spaces with Artificial Gravity:** Design a spaceship that utilizes advanced technology to create artificial gravity in certain areas, allowing for more comfortable living spaces for long-duration space missions. This idea incorporates biomes or living quarters that mimic Earth-like conditions, providing psychological benefits to the crew. The ship could have zones dedicated to agriculture (for fresh food), recreation (like gyms or entertainment rooms), and residential areas. The artificial gravity is created through rotating sections of the ship, providing a sensation similar to Earth's gravity.",
    "**Energy Harvesting from Space Debris:** Develop a spaceship capable of extracting energy from space debris, such as old satellites, rockets, and other orbital debris. By integrating specialized sensors and robotic arms, the ship can detect and capture these pieces, using them as sources of raw materials for construction and energy generation. This innovative design promotes sustainability and resourcefulness in space exploration.",
    "**Spacecraft as a Self-sustaining Ecosystem:** Design a spaceship that functions as a self-contained ecosystem, incorporating elements like closed-loop life support systems, renewable energy production, and recycling facilities. The ship could grow its own food, produce oxygen, and recycle water and waste, mimicking Earth's natural processes. This concept not only reduces dependency on Earth but also makes long-term space missions more feasible and sustainable.",
    "**Teleportation Module Prototype:** While still a theoretical concept, explore the development of a teleportation module that could potentially transport the ship's crew and cargo across vast distances instantaneously. This idea would revolutionize space travel by drastically reducing journey times. The teleportation module would require extensive research into quantum entanglement and wormholes, which are currently beyond our current technological capabilities. However, it offers an exciting vision for future space exploration.",
    "**Incorporating AI for Crew Well-being:** Design a spaceship with advanced AI systems integrated into its infrastructure to monitor and enhance crew well-being. These AI systems could provide personalized health advice, emotional support, and even help with tasks like managing daily routines and entertainment. By addressing mental health concerns and providing companionship, the AI would contribute significantly to the overall comfort and productivity of the crew during extended missions."
