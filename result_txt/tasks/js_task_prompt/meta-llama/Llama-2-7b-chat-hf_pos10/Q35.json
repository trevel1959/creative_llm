    "Woolly Mammoth - With the increasing awareness of the impact of climate change on the environment, the Woolly Mammoth would be a great choice to bring back to life. They were well adapted to cold climates and could help restore balance to the Arctic ecosystem. Additionally, their large size and herbivorous diet would make them a valuable asset for controlling invasive plant species.",
    "Quagga - The Quagga was a subspecies of zebra that went extinct in the late 19th century due to overhunting. Their distinctive stripes were unique among zebras and could help restore balance to the African savannah ecosystem. By bringing back the Quagga, we could also help protect other endangered species that share their habitat.",
    "Passenger Pigeon - Once the most abundant bird species in North America, the Passenger Pigeon went extinct in 1914 due to overhunting and habitat loss. Bringing them back to life would not only restore a vital component of the ecosystem but also serve as a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts. With their ability to fly in large flocks, they could also help control insect and disease populations.",
    "Thylacine - Also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, the Thylacine was a carnivorous marsupial that went extinct in the early 20th century. Their unique dental structure and powerful jaws made them effective predators, and their ability to adapt to different environments would make them valuable in reintroducing them to ecosystems where they are needed.",
    "Moa - The Moa was a large flightless bird that went extinct in New Zealand around the 15th century. They were an important food source for the indigenous Maori people and could be valuable in restoring balance to the ecosystem. With their size and strength, they could also help control invasive plant species and provide a new source of food for local communities."
