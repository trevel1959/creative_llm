    "**Cultural Exchange Workshops:** Create a series of workshops where the exchange student can share their country's culture with your community. This could include cooking classes for traditional dishes, art demonstrations (like calligraphy or pottery), dance lessons, or music performances. These events not only educate locals about the student's culture but also provide a platform for them to practice and improve their language skills.",
    "**Local Language Immersion Classes:** Offer a special class where local students are paired with the exchange student to learn their native language. This could be done in a classroom setting or through interactive activities that encourage conversation and cultural exchange. The goal is to create a supportive environment where everyone learns from each other.",
    "**Cross-Cultural Sports Tournaments:** Organize sports events that highlight both your local traditions and the exchange student's culture. For example, if they come from a country known for martial arts, organize a tournament featuring various martial arts styles. This not only promotes physical activity but also encourages participants to learn more about each other's cultures.",
    "**Community Service Projects:** Engage the exchange student in community service projects that benefit both your community and theirs. For instance, they could help clean up local parks, assist in community gardens, or work on environmental conservation efforts. This helps build mutual understanding and fosters a sense of global citizenship.",
    "**International Film Festival:** Host a film festival featuring movies from around the world, including those from the exchange student's country. Screenings could be followed by discussions led by the student, inviting insights into the themes, societal impacts, and cultural significance of the films. This not only exposes the community to diverse cinematic experiences but also sparks conversations about cultural differences and similarities."
