    "**Biometric Tattoo**: Develop a unique, high-tech tattoo that contains a microchip with an individual's biometric data, such as fingerprints, iris scans, and DNA. This tattoo would be virtually unalterable and serve as a secure form of identification. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Neural Network Implant**: Create a brain-computer interface (BCI) implant that stores a person's identity and can be accessed through neural signals. This implant would be implanted under the skin and would require a specific neural pattern to authenticate the individual. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Quantum Dot Implant**: Develop a tiny implant that contains quantum dots, which are tiny particles that can store vast amounts of data. These quantum dots would be embedded under the skin and would serve as a secure, high-capacity storage device for an individual's identity. (Confidence score: 0.6)",
    "**Personal Aura**: Create a device that generates a unique, personalized aura that can be detected by specialized sensors. This aura would be a combination of an individual's biometric data, environmental factors, and personal characteristics, making it virtually impossible to replicate. (Confidence score: 0.5)",
    "**Digital Twin**: Develop a digital twin of each individual, which would be a virtual representation of their identity, including their biometric data, medical history, and personal preferences. This digital twin would be stored in a secure, decentralized network and could be accessed through a secure authentication process. (Confidence score: 0.9)"
