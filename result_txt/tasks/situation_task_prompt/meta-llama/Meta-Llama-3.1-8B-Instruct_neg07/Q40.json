    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a wearable backpack with integrated solar panels that can harness energy from the sun, allowing you to charge your devices on-the-go. The backpack would have a sleek, compact design with multiple pockets for storage and a built-in power bank to store excess energy. This innovative solution would provide a reliable and portable power source, making it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, and emergency responders.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop shoes with built-in kinetic energy harvesting technology that captures the energy generated by every step, stride, or movement. This energy would be stored in a small power bank within the shoe, which could then be used to charge devices. The shoes would have a sleek, modern design with interchangeable insoles and a wireless charging system for seamless device charging.",
    "**Bioluminescent Power Source**: Explore the potential of bioluminescent organisms to create a sustainable power source. By harnessing the energy produced by these organisms, you could develop a unique, eco-friendly power solution. This innovative approach would involve cultivating bioluminescent organisms in a controlled environment, collecting their energy, and converting it into a usable form. This could be achieved through a specialized bio-reactor or a wearable device that incorporates bioluminescent cells.",
    "**Piezoelectric Roadways**: Design a network of piezoelectric roadways that generate electricity from the weight and movement of vehicles. As cars drive over the road, the piezoelectric material would convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, which could be fed into the power grid or used to charge devices. This innovative solution would provide a sustainable and efficient way to harness energy from urban infrastructure.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that harvests energy from the atmosphere, using the difference in temperature and humidity between the air and a condenser to generate electricity. This device would be powered by a combination of heat and humidity, making it an ideal solution for areas with high temperatures and humidity levels. The harvested energy could be used to charge devices, power homes, or even fuel vehicles."
