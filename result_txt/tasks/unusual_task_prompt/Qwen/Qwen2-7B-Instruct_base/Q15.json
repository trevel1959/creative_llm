    "**Inflatable Pillow Lounger:** Create a versatile pillow that can be inflated into a comfortable lounger. The pillow would have a built-in air pump, allowing it to expand from a compact size for easy storage to a full-sized lounger. This idea would be perfect for camping, beach days, or just relaxing in the backyard. The material should be durable and comfortable to ensure a pleasant experience.",
    "**Therapeutic Pillow with Heating Function:** Design a pillow that not only provides comfort but also offers therapeutic benefits. It would have an integrated heating system controlled by a remote, enabling users to adjust the temperature according to their needs. This could be particularly useful for people suffering from muscle pain or arthritis, providing warmth to help soothe aching muscles.",
    "**Sound-activated Pillow:** Develop a pillow that emits soothing sounds when placed against the head. The pillow would use motion sensors to detect when someone is lying down and automatically play gentle music or white noise. This feature could help improve sleep quality by reducing external noise distractions and promoting relaxation.",
    "**Smart Pillow with Health Monitoring:** Integrate a smart sensor into the pillow that tracks various metrics like heart rate, breathing patterns, and sleep stages. The data collected could be transmitted to a smartphone app, providing insights into one's sleep quality and helping users make necessary lifestyle changes to improve their health. This innovative pillow could revolutionize the way people think about sleep and its impact on overall well-being.",
    "**Rechargeable and Portable Pillow:** Design a lightweight, portable pillow that comes with a built-in rechargeable battery. This would allow users to take the pillow anywhere, ensuring a comfortable rest even in unexpected situations. The pillow could also double as a power bank, charging other devices such as smartphones or tablets. Additionally, it could have a USB port for charging directly from a wall outlet or a car charger, making it highly convenient for travel or outdoor activities."
