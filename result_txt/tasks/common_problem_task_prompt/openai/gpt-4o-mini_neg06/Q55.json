    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding for the establishment and maintenance of the park can be challenging. Organizers could explore diverse funding sources, such as grants from environmental organizations, crowdfunding campaigns, partnerships with local businesses, and sponsorship opportunities. Creating a detailed budget and financial plan that outlines projected costs and potential income can help attract investors and donors.",
    "**Biodiversity Management**: Ensuring the protection and management of local flora and fauna is crucial. This could involve conducting a comprehensive biodiversity assessment to identify species that need protection, as well as creating management plans for invasive species. Collaborating with local ecologists and conservation experts can help develop strategies for habitat restoration and species conservation.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Navigating the legal and regulatory framework for establishing a conservation park can be complex. This may include zoning laws, land use regulations, and environmental assessments. Engaging legal experts early in the process can help identify potential hurdles and ensure compliance with all necessary regulations. Additionally, creating a clear plan for environmental impact assessments can facilitate smoother approvals.",
    "**Sustainable Tourism Development**: While eco-tourism can provide funding and awareness, it can also lead to environmental degradation if not managed properly. To mitigate this risk, planners could implement strict guidelines for visitor access, create designated trails to minimize habitat disruption, and educate visitors on responsible behavior within the park. Offering guided tours led by knowledgeable staff can enhance visitor experience while promoting conservation.",
    "**Infrastructure and Accessibility**: Developing the necessary infrastructure, such as trails, visitor centers, and restrooms, can pose logistical challenges. Planners should prioritize sustainable building practices and materials to minimize the park's environmental footprint. Additionally, ensuring that the park is accessible to individuals with disabilities and families with children can help broaden its appeal and usage."
