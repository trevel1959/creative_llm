    "**Language Barriers**: A foreign exchange student may have varying levels of proficiency in the host family's language, leading to potential miscommunication. This could result in frustration for both the student and the family. To address this, families can create a supportive environment by using simple language, incorporating visual aids, and engaging in language-learning activities together, such as cooking recipes from each other's cultures or playing language games.",
    "**Homesickness**: The student may experience homesickness, especially if they are far from their family and familiar surroundings. This can lead to feelings of isolation or sadness. To combat this, the host family can establish regular check-ins, encourage the student to maintain contact with their family through video calls, and involve them in local activities to help them feel more connected to their new environment.",
    "**Adjustment to Daily Routines**: The foreign exchange student may struggle to adapt to the host family's daily routines, such as meal times, household chores, or school schedules. This can create tension if expectations are not clearly communicated. To solve this, the host family can create a structured schedule that outlines daily activities, allowing the student to gradually adjust while also providing them with a sense of stability.",
    "**Integration into School Life**: The student might find it challenging to integrate into their new school environment, facing difficulties in making friends or participating in extracurricular activities. This can lead to feelings of exclusion. Host families can help by encouraging the student to join clubs or sports teams that align with their interests and facilitating introductions with peers, perhaps through social gatherings or school events.",
    "**Different Dietary Preferences**: The foreign exchange student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences based on their cultural background, which may not align with the host family's typical meals. This can lead to discomfort or dissatisfaction with food. To resolve this, the host family can have a discussion about dietary needs and preferences upon arrival, and even involve the student in meal planning and preparation, allowing them to share their culinary traditions."
