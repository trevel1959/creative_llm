    "Nanoparticle-based vaccine: Develop a vaccine that utilizes nanoparticles to deliver the disease-fighting antigens to the body. These nanoparticles can be engineered to target specific immune cells, such as dendritic cells, to enhance the immune response.",
    "Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine: Create a vaccine that utilizes VLPs, which are non-infectious particles that mimic the virus but do not contain any genetic material. These particles can stimulate an immune response without the risk of causing disease.",
    "Mucosal vaccine: Develop a vaccine that targets the mucosal surfaces of the body, such as the nose, throat, and lungs. These surfaces are the primary entry points for many diseases, and a vaccine that targets them can provide better protection.",
    "DNA vaccine: Develop a vaccine that uses DNA to encode the antigens of the disease. This vaccine can be delivered through a needle or inhalation and can stimulate an immune response by expressing the antigens in the body.",
    "Personalized vaccine: Develop a vaccine that is tailored to the"
