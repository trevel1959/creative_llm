    "Bartering System: In the absence of paper money and coins, people could adopt a bartering system where they exchange goods and services directly without using any medium of exchange. For example, a farmer could exchange fresh produce for a haircut or a carpenter could exchange a piece of furniture for a night's stay at a bed and breakfast. This system would promote mutual exchange and help people acquire the goods and services they need without relying on a centralized medium of exchange.",
    "Digital Wallets: With the rise of digital payments, people could use their smartphones or other devices to store and transfer value. Digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay could become the new medium of exchange. These wallets use near-field communication (NFC) technology to transmit payment information from one device to another, making transactions quick and easy.",
    "Cryptocurrencies: Another option could be to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as a new medium of exchange. These digital currencies use complex algorithms to secure transactions and verify the transfer of value without the need for intermediaries like banks. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them, and they can be easily transferred between individuals without the need for intermediaries.",
    "RFID Payments: Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology could be used to create contactless payment systems. RFID tags could be embedded in credit cards, phones, or other devices, allowing users to make payments by simply holding their device near a payment terminal. This technology is already used in some countries for public transportation and could be expanded to other areas.",
    "Holographic Displays: In a more futuristic scenario, holographic displays could become the new medium of exchange. Holographic displays project a three-dimensional image of an object or person, allowing users to interact with it as if it were real. In a payment context, holographic displays could be used to project a virtual cashier or to display prices and menus in a restaurant. This technology is still in its infancy, but it could potentially revolutionize the way we pay for things in the future."
