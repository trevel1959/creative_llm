    "Artificial Sunlight: One idea could be to create an artificial sun that can provide light even on cloudy days. This could be done by using mirrors or lenses to reflect sunlight onto a surface that can then be converted into usable energy. The artificial sun could also be designed to mimic natural sunlight in terms of color temperature and intensity, ensuring that it is safe for human use.",
    "Solar-Powered Domes: Another idea could be to construct solar-powered domes over cities or regions that experience frequent cloud cover. These domes could be equipped with solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, which could then be used to power homes, businesses, and other infrastructure within the dome. The domes could also be designed to regulate temperature and humidity levels inside, providing a comfortable environment even on cloudy days.",
    "Vertical Farms: Cloudy weather could present a challenge for agriculture, but one solution could be to build vertical farms that are located indoors and use artificial lighting to simulate sunlight. These farms could be equipped with advanced hydroponic systems that allow plants to grow without soil, using water and nutrients instead. With vertical farms, crops could be grown year-round, regardless of weather conditions, providing a reliable source of fresh produce for local communities.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: Cloudy weather could make driving difficult, especially in areas where roads are poorly lit. However, one idea could be to develop solar-powered vehicles that can operate even in low-light conditions. These vehicles could be equipped with solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, which could then be used to power the vehicle's electric motor. With solar-powered vehicles, people could travel safely and efficiently, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Blocking Technology: Finally, there could be a technological solution to block clouds from casting shadows on the ground. This could involve developing a type of material or technology that can be deployed in strategic locations to prevent clouds from passing overhead. While this may not be a practical solution for everyone, it could be useful in certain situations where access to sunlight is critical, such as in areas with limited solar resources."
