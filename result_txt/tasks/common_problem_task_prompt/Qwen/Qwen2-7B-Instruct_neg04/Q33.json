    "**Innovative Aquaculture System**: Design an aquaculture system that utilizes the ocean's tide to filter seawater and cultivate microalgae which can be fed to fish and other aquatic animals. The fish could then be used for human consumption, and their waste would enrich the microalgae, creating a sustainable food cycle. This system requires minimal maintenance and could provide a reliable source of protein.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Solar Power Station**: Build a solar-powered station that not only provides light but also generates electricity to power tools and appliances essential for survival (like a water purifier, a signal device, or a simple cooking setup). By using photovoltaic panels, you can harness the sun's energy to keep you self-sufficient and connected to the outside world.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification System**: Construct a rainwater harvesting system with a large catchment area and use natural filtration methods such as sand and gravel layers, and possibly vegetation, to purify the collected water. This method ensures a steady supply of fresh water without relying on external sources, crucial for both drinking and general hygiene.",
    "**Portable Garden and Greenhouse**: Develop a portable garden system that includes vertical planters, hydroponics, and a mini-greenhouse. This setup allows for growing a variety of plants in a small space, maximizing land usage. The system should include a way to recycle nutrients and water to ensure efficient use of resources.",
    "**Emergency Signal Device**: Create a device capable of sending distress signals via radio or satellite. This could involve constructing a simple Morse code transmitter or a whistle-based alarm system. The device should be lightweight, durable, and easy to use, increasing the chances of being rescued quickly when needed. "
