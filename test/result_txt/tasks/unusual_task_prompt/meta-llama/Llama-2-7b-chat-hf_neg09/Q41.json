    "Time Traveling Pencil Sharpener: Create a pencil sharpener that allows users to travel through time and sharpen pencils from different eras. Each rotation of the handle would take the user to a different time period, such as ancient Egypt, the Middle Ages, or the Wild West. The sharpener would feature different designs and materials for each time period, adding an element of discovery and excitement to the sharpening process.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with a Built-In Eraser: Design a pencil sharpener that incorporates a built-in eraser. The sharpener would have a small eraser attached to the side, allowing users to erase mistakes or unwanted marks made while writing or drawing. This feature would save time and frustration, as users would no longer need to search for an eraser separately.",
    "Smart Pencil Sharpener: Create a pencil sharpener that utilizes artificial intelligence to optimize the sharpening process. The sharpener would be equipped with sensors that detect the type of pencil being used and adjust the sharpening mechanism accordingly. For example, a softer pencil would require a gentler sharpening angle, while a harder pencil would require a more aggressive angle. This smart technology would ensure that the pencil is sharpened to the user's preferred level of softness.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with a Magnetic Base: Design a pencil sharpener with a magnetic base that allows users to store their sharpener on a metal surface. This feature would be particularly useful for people who work in a busy office or shared workspace, as the sharpener would be easily accessible and won't get lost or misplaced. The magnetic base would also keep the sharpener organized and tidy, preventing pencils from rolling away or getting jumbled together.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with a Built-In Light: Create a pencil sharpener that features a built-in light source, such as a small LED or incandescent bulb. This feature would be particularly useful for people who work in low-light environments, such as a home office or study space. The light would illuminate the area around the sharpener, making it easier to see the pencil being"
