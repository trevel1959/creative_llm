    "Once in a lush, green meadow, a boastful hare challenged all the animals to a race. Confident in his speed, he laughed at the thought of losing. However, a humble snail, known for her patience, decided to join. The race began, and the hare dashed off, leaving the snail far behind. But the hare, overconfident, stopped to nap under a tree. Meanwhile, the snail, slow but steady, kept inching forward. When the hare awoke, he panicked and sprinted toward the finish line, but it was too late. The snail had crossed first, proving that persistence and determination can triumph over speed.",
