    "**Truthful Job Interviews**: I would create a platform for job interviews where both the interviewer and interviewee are compelled to tell the truth. This would allow candidates to honestly express their qualifications and experiences, while employers would have to reveal the true nature of the company culture, expectations, and potential growth opportunities. This transparency could lead to better job matches and reduced turnover rates.",
    "**Family Reunions**: I would organize family reunions where relatives are compelled to share their true feelings and experiences. This would create a safe space for discussing long-held grievances, misunderstandings, or secrets that may have caused rifts within the family. The aim would be to foster healing and stronger bonds, allowing families to move forward with honesty and understanding.",
    "**Consumer Transparency**: I would implement a system in retail environments where product representatives and marketers are compelled to tell the truth about their products. This could include disclosing ingredients, sourcing practices, and any potential downsides of the product. This transparency would empower consumers to make informed choices, fostering a culture of accountability among brands.",
    "**Therapeutic Truth Sessions**: I would establish therapeutic sessions where individuals could express their true thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. Participants would be encouraged to share their innermost thoughts about relationships, life choices, and personal struggles. This could promote healing and understanding, allowing individuals to confront issues they may have been avoiding.",
    "**Truthful Social Media**: I would develop a social media platform where users are required to share their genuine thoughts and feelings, rather than curated images or exaggerated claims. This platform would encourage authenticity, allowing people to connect over shared experiences and emotions, rather than superficial portrayals. It could also serve as a space for honest discussions about mental health, self-esteem, and societal pressures."
