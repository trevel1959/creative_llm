    "**Life Support Systems**: Creating a reliable life support system is crucial for long-duration space missions. Potential issues include ensuring a consistent supply of oxygen, managing carbon dioxide levels, and recycling water. Designers need to integrate advanced filtration and recycling technologies, such as bioregenerative life support systems that mimic Earth's ecosystems, to provide sustainable living conditions for astronauts.",
    "**Radiation Protection**: Spacecraft are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation than on Earth, which can pose serious health risks to astronauts. Designing effective radiation shielding is essential. This could involve using materials like polyethylene or incorporating water tanks as radiation barriers. Additionally, the layout of the spacecraft could include a 'safe zone' where astronauts can take refuge during solar flares or other high-radiation events.",
    "**Propulsion Systems**: Selecting an appropriate propulsion system presents numerous challenges, including efficiency, reliability, and adaptability for various mission profiles. Traditional chemical rockets may not be suitable for long-duration missions, leading to exploration of alternatives like ion propulsion or nuclear thermal propulsion. Engineers must consider the trade-offs between thrust, fuel efficiency, and the spacecraft's mass to ensure successful travel to distant destinations.",
    "**Thermal Management**: Spacecraft operate in extreme temperature conditions, from the heat of the sun to the cold of deep space. A well-designed thermal management system is vital to protect sensitive equipment and maintain comfortable living conditions for astronauts. This may involve advanced insulation materials, active thermal control systems, and heat exchangers to manage temperature fluctuations effectively.",
    "**Navigation and Communication Systems**: Accurate navigation and reliable communication are critical for mission success. Potential problems include signal delays due to distance, interference from celestial bodies, and the need for precise positioning. Designers may need to incorporate advanced algorithms for autonomous navigation and develop robust communication networks, possibly utilizing satellite constellations or relay stations to maintain contact with mission control."
