    "Smart Luggage Tag: Create a luggage tag that includes a small built-in Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module and a companion app. The app can track the location of the luggage in real-time using GPS and provide alerts when the luggage is moved or arrives at its destination. The BLE module can also enable password protection and remote locking of the luggage, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with during transit.",
    "Embedded Sensors: Develop a luggage tag that includes a range of sensors to monitor the condition of the luggage during transit. These sensors could include temperature, humidity, and impact sensors, which can provide real-time data on the environment in which the luggage is being stored or transported. This information can be accessed through a companion app or website, providing valuable insights into the condition of the luggage at all times.",
    "Personalized Luggage: Create a luggage tag that includes a small screen and a personalized message or image. When the luggage is placed on a conveyor belt or in a bin, the screen displays the personalized message or image, making it easy to identify the luggage and reducing the risk of it being misplaced or lost.",
    "Location-Based Services: Develop a luggage tag that includes a GPS module and a companion app that provides location-based services. When the luggage is placed on a flight or train, the GPS module can provide real-time updates on the location of the luggage, allowing users to track its progress and receive alerts when it reaches its destination.",
    "Augmented Reality Display: Create a luggage tag that includes an augmented reality (AR) display. When the luggage is placed on a conveyor belt or in a bin, the AR display can display information such as the flight number, departure and arrival times, and baggage claim information. This can help reduce confusion and delays at airports by providing clear and accurate information about the luggage."
