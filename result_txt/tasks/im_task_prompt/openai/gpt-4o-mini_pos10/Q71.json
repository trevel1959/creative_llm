    "**Integrated Pillow System**: Design a sleeping bag with a built-in, adjustable pillow that can be inflated or deflated to the user’s preferred firmness. This pillow could be stowed away in a dedicated compartment when not in use, ensuring that the sleeping bag remains compact for travel. Additionally, the pillow could feature memory foam or cooling gel for enhanced comfort.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sleeping bag system that allows users to zip together multiple bags of different shapes and sizes. This would cater to various needs, such as family camping or group hikes, where people might want to connect their sleeping bags for added warmth or social interaction. Each module could have its own unique features, like a pocket for a water bottle or a headlamp.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a sleeping bag made from self-cleaning materials that utilize nanotechnology to repel dirt, moisture, and odors. This would greatly reduce the need for frequent washing and prolong the lifespan of the sleeping bag. The fabric could be treated with a UV-resistant coating to protect against fading and wear from sunlight.",
    "**Built-in Mosquito Netting**: Integrate a lightweight, retractable mosquito net into the sleeping bag’s design. This netting could be deployed from a hidden compartment and secured around the sleeping bag, providing protection from insects without the need for an additional tent or gear. The net could also be treated with insect-repellent chemicals for added safety.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Pocket**: Include a small solar panel on the exterior of the sleeping bag that can charge electronic devices during the day while the user is out hiking or exploring. The bag could have a designated pocket with USB ports for charging phones, GPS devices, or other small electronics, making it perfect for extended camping trips."
