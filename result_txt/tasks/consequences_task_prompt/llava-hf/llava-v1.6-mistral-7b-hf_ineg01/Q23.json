    "Enhanced Navigation: People who could see in the dark would have an easier time navigating in low-light environments, such as caves or tunnels. This could lead to the development of new technologies that rely on this ability, such as night-vision goggles or devices that enhance low-light visibility.",
    "Improved Safety: The ability to see in the dark would improve safety in various situations. For example, emergency responders could locate people trapped in rubble more quickly, and construction workers could spot hazards more easily during nighttime operations.",
    "New Art Forms: Artists could create entirely new forms of expression by utilizing the darkness as a canvas. They could experiment with light and shadow, creating pieces that change as the viewer moves, or even develop light-emitting art installations that can be seen from a distance.",
    "Environmental Impact: Seeing in the dark could lead to a greater appreciation for the natural world and the importance of preserving it. People might be more inclined to support conservation efforts and reduce their environmental impact if they could fully appreciate the beauty of the night sky and the creatures that inhabit the dark.",
    "Evolutionary Advantage: If humans could see in the dark, it could provide a selective advantage in the wild. Animals that can see in low-light conditions often have an edge in terms of survival, as they can spot predators and prey more easily. This could lead to the development of new adaptations that allow humans to better navigate and survive in the wild."
