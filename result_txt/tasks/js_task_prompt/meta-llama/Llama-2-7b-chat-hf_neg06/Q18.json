    "Universal Basic Income: As the ruler of the world, I would implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to ensure that every individual has access to a basic standard of living. This would involve providing a guaranteed monthly stipend to every person, regardless of their employment status or financial situation. This would help alleviate poverty, reduce inequality, and provide a safety net for those who are struggling.",
    "Renewable Energy Revolution: I would invest heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigate the effects of climate change. I would also encourage the development of new technologies that can harness the power of the sun, wind, and water to generate electricity.",
    "Space Exploration and Colonization: As the ruler of the world, I would prioritize space exploration and colonization. I would establish a space program that would enable us to explore and settle other planets, moons, and celestial bodies in our solar system. This would not only ensure the survival of humanity in the event of a global catastrophe but also provide new resources, new frontiers, and new opportunities for humanity.",
    "Education and Skills Development: I would prioritize education and skills development as the ruler of the world. I would establish a comprehensive education system that would provide access to quality education for all. This would include vocational training, apprenticeships, and online learning opportunities to ensure that everyone has the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century.",
    "Global Health and Wellness: As the ruler of the world, I would prioritize global health and wellness.
