    "Develop a pair of sunglasses with a built-in microphone and speaker, allowing you to take hands-free phone calls or listen to music while you're on the go. The microphone and speaker could be hidden in the earpieces or on the frame.",
    "Design a pair of sunglasses with a UV-sensing technology that detects the amount of UV radiation in the environment and adjusts the tint of the lenses accordingly. This would provide optimal protection for your eyes without having to manually adjust the lens tint.",
    "Create a pair of sunglasses with a augmented reality (AR) display built into the lenses. This could display information like directions, weather, or messages, and could also allow you to play games or watch videos while you're wearing them.",
    "Develop a pair of sunglasses with a smartphone-controlled smart tint feature, which would allow you to adjust the tint of the lenses using your smartphone app. This could be useful for people who are sensitive to light or who want to change the look of their sunglasses based on their mood or the time of day."
