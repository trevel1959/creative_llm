We could use apps or tools to help us calculate the time based on these cues, and even develop our own system for tracking time based on these natural phenomena.",
    "could use technology to track time: We could rely on technology to track time, such as's smartphone or computer. We could could use apps or software to track time, and even develop our own system for tracking time based on these digital tools.",
    "could use a time-tracking app: We could use a time-tracking app to keep track of time, such as the built-in time-tracking feature in many smartphones or computers. We could also use other time-tracking apps that provide more detailed and customizable time tracking.",
