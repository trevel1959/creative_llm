    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. This battery would be made with a special solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, which would then be stored in the battery for later use. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Wind-Powered Generators: Develop a small, portable wind turbine that can be placed near devices to generate electricity. This turbine would use the wind to turn a generator, which would produce electricity that could be stored in a separate battery. Confidence Score: 0.9/1",
    "Hydroelectric Power: Create a small, portable hydroelectric generator that can be used to generate electricity from any source of moving water. This generator would use the kinetic energy of the water to turn a turbine, which would produce electricity. Confidence Score: 0.8/1",
    "Fuel Cells: Develop a new type of fuel cell that can convert chemical energy from fuels like methanol or ammonia into electricity. This fuel cell would be more efficient and reliable than traditional batteries, and could be used to power a wide range of devices. Confidence Score: 0.9/1",
    "Nuclear Power: Create a small, portable nuclear reactor that can be used to generate electricity. This reactor would use the energy released from the fission of atoms to produce electricity, which could then be stored in a separate battery. Confidence Score: 0.9/1"
