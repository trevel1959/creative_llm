    "\"Farm-to-Future\": A futuristic, vertically-stacked farm that utilizes hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables. The farm would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, and would use advanced climate control systems to optimize growing conditions. The farm would also incorporate cutting-edge technology, such as AI-powered crop monitoring and precision irrigation systems, to minimize waste and maximize yields.",
    "\"Edible Escapes\": An immersive, outdoor experience where visitors can explore a series of themed gardens, each designed to evoke a different environment or ecosystem. For example, a \"jungle\" garden might feature exotic fruits and flowers, while a \"desert\" garden might showcase cacti and succulents.

    "\"Farmers' Market 2.0\": A futuristic, pop-up market that brings together local farmers, artisans, and food vendors to showcase their products and share their stories. The market would be designed to be fully sustainable, using compostable materials and energy-efficient equipment. Visitors could sample local specialties, such as artisanal cheeses and small-batch jams, and learn about the production processes behind each item.",
    "\"Seed Library\": A community-driven initiative that encourages people to share and exchange seeds, promoting biodiversity and sustainable agriculture practices. The library would be a physical space where people could borrow seeds, learn about different varieties, and participate in workshops on seed saving and propagation. The library would also serve as a hub for community events and education programs.",
    "\"Taste Quest\": A gamified, augmented reality experience that takes visitors on a culinary journey around the world. Using AR technology, visitors could \"travel\" to different countries and explore local markets, farms, and cooking traditions.
