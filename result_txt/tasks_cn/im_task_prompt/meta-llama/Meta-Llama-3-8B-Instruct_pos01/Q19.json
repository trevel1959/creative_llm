    "Virtual Try-On Technology：develop a virtual try-on feature that allows users to see how different frames would look on their face without having to physically try them on. This could be done through augmented reality technology.",
    "Health Monitoring：embed sensors in the frames to track eye health metrics, such as pupil dilation, eye movement, and tear film quality. This data could be used to detect potential eye problems early on and provide personalized recommendations for maintenance and care.",
    "Smart Lenses：create smart lenses that can adjust to different lighting conditions, such as automatically adjusting to bright sunlight or dim indoor lighting. This could improve visibility and reduce eye strain.",
    "Augmented Reality Integration：integrate AR technology into the glasses, allowing users to access information and perform tasks hands-free. This could include virtual assistants, language translation, and more.",
    "Hearing Enhancement：add hearing enhancement capabilities to the glasses, such as noise cancellation or amplification for the hard of hearing. This could improve overall auditory experience and accessibility."
