    "**Integrated Flossing Function**: Create an electric toothbrush that not only cleans teeth but also includes a flossing mechanism. The flossing function would be integrated into the bristles of the brush head. When the user moves the brush around their mouth, the bristles would automatically move back and forth to clean between teeth, mimicking the motion of flossing. This would streamline dental care routines and improve oral hygiene.",
    "**Personalized Oral Care App**: Develop an app that pairs with the electric toothbrush. The app could track brushing habits, alert users when they are not brushing long enough or effectively, suggest different brushing techniques based on individual teeth needs, and even remind users to replace their toothbrush heads. Additionally, it could provide personalized feedback, such as recommending specific toothpaste based on dietary intake, or suggest specific oral health routines depending on factors like gum sensitivity or plaque buildup.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Capabilities**: Integrate a mild teeth whitening gel into the toothbrush head. Users can apply the gel to the brush head, which then activates to gently whiten teeth during the brushing process. This would offer an at-home solution for mild to moderate teeth discoloration without the need for professional treatments, making it more accessible and convenient.",
    "**Adaptive Pressure Sensor**: Implement a pressure sensor in the handle of the toothbrush that detects how hard the user is brushing. If the user applies too much pressure, the toothbrush will vibrate or beep to alert them, reducing the risk of gum damage and protecting teeth from unnecessary wear. This feature would be especially beneficial for those who might unknowingly apply excessive force while brushing.",
    "**Dental Health Monitoring System**: Create an electric toothbrush that connects wirelessly to a user's smartphone. The toothbrush could monitor the user's brushing patterns and oral health over time, collecting data on brushing frequency, duration, and effectiveness. The app associated with the toothbrush could analyze this data and provide insights on areas needing improvement, predict potential dental issues, and recommend preventive measures or necessary actions (like visiting a dentist). This system would encourage proactive dental care by providing personalized health advice and reminders tailored to each user's specific needs."
