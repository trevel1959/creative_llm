    "Smart Coffee Maker with Personalized Recommendations: Develop a coffee maker that uses machine learning algorithms to learn the user's coffee preferences and recommends the perfect brew based on factors like taste, caffeine level, and time of day. The coffee maker could also adjust the brewing parameters to optimize the flavor based on the type of coffee beans used.",
    "Portable Coffee Maker for Outdoor Adventures: Create a compact, portable coffee maker that can be easily taken on camping trips, hiking excursions, or to the beach. The coffee maker would use a solar-powered heating element to brew coffee using a special, lightweight coffee pod. The design would be rugged and durable, with a compact, portable footprint.",
    "Coffee Maker with Air Purification: Develop a coffee maker that also acts as an air purifier, using a built-in HEPA filter to remove impurities and allergens from the air. This would create a more comfortable and healthy coffee drinking experience, especially for people with respiratory issues.",
    "Smart Coffee Maker with Augmented Reality Display: Create a coffee maker with a built-in augmented reality display that shows the user how to properly brew their coffee, with step-by-step instructions and visual aids. The display could also show information about the coffee beans, such as their origin and flavor profile, to help users choose the perfect beans for their taste preferences.",
    "Coffee Maker with Built-In Grinder: Develop a coffee maker that includes a built-in grinder, allowing users to grind their own coffee beans directly before brewing. This would ensure the freshest, most flavorful coffee possible, as the grinder would be located directly next to the brewing mechanism. The grinder could also be adjusted to grind the beans to the perfect consistency for the desired brewing method."
