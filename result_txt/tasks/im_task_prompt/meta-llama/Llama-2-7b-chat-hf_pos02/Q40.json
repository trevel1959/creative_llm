    "Smart Sunglasses: Design a pair of sunglasses with built-in augmented reality (AR) technology. The lenses would display information such as the wearer's calendar, weather updates, and notifications from their smartphone. The glasses could also have a camera and microphone for hands-free video calls and voice commands.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses with glow-in-the-dark lenses that could be charged during the day using solar power. This would make them perfect for nighttime activities such as camping, hiking, or running. The lenses could also have a reflective coating to increase visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "Anti-Blue Light Sunglasses: Design a pair of sunglasses that protect the wearer's eyes from blue light emitted by digital devices such as computers, smartphones, and televisions. The lenses would be made with a special filter that blocks blue light without affecting the wearer's color perception. This would help reduce eye strain and improve sleep quality.",
    "3D Printed Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses using 3D printing technology. The lenses could be customized to fit the wearer's prescription and could be made with different colors and patterns. The frames could also be designed with a unique shape or style, making them a one-of-a-kind accessory.",
    "Waterproof Sunglasses: Design a pair of sunglasses that are completely waterproof and can be worn while swimming or showering. The lenses would be made with a special waterproof coating that prevents water from entering the lens, while the frames would be made with a flexible and durable material that can withstand exposure to water. This would make them perfect for beachgoers, surfers, and water sports enthusiasts."
