    "**Key Fob Locator App**: Develop an app that connects to the key fob via Bluetooth, allowing users to track the location of their keys in real-time. The app could include features such as a \"find my key\" function that activates a sound from the key fob, helping users locate it quickly. Additionally, the app could provide a history of where the keys have been last detected, aiding in recovering lost keys.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Key Material**: Create car keys made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that reduce environmental impact. These keys could be designed to break down naturally over time without leaving harmful residues. This initiative could also include a recycling program for old keys, encouraging users to return their old keys in exchange for a discount on new eco-friendly keys.",
    "**Integrated Keyless Entry and Remote Start**: Innovate the traditional key fob by integrating keyless entry and remote start functionalities into a sleek design that allows users to unlock and start their cars from a distance using their smartphones. This feature would provide convenience, especially in extreme weather conditions, allowing drivers to preheat or cool their cars before entering.",
    "**Multi-Functional Keychain**: Transform the car key into a multi-functional device that includes additional features such as a mini flashlight, a personal alarm, or a USB charging port for mobile devices. This would make the keychain not only a tool for accessing the car but also a handy gadget for everyday use, appealing to a broader audience.",
    "**Voice-Activated Key Fob**: Develop a voice-activated key fob that allows users to perform various functions using voice commands. For instance, users could say, \"Unlock my car,\" or \"Start the engine,\" without needing to press any buttons. This hands-free operation would enhance convenience, especially for individuals carrying bags or children."
