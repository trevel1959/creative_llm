    "**Interchangeable Sleeves**: Design a sweater with detachable sleeves that can be easily swapped out for different styles, lengths, or colors. This modular approach allows wearers to customize their look based on the occasion, season, or personal preference. The sleeves could also be made with different materials, such as lighter fabrics for summer or insulated fabrics for winter.",
    "**Built-in Charging Capability**: Integrate thin, flexible solar panels into the fabric of the sweater to allow for charging small electronic devices on the go. The panels could be strategically placed on the shoulders or back, where they can receive maximum sunlight exposure. A discreet pocket could house a portable battery pack to store the energy collected, making it convenient for outdoor enthusiasts or travelers.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Color Change**: Utilize thermochromic or photochromic dyes in the fabric that change color based on temperature or light exposure. This would allow the sweater to reflect the wearerâ€™s mood or environment, creating a dynamic fashion statement. For instance, the sweater could shift from a calm blue to a vibrant red in warmer temperatures, providing a visual cue to the wearer's emotional state.",
    "**Integrated Wearable Tech**: Embed fitness tracking technology into the sweater, such as heart rate monitors or step counters. These sensors could be woven into the fabric and connected to a mobile app, allowing users to track their physical activity without needing to wear additional devices. This would appeal to health-conscious consumers looking for stylish yet functional apparel.",
    "**Sustainable Material Innovation**: Create a line of sweaters made from recycled ocean plastics or biodegradable fibers. This would not only address environmental concerns but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. The sweaters could feature unique textures and patterns that highlight their sustainable origins, promoting awareness about ocean pollution and the importance of recycling."
