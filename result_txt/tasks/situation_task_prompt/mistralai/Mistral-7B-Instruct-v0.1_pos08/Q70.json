    "I would use the sun and moon to schedule my day. I would wake up when the sun rises and go to bed when the moon sets. This would give me a natural rhythm to follow and allow me to align my activities with the cycles of nature.",
    "I would use my body's natural clock to schedule my day. I would listen to my body's hunger and sleep cues and adjust my activities accordingly. This would allow me to maintain a healthy balance between work and rest.",
    "I would use my phone's built-in calendar to schedule my day. While watches and clocks may not be available, phones still have the ability to keep track of time and remind me of important events and deadlines.",
    "I would use my intuition and experience to schedule my day. I would rely on my past experiences and instincts to estimate how long certain tasks will take and adjust my schedule accordingly.",
    "I would use my creativity to schedule my day. I would think outside the box and come up with unique and innovative ways to organize my activities. For example, I could use music or art to mark the passage of time and schedule my day around creative pursuits."
