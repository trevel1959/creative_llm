    "**Solar-Powered Habitat**: Design an eco-friendly habitat that utilizes solar energy to power the environment's systems. This habitat would include a large solar panel system on the roof, which powers lighting, heating, cooling, water purification, and even some automated feeding systems. The idea is to create a self-sustaining environment that reduces the need for external energy sources.",
    "**Interactive Play Area**: Create an area within the habitat where the animals can interact with their environment through various play equipment designed specifically for their species. For example, elephants might have a play area with giant slides or climbing structures, while primates might have a complex maze of tunnels and platforms. This encourages natural behaviors and physical activity.",
    "**Underwater Adventure Zone**: For aquatic animals, incorporate an underwater zone that allows visitors to experience a fish-eye view into their world. This could involve transparent domes or viewing areas submerged in tanks filled with filtered seawater. This zone could also feature interactive elements like touch screens for learning about each species.",
    "**Themed Educational Enclosures**: Each section of the habitat could be themed around different regions of the world, showcasing animals native to those environments. This theme could extend beyond just the animal selection to include the habitat design, food, and even cultural artifacts. For instance, a \"Savannah\" zone could feature grassy plains, termite mounds, and large, open spaces.",
    "**Nighttime Environments**: Design a part of the habitat specifically for nocturnal animals. This would include low light conditions, artificial moonlight, and soundscapes that mimic natural night-time environments. This ensures that these animals can thrive and display their natural behaviors without the disruptions caused by human activities during the day."
