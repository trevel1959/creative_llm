    "**Pest Infestation**: Once the garden is planted, it may attract various pests such as aphids, slugs, or beetles. These pests can damage plants and reduce yields. Implementing natural pest control methods, such as introducing beneficial insects (like ladybugs) or using organic pesticides, can help manage infestations without harming the ecosystem.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Over-watering or under-watering can significantly impact plant health. Inconsistent watering schedules can lead to root rot or drought stress. Installing a drip irrigation system or using moisture sensors can help regulate water levels and ensure that plants receive the appropriate amount of moisture.",
    "**Sunlight Exposure**: Different plants have varying sunlight requirements. A common problem is planting shade-loving plants in full sun or sun-loving plants in shaded areas, which can stunt growth or lead to plant death. To mitigate this, carefully plan the garden layout based on the sunlight patterns throughout the day and the specific needs of each plant species.",
    "**Competing Weeds**: Weeds can quickly overtake a garden, competing with plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight. This can hinder plant growth and lead to reduced yields. Regularly mulching the garden and hand-pulling weeds or using organic herbicides can help keep weeds at bay and support healthy plant development.",
    "**Seasonal Weather Variability**: Unexpected weather changes, such as late frosts or heavy rains, can negatively affect a garden. Frost can damage tender seedlings, while excessive rain can lead to waterlogged soil. To combat this, consider using row covers to protect plants from frost and creating drainage systems to manage excess water."
