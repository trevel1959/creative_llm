    "**Shade Capsule**: Develop wearable devices that can produce shade using advanced cooling technology. These capsule-shaped devices could be worn like sunglasses or hats, providing personal shade. The device could use solar panels to recharge during the day, converting sunlight into energy to power its cooling system. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Cover surfaces of buildings, pavements, and even clothing with reflective materials to bounce sunlight away. This could be achieved through a special paint or fabric that reflects UV rays, keeping areas cooler. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Water Cooling Stations**: Install water fountains in public places that also provide a cooling mist. This not only offers shade but also a refreshing breeze, helping to lower body temperatures. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Engineer plants that emit light instead of requiring sunlight. These plants could be designed to glow brightly at night, providing artificial shade during the day. They might need a power source, such as battery packs, to maintain their glow. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Airborne Clouds**: Use drones or balloons equipped with water tanks to release mist and create temporary clouds. This method could be used to cool specific areas, providing much-needed shade when the sun is too intense. Confidence Score: 0.7"
