    "**Name:** Luminaris",
    "**Appearance:** The Luminaris has a slender, elongated body covered in iridescent scales that reflect light, creating a shimmering effect. Its long neck allows it to reach high branches, and its tail is prehensile, serving as an additional limb. Large, round eyes can see in low light conditions, and delicate wings allow it to fly silently.",
    "**Habitat:** The Luminaris inhabits a dense, misty forest where the canopy is so thick that sunlight barely penetrates. It lives in a network of treehouses and bridges, utilizing its prehensile tail to navigate the dense foliage.",
    "**Behavior:** Luminaris are nocturnal, using their large eyes to hunt for insects and small mammals that are active at night. They are highly social creatures, living in large family groups. They communicate through a complex system of bioluminescent flashes, which can be used to convey emotions, warnings, or even complex messages.",
    "**Unique Ability:** The Luminaris has the ability to harness and manipulate light, creating powerful blasts of energy that can stun predators or disorient prey. They can also use this ability to create dazzling displays of light, which can be used for mating, territorial displays, or even to communicate with other Luminaris over long distances."
