    "**Dusting Mitt**: Instead of buying expensive dusting cloths, use an old sock as a dusting mitt. Slip your hand inside the sock and use it to wipe down surfaces, electronics, or even blinds. The sock's fabric will trap dust and dirt, making it an eco-friendly cleaning tool that can be washed and reused.",
    "**Travel Laundry Bag**: When packing for a trip, use a clean sock to store your dirty laundry. Simply roll up your dirty clothes and place them inside the sock. This keeps your dirty items separate from clean ones, and the sock is compact enough to fit in your suitcase without taking up much space.",
    "**Plant Watering Spike**: Turn a sock into a simple plant watering system. Fill the sock with water and tie it closed, then bury it partially in the soil of your potted plant. The water will gradually seep out, providing a slow and steady hydration method for your plants, especially when you're away for a few days.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Create a fun and interactive toy for your pet by filling a sock with crinkly plastic or some catnip for cats. Tie a knot at the end to secure the filling, and you have an engaging toy that your furry friend can chew, toss, and play with. It's an inexpensive way to keep your pet entertained.",
    "**Pillow Stuffing**: If you have several old socks that have lost their pairs, consider using them as stuffing for a pillow or cushion. Cut the socks into smaller pieces and fill a pillowcase with them. This can create a unique, squishy pillow thatâ€™s both comfortable and quirky, perfect for adding character to your home decor."
