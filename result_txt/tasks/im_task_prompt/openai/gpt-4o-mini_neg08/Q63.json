    "**Adjustable Fit System**: Design roller skates with an adjustable fit mechanism that allows users to easily change the size of the skates. This could be achieved with a ratchet system or expandable materials that accommodate growing feet or different sock thicknesses. This feature would make the skates more versatile for users of all ages and skill levels.",
    "**Interchangeable Wheel System**: Create a roller skate design that allows for easy swapping of wheels. Users could change the hardness or size of the wheels based on their skating style or the surface theyâ€™re skating on. This system would promote customization and help skaters optimize their performance for different terrains, such as smooth indoor rinks versus rough outdoor paths.",
    "**Built-in LED Lighting**: Incorporate customizable LED lights into the roller skates that can change colors and patterns based on the user's preferences or music rhythm. These lights could enhance visibility during nighttime skating and add a fun, artistic element to the skating experience, making it more appealing for younger skaters or those who enjoy expressing their style.",
    "**Ergonomic Design Enhancements**: Revamp the design of roller skates to focus on ergonomics, incorporating features like memory foam padding, arch support, and shock-absorbing soles. This would provide a more comfortable skating experience, reduce the risk of injury, and improve overall performance, especially for long-distance skaters or those practicing tricks.",
    "**Skate Assist Technology**: Develop a roller skate that features a self-propelling mechanism or electric assist option for beginners or those who struggle with balance. This technology would help users gain confidence while learning to skate and allow them to enjoy the activity without the fear of falling. The assist could be controlled via a simple toggle switch on the skate itself."
