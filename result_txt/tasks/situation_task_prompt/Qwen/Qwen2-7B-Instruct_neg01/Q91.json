    "**Innovative Prosthetic Senses**: Design a system of wearable technology that would simulate the sensation of touch, temperature, pain, and other physical stimuli. This could be achieved through a combination of sensors that detect changes in environment (like heat or pressure) and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) that can mimic the sensations of touch. The technology would be worn like gloves or a vest, providing feedback to the wearer as if they were still experiencing physical sensations.",
    "**Enhanced Visual Aids**: Develop a high-tech visor or glasses that not only corrects vision but also adds advanced features such as depth perception, motion tracking, and even haptic feedback for spatial awareness. This could prevent collisions or falls by allowing the wearer to 'see' around corners, sense obstacles, and navigate their environment more effectively without relying on physical sensation.",
    "**Tactile Memory System**: Create a device that records and stores information about textures, surfaces, and objects that one has touched in the past. The device could use a combination of artificial intelligence and memory chips to store tactile data. When needed, the wearer could access this information through a glove-like interface, allowing them to 'remember' what different materials feel like without physically touching them.",
    "**Smart Protective Clothing**: Design a line of clothing that uses smart textiles to provide protection against injury. These clothes could include embedded sensors that monitor stress levels, alerting the wearer to areas that are being over-stressed or where injury might occur. They could also incorporate cooling or heating elements to regulate body temperature, and possibly even shock-absorbing materials in critical areas.",
    "**Virtual Reality Adaptation**: Build a VR system that allows users to experience the sensation of touch and movement in virtual environments. By integrating haptic feedback and motion tracking, the VR experience would become more immersive and realistic, enabling users to interact with virtual objects as if they were real. This could be particularly useful for training purposes, such as learning to handle dangerous equipment or practicing complex surgeries without risking actual patients."
