    "**Smart Wheelchair with AI Navigation**: Create a smart wheelchair that utilizes AI to navigate through environments autonomously. Equipped with cameras and sensors, the wheelchair would recognize obstacles, map out spaces, and even learn the user's preferences for routes and destinations. The user could simply input a location via a mobile app or voice command, and the wheelchair would take them there, adapting to real-time changes in the environment.",
    "**Personal Hoverboard with Stabilization Technology**: Design a personal hoverboard that allows users to glide above the ground without needing to stand. This board would utilize advanced gyroscopic stabilization to keep the user balanced while seated. The hoverboard could be controlled by shifting weight or using hand gestures, providing a fun and dynamic way to move around without standing up.",
    "**Customizable Mobility Pod**: Introduce a mobility pod that resembles a small, enclosed vehicle, designed for comfort and ease of use. Users can enter the pod and control its movement through a touch screen interface or voice commands. The pod could have features like climate control, entertainment systems, and even a mini-fridge, making it a personal space that promotes independence and comfort while moving around.",
    "**Mobile Hoverchair**: Imagine a hoverchair that uses magnetic levitation technology to lift slightly off the ground, allowing for smooth and effortless movement. This chair would be equipped with an intuitive control system, enabling users to glide through spaces without needing to push or pull. It could also have adjustable height settings, allowing users to interact with different environments, like sitting at a table or reaching for items on shelves.",
    "**Portable Robotic Arm Assistants**: Create a system of portable robotic arms that can assist with tasks while the user is seated. These arms could be controlled through a wearable device or a mobile app, allowing the user to reach for items, pick them up, or perform tasks like cooking or cleaning without needing to stand. This system would enhance independence and productivity, making daily life more manageable."
