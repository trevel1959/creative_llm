    "**Solar Concentrators**: Develop a network of mirrored satellites that orbit the Earth, focusing sunlight onto a central location. This would allow for a concentrated beam of sunlight to be directed to a specific area, providing enough light for various applications. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Create a system that extracts water from the atmosphere, using the moisture in the air to generate electricity through a process called \"atmospheric water harvesting.\" This electricity could then be used to power solar panels, increasing their efficiency. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Bioluminescent Plants**: Engineer plants that produce bioluminescent properties, allowing them to emit their own light. This would provide a natural source of light, reducing the need for artificial lighting. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Develop a space-based solar power system, where solar panels are deployed in orbit around the Earth, collecting sunlight and beaming it back to the planet as a concentrated beam of energy. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Artificial Skies**: Create a network of transparent, thin-film membranes that can be deployed above cities, allowing sunlight to pass through while maintaining the cloudy sky below. These membranes would be made of a durable, weather-resistant material and could be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight entering the area. (Confidence: 0.6)"
