    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Shower Head**: Design a shower head that incorporates color-changing LED lights. The colors can shift based on the water temperature, creating a visual experience that enhances relaxation or invigoration. For example, a calming blue for warm showers or energizing red for cooler ones. This feature can help users create a spa-like atmosphere in their own bathrooms.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Water Filtration Shower Head**: Develop a shower head that includes an integrated water filtration system. This system would purify the water as it flows, removing chlorine and other impurities. It could also incorporate a mineral infusion feature that adds beneficial minerals back into the water, promoting healthier skin and hair while being environmentally friendly.",
    "**Adjustable Spray Patterns with Memory Settings**: Innovate a shower head with multiple spray patterns (rain, massage, mist, etc.) that can be easily adjusted. It could include a memory function that allows users to save their favorite settings. This would cater to individual preferences and provide a personalized shower experience every time.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Shower Head**: Introduce a shower head with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light or a special coating to prevent mold and mineral buildup. This feature would reduce the need for regular cleaning and ensure a consistent water flow, while also maintaining hygiene.",
    "**Hydro-Powered Shower Head**: Create a shower head that generates energy from the water flow itself. This energy could power built-in features like LED lights, temperature displays, or even Bluetooth speakers. By harnessing the power of water, this shower head would not only be innovative but also eco-friendly, reducing reliance on electricity."
