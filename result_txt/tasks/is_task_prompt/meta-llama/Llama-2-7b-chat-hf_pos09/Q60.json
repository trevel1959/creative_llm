    "Build a support network: The monkey can form a support network of other animals who have also lost their swings. Together, they can share their experiences and learn new ways to adapt to their changed circumstances. For example, the monkey could connect with a bird who has lost its wings and learn how to use its tail as a makeshift wing.",
    "Find a new hobby: The monkey can discover a new hobby or activity that it can excel in, such as painting or playing a musical instrument. This will not only keep it occupied but also give it a sense of purpose and fulfillment. For instance, the monkey could use its tail to create beautiful artwork or compose music that inspires others.",
    "Practice mindfulness: The monkey can practice mindfulness techniques to help it cope with its loss. By focusing on the present moment and letting go of negative thoughts, the monkey can find peace and contentment in its new circumstances. For example, the monkey could meditate on the beauty of nature or practice deep breathing exercises to calm its mind.",
    "Learn to adapt: The monkey can learn to adapt to its new environment by observing and learning from other animals. For instance, it could study the behavior of a squirrel that has learned to climb trees using its tail, or watch a bird learn to fly using its wings. By learning from others, the monkey can find new ways to navigate its changed circumstances.",
    "Create a new identity: The monkey can create a new identity for itself that is not dependent on its lost swing. For example, it could become known as the \"tail-twirling monkey\" or the \"foot-flapping monkey,\" highlighting its new abilities and strengths. By embracing its new identity, the monkey can find a sense of pride and self-worth in its changed circumstances."
