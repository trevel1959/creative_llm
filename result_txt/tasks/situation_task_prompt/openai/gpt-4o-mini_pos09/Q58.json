    "**Eco-Friendly Biocontrol Robots**: Design small, autonomous robots that mimic the behavior of natural predators. These robots could be programmed to identify and target pest insects, using gentle methods like suction or trapping. Equipped with sensors, they would navigate gardens and crops, providing a non-toxic way to keep pest populations in check.",
    "**Plant Companion Systems**: Create companion planting systems that utilize genetically modified plants capable of producing natural insect repellents or attractants. For instance, these plants could emit compounds that repel specific pests or attract beneficial insects (if they were still present) or even fungi that are harmful to the pests. This would create a self-regulating ecosystem around crops.",
    "**Insect Trap Ecosystems**: Design innovative trap systems that utilize pheromones or light to attract pests into self-contained ecosystems. These traps could be designed to capture insects while providing them with a controlled environment where they canâ€™t escape, effectively managing their population. The trapped insects could then be used for composting or as biofertilizers.",
    "**Smart Garden Networks**: Implement a network of interconnected smart sensors in gardens and agricultural areas. These sensors would monitor insect populations and environmental conditions, allowing for real-time data analysis. Based on this data, targeted actions such as releasing beneficial microbes or applying organic repellents could be initiated, creating a dynamic pest management system.",
    "**Insect Biopharmaceuticals**: Research and develop biopharmaceuticals derived from insect-resistant plants or compounds that can be used to control insect populations. These biopharmaceuticals could be designed to target specific pests without harming other plants or organisms, allowing for precise pest control while maintaining ecological balance."
