    "**Submarine Transportation:** Develop and utilize an extensive network of high-speed, long-range submarines for travel. These vessels could travel underwater, avoiding the impassable roads.",
    "**Maglev Trains:** Construct a high-speed magnetic levitation (Maglev) train network that would travel above the ground, bypassing the impassable roads.",
    "**Advanced Hovercraft:** Develop hovercraft technology to travel above land, similar to air travel but with a more accessible and lower-altitude mode of transport.",
    "**Underground Tunnels:** Construct an extensive network of underground tunnels to bypass the impassable roads. This would require significant investment in infrastructure and engineering.",
    "**Space Travel:** Invest in the development of commercial space travel, allowing passengers to travel to other planets or moons for long-distance travel."
