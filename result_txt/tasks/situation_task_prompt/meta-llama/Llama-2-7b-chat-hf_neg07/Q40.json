    "Solar-Powered Batteries: One possible solution to power devices without batteries is to use solar-powered batteries. These batteries are designed to harness the energy of the sun to generate electricity, which can then be stored and used to power devices. This would eliminate the need for traditional batteries and provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy.",
    "Wearable Energy Harvesting: Another idea is to use wearable technology that can harness the energy generated by the human body to power devices. For example, a smartwatch or fitness tracker could be designed with flexible solar panels or piezoelectric materials that convert kinetic energy from movement into electricity. This energy could then be stored in a small battery or directly used to power devices.",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Air-powered batteries are a novel solution that utilizes compressed air to generate electricity. These batteries consist of a sealed chamber filled with a specialized gas that can be compressed and expanded to generate electricity. When the air pressure is released, the gas expands and generates electricity, which can be stored in a small battery or used to power devices directly.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Bio-batteries are an innovative solution that leverages the power of living organisms to generate electricity. These batteries use microorganisms like bacteria or yeast to convert organic matter into electricity. The microorganisms feed on organic waste, such as food scraps or agricultural waste, and produce electricity as a byproduct. This electricity can then be stored in a battery or used to power devices directly.",
    "Tidal Power: Tidal power is a sustainable and renewable source of energy that can be harnessed to power devices. This involves building tidal turbines in coastal areas where the movement of the tides creates a consistent flow of water. The turbines convert the kinetic energy of the water into electricity, which can then be stored in a battery or used to power devices directly."
