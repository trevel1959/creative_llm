    "**Adaptive Technology Integration**: In the absence of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would turn to adaptive technology to enhance their daily lives. This could include wearable devices, such as smart glasses or smart contact lenses, that use artificial intelligence to correct vision. These devices would use advanced algorithms to analyze the user's surroundings and provide real-time visual enhancements, such as zooming in on objects or removing glare. For example, a person with myopia could use a smart contact lens that uses a tiny camera to capture their surroundings and projects a virtual image on a tiny display, allowing them to see objects clearly.",
    "**Personalized Low-Vision Aids**: To cope with the loss of glasses and contact lenses, individuals with poor vision would develop personalized low-vision aids. These could be custom-made devices that use a combination of magnification, contrast enhancement, and spatial awareness to help users navigate their environment. For instance, a person with cataracts could use a handheld device that uses a combination of infrared and ultraviolet light to highlight objects and provide a 3D representation of their surroundings.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: People with poor vision would develop enhanced sensory perception to compensate for their visual limitations. This could involve using other senses, such as hearing, touch, or smell, to gather information about their environment. For example, a person with macular degeneration could use a device that converts sound waves into visual patterns, allowing them to \"see\" their surroundings through sound.",
    "**Social Support Networks**: In the absence of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would rely on social support networks to navigate their daily lives. This could involve relying on friends, family, or caregivers to assist with tasks such as reading, cooking, or driving. For instance, a person with glaucoma could use a smartphone app that connects them with a network of volunteers who can assist with tasks and provide emotional support.",
    "**Neuroplasticity-Based Training**: People with poor vision would turn to neuroplasticity-based training to rewire their brains and adapt to their visual limitations. This could involve using brain-computer interfaces, neurofeedback training, or other forms of cognitive training to enhance their visual perception and develop new strategies for navigating their environment. For example, a person with amblyopia could use a brain-computer interface that uses electroencephalography (EEG) to detect and amplify their brain activity, allowing them to \"see\" objects more clearly.
