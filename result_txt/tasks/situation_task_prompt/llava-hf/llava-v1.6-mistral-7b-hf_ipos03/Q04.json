    "Modular Forests: Develop modular forests that can be easily transported and installed in urban areas. These forests would provide a variety of ecosystem services while also replenishing the lost natural resources.",
    "Bioengineered Trees: Invest in research and development of bioengineered trees that can grow faster and produce higher yields of wood and other resources. These trees could be planted in areas that are not suitable for natural forest growth.",
    "Sustainable Forestry Practices: Implement sustainable forestry practices to ensure that forests are managed in a way that maximizes resource production while minimizing environmental impact.",
    "Urban Forests: Encourage the creation of urban forests in cities around the world. These forests would provide a variety of benefits, including resource production and improved air quality.",
    "Recycling Programs: Develop and implement recycling programs to recover and repurpose existing forest-derived resources, such as wood and paper."
