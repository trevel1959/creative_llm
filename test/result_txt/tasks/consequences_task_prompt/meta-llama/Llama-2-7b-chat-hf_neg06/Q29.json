    "Information Overload: With the ability to remember everything read, humans would be bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information. This would lead to cognitive overload, making it difficult to process and retain any information.",
    "Loss of Personal Identity: As memories are constantly being added to, the individual's sense of self would become distorted. The ability to forget would be seen as a necessary aspect of personal identity, and the inability to do so would lead to confusion and disorientation.",
    "Increased Emotional Burden: The constant retention of emotions associated with every memory would lead to an increased emotional burden. This would result in heightened anxiety, depression, and PTSD.",
