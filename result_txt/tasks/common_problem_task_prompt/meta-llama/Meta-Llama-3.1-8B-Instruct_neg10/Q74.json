    "**Launch Window Constraints**: The launch window for a satellite is determined by a variety of factors, including the position of the Earth, the satellite's orbit, and the launch vehicle's capabilities. If the launch window is missed, the mission may be delayed, and additional costs may be incurred. This requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that the launch occurs within the optimal window.",
    "**Radiation Exposure**: Satellites in orbit are exposed to harmful radiation from the sun and deep space, which can damage electronic components and affect the satellite's performance. This requires the use of radiation-hardened components and shielding to protect the satellite's electronics.",
    "**Communication Interference**: As the satellite communicates with Earth, it must be designed to minimize interference from other satellites, radio signals, and other sources of electromagnetic radiation. This requires careful consideration of the satellite's frequency allocation, antenna design, and signal processing algorithms.",
    "**Power Generation and Storage**: Satellites in orbit require a reliable source of power to operate, which can be challenging due to the limited availability of solar energy and the need for power storage systems to provide a stable power supply. This requires the use of advanced power generation and storage technologies, such as solar panels and batteries.",
    "**Navigation and Control**: Satellites in orbit require precise navigation and control systems to maintain their position and orientation. This requires the use of advanced sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, and sophisticated control algorithms to ensure stable and accurate operation."
