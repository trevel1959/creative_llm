    "Create a Cloud-Piercing Device: Develop a technologically advanced device that can pierce through the clouds and direct sunlight onto specific areas, providing a reliable source of natural light. This device could be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, ensuring a sustainable solution.",
    "Artificial Lighting System: Design an intelligent lighting system that can mimic the natural light-dark cycle, simulating a 24-hour day-night cycle. This system could be powered by a combination of LED lights and solar panels, providing consistent and controlled lighting conditions.",
    "Greenhouse-Inspired Spaces: Transform your living space into a greenhouse-like environment, filled with plants that can absorb and reflect light. By incorporating vertical gardens, skylights, and large windows, you can create a natural lighting system that is both visually appealing and energy-efficient.",
    "Mirrored Reflection: Install mirrors strategically throughout your home to reflect natural light from windows and skylights, amplifying the available light. This technique can help brighten up dark corners and create a sense of openness in your space.",
    "Light-Harvesting Furniture: Develop furniture pieces that can harness and store light energy during the day, releasing it at night to provide a soft and consistent glow. This could involve using photovoltaic materials or incorporating LED lights into furniture design."
