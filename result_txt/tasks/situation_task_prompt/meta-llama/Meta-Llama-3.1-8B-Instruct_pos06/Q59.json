    "**Cloud-Harvesting Towers**: Build towering structures that can harness sunlight from above the clouds, using advanced optics and mirrors to focus and concentrate the light onto the surface below. These towers would be designed to withstand harsh weather conditions and would provide a reliable source of sunlight for cities and communities. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that can extract water vapor from the air, even when the sky is cloudy, and use it to generate electricity through electrolysis. This process would release oxygen and hydrogen, which could be used to power homes, businesses, and industries. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Subterranean Greenhouses**: Design and build subterranean greenhouses that use artificial lighting to mimic the effects of sunlight. These underground facilities would be equipped with advanced hydroponic systems, allowing for efficient crop growth and high yields. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Solar-Powered Concentrators**: Develop advanced solar concentrators that can collect and focus sunlight from above the clouds, even when the sky is overcast. These concentrators would be designed to be portable and scalable, making them suitable for both urban and rural areas. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Agriculture**: Engineer crops that can produce their own light, using bioluminescent properties to illuminate the surrounding environment. This would enable farmers to grow crops in cloudy conditions, reducing the need for artificial lighting and increasing crop yields. (Confidence score: 0.9)"
