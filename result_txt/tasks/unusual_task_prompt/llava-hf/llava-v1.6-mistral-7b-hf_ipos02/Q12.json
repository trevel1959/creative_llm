    "**Emergency Floatation Device:** In case of a water-related emergency, a balloon could be inflated and used as a temporary flotation device. While not as effective as a life jacket, it could provide some buoyancy and help someone stay afloat until professional help arrives.",
    "**Balloon-Powered Light Source:** By attaching a small light bulb to a balloon and filling it with helium, one could create a makeshift balloon-powered light source. The helium would lift the balloon and the light bulb, providing a portable source of light.",
    "**Balloon-Powered Water Pump:** In areas with limited access to clean water, a balloon-powered water pump could be a lifesaver. By attaching a hose to the balloon and creating a vacuum, the balloon could be used to pump water from a low-lying source to a higher one.",
    "**Balloon-Powered Musical Instrument:** By connecting a series of balloons to a small keyboard or drum set, one could create a balloon-powered musical instrument. When the balloons are inflated, the air pressure would activate the musical notes."
