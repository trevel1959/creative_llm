    "**Smart Coffee Maker with Personalized Brews**: Develop a coffee maker that learns and adapts to individual taste preferences over time. It uses AI technology to understand the brewing habits of each user and suggests optimal brewing settings. For instance, if a user prefers their coffee stronger in the morning and milder in the afternoon, the coffee maker can adjust its settings accordingly. This not only enhances personalization but also reduces waste by ensuring the perfect cup every time.",
    "**Coffee Maker with Health Monitoring Features**: Create a coffee maker that integrates health tracking features. It can measure caffeine intake for each user, monitor the quality of water used (to prevent impurities affecting taste), and even suggest healthier coffee alternatives based on dietary needs. For example, it could recommend decaf or lower sugar options based on a user's daily calorie intake.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Maker with Zero Waste Design**: Design a coffee maker that minimizes environmental impact by using recyclable materials and reducing waste. It could include a feature where used coffee grounds are automatically composted within the machine, turning waste into fertilizer. Additionally, the machine might use a reusable filter system, eliminating the need for paper filters, which contribute significantly to landfill waste.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Experience Station**: Combine a coffee maker with a digital display that turns the process of making coffee into an interactive experience. Users can choose from a variety of coffee types and flavors, and the machine provides information about each one. It could also offer recipes for coffee-based cocktails or desserts, encouraging users to explore new flavors and combinations. This not only makes the coffee-making process more engaging but also educates users about coffee culture.",
    "**Energy-Saving and Smart Home Integration Coffee Maker**: Design a coffee maker that is highly energy-efficient and seamlessly integrates with smart home systems. The machine should be able to adjust its power usage based on the time of day or user activity patterns. For instance, it might reduce energy consumption during off-peak hours or when the house is unoccupied. Moreover, it should connect with other smart devices, like speakers or lights, allowing users to start their coffee routine with voice commands or set up customized routines that start the coffee brewing at specific times."
