    "**Virtual Queue Management**: Develop a mobile app or online platform that allows users to queue their print jobs. Once connected to the printer via Wi-Fi, users could send their documents to the virtual queue from anywhere. The printer would then process these jobs based on priority or availability, ensuring no one waits longer than necessary.",
    "**3D Printing Integration**: Enhance the printer with 3D printing capabilities. Users could print not only traditional documents but also small objects, prototypes, or personalized items directly from the printer. This feature would make printers more versatile and appealing to a broader range of users.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Incorporate a large touchscreen display on the printer, allowing users to interact with it directly. This interface could include features like scanning, copying, editing, and even creating custom templates. It would make the printer more user-friendly and engaging.",
    "**Automated Paper Handling**: Improve paper handling by integrating automatic paper feeding, stacking, and management systems. This feature would ensure smooth and uninterrupted printing without the need for constant user intervention, making the printer more efficient and less prone to jams.",
    "**Energy Efficiency**: Implement advanced energy-saving technologies such as sleep mode, low-power standby, and eco-printing modes. These features would help reduce power consumption and minimize environmental impact, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers."
