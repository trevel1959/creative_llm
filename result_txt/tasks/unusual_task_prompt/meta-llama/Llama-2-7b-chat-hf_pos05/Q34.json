    "Tape Measure with Built-In Level: Create a tape measure that includes a built-in level, making it easier for users to ensure that surfaces are perfectly level and plumb. This feature would be particularly useful for DIYers and contractors who frequently work with walls, floors, and ceilings.",
    "Smart Tape Measure: Develop a tape measure that can connect to a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This would allow users to take measurements wirelessly and transfer them to their device for easy storage and sharing. Additionally, the app could provide additional features such as converting measurements to different units, calculating area and volume, and even offering virtual guides for hanging pictures or installing shelves.",
    "Tape Measure with Laser Guide: Create a tape measure with a built-in laser guide that projects a level line onto surfaces. This would allow users to quickly and easily ensure that surfaces are level and plumb without having to physically measure them. The laser guide could also be used for tasks such as hanging pictures or installing shelves, making it easier to achieve accurate placement.",
    "Tape Measure with Integrated Ruler: Develop a tape measure that includes an integrated ruler, allowing users to take both length and width measurements without needing to switch between two separate tools. This would be particularly useful for measuring large objects or spaces, where it may not be practical to have two separate measuring devices.",
    "Tape Measure with Customizable Markings: Create a tape measure with customizable markings that allow users to add their own measurements or labels. This could be particularly useful for professionals who frequently use the same measurements or for DIYers who want to create their own customized measuring system. The tape measure could include a removeable sticker sheet or a built-in erasable surface, allowing users to easily add or remove markings as needed."
