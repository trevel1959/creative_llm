    "Bio-based Building Materials: Create a new type of building material that uses biological organisms like bacteria, fungi, or algae to create strong, durable, and sustainable structures. These organisms could be genetically engineered to produce materials like cellulose, chitin, or proteins, which could be used to create a building's framework, walls, and roofing. This approach would not only reduce the environmental impact of construction but also provide a new source of sustainable materials.",
    "Self-healing Materials: Develop a new class of materials that can repair themselves automatically when damaged. This could be achieved by incorporating microorganisms or micro-robots into the building materials. For example, bacteria could be used to produce limestone, while micro-robots could be used to repair cracks or damage to the structure. This technology would significantly reduce the need for maintenance and repair work, making building construction more efficient and sustainable.",
    "Air-based Building Materials: Design a building material that uses air as its primary component. This could involve creating a lightweight, porous material that is filled with air bubbles, which would provide insulation and buoyancy. The material could be made from a combination of natural fibers, such as hemp or flax, and a specialized binding agent that creates the air pockets. This innovative material would provide excellent insulation against cold and heat, while also being lightweight and easy to transport.",
    "Shape-memory Materials: Develop materials that can change shape in response to environmental conditions, such as temperature or humidity. This could involve using specialized polymers or metals that can change their shape when exposed to specific stimuli. For example, a building material could change from a rigid form to a flexible one when the temperature rises, allowing it to adapt to changing weather conditions. This technology would provide greater structural stability and resilience in buildings, while also reducing the need for maintenance and repair work.",
    "Bioluminescent Materials: Create building materials that produce their own light through bioluminescence. This could involve using specialized bacteria or fungi that emit light when exposed to oxygen or other stimuli. The material could be made from a combination of natural fibers and bioluminescent"
