    "Once in a lush, green forest, there lived a bear named Benny who adored honey more than anything else. Every day, he would sneak into the beehives, devouring the sweet treasure. One fateful day, Benny ate so much honey that he became stuck in a tree! As he struggled, the bees buzzed angrily around him. Realizing his greed had led to this sticky situation, Benny called for help. His friends, the wise old owl and playful squirrels, worked together to free him. From that day on, Benny learned moderation and shared his honey with his friends, turning his obsession into a sweet friendship.",
