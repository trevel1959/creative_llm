    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Incorporate UV-C light technology into the lid of the water bottle. This would allow users to sanitize their bottles by simply pressing a button. The UV-C light would eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring that the water remains clean and safe to drink without the need for frequent scrubbing or chemical cleaners.",
    "**Collapsible Design**: Create a collapsible water bottle made from durable, flexible materials that can be easily compressed when empty. This design would make it convenient for travel, hiking, or everyday use, as it takes up minimal space in bags or pockets. The bottle could also have a locking mechanism to ensure it stays secure when expanded.",
    "**Flavor Infuser Chamber**: Design a water bottle with a built-in flavor infuser chamber. Users could add fruits, herbs, or flavoring agents to this compartment, allowing them to infuse their water with natural flavors. The infuser would have a mesh filter to prevent pieces from entering the main bottle, making it easy to enjoy flavored water without any mess.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Develop a water bottle with double-walled vacuum insulation and a built-in temperature control feature. Users could set their desired water temperature (cold or hot) via a mobile app, and the bottle would maintain that temperature for hours. This feature would be perfect for those who enjoy iced beverages during workouts or hot drinks on the go.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lid**: Design a lid that serves multiple purposes, such as a built-in cup, a storage compartment for small items (like keys or cash), and a straw attachment. This multifunctional lid would enhance the user experience by providing additional convenience and utility, especially for outdoor enthusiasts or those who like to minimize the number of items they carry."
