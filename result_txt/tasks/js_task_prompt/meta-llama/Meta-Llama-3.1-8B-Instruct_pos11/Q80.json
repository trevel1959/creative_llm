    "Leonardo da Vinci: Bringing back the Renaissance master would be a dream come true. Da Vinci was a true polymath - an artist, inventor, engineer, and scientist. His expertise spanned from painting the Mona Lisa to designing flying machines. I'd love to learn from him about his creative process, his views on art and science, and how he managed to excel in so many fields. Imagine the conversations we could have about the intersection of art and technology, or how he approached problem-solving in his inventions. Da Vinci's presence would be a treasure trove of knowledge and inspiration.",
    "Frida Kahlo: Frida's life was a tapestry of art, culture, and resilience. As a painter, she explored the human experience with unflinching honesty, often incorporating her own physical and emotional pain into her work. I'd want to discuss with her the role of identity, culture, and feminism in her art, as well as her experiences with physical and emotional suffering. Her presence would offer a unique perspective on the human condition, and I'm sure she'd have some fascinating stories to share about her life and artistic process.",
    "Albert Einstein: Who wouldn't want to meet the genius behind the theory of relativity? Einstein's groundbreaking work revolutionized our understanding of space and time. I'd love to learn from him about his thought process, how he approached complex problems, and what inspired his most famous equations. His presence would be a chance to explore the mysteries of the universe and gain insight into the mind of a true visionary.",
    "Ada Lovelace: Often considered the world's first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace was a trailblazer in the field of mathematics and computer science. I'd want to discuss with her the early days of computing, her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, and her vision for the potential of machines to go beyond mere calculation. Her presence would offer a unique perspective on the history of technology and the role of women in shaping it.",
    "Nikola Tesla: Tesla was a true pioneer in the field of electrical engineering, and his work on alternating current (AC) revolutionized the way we transmit energy. I'd love to learn from him about his innovative designs, his views on the future of energy, and his thoughts on the intersection of science and spirituality. His presence would be a chance to explore the possibilities of renewable energy and the role of technology in shaping our world."
