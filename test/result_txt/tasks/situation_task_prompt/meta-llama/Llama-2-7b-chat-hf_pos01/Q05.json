    "Solar-Powered Lights: One creative solution would be to install solar-powered lights in strategic locations around the home, such as windowsills, patios, and walkways. These lights would provide natural light during the day and supplemental light at night, ensuring there is enough illumination even without the sun. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Another idea would be to use mirrors to reflect natural light from windows or other sources into the home. By positioning mirrors in a way that maximizes the reflection of light, it could provide additional illumination during the day. This method would be especially effective in rooms with limited natural light. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Some plants, such as certain species of algae or bacteria, have the ability to produce light. By incorporating these plants into the home's decor, they could provide a natural and sustainable source of light. This could be especially useful in rooms with limited natural light. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Fresnel Lens Lighting: A Fresnel lens is a thin, lightweight lens that can concentrate light into a smaller area. By using a Fresnel lens in a light fixture, it could focus the light from a single source into a brighter, more concentrated beam, providing additional illumination during the day. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Light-Pipe Technology: Light-pipe technology involves using a flexible tube filled with a reflective material to channel light from one location to another. By incorporating light pipes into the home's design, it could provide a way to distribute light from one location to another, ensuring there is enough illumination even without the sun.
