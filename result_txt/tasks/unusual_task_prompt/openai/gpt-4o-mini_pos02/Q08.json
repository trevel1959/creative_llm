    "**Travel Organizer**: Transform socks into portable organizers for small items while traveling. Roll up chargers, cables, or toiletries in socks to keep them tidy and prevent tangling. This method saves space in your luggage and makes it easy to find items without rummaging through your bag.",
    "**DIY Air Freshener**: Fill a sock with dried lavender, potpourri, or baking soda, and tie it off to create a homemade air freshener. Hang it in closets, cars, or even under sinks to absorb odors and add a pleasant scent to the environment. This is a natural alternative to commercial air fresheners.",
    "**Dusting Tool**: Repurpose a sock as a dusting glove. Slip it over your hand and use it to wipe down surfaces, blinds, or electronics. The fabric captures dust and dirt, and you can wash the sock afterward for repeated use. It’s a fun way to engage kids in cleaning tasks!",
    "**Emergency Phone Holder**: In a pinch, an old sock can be used to create a makeshift phone holder. Cut a small slit in the toe of the sock and insert your phone, allowing it to stand upright. This is especially handy when watching videos or following recipes while cooking.",
    "**Pet Toy**: Create a simple dog or cat toy by stuffing a sock with other old socks or soft materials. Tie off the end to secure the stuffing and toss it to your pet. The texture and shape will provide them with a fun and engaging plaything, and it’s a great way to recycle old clothing."
