    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Develop a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light or ozone technology to sanitize the interior surfaces of the refrigerator. This would help eliminate bacteria and odors, ensuring that food stays fresh longer without the need for harsh chemicals. Users could activate the cleaning cycle with a button or through a smartphone app.",
    "**Modular Shelving System**: Design a modular shelving system that allows users to easily reconfigure the layout of the shelves according to their needs. This could include adjustable heights, removable sections, and even customizable compartments for different types of food. Users could create more space for large items or optimize storage for smaller products.",
    "**Temperature and Humidity Control Zones**: Create a refrigerator with multiple temperature and humidity control zones, allowing users to customize the environment for different types of food. For example, a dedicated zone for fruits and vegetables with higher humidity, and another for meats and dairy with lower humidity. This would help preserve freshness and taste for a longer period.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Assistant**: Incorporate a touch-screen interface on the refrigerator door that serves as a recipe assistant. Users could input available ingredients, and the refrigerator would suggest recipes, cooking instructions, and even video tutorials. It could also connect to smart kitchen devices, such as ovens and microwaves, to streamline the cooking process.",
    "**Energy Harvesting Technology**: Implement energy harvesting technology that captures excess heat generated by the refrigerator's compressor and converts it into usable energy. This could help power internal lighting or smart features, reducing overall energy consumption. Additionally, a solar panel option could be added for eco-conscious users looking to further minimize their carbon footprint."
