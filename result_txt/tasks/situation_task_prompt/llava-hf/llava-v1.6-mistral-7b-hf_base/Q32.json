    "Use dental floss and mouthwash: Dental floss and mouthwash can be used to clean your teeth and maintain oral hygiene. Flossing once or twice a day will help remove food particles and plaque from between your teeth and under the gumline, while mouthwash can help kill bacteria and freshen your breath.",
    "Practice proper brushing techniques: To ensure optimal oral hygiene, practice proper brushing techniques, such as brushing for at least two minutes twice a day, using a soft-bristled toothbrush, and reaching all areas of your mouth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces.",
    "Eat a balanced diet: Eating a balanced diet that is low in sugar and high in vitamins and minerals can help maintain healthy teeth and gums. Avoiding sticky and acidic foods can also reduce the risk of tooth decay and erosion.",
    "Visit a dental school or dental hygiene program: If there are no practicing dentists in your area, you can visit a dental school or dental hygiene program where students are supervised by licensed professionals. They can provide you with basic dental care services, such as cleanings and extractions, at a reduced cost.",
    "Learn to perform basic dental procedures: If you have access to dental books, videos, or online resources, you can learn to perform basic dental procedures, such as fillings and extractions. However, it's important to note that this should only be done as a last resort and should not replace regular dental check-ups and cleanings."
