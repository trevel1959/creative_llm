    "**Sensory Beach Experience:** Since the sand is gone, create a sensory experience by using different textures and materials. For instance, one could lay down a layer of soft, fluffy grass or even a carefully designed carpet made from various types of fibers that mimic sand's texture. This could be combined with soundscapes of waves crashing on a hidden barrier or artificial sea sounds, and fragrances that evoke the ocean.",
    "**Water-based Activities:** Instead of playing in the sand, focus on water-based activities like kayaking, paddleboarding, or even swimming in the ocean. This not only keeps the beach's aquatic aspect intact but also allows for a wide variety of activities to keep visitors engaged and entertained. You can have guided tours, races, or workshops on water sports.",
    "**Beach-themed Games and Challenges:** Create games that are beach-related but don't require sand. For example, set up a mini golf course using large, smooth stones as the \"holes\" and use coconut husks as balls. Another idea is to build a giant Jenga tower using driftwood and challenge people to take turns removing blocks without toppling the structure. ",
    "**Artistic and Creative Zones:** Transform the beach into an open-air art studio. Provide materials like wood, seashells, and various natural elements for visitors to create their own art pieces. Have a designated area where people can paint murals on large canvases or build sculptures using sandstone replicas (since thereâ€™s no actual sand). This encourages creativity and personal expression while providing a unique experience at the beach.",
    "**Cultural and Educational Exhibitions:** Use the space to host interactive exhibitions that educate people about marine life, conservation efforts, and the importance of beaches in ecosystems. Set up interactive stations where visitors can learn about the impact of sand disappearance and ways to prevent it. You could also have live demonstrations or presentations from marine biologists, artists, and environmentalists sharing their insights and knowledge."
