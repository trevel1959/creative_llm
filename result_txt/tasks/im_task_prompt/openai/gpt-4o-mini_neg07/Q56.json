    "**Multi-Function Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates additional features such as a small LED light for nighttime visibility, a built-in horn for louder alerts, and even a small speaker that can play music or podcasts. This would make the bell not only a signaling device but also an entertainment feature for cyclists.",
    "**Motion-Activated Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that uses motion sensors to detect when a cyclist is approaching pedestrians or other cyclists. The bell would automatically ring to alert others, ensuring safety without requiring the cyclist to manually activate it.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that is powered by solar energy. The bell would have a small solar panel that charges during the day, allowing it to operate without batteries. This eco-friendly design would reduce waste and ensure that the bell is always ready to use.",
    "**Customizable Visual Alerts**: Add a visual component to the bicycle bell, such as a small LED display that can flash messages or symbols (like a thumbs up or a warning sign) to communicate with other cyclists and pedestrians. This could enhance safety and provide a fun way to interact while riding.",
    "**Ergonomic Design**: Redesign the bell for improved ergonomics, making it easier to reach and activate with one hand. This could include a larger, textured button or a lever mechanism that requires less force to operate, allowing cyclists to signal without losing grip on the handlebars."
