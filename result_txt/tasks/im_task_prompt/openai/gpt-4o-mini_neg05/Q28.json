    "**Integrated Communication System**: Design a helmet that features built-in speakers and a microphone, enabling hands-free communication with fellow cyclists or emergency services. Riders could use voice commands to make calls or send messages, improving safety by keeping their hands on the handlebars and eyes on the road. Additionally, a group communication feature would allow cyclists in a pack to coordinate turns and stops without shouting.",
    "**Modular Padding System**: Create a helmet with a customizable, modular padding system that allows users to adjust the fit and comfort level. The padding could be made from various materials, including memory foam or gel inserts, which can be swapped out depending on weather conditions or personal preference. This feature would enhance comfort during long rides and make the helmet more appealing to a broader range of users.",
    "**Solar-Powered Safety Lights**: Integrate small, solar-powered LED lights into the helmet that automatically activate in low-light conditions. These lights could be programmed to flash or remain steady, increasing visibility for the rider. The solar panel could also power additional features, like a small fan for cooling during hot rides, making the helmet both functional and energy-efficient.",
    "**Crash Detection and Alert System**: Develop a helmet equipped with sensors that can detect sudden impacts or falls. In the event of a crash, the helmet could automatically send an alert to emergency contacts with the rider's location, along with a request for help. This would provide an added layer of safety for solo riders or those in remote areas, ensuring that help is on the way even if the rider is unconscious.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the helmet's design using sustainable, biodegradable materials that reduce environmental impact. For example, using recycled plastics or natural fibers for the outer shell and padding could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the production process could focus on minimizing waste and energy consumption, making the helmet a more sustainable choice in the cycling market."
