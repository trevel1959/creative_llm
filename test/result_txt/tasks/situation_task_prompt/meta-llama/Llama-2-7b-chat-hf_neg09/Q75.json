    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared is to convert vehicles to run on solar power. This could be achieved by installing solar panels on the vehicle's body or integrating solar panels into the design of the vehicle. The panels would absorb sunlight during the day and convert it into electricity, which would power the vehicle's motor. This would provide a clean and sustainable source of energy for transportation.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option for powering vehicles without oil is to use hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which can then be used to power a vehicle's motor. The only byproduct of this process is water vapor and heat, making it an environmentally friendly option. Additionally, hydrogen can be produced through renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power, further reducing the carbon footprint of transportation.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by advanced batteries could also be a viable option if oil were to disappear. Advanced batteries such as lithium-ion or solid-state batteries have longer ranges and faster charging times than traditional batteries, making them more practical for long-distance driving. Additionally, EVs produce zero emissions, making them a cleaner alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Vehicles: Another creative solution to power vehicles without oil is to use nuclear power. Nuclear reactors could be designed to produce electricity, which could then be used to power vehicles. This would provide a reliable and consistent source of energy, as nuclear reactors can operate for extended periods of time without the need for refueling. However, safety concerns and regulations surrounding nuclear power may limit its use for transportation.",
    "Bio-Fuelled Vehicles: Bio-fuels such as ethanol or biodiesel could be used to power vehicles instead of oil. These fuels are derived from organic matter such as plants or waste, and can be produced sustainably. For example, ethanol can be produced from sugarcane or corn, while biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils or animal fats. Using bio-fuels would reduce"
