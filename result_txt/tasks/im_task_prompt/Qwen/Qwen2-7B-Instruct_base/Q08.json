    "**Fridge Garden**: Create a small vertical garden inside your refrigerator. This can be done by hanging small pots or using DIY plant holders that fit into the fridge's compartments. You can grow herbs like basil, mint, and cilantro which not only add flavor to your dishes but also provide a fresh supply right when you need them. Ensure you choose plants that thrive in cooler environments and require minimal light.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Enhancer**: Upgrade your refrigerator with energy-efficient features. Consider replacing an older model with a newer, Energy Star-certified one. These models use up to 40% less energy than older models, helping save money on your electricity bills. Additionally, make sure your refrigerator is well insulated and sealed to prevent heat from entering, thereby reducing energy consumption.",
    "**DIY Smart Refrigerator**: Incorporate smart technology into your fridge for better organization and food management. You could install a tablet holder inside your fridge where you can download apps that help track inventory, set expiration reminders, and even order groceries directly from your phone. Some advanced models come with built-in screens and cameras, allowing you to see what's inside without opening the door.",
    "**Recycling Station**: Turn your refrigerator into a mini recycling center. Set up compartments specifically for collecting recyclables like plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass jars. This makes it easier to sort waste as you collect groceries, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and promoting sustainable living.",
    "**Healthy Eating Hub**: Transform your fridge into a healthy eating hub by organizing it with nutritious options. Place healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, yogurt, and whole-grain crackers at eye level for easy access. Use the crisper drawers for vegetables and greens to keep them fresher longer. Include a section dedicated to homemade meals and portioned leftovers to encourage healthy eating habits and reduce food waste. "
