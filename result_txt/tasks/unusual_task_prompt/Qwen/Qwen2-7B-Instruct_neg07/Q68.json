    "**Smart Soap Dispenser**: Design a smart soap dispenser that utilizes sensors to detect when a user is approaching, dispensing just enough soap without the need for manual pressing. This can be further enhanced by integrating it with AI, learning user habits over time to adjust soap usage accordingly, thus reducing waste and saving money.",
    "**Hybrid Soap Dispenser**: Combine a traditional pump-action dispenser with an integrated refillable container system. The user simply adds liquid soap or gel to the container, and a built-in mechanism measures and dispenses the appropriate amount, ensuring no product goes to waste.",
    "**DIY Soap Dispenser Kit**: Create a DIY kit where users can customize their own soap dispensers using various materials like glass, metal, or bamboo. Include interchangeable parts like different types of pumps, lids, and decorative covers. This not only personalizes the dispenser but also encourages creativity.",
    "**Solar-Powered Soap Dispenser**: Develop a solar-powered soap dispenser that uses ambient light to charge its internal battery. This ensures continuous operation without the need for electricity, making it ideal for outdoor use, remote areas, or emergency situations.",
    "**Interactive Soap Dispenser**: Incorporate interactive features such as voice commands, QR code scanning, or gamification elements into the dispenser. For example, the user can scan a QR code to get recipes, tips, or discounts on soap products. Or, a voice command feature could allow users to activate the dispenser hands-free, enhancing hygiene in public spaces."
