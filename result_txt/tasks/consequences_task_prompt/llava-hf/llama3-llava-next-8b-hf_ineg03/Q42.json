    "Without gravity, buildings and structures would need to be designed with an alternative means of support, such as magnetic or air pressure-based mechanisms.",
    "Transportation systems, including roads and rail networks, would need to be redesigned to accommodate for the lack of gravity, potentially using alternative propulsion methods or systems that do not rely on gravity.",
    "The natural movement of liquids and gases would change significantly, as they would not be influenced by gravity. This could lead to new methods of collecting and distributing water and other resources.",
    "The behavior of the human body would change, as it would not be subject to the effects of gravity. This could lead to new forms of exercise and physical activities that are not currently possible due to gravity.",
    "The concept of \"up\" and \"down\" would become relative and context-dependent, as there would be no universal reference for orientation."
