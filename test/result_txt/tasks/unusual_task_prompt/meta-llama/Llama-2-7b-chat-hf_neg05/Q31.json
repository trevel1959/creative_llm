    "Calculator with a twist: Create a calculator that has a unique feature that allows users to input equations instead of just numbers. This could be achieved through the use of a touchscreen interface or voice recognition technology. Users could then solve complex mathematical problems by simply writing out the equation on the calculator.",
    "Augmented reality calculator: Develop a calculator that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to display mathematical problems and solutions. Users could point their device's camera at a blank space and see mathematical problems and their solutions appear in 3D. This could make learning math more interactive and engaging for students.",
    "Calculator with a built-in tutor: Create a calculator that comes with a built-in tutoring system. The calculator could have a small display screen that shows step-by-step instructions on how to solve a problem, as well as provide explanations for each step. This could be especially helpful for students who struggle with math.",
    "Smart calculator for the visually impaired: Design a calculator that is specifically tailored for people with visual impairments. The calculator could have larger buttons and a voice output feature that reads out the calculations as they are performed. This would make it easier for people with visual impairments to use a calculator without assistance.",
    "Calculator that learns your math habits: Develop a calculator that learns your math habits and preferences over time. The calculator could use machine learning algorithms to identify the types of problems you typically solve and provide suggestions and shortcuts based on your usage patterns. This could make the calculator more personalized and efficient for each user."
