    "Natural Soap Bars: Create a line of natural soap bars using ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and essential oils. These soap bars would be gentle on the skin and can be made in various scents like lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint.",
    "Solar Showers: Develop a portable, solar-powered shower system that can be used in place of traditional showers. The system would use a solar panel to heat up water, which can then be stored in a tank for use. This would eliminate the need for soap, as the water would be clean and hygienic.",
    "Water-Less Washing: Create a device that can convert water into a mist, allowing for a gentle and effective cleaning experience without the need for soap. The device could be powered by a small battery or solar panel, making it portable and easy to use.",
    "Bamboo Towels: Develop a line of bamboo towels that are naturally antibacterial and antifungal. These towels would be gentler on the skin than traditional cotton towels and would not require the use of soap for cleaning. Bamboo is also a sustainable and eco-friendly material, making it a great alternative to traditional towels.",
    "Air-Powered Cleaning: Create a handheld device that uses compressed air to clean surfaces, rather than soap and water. The device could be powered by a small battery or solar panel, and would be gentle on surfaces while effectively removing dirt and grime. This would be especially useful for cleaning delicate surfaces like electronics or antique furniture."
