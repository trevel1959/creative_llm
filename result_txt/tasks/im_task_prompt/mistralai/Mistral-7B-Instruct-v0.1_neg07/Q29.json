    "Smart Lawn Mower: Develop a lawn mower that uses sensors to detect and map out the grass height, ensuring that the mower cuts the grass at the optimal height for each area. This would prevent over-cutting or under-cutting of the grass, resulting in a healthier lawn.",
    "Self-Driving Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that can be programmed to mow the lawn on its own. The mower would use GPS technology to navigate the lawn and avoid obstacles such as trees, flowers, and children playing.",
    "Electric Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that runs solely on electricity, reducing the carbon footprint of lawn care. The mower would be more efficient than traditional gas-powered mowers and would produce less noise.",
    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Develop a lawn mower that is powered by solar energy. The mower would be equipped with solar panels that capture energy from the sun and store it in a battery, allowing the mower to operate without the need for electricity.",
    "Robotic Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that uses robotic technology to mow the lawn. The mower would be equipped with sensors that allow it to navigate the lawn and avoid obstacles, and would be able to mow the lawn at any time of the day or night."
