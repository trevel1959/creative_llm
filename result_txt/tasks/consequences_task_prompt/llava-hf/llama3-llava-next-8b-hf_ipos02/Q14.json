    "**Weather-Based Transportation**: Weather control could revolutionize transportation by enabling the creation of new roads and highways that are only functional during specific weather conditions. For example, a road that only exists during rain could provide a dedicated water transport route, while a road that only exists during snow could be a dedicated ski resort.",
    "**Weather Insurance**: Weather control could provide a new insurance market where individuals and businesses could purchase protection against extreme weather events. This could incentivize more sustainable practices to avoid triggering these events.",
    "**Weather Tourism**: The ability to control the weather could create a new tourism industry where tourists can visit places with perfect weather conditions for their desired activities. For example, a ski resort could offer a \"guaranteed snow\" package, or a beach resort could offer a \"guaranteed sun\" package.",
    "**Weather-Based Agriculture**: Weather control could be used to optimize agricultural conditions, ensuring optimal crop growth and yield. Farmers could use weather control to ensure a consistent supply of water, and to control the timing of the growing season.",
    "**Weather-Based Mental Health**: Weather control could be used as a form of mental health treatment. For example, a person suffering from depression could be exposed to sunny weather to boost their mood, or a person with anxiety could be exposed to calm weather to reduce their stress levels."
