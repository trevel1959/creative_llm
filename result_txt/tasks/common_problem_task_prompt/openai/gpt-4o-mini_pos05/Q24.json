    "**Language Barriers**: Language can be a substantial hurdle. The exchange student might struggle with English, leading to difficulties in communication, both in everyday situations and in school. This could result in feelings of isolation or frustration. To address this, the host family could establish a language buddy system, where family members and the student practice language skills together through fun activities, such as cooking or watching movies in English with subtitles.",
    "**Homesickness**: The student may experience homesickness, especially during significant holidays or family events. They might miss their family, friends, and familiar surroundings, leading to emotional distress. To alleviate this, the host family could involve the student in local traditions, create a welcoming atmosphere, and schedule regular video calls with the student’s family back home to help them feel connected.",
    "**Academic Pressure**: The foreign exchange student may feel immense pressure to perform academically, especially if they are attending a different educational system. This could lead to stress and anxiety, particularly if they are not familiar with the curriculum or teaching methods. Host families can help by offering to assist with homework, encouraging the student to seek help from teachers, and reminding them that it’s okay to ask questions and take time to adjust.",
    "**Integration with Peers**: The student may find it challenging to integrate with their peers, feeling like an outsider in social situations. This can lead to loneliness and a lack of social support. To help the student connect, host families could organize social gatherings, invite friends over, or encourage the student to join clubs or extracurricular activities that align with their interests, providing opportunities to make friends.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: The foreign exchange student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences based on their culture, religion, or personal choices (like vegetarianism or allergies). This could lead to discomfort during meal times if not addressed. Host families should have an open discussion about food preferences and work together to prepare meals that respect the student’s dietary needs while introducing them to local cuisine."
