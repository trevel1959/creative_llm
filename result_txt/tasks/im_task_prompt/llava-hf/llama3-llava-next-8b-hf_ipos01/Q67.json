    "Brush Palette: Attach a small, retractable palette to the paintbrush handle, allowing the artist to mix colors directly on the brush. This can save time and prevent paint spills on the workspace.",
    "Magnetic Grip: Add a magnetic tip to the paintbrush head, allowing the artist to easily pick up and place down paint directly onto the brush without having to dip into a cup or container. This can be especially useful for small, delicate brush strokes.",
    "Adjustable Brush Head: Design a brush head that can be easily adjusted for different brush stroke effects, such as thick or thin strokes, soft or firm strokes, and various angles. This can give the artist more control over the final result.",
    "Ergonomic Handle: Develop an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for the artist's hand size and comfort level, reducing the risk of strain or injury during extended periods of painting.",
    "Quick-Dry Paint: Create a special paint formula that dries quickly without the need for a fan or lamp, allowing the artist to work more efficiently and without interruptions."
