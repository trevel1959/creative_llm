    "Water Gliders: These are lightweight, hydrofoil-like vessels that use the water's surface tension to glide across large bodies of water. They could be powered by a combination of solar panels and human-powered paddles, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Hydrothermal Bladders: These are inflatable bladders that can be filled with hot water from a nearby volcano or geothermal source. The heat from the water would be used to create lift, allowing the bladders to float on top of the water. They could be connected together to form a network of interconnected \"islands\" that could be used for transportation and trade.",
    "Aqua-Sleds: These are sled-like devices that use the water's buoyancy to travel across large bodies of water. They could be powered by a combination of human-powered paddles and electric motors, making them a versatile and efficient mode of transportation.",
    "Water-Walking Devices: These are devices that use a combination of magnets and electromagnetic fields to create a \"walkway\" on the water's surface. They could be powered by a combination of solar panels and human-powered generators, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.",
    "Submarine Tunnels: These are underwater tunnels that connect different parts of a large body of water. They could be powered by a combination of nuclear reactors and solar panels, making them a fast and efficient mode of transportation. The tunnels could also be used for trade and commerce, allowing goods to be transported quickly and easily between different regions of the water."
