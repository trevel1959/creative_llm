    "**Budget Overruns**: Producing a Broadway musical often involves significant financial investment. Unexpected costs can arise from elaborate set designs, costume changes, or the need for additional rehearsals. If the budget isn't carefully managed, it could lead to compromises in production quality or even threaten the viability of the show before it even opens.",
    "**Casting Challenges**: Finding the right actors for a musical can be a daunting task. A major issue could arise if the chosen cast members are unable to deliver the performances expected, either due to lack of experience, chemistry, or vocal ability. Additionally, if a lead actor drops out close to opening night, it can create a scramble to find a suitable replacement who can fit into the role seamlessly.",
    "**Technical Difficulties**: Broadway productions rely heavily on technology for lighting, sound, and special effects. Technical issues can occur during rehearsals or performances, such as sound malfunctions, lighting failures, or issues with set changes. These problems can disrupt the flow of the show and diminish the audience's experience, leading to negative reviews.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**: Even with a stellar production, if the marketing strategy is ineffective, ticket sales may suffer. A lack of engagement with potential audiences through social media, promotional events, or partnerships with local businesses can lead to a lack of awareness about the musical. This can hinder the show's success, especially in a competitive market like Broadway.",
    "**Rehearsal Schedule Conflicts**: Coordinating rehearsal schedules can be a logistical nightmare, especially when cast members have other commitments, such as previous shows or personal obligations. If rehearsals are not consistent or if key cast members miss critical practice sessions, it can lead to a disjointed performance and increased stress as the opening night approaches."
