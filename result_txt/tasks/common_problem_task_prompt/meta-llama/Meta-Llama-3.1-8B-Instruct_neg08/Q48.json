    "**\"Equipment Cost and Accessibility\"**: The creation of a new sport often requires specialized equipment, which can be expensive. This cost barrier might prevent individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds from participating, limiting the sport's diversity and inclusivity. Furthermore, the high cost of equipment could also deter schools and communities from adopting the sport, reducing its overall reach.",
    "**\"Safety Concerns\"**: Introducing a new sport can also raise safety concerns. The rules, equipment, and physical demands of the game might not be well-understood, leading to injuries. In addition, the sport might be more physically demanding than others, potentially causing long-term health issues if not managed properly.",
    "**\"Competitive Balance\"**: As a new sport gains popularity, teams and players might have varying levels of experience and skill. This disparity could lead to an imbalance in competition, making it difficult for newer teams to compete against more experienced ones. This imbalance could also discourage participation and lead to a decline in the sport's popularity.",
    "**\"Player Burnout\"**: The physical and mental demands of a new sport can be high, especially if it combines elements of multiple existing sports. Players might experience burnout due to the intense training and competition schedule, leading to a decrease in their overall performance and potentially causing them to drop out of the sport.",
    "**\"Marketing and Recognition\"**: A new sport might struggle to gain recognition and attract a following. Without a strong marketing strategy, it might be difficult to create a fan base, secure sponsorship deals, and gain legitimacy within the sports world."
