    "Improved financial stability: Debt can be a source of instability in the financial system, as a sudden increase in defaults can lead to a crisis. Erasing debt would reduce this risk, leading to a more stable financial system.",
    "Greater political stability: Debt can be a source of political instability, as governments may be constrained in their ability to implement policies that benefit their citizens due to debt obligations. Erasing debt would give governments greater flexibility to pursue policies that promote economic growth and social development.",
    "Environmental benefits: Debt can be used to finance environmentally damaging projects, such as the construction of coal-fired power plants. Erasing debt would reduce the incentive for such projects and free up resources for more sustainable investments.",
