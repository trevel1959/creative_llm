    "**Water Cooling System**: You could set up a water cooling system using cold water or ice cubes in a large tub placed in your room. The heat from your body and other sources will warm the water, which can be then drained out to cool down again. This cycle can help regulate the temperature.",
    "**Reflective Materials**: Utilize reflective materials such as aluminum foil or mirrors on walls and ceilings to reflect sunlight and heat away from the room during hot days. On cooler days, these same materials can be used to reflect artificial light or heat back into the room.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling Fans**: Use evaporative cooling fans that work by drawing hot air through wet paper pads, which cools the air before it's circulated around the room. This method uses less energy compared to traditional AC units and requires only a small amount of water.",
    "**Thermal Insulation**: Improve insulation in your home or office to prevent heat from entering during summer and cold air from escaping during winter. Using thick curtains, draft-proofing, and double-pane windows can significantly reduce the need for heating and cooling systems.",
    "**Greenhouse Effect Simulation**: Set up a miniature greenhouse effect within your room by creating a sealed environment with a clear plastic cover or glass. This will trap the heat generated by your body and other sources, keeping the room warmer in winter. However, ensure proper ventilation to avoid overheating and potential health risks. "
