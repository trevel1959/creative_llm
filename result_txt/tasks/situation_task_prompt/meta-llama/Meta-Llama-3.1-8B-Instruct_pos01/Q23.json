    "**Friction-based writing**: I would use a piece of chalk or a graphite stick to write on a rough surface, like a rock or a piece of bark. The friction between the material and the surface would create a mark that could be read.",
    "**Sand writing**: I would use a stick to draw in the sand on a beach or a dry riverbed. The shape and texture of the marks would be temporary, but they could be easily seen and understood.",
    "**Water-based writing**: I would use a stick or a reed to write in the sand or mud near a body of water. The water would help to preserve the marks, and they could be read from a distance.",
    "**Thermal writing**: I would use a hot object, like a piece of metal or a stone, to burn marks into a surface. The heat would create a lasting impression that could be read.",
    "**Mold-based writing**: I would use a mold or a stencil to create impressions in a soft material, like clay or plaster. The mold would create a permanent mark that could be read."
