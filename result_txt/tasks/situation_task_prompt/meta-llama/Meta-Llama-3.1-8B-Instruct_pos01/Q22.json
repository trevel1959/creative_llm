    "**Personalized Hoverboards**: I would create a network of elevated walkways and designated hoverboard lanes that crisscross the city, allowing residents to travel quickly and efficiently. Each hoverboard would be equipped with GPS, navigation, and safety features, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. The hoverboards would be powered by advanced magnetic levitation technology, reducing energy consumption and noise pollution. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Aquatic Transportation**: I would convert the city's waterways into a network of interconnected canals and waterways, using advanced hydrofoils and amphibious vehicles to transport people and goods. This would not only reduce congestion on land but also provide a unique and scenic mode of transportation. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Gravity-Defying Elevators**: I would install a network of vacuum-sealed tubes that crisscross the city, allowing people to travel vertically and horizontally using advanced magnetic levitation technology. These gravity-defying elevators would be powered by renewable energy sources and would reduce travel time significantly. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Personalized Flying Devices**: I would create a fleet of miniature flying devices, such as drones or personal aircraft, that would be equipped with advanced navigation and safety features. These devices would be designed for short-distance travel and would be powered by advanced battery technology. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Subterranean Transportation**: I would create a network of underground tunnels and tubes that would allow people to travel quickly and efficiently through the city. These tunnels would be equipped with advanced transportation systems, such as magnetic levitation or vacuum-sealed tubes, and would be powered by renewable energy sources.
