    "**Dream-Stealing Epidemic**: In a world where sleep is no longer an option, people's dreams become a coveted resource. A new black market emerges, where individuals sell their dreams to the highest bidder. The rich can afford to purchase vivid, exciting dreams, while the poor are left with nothing but fragmented, disturbing visions. This leads to a society where the haves and have-nots are further divided, and the concept of sleep becomes a luxury only the wealthy can afford.",
    "**Cognitive Overload**: Without sleep, humans' brains become overwhelmed by the constant influx of information and stimuli. People's minds start to shut down, and they become unable to process even the simplest tasks. This leads to a decline in productivity, and society is forced to adapt to a new normal where individuals are constantly stimulated, but never truly rested. As a result, people's creativity and problem-solving skills begin to atrophy, and innovation becomes a rare commodity.",
    "**Neurological Breakdown**: Prolonged sleep deprivation causes the human brain to degenerate at an alarming rate. People's memories begin to fade, and their ability to learn new information is severely impaired. This leads to a society where knowledge is power, and those who have access to information are the ones who hold the reins. The government establishes a new department dedicated to preserving and controlling knowledge, leading to a dystopian society where freedom of thought is a distant memory.",
    "**Social Unrest**: Without sleep, people become irritable, anxious, and prone to violent outbursts. Society descends into chaos as individuals lash out at one another, and the rule of law begins to break down. The government responds by establishing a new police force, the \"Sleepless Squad,\" tasked with maintaining order and quelling riots. However, this only leads to further unrest, as people begin to question the authority of those who are sleep-deprived and, therefore, less capable of making rational decisions.",
    "**Evolutionary Leap**: In a world without sleep, humans are forced to adapt to a new reality. Their brains undergo a rapid evolution, and they develop new ways of processing information and dealing with stress. This leads to a new species of human, one that is more resilient, more intelligent, and more capable of handling the demands of a sleepless world. However, this new species is also more isolated, more aggressive, and more prone to violence, leading to a society where humans are no longer the dominant species."
