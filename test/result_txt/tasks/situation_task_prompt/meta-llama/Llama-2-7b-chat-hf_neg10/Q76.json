    "Carrier Pigeons: In a world without phones, people could use carrier pigeons as a means of long-distance communication. Trained pigeons could be used to carry messages between locations, with trained messages attached to their legs or carried in small containers attached to their bodies. This method would be slow but reliable, as pigeons could fly between locations and deliver messages within a few hours.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to transmit messages over long distances. Homing pigeons are trained to return to their home location, and messages could be attached to their legs or carried in small containers attached to their bodies. When the pigeon reaches its destination, the message could be retrieved and delivered. This method would be slower than modern phone communication but would provide a reliable means of communication.",
    "Optical Signals: In a world without phones, people could use optical signals to communicate over long distances. This could involve using mirrors or other reflective surfaces to reflect laser beams or other light signals between locations. The signal could be encoded with messages and transmitted between locations, allowing for efficient communication over long distances.",
    "Acoustic Signals: Another option for long-distance communication in a world without phones would be acoustic signals. This could involve using underwater signals, such as whistles or other sounds, to transmit messages between locations. The signals could be encoded with messages and transmitted through the water, allowing for communication between locations that are far apart.",
    "Semaphore Flags: In a world without phones, people could use semaphore flags to communicate over long distances. Semaphore flags are a system of communication that uses flags to convey messages. Each flag has a specific meaning, and the flags are moved in a specific pattern to convey a message. This method would be slow but reliable, as the flags could be used to transmit messages between locations that are far apart."
