    "Smart Home Alarm System: This system would use a combination of sensors and AI to detect potential security threats in a home, such as doors or windows being opened without permission, and alert the homeowner or authorities. The system could also use facial recognition technology to identify individuals entering the home and grant access only to authorized people.",
    "Motion-Activated Alarm System: This system would use motion sensors to detect movement within a specific area, such as a room or outdoor space, and trigger an alarm if any unauthorized movement is detected. The system could also use a heat sensor to detect the presence of an individual in a room, even if they are not moving.",
    "Acoustic Alarm System: This system would use sound waves to detect and alert individuals of potential security threats. For example, the system could use a high-pitched siren to alert individuals of an intruder, or a low-pitched alarm to indicate a fire. The system could also use sound waves to detect the presence of a window or door being opened.",
    "Environmental Alarm System: This system would use sensors to detect changes in the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or light levels, and trigger an alarm if any of these parameters fall outside of a predetermined range. For example, if the temperature in a room falls below a certain level, the system could trigger an alarm to alert the homeowner.",
    "Biometric Alarm System: This system would use biometric data, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition, to identify individuals entering a specific area or room. The system could also use this data to grant access to authorized individuals and deny access to unauthorized individuals. If an unauthorized individual attempts to enter the area, the system would trigger an alarm."
