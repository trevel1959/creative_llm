    "Solar-powered Floating Power Plant: This concept involves building a power plant that is floating on a body of water, which is equipped with solar panels to generate electricity. The water provides buoyancy and cooling for the panels, and the power generated can be used to supply electricity to nearby communities.",
    "Wind Turbine Farm: This involves building a large-scale wind turbine farm in a location with high wind speeds. The turbines are arranged in a grid-like pattern and are connected to a central power distribution center. This design allows for efficient operation and maintenance of the turbines.",
    "Geothermal Power Plant: This concept involves harnessing the earth's natural heat to generate electricity. This can be done by drilling deep into the earth's crust to access hot water and steam, which can then be used to spin turbines and generate electricity.",
    "Biomass Power Plant: This involves burning organic matter, such as wood, agricultural waste, and municipal waste, to generate electricity. The waste is first processed to remove impurities and then burned in a boiler to create steam, which drives turbines and generates electricity.",
    "Tidal Power Plant: This concept involves building a power plant that harnesses the energy of ocean tides to generate electricity. This can be done by building turbines in areas where there are strong tidal currents, such as the mouth of a river or in a bay. The turbines are activated by the movement of the water, and the power generated can be used to supply electricity to nearby communities."
