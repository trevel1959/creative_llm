    "**AI-Enhanced Vision**: Create augmented reality glasses that utilize AI to analyze the environment and identify potential hazards. These glasses could highlight obstacles, warn of sharp edges, or detect changes in temperature. For example, if a hot stove is detected, the glasses could display a visual warning or even emit a sound, prompting the wearer to avoid that area. This technology would help the individual navigate safely through their surroundings.",
    "**Sensory Substitution Devices**: Design a device that translates physical sensations into other sensory experiences, such as sound or light. For instance, if a person is at risk of stepping on a sharp object, the device could emit a specific sound frequency or change the color of a light when the foot is too close to danger. This sensory substitution would provide a different way to perceive threats, enabling the wearer to avoid injury.",
    "**Environmental Adaptation Spaces**: Create living and working spaces specifically designed for individuals who cannot feel physical sensations. These spaces would feature rounded edges, non-slip surfaces, and padded walls to minimize the risk of injury. Additionally, the layout would be intuitive, with clear pathways and ample space to prevent accidental collisions. The environment itself would act as a protective barrier, reducing the likelihood of harm.",
    "**Emergency Response Companion**: Develop a robotic companion that stays close to the individual at all times. This companion could be programmed to recognize when the person is in a dangerous situation and take action to prevent injury. For example, if the wearer is about to fall, the robot could gently push them back or catch them. It could also be equipped with a communication system to alert others in case of an emergency.",
    "**Training Programs for Hazard Awareness**: Implement specialized training programs focused on developing cognitive skills for hazard recognition. These programs would teach individuals how to observe their surroundings carefully, identify potential dangers, and develop mental strategies for avoiding injury. Role-playing scenarios and virtual reality simulations could be used to practice responses to various situations, enhancing their ability to navigate safely."
