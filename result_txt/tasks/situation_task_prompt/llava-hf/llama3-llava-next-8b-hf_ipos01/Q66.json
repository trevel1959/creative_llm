    "Geodesic Dome Architecture: Geodesic domes are a type of dome that is composed of interconnected triangular or pentagonal components. These structures are incredibly strong and lightweight, making them ideal for building a house. In a world without natural building materials, geodesic domes could be constructed using a variety of materials, such as aluminum, steel, or even carbon fiber, to create a durable and energy-efficient home.",
    "Vertical Gardening: In a world without natural building materials, one could focus on creating sustainable, eco-friendly homes that incorporate vertical gardening. This would involve building a house with walls covered in plants and trees, providing a natural air filter and insulation. The plants could also produce food and provide a source of income for the occupants.",
    "Bioluminescent Lighting: Another option for building a house without natural materials would be to utilize bioluminescent lighting. This would involve using organisms that emit light naturally, such as certain types of algae or bacteria, to create a glowing, eco-friendly interior. This would not only provide a unique aesthetic but also reduce energy consumption.",
    "Floating Homes: In a world without natural building materials, one could consider building houses that float on water. This would involve constructing a buoyant structure, such as a houseboat or a floating island, using materials like concrete or composite materials. This would provide a sustainable and innovative way to build a home, especially in coastal areas or near bodies of water.",
    "Modular Construction: Modular construction involves prefabricating building components in a factory and then assembling them on-site. This method could be utilized to build a house without natural materials by using sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, recycled metal, or even repurposed shipping containers. The components could be designed to look like traditional wood or stone, providing a familiar aesthetic while minimizing environmental impact."
