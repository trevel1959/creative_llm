    "Eco-friendly insect repellents: One way to deal with pests like insects if all animals disappeared is to use eco-friendly insect repellents made from natural ingredients like essential oils, herbs, and spices. For example, citronella oil, lavender oil, and peppermint oil have been known to repel mosquitoes and other insects. These repellents can be applied to the skin or clothing, providing a safe and non-toxic alternative to chemical-based repellents.",
    "Insect-proof clothing: Another idea is to design and create insect-proof clothing that can protect humans from pests like mosquitoes and ticks. This clothing could be made from special fabrics that are woven with insect-repelling properties, such as permethrin or pyrethrin. These fabrics can be used to create clothing like pants, shirts, and jackets that can keep insects at bay.",
    "Insect-eating plants: If all animals disappeared, plants could be used to control insect populations. Certain plants, like Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, are already known to feed on insects. By cultivating and spreading these plants in areas where insects are a problem, it could help reduce their numbers naturally.",
    "Insect-hunting drones: A more high-tech solution to dealing with insects is to use insect-hunting drones. These drones could be equipped with specialized sensors and cameras that can detect and track insects. Once an insect is detected, the drone could use a specialized net or suction device to capture and remove the insect. This could be especially useful for dealing with pests like mosquitoes and flies that can transmit diseases.",
    "Insect-repelling buildings: Finally, buildings could be designed and constructed with insect-repelling properties. For example, buildings could be made with specialized materials that emit a scent that repels insects, or they could be designed with features that make it difficult for insects to enter. This could include features like screens on windows and doors, or specialized ventilation systems that keep insects out."
