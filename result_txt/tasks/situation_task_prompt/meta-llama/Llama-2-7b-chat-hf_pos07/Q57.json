    "Floating Islands: One creative solution to accommodate a drastic rise in ocean levels would be to construct floating islands. These man-made structures could be built using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, and designed to withstand the harsh marine environment. The islands could be engineered to have a stable base, providing a safe and secure living space for inhabitants.",
    "Underwater Cities: Another option would be to construct underwater cities, where the buildings and infrastructure are designed to withstand the high pressure and saltwater conditions. These cities could be built using advanced materials and technology, providing a self-sustaining environment for their inhabitants. The underwater layout could include areas for residential, commercial, and recreational purposes, ensuring a balanced and comfortable living space.",
    "Artificial Reefs: As the ocean levels rise, it's possible to create artificial reefs that could provide a habitat for marine life and protect coastal areas from erosion. These reefs could be designed to mimic the natural reef ecosystem, providing a thriving environment for marine species. The artificial reefs could also serve as a safe haven for humans, offering a sustainable and eco-friendly living solution.",
    "Modular Floating Homes: Modular floating homes could be a practical solution for accommodating a rising ocean level. These homes could be built using prefabricated modules, which could be easily assembled and disassembled as needed. The modules could be designed to be energy-efficient and sustainable, using materials that are resistant to marine environments. This approach would provide a flexible and adaptable living solution for those affected by rising ocean levels.",
    "Submerged Biospheres: Submerged biospheres are a futuristic and innovative solution for accommodating a drastic rise in ocean levels. These biospheres could be designed to mimic a natural ecosystem, providing a self-sustaining environment for plants, animals, and humans. The biospheres could be built using advanced materials and technology, ensuring a stable and secure living space for inhabitants. This approach would provide a unique and sustainable living solution for those affected by rising ocean levels."
