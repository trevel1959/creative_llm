    "**LED Light Integration**: Create a bicycle bell that incorporates LED lights. When the bell is rung, the lights could flash in a pattern to enhance visibility, especially at night. This could serve a dual purpose: notifying pedestrians and other cyclists while also increasing the visibility of the rider. The light could be programmed to change colors based on the time of day or weather conditions, ensuring maximum safety.",
    "**Voice-Activated Bell**: Design a voice-activated bicycle bell that responds to specific commands. Riders could say phrases like \"ring bell\" or \"alert\" to activate the bell without needing to take their hands off the handlebars. This would be especially beneficial for those navigating through crowded areas where hands-free operation is crucial. The system could use voice recognition technology to avoid accidental ringing.",
    "**Multi-Function Bell**: Innovate a bicycle bell that doubles as a mini horn and a whistle. The bell could have different settings: a traditional ringing sound for alerting pedestrians, a horn sound for warning vehicles, and a whistle for attracting attention in emergencies. This versatility would make it a valuable safety tool for cyclists, especially in urban environments where different sounds might be needed depending on the situation.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bell**: Introduce a solar-powered bicycle bell that harnesses sunlight to charge an internal battery. This bell could feature a rechargeable battery that powers not only the bell itself but also additional features like an LED light or a small digital display that shows battery life or other cycling metrics. This eco-friendly option would appeal to environmentally conscious cyclists and reduce the need for battery replacements.",
    "**Interactive Bell with Feedback System**: Create a bicycle bell that incorporates a feedback system, allowing it to provide audio or visual feedback to the rider. For instance, if the bell is rung, it could emit a different sound based on the frequency of use, or it could have a small display that indicates how many times the bell has been used during a ride. This feature could help cyclists become more aware of their surroundings and encourage them to use the bell more frequently in busy areas."
