    "**Eco-Friendly Transportation**: Arrange for guests to travel to your wedding in a manner that minimizes environmental impact. This could involve setting up carpooling arrangements, arranging for a shuttle service, or encouraging guests to arrive by public transport or bike. You can also rent electric or hybrid vehicles for the transportation needs on your wedding day. For instance, a company like 'Green Limousine' provides eco-friendly vehicles for special occasions.",
    "**Zero-Waste Catering**: Work with a caterer who specializes in zero-waste meals. They can create dishes that are both delicious and sustainable, using seasonal, local ingredients, and minimizing food waste. Compostable utensils, plates, and napkins should be used, along with recycling bins for any recyclable materials. A creative idea could be to serve food in reusable containers, which guests can take home as souvenirs.",
    "**Sustainable Wedding Favors**: Instead of traditional paper thank you cards or plastic favors, consider giving guests something that has a direct environmental benefit. This could include tree planting certificates, seed packets that grow native plants, or reusable items such as bamboo straws, beeswax wraps, or handmade soaps. These gifts not only reduce waste but also encourage sustainable practices among guests.",
    "**Eco-Themed Decorations**: Focus on decorations that are sustainable, biodegradable, and made from natural materials. Use flowers that are in season, and avoid synthetic decorations that will end up in landfills. Creative ideas include using locally sourced branches, leaves, or dried fruits as centerpieces, or hanging decorations made from recycled materials like glass bottles or old newspapers. Additionally, you can incorporate live plants into your decor to create a lush, eco-friendly atmosphere.",
    "**Renewable Energy at the Venue**: If possible, choose a venue that utilizes renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. Alternatively, you can hire a professional to provide solar-powered lighting and equipment for your event. This reduces your carbon footprint and sends a strong message about your commitment to sustainability. Another innovative approach could be to have a small wind turbine or solar panels set up specifically for your wedding, demonstrating how even small-scale renewable energy projects can make a difference.
