    "Law enforcement changes: With no need for weapons, there would be a profound change in the role and structure of law enforcement agencies. They could focus more on education, community relations, and crime prevention, freeing them from the need to carry firearms at all times. This could lead to improved relations with the public and lower rates of injuries or fatalities related to police action.",
    "Increased technology: If guns were no longer commonly used, the market would shift towards technology-based defense systems. This could include smarter surveillance, body scanners, and advanced security measures to protect areas. This could also lead to new high-tech jobs and industries focused on security.",
    "Changes in education: Without the threat of violence, schools could become safer environments for students and teachers, leading to a more productive learning environment. Schools may introduce new programs such as martial arts or self-defense techniques to combat any potential threats.",
    "Changes in sports: Sports such as archery, trap shooting, and other gun-oriented sports would be eliminated or transformed. This could lead to an overall increase in athletic diversity and possibly the rise of new sports such as drone racing or simulation-based survival games.",
    "Changes in mental health: In a world without guns, there may be a decreased incidence of violence-related mental health issues. It has been hypothesized that people who commit mass shootings often display signs of mental issues that have not been adequately addressed. Their removal from the social landscape could help to prevent such incidents in the future."
