They could be built in forests, parks, or even in backyards, providing a peaceful and eco-friendly sleeping space.",
    "Tent Cities: If beds disappeared, people could build tent cities to provide a temporary shelter for sleeping. Tents could be set up in open fields, parks, or even on rooftops, offering a flexible and portable sleeping solution. Tent cities could be designed with different levels of privacy and amenities, such as sleeping bags, blankets, and camping gear.",
    "Floating Beds: In a world without beds, people could adapt to sleeping on floating beds suspended in mid-air. These beds could be made of lightweight materials, such as inflatable mattresses or hammocks, and could be suspended from the ceiling or attached to walls. Floating beds would provide a unique and relaxing sleeping experience, and they could be designed to rotate or sway gently to create a soothing motion.",
    "Sleeping Pods: If beds disappeared, people could use sleeping pods as an alternative. Sleeping pods are small, enclosed spaces that provide a private and cozy sleeping area. They could be made of materials such as fabric, foam, or even recycled materials, and they could be designed to be portable or stationary. Sleeping pods could be placed in public areas, such as parks or train stations, or they could be installed in homes and offices.",
    "Hanging Nets: In a world without beds, people could adapt to sleeping in hanging nets. These nets could be made of durable materials, such as nylon or cotton, and could be hung from the ceiling or attached to walls. Hanging nets would provide a unique and adventurous sleeping experience, and they could be designed to be private or communal. They could also be used for other purposes, such as reading, meditating, or even working."
