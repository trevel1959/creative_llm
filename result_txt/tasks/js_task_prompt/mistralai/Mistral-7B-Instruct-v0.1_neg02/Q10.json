    "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: I would change the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to the start of World War I. Instead, I would have arranged for him to have a peaceful and successful visit to Sarajevo, where he could have met with local leaders and worked towards building stronger relationships between Austria-Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This would have prevented the outbreak of war and saved countless lives.",
    "The signing of the Treaty of Versailles: I would change the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh penalties on Germany after World War I. Instead, I would have worked towards a more fair and reasonable treaty that would have allowed Germany to recover more quickly and prevented the rise of the Nazi party.",
    "The fall of the Berlin Wall: I would change the fall of the Berlin Wall, which marked the end of the Cold War. Instead, I would have worked towards a more peaceful and cooperative relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which could have prevented the arms race and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.",
    "The discovery of penicillin: I would change the discovery of penicillin, which revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives. Instead, I would have worked towards the discovery of other antibiotics that could have been used to treat bacterial infections more effectively.",
    "The invention of the printing press: I would change the invention of the printing press, which made books and information more accessible to the masses. Instead, I would have worked towards the invention of other technologies that could have made information even more accessible and widespread, such as the internet or mobile devices."
