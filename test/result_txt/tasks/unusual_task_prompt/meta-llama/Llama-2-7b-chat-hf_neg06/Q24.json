    "Virtual Toothbrush: Create a virtual toothbrush that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to superimpose a digital toothbrush on the user's real-life mouth. The app would track the user's brushing motion and provide real-time feedback on brushing technique, brushing for the recommended 2 minutes, and covering all surfaces of the teeth.",
    "Sonic Toothbrush: Design a toothbrush that utilizes sonic technology to provide a more thorough and efficient cleaning experience. The toothbrush would feature multiple sonic vibrations and oscillations, which would help to remove plaque and debris more effectively than traditional toothbrushes. Additionally, the toothbrush could come with interchangeable heads for different brushing needs, such as a gentle head for sensitive teeth or a firmer head for tougher plaque.",
    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that can connect to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth, providing real-time data on brushing habits and oral health. The toothbrush could track brushing time, brushing technique, and even detect when the user has missed an area of the mouth. The app could provide personalized feedback and recommendations for improving oral hygiene.",
    "Chewable Toothbrush: Create a toothbrush that is chewable and can be used as a health supplement. The toothbrush would be made with natural ingredients and could provide essential vitamins and minerals for dental health. The chewable design would make it easy for users to remember to brush their teeth, especially children.",
    "Toothbrush Sanitizer: Design a toothbrush that can sanitize itself and the user's mouth. The toothbrush would feature a built-in UV-C light that kills bacteria and germs on the toothbrush and in the mouth. This would provide an additional layer of protection against oral infections and promote good oral hygiene. The toothbrush could also come with a travel case that contains a built-in UV-C light for sanitizing the toothbrush on the go."
