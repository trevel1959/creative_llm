    "**Eco-Friendly Detergent Dispenser**: Create a washing machine with a built-in eco-friendly detergent dispenser that uses biodegradable capsules or tablets. The machine could automatically dispense the right amount of detergent based on the load size and soil level, reducing the need for single-use plastic containers. Users could choose from a variety of natural detergent options, promoting sustainability while ensuring effective cleaning.",
    "**Integrated Drying System**: Design a washing machine that includes a built-in drying system, allowing users to wash and dry their clothes in one go. This could be achieved through a combination of heat pump technology and advanced moisture sensors that monitor humidity levels in the drum. The machine would automatically switch from washing to drying mode, providing convenience and saving space in small homes where separate appliances may not fit.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and steam to sanitize the drum and internal components of the washing machine. This technology would help eliminate odors, mold, and bacteria without the need for harsh chemicals. The machine could alert users when itâ€™s time for a self-cleaning cycle, promoting hygiene and extending the life of the appliance.",
    "**Noise-Cancellation Design**: Innovate a washing machine with advanced noise-cancellation technology that minimizes operational sounds. This could include sound-dampening materials in the drum and casing, as well as vibration reduction systems. Such a machine would be ideal for apartments or homes where noise levels need to be kept low, allowing users to do laundry at any time without disturbing others.",
    "**Customizable Wash Programs**: Develop a washing machine that allows users to create and save their own wash programs based on their unique laundry needs. This could include specific settings for delicate fabrics, heavily soiled items, or quick washes. The machine could also have a user-friendly touchscreen interface that makes it easy to select and modify settings, catering to individual preferences."
