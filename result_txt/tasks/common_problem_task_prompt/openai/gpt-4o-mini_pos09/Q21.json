    "**Cyberbullying**: With the rise of social media and online interactions, children are more susceptible to cyberbullying. Parents may struggle to monitor their child's online interactions effectively and recognize signs of distress. Open communication about online experiences is crucial, but many children may hesitate to share their experiences for fear of losing access to their devices or being seen as weak. Educating children about safe online practices and how to handle bullying is essential.",
    "**Digital Footprint Awareness**: Children often do not understand the long-term implications of their online actions, such as posting inappropriate photos or sharing personal information. This lack of awareness can lead to negative consequences in the future, including college admissions or job opportunities. Parents need to educate their children about digital footprints and the importance of maintaining a positive online presence, but this requires ongoing conversations and monitoring.",
    "**Content Exposure**: The internet is filled with content that may not be suitable for children, including violence, adult themes, and misinformation. Parents may find it challenging to filter what their children can access, especially with the increasing use of personal devices. Utilizing parental controls and engaging in co-viewing or discussions about the content can help mitigate this issue, but it requires vigilance and effort from parents.",
    "**Dependency on Technology**: As children become accustomed to digital devices for entertainment, learning, and socialization, there is a risk of developing a dependency on technology. This can hinder their ability to engage in face-to-face interactions, pursue outdoor activities, or develop hobbies that do not involve screens. Parents must encourage a balanced lifestyle that includes offline activities, which can be difficult in a technology-driven society.",
    "**Misinformation and Critical Thinking**: The digital age is rife with misinformation, and children may struggle to differentiate between credible sources and unreliable ones. This can lead to the spread of false information and skewed perceptions of reality. Parents can play a vital role in teaching their children critical thinking skills and media literacy, helping them to evaluate sources and understand the importance of fact-checking."
