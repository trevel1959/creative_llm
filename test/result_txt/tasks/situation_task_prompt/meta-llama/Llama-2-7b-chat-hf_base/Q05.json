    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One option would be to use solar-powered lanterns that use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity during the day, storing it in a battery for use at night. These lanterns can be placed around the home or in specific areas where light is needed, providing a reliable source of light even without the sun.",
    "LED Light Bulbs: Another option would be to replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs, which use significantly less energy and can provide bright light for longer periods of time. LED bulbs can be powered by a combination of mains electricity and a battery backup system, ensuring that light is available even during a sunless day.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: A unique solution would be to use mirrors to reflect sunlight into areas where it is needed. This can be achieved by placing mirrors at strategic angles to reflect sunlight into rooms or areas, providing a bright and natural source of light. This method can be especially effective in larger spaces or areas with high ceilings, where traditional lighting methods may not be practical.",
    "Bioluminescent Plants: Another creative solution would be to incorporate bioluminescent plants into the home or workspace. These plants, such as glowing mushrooms or luminous flowers, can provide a soft, natural light source without the need for electricity. This method can add a touch of nature and beauty to the space, while also providing a reliable source of light.",
    "Light-Emitting Paint: A more futuristic solution would be to use light-emitting paint on walls or surfaces, which can emit a soft, steady light without the need for any additional sources. This paint can be charged during the day using solar panels or other energy sources, providing a reliable source of light even without the sun. This method can be particularly useful in areas where natural light is limited or unpredictable."
