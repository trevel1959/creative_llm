    "Cost: The cost of installing solar panels can be high, especially if the city has to purchase or lease the panels. This may be a barrier for some homeowners who cannot afford the upfront cost.",
    "Maintenance: Solar panels require regular maintenance, including cleaning and monitoring for any issues. If the city is responsible for maintaining the solar panels, this could be a significant task to undertake.",
    "Energy storage: Solar panels generate electricity during the day, but they do not provide power during the night or in case of power outages. Energy storage systems, such as batteries, may be necessary to ensure a reliable energy supply.",
    "Grid integration: Solar panels generate electricity that can be fed back into the grid, but this requires the city to have the infrastructure in place to manage the flow of electricity. This may involve upgrading the electrical grid and adding smart meters to track the amount of electricity generated.",
    "Aesthetics: Solar panels can be visually unappealing, especially if they are installed in a way that disrupts the view of the neighborhood. This could be a concern for homeowners who do not want the panels to detract from the appearance of their homes."
