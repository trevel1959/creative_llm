    "Oven-baked aromatherapy: Create an oven-baked aromatherapy product that utilizes the heat of the oven to release the fragrance of essential oils. This could be done by mixing the essential oils with a carrier oil and then baking it in the oven until the fragrance is released. The resulting product could be a scented candle, potpourri, or even a room spray.",
    "Smart oven technology: Design an oven that incorporates smart technology, such as a built-in scale, thermometer, and timer. This would allow users to accurately measure and monitor the cooking process, ensuring that their food is cooked to the perfect temperature and time. The oven could also be connected to a mobile app, allowing users to control it remotely and receive notifications when their food is ready.",
    "Oven-roasted meal prep: Create a meal prep system that utilizes the oven to cook and prepare healthy meals in advance. This could involve using the oven to roast vegetables, cook grains, and prepare protein sources, all of which can be stored in individual portions for easy reheating throughout the week. The system could also include a scheduling feature, allowing users to plan their meals in advance and automatically have their oven prepare them at the designated time.",
    "Oven-based fermentation: Design an oven that incorporates a fermentation chamber, allowing users to create their own fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and sourdough bread. The chamber would be designed to maintain a consistent temperature and humidity level, ensuring that the fermentation process is carried out properly. This could be a great way to create healthy, probiotic-rich foods at home.",
    "Oven-powered air purifier: Create an oven that also functions as an air purifier, using the heat of the oven to purify the air in the surrounding environment. This could involve using a HEPA filter or other air purification technology to remove impurities and allergens from the air. This would be a great addition to any home, particularly for those who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues."
