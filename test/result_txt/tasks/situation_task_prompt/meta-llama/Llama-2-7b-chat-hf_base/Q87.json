    "Pneumatic Cutting Tools: In a world without scissors or knives, people could use pneumatic cutting tools like air shears or air knives. These tools use compressed air to cut through materials like paper, plastic, and metal with precision and ease. They would be a suitable replacement for scissors and knives, especially for tasks that require cutting large quantities of materials.",
    "Laser Cutting Technology: Laser cutting technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making it possible to cut through a wide range of materials with high precision and accuracy. With the absence of scissors and knives, laser cutting technology could be the go-to solution for cutting materials like wood, plastic, and fabric. This method would be especially useful for intricate designs and patterns that require precise cuts.",
    "Magnetic Cutting: Magnetic cutting technology uses magnetic fields to cut through materials like metal and plastic. This method could be used in place of scissors and knives for cutting tasks. Magnetic cutting tools would be especially useful for cutting through materials that are difficult to cut with traditional methods, such as cutting through thick metal sheets or plastic pipes.",
    "Water Jets: Water jets are a cutting-edge technology that uses a high-pressure stream of water to cut through materials like metal, stone, and glass. In a world without scissors or knives, water jets could be used to cut through a variety of materials with precision and accuracy. This method would be especially useful for cutting intricate designs and patterns, as well as for cutting through hard-to-reach areas.",
    "Sonic Cutting: Sonic cutting technology uses high-frequency sound waves to cut through materials like metal, plastic, and glass. This method would be a suitable replacement for scissors and knives, especially for cutting tasks that require precision and accuracy. Sonic cutting technology could also be used to cut through materials that are difficult to cut with traditional methods, such as cutting through thick metal sheets or plastic pipes."
