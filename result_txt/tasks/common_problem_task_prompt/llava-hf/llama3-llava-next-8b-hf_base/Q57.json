    "**Inadequate product offerings:** If the store lacks a diverse range of products, it may struggle to attract customers with a wide range of tastes and preferences. This can be addressed by periodically reviewing and updating the product list to ensure it is current, relevant, and diverse enough to appeal to a broad customer base.",
    "**Poor customer service:** If the store's customer service skills or system is not effective, customers may be dissatisfied and may not return for future purchases or recommend the store to others. To resolve this, the store can invest in improving the customer service team's training and implementing effective resolution strategies for customer complaints.",
    "**Limited payment options:** If the store only accepts a limited number of payment methods, it may deter some customers from completing their purchases. To overcome this, the store can explore alternative payment options, such as financing options, mobile payments, and various currencies, to provide a more accessible and convenient purchasing experience.",
    "**High shipping costs or long delivery times:** Fast and efficient shipping is essential for online purchases, and excessive shipping costs or long delivery times can negatively impact sales and customer satisfaction. To address this issue, the store can optimize its logistics and shipment services or consider alternative shipping options such as same-day delivery, next-day delivery or in-store pick-up.",
    "**Lack of trust and security:** If customers have concerns about the store's credibility, security, or privacy policies, they are less likely to make purchases or recommend the store to others. To resolve this, the store should ensure clear disclosure of trust and security measures, such as SSL certification and easy access to policies, and offer proof of trust through third-party verification."
