    "Hovercraft: One creative solution to travel to another continent without planes is by using hovercraft technology. Hovercrafts are vehicles that use air pressure to lift and propel them above the ground, allowing for fast and efficient travel over long distances. By harnessing this technology, people could travel across continents in a matter of hours, rather than days or weeks by traditional means.",
    "Space Travel: In a world without planes, space travel could become the next mode of transportation for intercontinental travel. While this may seem like a far-fetched idea, there are already several private companies working on developing commercial spacecraft that could potentially take passengers to the moon or other destinations in low Earth orbit. While this option would be expensive and require extensive training, it would offer a unique and exciting way to travel to another continent.",
    "Maglev Trains: Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, use magnetic fields to lift and propel trains above the track, reducing friction and allowing for faster travel. By developing maglev trains that can travel at high speeds over long distances, people could travel between continents in a relatively short amount of time. This mode of transportation would be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional trains, making it an attractive option for intercontinental travel.",
    "Submarines: Submarines could be used to travel between continents, especially in the deep ocean areas where traditional modes of transportation are not feasible. While this mode of transportation would require specialized equipment and training, it could offer a unique and exciting way to travel to another continent. Submarines could potentially travel at depths of up to 30,000 feet, allowing for transit times of several days or weeks depending on the distance.",
    "Airships: Another creative solution to travel to another continent without planes is by using airships. Airships are large, lighter-than-air vessels that use helium or hydrogen to lift them above the ground. While this mode of transportation is slower than traditional planes, it could offer a more comfortable and scenic way to travel between continents. Airships could potentially travel at speeds of up to 100 mph and could be powered by renewable energy sources, making them a more environmentally friendly option for intercontinental travel."
