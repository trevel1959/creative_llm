    "**Floating Coral Islands**: Imagine a series of interconnected floating islands made from sustainable materials, designed to mimic coral reefs. These islands would host diverse marine life, including fish, sea turtles, and colorful corals. The habitat would have underwater tunnels and viewing areas for both the animals and visitors, allowing for immersive experiences. Each island would be equipped with natural filtration systems to maintain water quality and provide a safe environment for aquatic species to thrive.",
    "**Underground Ecosystem**: This habitat would be a vast network of tunnels and chambers below the surface, simulating a natural underground ecosystem. The tunnels would be filled with unique plants that thrive in low light, and the chambers would host various small mammals, insects, and fungi. Special lighting would mimic natural cycles to support the growth of underground flora. This habitat would be an excellent way to educate visitors about the importance of subterranean ecosystems and their inhabitants.",
    "**Sky Garden Canopy**: This habitat would consist of multiple layers of platforms suspended high in the trees, creating a three-dimensional space for arboreal animals like monkeys, birds, and sloths. Each layer would feature different types of vegetation, climbing structures, and feeding stations, promoting natural behaviors and interactions among species. The design would also include observation areas for visitors to experience the canopy's unique ecosystem without disturbing the animals.",
    "**Desert Oasis Retreat**: A simulated desert habitat featuring a central oasis with lush vegetation, water features, and shaded areas. This oasis would attract a variety of desert-dwelling animals, such as fennec foxes, tortoises, and various bird species. The surrounding sandy landscape would include naturalistic burrows and rock formations, providing shelter and hiding spots. This habitat would educate visitors about desert ecosystems, their fragility, and the adaptations of the species that inhabit them.",
    "**Arctic Wonderland**: This habitat would replicate the icy environment of the Arctic, complete with snow-covered landscapes, ice caves, and freezing water bodies. It would be home to polar bears, seals, and arctic foxes. The design would incorporate temperature control systems to maintain a cold climate and include educational exhibits on climate change and its impact on polar ecosystems. Visitors could observe the animals in their natural behaviors while learning about conservation efforts."
