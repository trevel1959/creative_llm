The player could manipulate the sound using breath control, fingerings, and a unique \"air-jet\" system that would allow for expressive glissando effects.",
    "**Lumina**: A stringed instrument that incorporates LED lights and fiber optics to create a mesmerizing light show. The Lumina would have a hollow body with a network of fibers that would transmit light pulses to create a dynamic, three-dimensional effect. The player could control the light patterns using a custom-built effects pedal, allowing for a wide range of visual and aural textures.
