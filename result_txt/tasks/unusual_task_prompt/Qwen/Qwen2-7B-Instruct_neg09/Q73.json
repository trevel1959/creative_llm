    "**Time Management Workshop Series**: Create a series of workshops focusing on various techniques for effective time management. Each workshop could be centered around a specific tool or strategy (like Pomodoro Technique, Eisenhower Matrix, etc.). You can include interactive elements like quizzes, group discussions, and practical exercises to help participants apply these strategies effectively in their daily lives. ",
    "**Future Self Letter**: Write a letter to your future self detailing your current struggles, the assignment you're regretting, and how you plan to overcome it. This exercise not only helps in processing emotions but also serves as a motivational reminder. Encourage others to do the same and perhaps organize a sharing session where participants can read out their letters aloud.",
    "**Creative Breakthrough Session**: Host a session where participants brainstorm ways they can creatively tackle the assignment using different resources or tools they might not have initially considered. This could involve using multimedia elements (like videos, podcasts), innovative software, or even unconventional methods that leverage their personal strengths.",
    "**Expert Guest Panel**: Invite individuals who are experts in managing large tasks or projects to share their experiences and tips. They could discuss common regrets, strategies to avoid them, and how they handle similar situations. This can provide real-life examples and insights that are invaluable for learning.",
    "**Personal Accountability Buddy System**: Implement a buddy system where each participant is paired up with someone else who will check-in on their progress, offer support, and hold them accountable for meeting deadlines. This peer-to-peer accountability can significantly boost motivation and productivity."
