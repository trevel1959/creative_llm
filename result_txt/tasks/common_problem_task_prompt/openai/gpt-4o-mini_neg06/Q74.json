    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact the launch schedule. High winds, thunderstorms, or lightning can delay the launch or force a cancellation. For example, if a launch is scheduled during hurricane season, there may be a need to reroute or reschedule the launch to ensure safety, which can be costly and time-consuming.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: There are numerous regulations governing space launches, including international treaties and national laws. Failing to comply with these regulations can lead to legal challenges or the inability to launch. For instance, if a company does not secure the necessary licenses from regulatory bodies, they may face fines or delays in their launch timeline.",
    "**Funding and Budget Overruns**: The cost of launching a satellite can be exorbitant, and budget overruns can jeopardize the entire mission. If unexpected expenses arise, such as the need for additional testing or repairs, the project may run out of funds. This could lead to the cancellation of the launch or the need to seek additional funding, which may not be readily available.",
    "**Launch Site Issues**: The chosen launch site may present problems, such as logistical challenges or environmental concerns. For example, if the launch site is located in an area prone to earthquakes, it may require additional engineering measures to ensure the launch pad's stability. Additionally, community opposition to the launch site can lead to protests or legal challenges.",
    "**Payload Integration Problems**: The integration of the satellite with the launch vehicle is a critical phase that can encounter issues. If there are compatibility problems between the satellite and the rocket, such as mismatched connectors or incorrect weight distribution, it could lead to launch delays or failures. For instance, if the satellite is not securely attached, it may separate prematurely or not at all."
