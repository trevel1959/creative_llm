    "**Modular Accessory Attachments**: Create a range of modular accessories that can be easily attached or detached from wheelchairs. These could include cup holders, storage compartments, phone holders, or even portable charging stations. Users could customize their wheelchairs based on their daily needs, enhancing functionality without compromising style or comfort.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Develop an augmented reality (AR) interface that overlays information on the user’s environment. For example, users could wear AR glasses that highlight accessible routes, show nearby amenities, or provide information about their surroundings. This technology could empower users to navigate independently and explore new places with confidence.",
    "**Ergonomic Adaptive Seating**: Design an advanced seating system that automatically adjusts to the user’s posture and preferences. Utilizing sensors, the seat could detect pressure points and make real-time adjustments to provide optimal support and comfort. This would reduce fatigue during long periods of use and promote better posture, enhancing overall health.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Incorporate health monitoring devices within the wheelchair that track vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and even stress levels. This data could be synced with a mobile app to provide users and caregivers with insights into the user’s health, allowing for proactive management of any potential issues.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate the design of wheelchairs using sustainable and eco-friendly materials. This could include biodegradable plastics, recycled metals, or organic fabrics. Not only would this appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, but it could also promote a positive image for the wheelchair industry as a whole, aligning with global sustainability goals."
