    "**Community Resistance**: Residents may resist changes to their public transportation system, especially if they feel the overhaul will negatively impact their daily lives. This could manifest as opposition to route changes, increased fares, or construction disruptions. Engaging with the community through public forums and surveys is essential to address concerns and foster support for the new system.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Many cities have aging infrastructure that may not support modern transportation needs. Upgrading roads, bridges, and rail lines can be a massive undertaking that uncovers unexpected issues, such as the need for environmental assessments or compliance with safety regulations. This can lead to increased costs and extended timelines.",
    "**Technology Integration**: Modernizing a public transportation system often involves incorporating new technologies, such as smart ticketing systems or real-time tracking apps. However, integrating these technologies can be complex and may require staff training, system compatibility checks, and ongoing maintenance. If not implemented correctly, these technologies could lead to confusion among users and decreased ridership.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Overhauling a public transportation system can have significant environmental implications. Construction projects may disrupt local ecosystems, increase pollution, or lead to displacement of communities. It's crucial to conduct thorough environmental impact assessments and develop strategies to mitigate any negative effects to ensure the project aligns with sustainability goals.",
    "**Equity and Accessibility**: A significant challenge in revamping public transportation is ensuring that the new system is equitable and accessible for all community members, including those with disabilities, low-income residents, and marginalized groups. Failure to address these needs could exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to public backlash."
