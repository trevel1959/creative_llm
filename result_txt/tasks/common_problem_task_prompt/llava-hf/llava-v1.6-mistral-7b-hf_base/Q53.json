    "TIME CONSTRAINTS: Deadlines can be a major obstacle for screenwriters, especially if the scope of the film or the complexity of the plot is extensive. Developing a timeline, breaking the story into smaller segments, and creating a writing schedule can manage time constraints.",
    "SCRIPT FLUCTUATIONS: Writers may face frequent changes during the writing process, which can affect both the narrative flow and the overall structure of the script. To combat this, creating a flexible outline, anticipating potential changes, and incorporating the ability to revise during the writing process can be helpful.",
    "SUBTEXT: Incorporating subtext into characters and the plot may be challenging for some writers. To address this, writers can practice examining their characters by asking what they want and what needs are driving them, as well as identifying the underlying theme and emotion of the story.",
    "MARKET SATURATION: The film industry can be highly competitive, leading to a risk of creating a screenplay that may feel repetitive or unoriginal. To overcome this challenge, writers can research current trends and popular genres, aim to develop a unique take or fresh perspective, and avoid cliches and overused plot devices.",
    "PERSONAL Bias and CONFLICT: Writer's personal biases might be reflected in their characters or plot choices, making the story feel unrelatable or insensitive to audiences. Recognizing and acknowledging these biases, and developing empathy with different perspectives can help overcome this problem."
