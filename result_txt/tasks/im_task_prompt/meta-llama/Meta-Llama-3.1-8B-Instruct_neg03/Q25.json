    "**Eco- Friendly Stapler with Built-in Compostable Staples**: Design a stapler that uses compostable staples made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or sugarcane. The stapler would have a built-in composting system that allows users to dispose of the staples in an eco-friendly manner. The composting system would break down the staples into nutrient-rich soil that can be used to fertilize plants.",
    "**Smart Stapler with Integrated Task Management**: Create a stapler that doubles as a task management tool. The stapler would have a built-in screen and keyboard that allows users to input tasks and deadlines. The stapler would then send reminders and notifications to the user's phone or computer. The stapler would also have a built-in calendar and to-do list feature, allowing users to stay organized and focused.",
    "**Stapler with Built-in Document Scanner and Digital Archiving**: Design a stapler that includes a built-in document scanner and digital archiving system. The stapler would allow users to scan and digitize their documents, and then store them securely in the cloud. The stapler would also have a built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature, allowing users to search and retrieve documents by keyword or phrase.",
    "**Stapler with Integrated 3D Printing Capability**: Create a stapler that includes a built-in 3D printing module. The stapler would allow users to print small 3D objects, such as paper clips, staples, or even small tools. The stapler would come with a library of pre-designed 3D models that users can print with the touch of a button.",
    "**Stapler with Augmented Reality Display**: Design a stapler that includes an augmented reality (AR) display. The stapler would have a small screen that displays interactive information and tutorials on how to use the stapler, as well as provide users with information on the staples they are using. The AR display would also allow users to scan and identify different types of paper and documents, providing information on their weight, thickness, and other properties. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are just the starting point. Here are some potential next steps to further develop and refine them: 1. **Eco-Friendly Stapler with Built-in Compostable Staples**: \t* Research and identify suitable plant-based materials for the compostable staples."
