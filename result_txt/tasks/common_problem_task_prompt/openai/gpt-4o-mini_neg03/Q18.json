    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: The absence of refrigeration poses significant challenges for food storage and preservation, leading to food spoilage and waste. To combat this, families could explore alternative food preservation methods such as canning, pickling, and drying. Additionally, local community gardens or co-ops could be established to promote fresh produce sharing among neighbors.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many water supply systems rely on electricity for pumping and purification. Without power, access to clean water could become a major concern. Communities could implement rainwater harvesting systems or develop manual water filtration methods to ensure a steady supply of clean water. Educating residents on water conservation techniques would also be essential.",
    "**Health and Medical Risks**: Individuals with medical conditions that require electrical devices (like oxygen machines or refrigeration for medications) may face serious health risks. To mitigate this, local health services could create a support network to help those in need, offering resources like battery-powered medical devices or establishing emergency care facilities equipped with generators.",
    "**Limited Communication**: Without electricity, traditional means of communication, such as phones and the internet, would be unavailable. Communities could establish a system of runners or designated messengers to relay important messages or updates. Additionally, encouraging the use of written notes or community gathering points could facilitate communication among residents.",
    "**Increased Safety Concerns**: The absence of streetlights and home security systems could lead to increased crime rates and safety issues. Neighborhood watch programs could be developed, encouraging residents to look out for one another. Organizing community patrols and establishing safe zones with temporary lighting solutions, such as solar-powered lanterns, could enhance safety."
