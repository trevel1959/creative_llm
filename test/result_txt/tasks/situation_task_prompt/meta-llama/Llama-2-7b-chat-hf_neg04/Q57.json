    "Floating Cities: One creative solution to rising ocean levels is to build floating cities. These cities would be designed to float on the water, providing a safe and stable living space for those affected by the rising tides. The floating cities could be made up of multiple platforms or islands, connected by bridges or tunnels, and would feature all the amenities of a traditional city, including homes, businesses, and recreational spaces.",
    "Underwater Cities: Another option for dealing with rising ocean levels is to build underwater cities. These cities would be designed to withstand the high pressures and temperatures of the deep ocean, and would feature advanced filtration systems to remove salt and other impurities from the water. The underwater cities could be built using advanced materials, such as transparent domes or submersible modules, and would provide a unique and sustainable living environment for those who choose to live there.",
    "Treehouses on Stilts: For those who prefer a more rustic and natural living environment, treehouses on stilts could be a viable option. These treehouses would be built on tall stilts, elevated above the rising water level, and would be designed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. The treehouses could be made from sustainable materials, such as recycled wood or bamboo, and would feature large windows and open spaces to take advantage of the natural light and views.",
    "Floating Islands: Another creative solution to rising ocean levels is to build floating islands. These islands would be made up of a series of interconnected platforms, floating on the water, and would feature all the amenities of a traditional island, including homes, businesses, and recreational spaces. The floating islands could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, and would provide a sustainable and self-sufficient living environment for those who choose to live there.",
    "Artificial Reefs: For those who prefer a more adventurous and eco-friendly living environment, artificial reefs could be a viable option. Artificial reefs are underwater structures that are designed to attract marine life and provide a habitat for fish and other sea creatures. These reefs could be built using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic or natural cor"
