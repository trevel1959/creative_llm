    "Scissors with Built-in Cutting Board: The cutting board is a common accessory for scissors, but what if the scissors themselves had a built-in cutting board? This design would feature a flat, rectangular surface integrated into the handle of the scissors, making it easier to cut and manipulate materials without the need for a separate cutting board. The cutting board could be made of a durable, easy-to-clean material like silicone or stainless steel.",
    "Scissors with Built-in Ruler: For those who need to measure their cuts, a set of scissors with a built-in ruler could be incredibly useful. The ruler could be incorporated into the handle of the scissors, with measurements marked along the length of the handle. This would allow users to quickly and easily measure their cuts, without the need for a separate ruler. The ruler could be made of a durable material like plastic or metal, and could be calibrated for accuracy.",
    "Scissors with Built-in Tape Measure: Another useful feature for craftspeople and DIY enthusiasts is a set of scissors with a built-in tape measure. The tape measure could be integrated into the handle of the scissors, with measurements marked along the length of the handle. This would allow users to measure the length of their cuts, as well as the distance between different points on a project. The tape measure could be made of a durable material like plastic or metal, and could be calibrated for accuracy.",
    "Scissors with Built-in Precision Grip: For those who struggle with slippery hands or who need to make precise cuts, a set of scissors with a built-in precision grip could be incredibly useful. The grip could be made of a textured material like rubber or silicone, and could be molded to fit the user's hand. This would provide a secure grip, even when the user's hands are slippery with moisture or soap. The precision grip could also help users make more accurate cuts, as it would allow them to apply more control and pressure to the scissors.",
