    "UV Protection Enhancement: Another way to improve sunglasses is by increasing the level of UV protection they offer. This can be achieved by using lenses with higher UV protection ratings or by incorporating polarizing filters that reduce glare and enhance contrast.",
    "Customizable Lenses: Sunglasses could be made with interchangeable lenses that allow users to choose the level of UV protection, tint, and polarization based on their specific needs and preferences.",
    "Advanced Grip Design: To improve the grip of sunglasses on the face, a non-slip grip or rubberized frame could be added to prevent slipping or sliding during physical activities or while running.",
    "Improved Ventilation: To keep the wearer cool and comfortable, sunglasses could be designed with vents or airflow channels that allow air to circulate around the eyes.",
    "Water Resistance: Sunglasses could be made with water-resistant materials, such as hydrophobic coatings or sealed components, to prevent fogging or misting up in wet conditions."
