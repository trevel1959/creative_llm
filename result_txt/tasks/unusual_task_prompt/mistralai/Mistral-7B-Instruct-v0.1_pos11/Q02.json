    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to control a rubber hand in real-time. This would allow for a more immersive and interactive experience, as the user could see their hand in the virtual world and feel it move in response to their movements.",
    "Develop a robot that can mimic the movements of a rubber hand. This would be a useful tool for tasks that require precision and dexterity, such as surgery or assembling small parts.",
    "Create a game that incorporates a rubber hand as the main character. The game could be a puzzle or adventure game, and the rubber hand would need to use its unique abilities to progress through the levels.",
    "Develop a device that can translate sign language into movements of a rubber hand. This would be a useful tool for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and would allow them to communicate more easily with others.",
    "Create a virtual assistant that can use a rubber hand to perform tasks, such as grabbing and moving objects or signing. This would be a useful tool for people with disabilities, as it would allow them to perform tasks that may be difficult or impossible for them to do on their own."
