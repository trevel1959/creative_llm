    "Incorporating Renewable Energy Sources: A high-rise building can incorporate renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines on its rooftop to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also helps in reducing electricity bills.",
    "Green Roofs: A green roof is a layer of vegetation planted on top of a building. It helps in reducing heat absorption, improves air quality, provides insulation, and reduces stormwater runoff. The green roof can be designed to include native plants that are adapted to the local climate and provide habitat for birds and insects.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting System: A rainwater harvesting system can be installed to collect rainwater from rooftops and store it for later use. This water can be used for irrigation, washing, and even drinking if properly treated.",
    "Smart Building Technology: High-rise buildings can be equipped with smart building technology that allows for remote monitoring and control of various systems such as lighting, heating, cooling, and security. This technology can help in reducing energy consumption and improving the efficiency of the building.",
    "Vertical Gardens: Vertical gardens can be incorporated into the exterior walls of a high-rise building. These gardens not only add aesthetic value to the building but also improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and providing oxygen. They can also help in reducing the urban heat island effect by reflecting sunlight and absorbing heat."
