    "**Cleaning Small Crevices**: A toothbrush is perfect for cleaning hard-to-reach places. It can be used to scrub the intricate parts of gadgets, such as keyboards, camera lenses, and even jewelry. The bristles can get into tiny gaps that regular cleaning tools can't reach, ensuring a thorough clean without scratching delicate surfaces.",
    "**Gardening Tool**: In the garden, a toothbrush can serve as a mini weeder. The stiff bristles can help remove weeds from around delicate plants without disturbing their roots. Additionally, it can be used to gently brush off soil from the leaves of plants or to apply small amounts of fertilizer or pest control directly to the soil.",
    "**Pet Grooming Aid**: A toothbrush can be an excellent tool for grooming pets, especially for small animals like cats or rabbits. The soft bristles can help remove loose fur, dirt, and dander, making it easier to keep pets clean and healthy. It can also be used to brush teeth in animals that are tolerant of oral care, promoting dental hygiene.",
    "**Crafting Tool for Texturing**: In crafting, a toothbrush can be used to create texture on various materials. For instance, when working with clay or plaster, brushing the surface with a toothbrush can create interesting patterns and designs. It can also be used to apply paint or ink in a controlled manner, adding unique elements to scrapbooking or card-making projects.",
    "**Shoe Cleaning Brush**: Instead of using a designated shoe brush, a toothbrush can effectively clean the soles and sides of shoes. The bristles can get into the grooves of sneaker soles or around the eyelets of dress shoes, making it easier to remove dirt and grime. This is particularly useful for cleaning white sneakers or canvas shoes that tend to show dirt easily."
