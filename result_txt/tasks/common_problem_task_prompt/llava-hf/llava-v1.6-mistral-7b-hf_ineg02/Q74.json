    "**Launch Vehicle Selection**: Choosing the right launch vehicle is crucial for a successful satellite launch. Each launch vehicle has different characteristics, such as launch capacity, launch cost, and launch frequency, which need to be carefully selected based on the specific mission requirements.",
    "**Launch Window**: Choosing the right launch window is also important, as it affects the mission success rate. A launch window is the time period during which launch conditions are suitable for a successful launch. Weather and other environmental factors play a significant role in determining the launch window.",
    "**Security and Safety**: Security and safety must be taken into account during the entire mission, from the design process to the launch itself and post-launch operations. This includes ensuring that unauthorized personnel do not have access to sensitive data, and that the launch site is secure from any potential threats.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Launches can have significant environmental impacts, such as the generation of emissions and noise pollution. Addressing these environmental concerns is important in minimizing the impact on the local ecosystem and the general population.",
    "**Space Traffic Management**: As the number of space objects in Earth's orbit increases, the need for space traffic management becomes more critical. This involves tracking the movements of other space craft and satellite to avoid collisions and ensure that they operate within the defined regulations and protocols."
