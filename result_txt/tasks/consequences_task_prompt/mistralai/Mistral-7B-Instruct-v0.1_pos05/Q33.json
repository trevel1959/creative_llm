    "Animals would have a much larger carrying capacity, which would allow them to transport more food and resources. For example, elephants could carry more logs for building, or horses could carry more supplies for humans.",
    "Animals would have a greater impact on their environment. Larger animals would require more resources, which could lead to overgrazing or habitat destruction. Additionally, larger animals would produce more waste, which could contribute to pollution.",
    "Larger animals would be more vulnerable to predators. Predators would be able to take down larger prey more easily, which could lead to a decline in the population of larger animals.",
    "Larger animals would be more difficult to domesticate. For example, it would be more difficult to train a horse to carry a rider if it was twice its current size.",
    "Larger animals would have a different set of adaptations. For example, a larger dog would need stronger bones and larger paws to support its weight. Similarly, a larger bird would need a larger beak to catch prey."
