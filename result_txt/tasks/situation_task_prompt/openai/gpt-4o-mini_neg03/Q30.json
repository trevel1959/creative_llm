    "**Fermented Foods**: Fermentation can be utilized to enhance the nutritional profile of other food sources. Foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso can be made from non-fruit and non-vegetable ingredients, such as grains and legumes. Fermented foods are rich in probiotics and can help improve gut health, which in turn can enhance nutrient absorption. Additionally, these foods can be fortified with herbs and spices that provide additional vitamins and minerals.",
    "**Seaweed and Algae Supplements**: Seaweeds like nori, dulse, and spirulina are rich in vitamins and minerals, including iodine, calcium, and B vitamins. These can be harvested from oceans or cultivated in controlled environments. Algae-based supplements, like chlorella and spirulina, can also provide a concentrated source of essential nutrients. Incorporating these into diets can help bridge the nutritional gap left by the absence of fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Nutrient-Enhanced Grains and Legumes**: Focusing on grains and legumes that have been genetically modified or selectively bred to be higher in essential vitamins and minerals can be an effective strategy. For example, biofortified crops such as iron-rich beans or zinc-enriched rice can be cultivated to ensure that essential nutrients are still available. Developing recipes that utilize these enhanced grains and legumes can help create a balanced diet.",
    "**Nutritional Yeast**: This deactivated yeast is a powerhouse of nutrients, particularly B vitamins, including B12, which is crucial for those who might lack animal products in their diet. Nutritional yeast can be used as a seasoning or added to various dishes for a cheesy flavor while boosting nutrient intake. Itâ€™s also a great source of protein and fiber, making it a versatile addition to meals.",
    "**Synthetic Nutrient Supplements**: With advancements in biotechnology, it is possible to create synthetic vitamins and minerals that can be consumed in pill or powder form. These supplements can be tailored to meet individual dietary needs, ensuring that people receive the essential nutrients they require. Furthermore, food companies could develop fortified foods that include these synthetic nutrients, providing a convenient way to maintain a balanced diet."
