    "Vertical Farming: One creative solution to ensure the availability of essential vitamins and minerals even if all fruits and vegetables disappeared is through vertical farming. This involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in indoor environments, using hydroponics or aeroponics. By doing so, farmers can maximize their yield per square foot, making it possible to produce a wide variety of crops in a small area. This method also allows for year-round production, regardless of season or weather conditions, ensuring a steady supply of essential nutrients.",
    "Microgreens: Another innovative solution is to focus on microgreens, which are young, nutrient-dense versions of leafy greens, herbs, and other vegetables. Microgreens are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and can be grown year-round in indoor environments. They can be easily incorporated into meals, such as salads, smoothies, and sandwiches, and can provide a boost of essential nutrients.",
    "Food Hydrolysis: Food hydrolysis is a process that involves breaking down food molecules into their most basic components, such as amino acids, sugars, and minerals. This process can be used to extract the essential vitamins and minerals from non-vegetable sources, such as meat, eggs, and dairy products. For example, hydrolyzed whey protein can provide a rich source of branched-chain amino acids, which are important for muscle growth and repair.",
    "Algae-based Supplements: Algae are a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, calcium, and iron. Algae-based supplements can be produced in large quantities, using photobioreactors or open ponds, and can provide a sustainable source of these nutrients. Additionally, algae are low in calories and fat, making them an attractive alternative to traditional supplements.",
    "Synthetic Nutrients: While not a natural source of vitamins and minerals, synthetic nutrients can be created in a laboratory using chemical reactions. These synthetic nutrients can be designed to m"
