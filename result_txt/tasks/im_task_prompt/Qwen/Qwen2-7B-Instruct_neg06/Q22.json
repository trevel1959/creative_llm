    "**Innovative Light Design**: Create a flashlight that utilizes a unique light-emitting diode (LED) design, allowing for a more focused beam that can be adjusted for different tasks. The flashlight could have a series of lenses or mirrors inside that can be manipulated by a dial on the handle, enabling users to choose between a wide floodlight or a narrow spotlight.",
    "**Energy-Saving Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that is powered by kinetic energy, converting the user's motion into electricity. This would be particularly useful in situations where batteries are not available or when conserving power is essential. The flashlight might feature a built-in pedometer to indicate how much charge has been collected.",
    "**Voice-Activated Flashlight**: Integrate voice commands into the flashlight so that users can operate it without having to touch it. This could include commands like \"turn on,\" \"adjust brightness,\" or \"switch to strobe mode.\" This idea is especially helpful for individuals with motor disabilities or for those who prefer hands-free operation.",
    "**Waterproof and Durable Construction**: Design a flashlight specifically for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or kayaking. It should be waterproof, shockproof, and made from materials that can withstand extreme temperatures. The flashlight could also include features like a carabiner clip for easy attachment to gear or a built-in compass.",
    "**Smart Flashlight Integration**: Combine traditional flashlight functionality with smart device connectivity. The flashlight could be paired with a smartphone app, allowing users to control brightness, switch modes, or even receive alerts about low battery life. This could also include a feature where the flashlight doubles as a Bluetooth speaker, enhancing its utility in various scenarios."
