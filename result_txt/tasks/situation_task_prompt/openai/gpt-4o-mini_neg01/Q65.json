    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Utilize mirrors and reflective materials strategically to amplify any available light sources. By placing mirrors opposite windows or light sources, you can bounce natural light into the room during twilight hours. Additionally, you could create a series of reflective panels that not only serve as decor but also maximize the effect of candlelight or other small light sources, creating a bright, spacious feel even in the absence of traditional lighting.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Pathways**: Design your room with glow-in-the-dark pathways or markers that guide you safely through the space. This could involve painting the edges of furniture, floor tiles, or even creating a glowing border along the walls. These pathways would charge during the day and provide just enough illumination at night to help you navigate without disturbing the overall ambiance of the room.",
    "**Candlelight Sculptures**: Craft artistic sculptures that double as candle holders. By designing intricate pieces that can hold multiple candles, you can create a centerpiece that not only provides light but also serves as a conversation starter. These sculptures could be made from various materials, such as metal, wood, or ceramic, and could be themed to match the room's decor, enhancing the atmosphere while providing soft, flickering light.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns**: Incorporate solar-powered lanterns that can be charged during the day and placed strategically around the room. These lanterns could be designed in various artistic styles, such as Moroccan, modern, or rustic, allowing you to express your aesthetic while providing illumination. You could hang them from the ceiling, place them on shelves, or use them as table centerpieces to create a warm, inviting glow.",
    "**Light-Emitting Textiles**: Innovate with textiles that emit light. Imagine curtains, bed linens, or wall hangings made from fabric embedded with fiber optics or LED threads that glow softly. These textiles could be programmed to change colors or intensities, allowing you to adjust the mood of the room. They would provide a unique, ambient light source while adding texture and warmth to the space."
