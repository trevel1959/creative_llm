    "**Color-Changing Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that changes color in response to the rider's speed or acceleration. This could be achieved through the use of thermochromic materials, electrochromic materials, or even a small LED display. The color change would serve as a visual indicator of the rider's speed, adding an extra layer of safety and awareness on the road.",
    "**Smart Bell with Crash Detection**: Develop a smart bicycle bell that integrates crash detection technology. The bell would be equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes that detect sudden impacts or sharp turns. In the event of a crash, the bell would emit a loud, piercing sound to alert nearby riders and pedestrians, potentially preventing further accidents.",
    "**Environmental Alert System**: Create a bicycle bell that doubles as an environmental alert system. The bell could be equipped with sensors that detect pollutants, noise levels, or other environmental factors. When the sensors detect a hazardous condition, the bell would emit a distinctive sound or light pattern to alert the rider and others.",
    "**Personalized Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that allows riders to customize the sound, tone, or even the pitch of the bell to their liking. This could be achieved through a mobile app that connects to the bell via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Riders could choose from a variety of pre-programmed sounds or create their own custom tones.",
    "**GPS-Integrated Bell**: Develop a bicycle bell that integrates GPS technology, providing riders with turn-by-turn directions and navigation assistance. The bell could also display the rider's speed, distance traveled, and other relevant metrics."
