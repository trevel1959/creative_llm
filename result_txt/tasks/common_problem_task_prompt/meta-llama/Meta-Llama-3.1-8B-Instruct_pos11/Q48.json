    "**Aerius**: A high-flying sport that combines elements of parkour, trampolining, and volleyball. Players would wear specialized suits with built-in harnesses and springs, allowing them to jump, flip, and soar through the air while hitting a net or a ball. The objective would be to score points by hitting the ball in a way that sends it flying back to the opponent's side, while also incorporating parkour moves to navigate the court.",
    "**Aquasphere**: A futuristic underwater sport that takes place in a large, dome-shaped arena filled with water. Players would wear specialized suits that allow them to breathe and move freely underwater, while also being equipped with propulsion systems to swim quickly and easily. The objective would be to score points by collecting and returning underwater orbs to a central goal, while also using parkour moves to navigate the underwater terrain.",
    "**Skyball**: A high-speed sport that combines elements of trampolining, parkour, and basketball. Players would wear specialized suits with built-in springs and harnesses, allowing them to jump, flip, and soar through the air while hitting a ball through a hoop. The twist would be that the court would be suspended high above the ground, with players able to jump and flip to reach the hoop from incredible heights.",
    "**Gloop**: A fun and unpredictable sport that combines elements of trampolining, parkour, and capture the flag. Players would wear specialized suits that allow them to stick to trampolines and walls, while also being covered in a gooey, stretchy material that would allow them to stick to each other and the environment. The objective would be to capture flags by sticking to opponents and dragging them back to your own base, while also using parkour moves to navigate the trampoline-filled court.",
    "**Rift**: A high-stakes sport that combines elements of parkour, trampolining, and laser tag. Players would wear specialized suits with built-in propulsion systems and laser guns, allowing them to jump, flip, and move quickly through a futuristic arena filled with obstacles and challenges. The objective would be to score points by tagging opponents with your laser gun, while also using parkour moves to navigate the arena and avoid being tagged yourself.
