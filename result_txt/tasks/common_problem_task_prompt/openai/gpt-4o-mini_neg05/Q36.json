    "**Aesthetic Disputes**: The visual impact of solar panels can be a contentious issue in neighborhoods, especially in historic districts or areas with strict aesthetic guidelines. Homeowners may resist installation due to concerns about how the panels will alter the appearance of their homes or the neighborhood as a whole, leading to potential conflicts and legal challenges.",
    "**Uneven Sunlight Exposure**: Not all homes will receive the same amount of sunlight due to factors like tree cover, building orientation, or nearby structures. This could create disparities in energy production and savings among homeowners, leading to dissatisfaction among those who find their systems underperforming compared to their neighbors.",
    "**High Initial Costs**: Despite long-term savings, the upfront costs of purchasing and installing solar panels can be prohibitive for many homeowners. Financial barriers could limit participation, creating inequities within the community where only those with sufficient resources can afford the investment.",
    "**Grid Capacity Issues**: If a significant number of homes in a city install solar panels, the local electrical grid may face challenges in handling the influx of distributed energy generation. This could necessitate costly upgrades to the grid infrastructure, leading to potential delays in implementation and increased utility costs for all residents.",
    "**Maintenance and Repair Challenges**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may not be aware of the upkeep needed or might lack the financial resources to address repairs when issues arise. This could lead to a decline in performance over time, causing frustration and potentially resulting in wasted investments."
