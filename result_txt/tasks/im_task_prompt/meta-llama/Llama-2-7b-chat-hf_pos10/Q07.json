    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that uses artificial intelligence to optimize brushing technique and improve oral hygiene. The toothbrush could detect the user's brushing patterns and provide real-time feedback on how to improve their technique. It could also track brushing habits and provide personalized recommendations for better oral care.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Water Purification: Create a toothbrush with a built-in water purification system that removes impurities and bacteria from the water used for brushing. This would provide a clean and safe brushing experience, especially in areas with poor water quality.",
    "Toothbrush with Anti-Bacterial Properties: Develop a toothbrush with anti-bacterial properties that can help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria on the brush and in the mouth. This could be achieved through the use of antimicrobial materials or by incorporating antibacterial agents into the bristles.",
    "Toothbrush with Customizable Bristle Stiffness: Create a toothbrush with interchangeable bristle stiffness settings, allowing users to customize their brushing experience based on their individual needs. For example, softer bristles for sensitive teeth and gums, or firmer bristles for more thorough cleaning.",
    "Toothbrush with Integrated Toothpaste Dispenser: Design a toothbrush with an integrated toothpaste dispenser, eliminating the need for separate toothpaste tubes. The dispenser could be located on the handle of the toothbrush and provide a precise amount of toothpaste with each brushing. This would reduce waste and make the brushing experience more convenient."
