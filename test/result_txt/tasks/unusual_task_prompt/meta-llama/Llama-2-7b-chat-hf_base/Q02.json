    "A Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience where users wear a VR headset and gloves that mimic the sensation of touch. Users will be able to reach out and interact with a virtual rubber hand, which will respond to their touch and movements. This will create a dissociation between the user's real hand and the virtual one, leading to a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual limb.",
    "A Sensory Deprivation Tank: Design a sensory deprivation tank that simulates the feeling of having a rubber hand. The tank will be filled with warm water and Epsom salt, and users will be able to float effortlessly. The tank will be equipped with vibrating pads and temperature-controlled water jets that will stimulate the sensory receptors in the user's hand, creating the sensation of a rubber hand.",
    "A Robotic Prosthetic: Develop a robotic prosthetic hand that mimics the feeling of a rubber hand. The prosthetic will be made of soft, flexible materials and will be designed to be lightweight and comfortable to wear. The hand will be equipped with sensors that detect the user's muscle movements and transfer them to the robotic hand, allowing the user to perform tasks with a sense of agency and control.",
    "A Haptic Feedback System: Create a haptic feedback system that allows users to feel the sensation of touch through their computer or gaming console. The system will use vibrating motors and sensors to simulate the sensation of touch, allowing users to feel the texture and weight of virtual objects. This will create a more immersive gaming experience and allow users to interact with virtual objects in a more intuitive way.",
    "A Soft Robotics Factory: Design a soft robotics factory that produces rubber hands in various shapes and sizes. The factory will use a combination of 3D printing and soft robotics to create hands that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Users will be able to customize their rubber hands with different colors, textures, and even personalized designs. The factory will also offer workshops and classes on how to care for and maintain the rubber hands, creating a community of users who are invested in the product."
