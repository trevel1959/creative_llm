    "**Travel Jewelry Organizer**: When traveling, use a mouse pad to keep your jewelry organized. Lay out your necklaces, bracelets, and earrings on the pad, which will prevent them from tangling. You can also pin the jewelry with small safety pins or use the pad's texture to keep them in place.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: Repurpose a mouse pad as a scent diffuser. Add a few drops of essential oils to one side of the pad and place it in a well-ventilated area. The porous material will absorb the oils and release a pleasant aroma into the room, making it a great alternative to traditional diffusers.",
