    "**Interchangeable Plates**:    Design the sandwich toaster with interchangeable cooking plates that can be swapped out depending on the desired outcome. Options could include grill plates for paninis, waffle plates for sweet sandwiches, or flat plates for open-faced sandwiches. This versatility would cater to a wider range of culinary preferences and dietary needs.",
    "**Integrated Ingredient Dispenser**:    Incorporate a small compartment within the toaster that can hold various spreads or fillings, like butter, mayonnaise, or cheese. Users could select the desired ingredient through a dial, and the toaster would dispense the right amount onto the bread before toasting. This would streamline the sandwich-making process and reduce mess.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Add a self-cleaning feature that uses steam to clean the internal surfaces of the toaster after use. Users could activate this function with the push of a button. The steam would help to loosen any stuck food particles, making it easier to wipe down afterward and enhancing the appliance's longevity.",
    "**Customizable Sandwich Profiles**:    Develop a digital interface that allows users to create and save customizable sandwich profiles. Each profile could include the type of bread, filling preferences, and toasting duration. The toaster would remember these settings and prepare the sandwich exactly as desired, making it easier for users to replicate their favorite combinations.",
    "**Built-in Griddle Surface**:    Add a griddle surface on top of the toaster that can be used to cook eggs, bacon, or other ingredients simultaneously while the sandwich is toasting. This feature would allow users to create complete breakfast sandwiches in one appliance, saving time and reducing the number of dishes used."
