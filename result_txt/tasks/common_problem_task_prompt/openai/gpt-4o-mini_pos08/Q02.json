    "**Kitchen Space Crunch**: Cooking for a large group often means juggling multiple dishes simultaneously, which can lead to a cramped kitchen. This can create a chaotic environment where it’s difficult to find tools and ingredients. To mitigate this, designate specific zones in the kitchen for different tasks (prep, cooking, plating) and involve family members in the cooking process. Assign roles to each person to ensure the kitchen runs smoothly and efficiently.",
    "**Timing Troubles**: Coordinating the cooking times of various dishes can be a logistical nightmare. Some dishes may take longer to prepare than others, and timing everything to be ready at once can be challenging. To solve this, create a cooking timeline that outlines when each dish should be started, factoring in cooking and resting times. Consider using a whiteboard or digital planner to keep track of each dish’s progress.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions**: With a large family, it’s likely that there will be a variety of dietary preferences and restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free, nut allergies, etc.). Failing to accommodate these can lead to awkward situations at the dinner table. To address this, send out a quick survey before the holiday to gather information about everyone’s dietary needs. Then, plan a diverse menu that includes options for all guests, ensuring that no one feels left out.",
    "**Serving Logistics**: Serving a large meal can be tricky, especially if you have limited dining space or seating arrangements. This can lead to delays and confusion during the meal. To streamline the serving process, consider buffet-style dining where guests can serve themselves, or prepare a family-style meal where dishes are passed around the table. This encourages interaction and can help reduce the stress of serving individual plates.",
    "**Cleanup Chaos**: After a large holiday dinner, the cleanup can be daunting, especially if you’ve cooked multiple courses and used a variety of dishes. This can lead to feelings of overwhelm and frustration. To make cleanup easier, enlist the help of family members before the meal begins, assigning specific cleanup tasks. Additionally, consider using disposable or compostable dinnerware for easy post-meal cleanup, or set up a “clean-as-you-go” system where everyone helps with dishes and tidying up during the meal."
