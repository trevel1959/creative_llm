    "**Smart Mug**: Design a coffee mug with a built-in, rechargeable battery and a temperature control system. The mug would have a small screen that displays the optimal temperature for the drink, and it would automatically adjust the temperature to the desired level. This would ensure that the coffee is always at the perfect temperature, and the user could even set a timer to have the mug heat up or cool down at a specific time.",
    "**Mood Mug**: Create a coffee mug that changes color and pattern in response to the user's emotions. Using advanced sensors and AI technology, the mug would detect the user's emotions and adjust its appearance accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the mug could turn a calming blue color, while a happy user could see a bright and cheerful pattern.",
    "**Memory Mug**: Design a coffee mug that can store and display memories. The mug would have a built-in camera and AI-powered software that can recognize and tag people, places, and objects in the photos taken with the mug. Users could then view their memories by looking at the mug, which would display a slideshow of their favorite moments.",
    "**Wellness Mug**: Develop a coffee mug that tracks the user's hydration levels and provides personalized recommendations for improvement. The mug would have a built-in water sensor and a companion app that would monitor the user's water intake and offer suggestions for increasing their hydration levels. The mug could also have a built-in UV light that would help to sanitize the user's water bottle or cup.",
    "**Augmented Reality Mug**: Create a coffee mug that brings the user's favorite stories and characters to life. Using augmented reality (AR) technology, the mug would display interactive and immersive experiences that complement the user's favorite books, movies, or TV shows. For example, the mug could display a 3D model of a character from a favorite book, or bring a favorite movie to life with interactive animations and special effects.
