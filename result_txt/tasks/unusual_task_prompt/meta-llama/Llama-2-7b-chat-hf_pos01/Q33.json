    "Sponge-inspired Water Purification System: Create a water filtration system that mimics the way sponges absorb and filter water. The system would consist of a sponge-like membrane that traps impurities and pollutants, allowing clean water to pass through. This innovative technology could provide clean drinking water to communities in developing countries or areas affected by natural disasters. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Sponge-based Artificial Muscle: Develop a new type of artificial muscle that utilizes the unique properties of sponges to generate movement. The sponge-based muscle would be lightweight, flexible, and energy-efficient, making it ideal for use in robotics, prosthetics, and other applications. This technology could revolutionize the field of prosthetics and enable people with mobility impairments to perform tasks that were previously impossible. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Sponge-inspired Skin Substitute: Create a synthetic skin substitute that mimics the properties of a sponge. This innovative material could be used to treat burn victims, provide wound coverage, and promote skin regeneration. The sponge-like skin substitute would be breathable, flexible, and able to adapt to the body's natural movements, providing a more realistic and effective alternative to traditional skin grafts. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Sponge-based Energy Storage System: Develop an energy storage system that utilizes the porous structure of sponges to store electrical energy. The sponge-based system would be lightweight, compact, and highly efficient, making it ideal for use in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. This innovative technology could revolutionize the way we store energy and provide a more sustainable alternative to traditional batteries. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Sponge-inspired Waterproof Coating: Create a waterproof coating that mimics the properties of a sponge. This innovative coating would be breathable, flexible, and able to adapt to different surfaces, providing a more effective and efficient way to protect surfaces from water damage. The sponge-like coating could be used to protect buildings, bridges, and other structures from water"
