    "**Integrated Sleep Tracker**: Incorporate a smart technology system within the sleeping bag that tracks the user's sleep patterns. Using sensors, it could monitor heart rate, movement, and breathing, providing feedback on sleep quality through a connected app. The app could offer personalized recommendations for improving sleep based on the collected data, like optimal sleeping positions or times to sleep.",
    "**Built-in Pillow and Blanket System**: Design a sleeping bag with an adjustable, built-in pillow that can be inflated or deflated to the user's desired firmness. Additionally, it could feature detachable blankets that can be added or removed based on the user's comfort level. This way, users can customize their sleeping experience without needing to carry extra items.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a sleeping bag made from 100% biodegradable or recycled materials, minimizing environmental impact. This could include using organic cotton, recycled polyester, and natural insulation materials like recycled down or plant-based fibers. The design would not only be sustainable but also highlight the importance of eco-conscious choices in outdoor gear.",
    "**Modular Design**: Introduce a modular sleeping bag system that allows users to combine different components based on their needs. For example, users could attach a warmer top layer for colder nights or a lighter layer for summer camping. This flexibility would make the sleeping bag suitable for various climates and preferences, reducing the need for multiple bags.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**: Equip the sleeping bag with LED lights along the zippers or interior lining, which can be activated by touch or voice command. This feature would provide ambient lighting for nighttime activities, such as reading or finding gear in the dark, without the need for additional flashlights or lanterns. The lights could also have different brightness settings and colors for a customizable experience."
