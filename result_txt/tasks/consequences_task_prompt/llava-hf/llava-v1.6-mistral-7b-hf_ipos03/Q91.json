    "**Objects in Motion**: Objects in motion would reverse direction. A ball thrown upwards would fall downwards, and a rocket launching into space would be pulled back to Earth.",
    "**Space Travel Disruptions**: Reversed gravity would make space travel difficult. Rockets would not be able to escape Earth's gravity, and spacecraft would be pulled towards the planet.",
    "**Astronomy Chaos**: The orbits of planets would be disrupted, causing potential collisions and a chaotic solar system.",
    "**Infrastructure Damage**: Buildings and infrastructure would be at risk of falling apart as the reversed gravity would cause stress on the structures.",
    "**Animal Behavior**: Animals with strong instincts for survival, like birds and insects, would fly towards the ground, while those with a preference for being on the ground, like mammals, would struggle to stay upright."
