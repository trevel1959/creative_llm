    "**The Great Brain Drain**: Overnight, the entire global population gains a level of intelligence rivaling the greatest minds in history. The world is flooded with brilliant ideas, and innovation accelerates at an unprecedented rate. However, this also leads to an overabundance of information, making it difficult for individuals to focus and prioritize their thoughts. As a result, mental health issues related to information overload become a pressing concern. People struggle to filter out irrelevant information, leading to anxiety, depression, and a sense of overwhelm. The world becomes a chaotic, yet fascinating, place where genius is the norm, but mental clarity is a rare commodity.",
    "**The Genius Gap**: In a world where everyone is a genius, the concept of \"intelligence\" becomes redefined. The gap between the intellectually gifted and the average person disappears, but a new divide emerges. Those who were previously considered geniuses now find themselves struggling to keep up with the new norm. They feel like they've lost their edge, and their sense of identity is threatened. This phenomenon leads to a reevaluation of what it means to be intelligent and a shift in how society values and rewards cognitive abilities.",
    "**The Lost Art of Simplicity**: With the sudden influx of genius-level intellect, people begin to focus on solving complex problems and creating intricate solutions. In the process, they overlook the value of simplicity and elegance in design. The world becomes cluttered with overly complicated systems, and people forget the beauty of simplicity. As a result, innovation slows down, and the focus shifts from creating innovative solutions to merely solving problems with brute force. The world loses its sense of wonder and awe as people become too focused on the complexity of their creations.",
    "**The Rise of the Intellectual Elite**: In a world where everyone is a genius, a new social hierarchy emerges. The most intelligent individuals rise to the top, forming a new elite class. They use their intellect to manipulate and control others, exploiting their cognitive advantages to gain power and influence. This leads to a resurgence of authoritarianism, as the intellectually gifted seek to impose their will on the rest of society. The world becomes a battleground for intellectual supremacy, and the concept of equality is reevaluated.",
    "**The Great Convergence**: With everyone possessing genius-level intellect, the boundaries between disciplines and fields of study begin to blur. Scientists, artists, and philosophers converge, and their unique perspectives blend together. This leads to a new era of interdisciplinary collaboration, where solutions to complex problems are found"
