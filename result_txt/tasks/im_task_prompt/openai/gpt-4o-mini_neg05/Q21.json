    "**Soundproofing Technology**: Enhance doors with advanced soundproofing materials that reduce noise pollution from outside. This could include layers of acoustic panels or specialized sound-dampening materials that not only improve privacy but also create a more peaceful indoor environment. Ideal for homes in busy urban areas or for home offices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop doors made from sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood or recycled metal. Incorporating energy-efficient designs, like insulated cores or solar panels, can help maintain indoor temperatures and reduce energy consumption. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers looking to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Mood Lighting Features**: Integrate LED mood lighting around the edges of the doorframe that can change colors based on the time of day or the homeowner's preference. This could serve as a night light, enhance the aesthetic appeal of the entrance, or even provide alerts (e.g., flashing red for security alerts).",
    "**Built-in Pet Door**: Design a door with a discreet, built-in pet door that can be locked or unlocked depending on the owner's needs. This would allow pets to come and go freely while maintaining security for the rest of the home. The pet door could also feature a sensor that detects when the pet is nearby, automatically unlocking when they approach.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Create a door that features an embedded AR screen that can display messages, alerts, or even virtual door knockers. When someone approaches, the door could show a welcome message or a security alert. This interactive feature could also provide information like weather updates or notifications from smart home devices."
