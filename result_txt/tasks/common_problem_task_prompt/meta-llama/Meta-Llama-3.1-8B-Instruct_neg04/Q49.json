    "**Smart Contact Lenses for Food Allergy Detection**: These contact lenses would have a built-in microchip and a tiny sensor that detects the presence of allergens in the wearer's food. When an allergen is detected, the lens would release a subtle vibration or a color change to alert the wearer. The sensor would be connected to a smartphone app that provides information on the allergen, its severity, and recommended treatment. This technology would revolutionize the way people with food allergies manage their condition, reducing the risk of anaphylaxis and improving their quality of life.",
    "**Personalized Air Quality Monitoring Wearables**: These wearables would be designed to monitor the wearer's exposure to air pollutants, allergens, and other environmental hazards. The device would use advanced sensors to detect pollutants and provide real-time feedback on the wearer's air quality. The data would be synced to a smartphone app, allowing the wearer to track their exposure and make informed decisions about their environment. This technology would be especially beneficial for people with respiratory issues, such as asthma, and those living in polluted urban areas.",
    "**Augmented Reality Contact Lenses for Language Learning**: These contact lenses would have a built-in AR display that provides real-time translations and language lessons. The wearer would be able to point their lens at a sign or a speaker, and the lens would display the translation in their native language. The AR display would also offer interactive language lessons, allowing the wearer to practice their language skills in a more immersive and engaging way. This technology would revolutionize language learning, making it more accessible and effective for people around the world.",
    "**Smart Home Automation for Seniors**: This technology would be designed to create a safe and accessible living environment for seniors. The system would use AI-powered sensors to detect changes in the senior's behavior, health, and mobility. The system would then adjust the home's lighting, temperature, and entertainment systems to create a comfortable and engaging environment. The system would also provide emergency alerts and remote monitoring, allowing family members and caregivers to stay informed and connected. This technology would improve the quality of life for seniors, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation.",
    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for PTSD and Anxiety**: This technology would use VR to create immersive and controlled environments for therapy. The system would be designed to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing patients to confront and overcome their fears in a safe and controlled manner. The VR experience would be tailored to the individual's specific needs and triggers,"
