    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Create a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which could then be stored and used to power devices.",
    "Bio-Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that uses microorganisms like bacteria or yeast to generate electricity. These microorganisms could be genetically engineered to produce electricity as a byproduct of their normal metabolic processes, providing a sustainable and renewable source of power.",
    "Air-Powered Batteries: Create a battery that harnesses the energy from the air to generate electricity. This could be achieved through a process called piezoelectricity, where a material is able to generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress, such as from the movement of air molecules.",
    "Thermal Energy Batteries: Develop a battery that harnesses the heat from the environment to generate electricity. This could involve using thermoelectric materials that can convert heat into electrical energy, or using phase-change materials that can store thermal energy and release it as electricity when needed.",
    "Waste-to-Energy Batteries: Create a battery that uses waste materials as a source of energy. For example, a battery could be designed to convert organic waste materials like food scraps or plant matter into electrical energy through a process called anaerobic digestion. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of power for devices, while also reducing waste and promoting sustainability."
