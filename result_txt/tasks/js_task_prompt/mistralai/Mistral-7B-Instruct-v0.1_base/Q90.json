    "Improved Cardiovascular System: One of the most significant changes I would make is to the cardiovascular system. The human heart is a marvel of engineering, but it could be made more efficient. I would design a new heart with four chambers instead of two, allowing for better circulation and oxygenation of the blood. Additionally, I would add an extra layer of tissue around the heart to protect it from damage.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Abilities: Another change I would make is to enhance our sensory abilities. I would add more sensors to the skin, allowing us to feel even the slightest touch or temperature changes. I would also add more receptors to the eyes, allowing us to see in infrared and ultraviolet light.",
    "Super Strength: I would also add super strength to the human body. This could be achieved by adding extra muscle mass or by creating stronger bones. With super strength, we could lift heavy objects with ease and perform feats of strength that would be impossible for a normal human.",
    "Improved Digestive System: The human digestive system is also in need of improvement. I would add an extra layer of tissue to the stomach, allowing for better digestion of tougher foods. Additionally, I would add an extra set of teeth to the mouth, allowing for a wider variety of foods to be eaten.",
    "Increased Longevity: Finally, I would design the human body to live longer. I would add extra layers of tissue to the body, allowing for better protection against disease and injury. Additionally, I would add extra organs to the body, such as extra kidneys and livers, to help the body function more efficiently."
