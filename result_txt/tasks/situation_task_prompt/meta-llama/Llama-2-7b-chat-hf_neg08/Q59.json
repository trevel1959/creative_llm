    "Create a Cloud-Catching Device: Develop a specialized device that can capture and store cloud particles, allowing you to harness their light and energy. This device could be powered by a small solar panel or a kinetic energy harvester, ensuring a sustainable and efficient source of light.",
    "Mirrored Dome City: Build a massive, transparent dome over the city, covered in highly reflective mirrors. This would deflect and concentrate sunlight, providing ample illumination even on cloudy days. The dome could also be designed with thermal insulation to regulate temperature and maintain a comfortable environment.",
    "Artificial Sunlight Generators: Develop compact, portable devices that can produce artificial sunlight using advanced LED technology. These generators could be powered by a small fuel cell or battery, making them ideal for use in remote areas or during emergencies.",
    "Cloud-Based Solar Panel Arrays: Design and install solar panel arrays on large, specially-designed clouds that can float in the sky. These clouds could be equipped with a specialized mesh or grid that captures and harnesses sunlight, even on cloudy days. This innovative solution would provide a steady, renewable source of energy.",
    "Bioluminescent Urban Landscapes: Incorporate bioluminescent plants and microorganisms into urban landscaping, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that produces light. This could involve using specialized soil or substrates that support the growth of bioluminescent mosses, lichens, or bacteria. As these organisms absorb sunlight during the day, they would emit light at night, providing a natural and sustainable source of illumination."
