    "Once in a quaint village, there lived a boy named Oliver who possessed a peculiar gift: he could taste words. Each time someone spoke, the flavors danced on his tongueâ€”sweet like honey when kindness was spoken, bitter like dark chocolate with anger, and sour like lemons with insults. ",
    "His gift brought joy to the village, as he shared the flavors of their conversations, teaching them the power of their words. One day, a stranger arrived, speaking only harsh words. Oliver tasted the bitterness and, with courage, spoke back with sweetness. To his surprise, the stranger softened, revealing a heart yearning for kindness. From that day, the village learned to choose their words wisely, for they were more than just sounds; they were flavors that could change hearts.",
