This would include smart buildings that adjust their temperature, lighting, and energy use based on occupancy and weather conditions, as well as smart roads that adjust traffic flow and traffic lights based on traffic conditions.",
    "Community-Focused Design: The city would be designed with a strong focus on community and social connections. This could include public spaces that encourage social interaction, community gardens, and programs that promote community engagement and volunteerism."
