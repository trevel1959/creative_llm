    "Virtual Reality Zoo Experience: Create a virtual reality experience for visitors to explore the zoo from the comfort of their own homes. Using VR technology, visitors could take a virtual tour of the zoo, interact with animals, and learn about their habitats and behaviors. This would be especially beneficial for people who live far away from the zoo or have mobility issues.",
    "Sensory Immersion Exhibits: Create immersive exhibits that stimulate the senses, such as a rainforest exhibit with mist, water, and tropical plants, or a desert exhibit with sand, cacti, and a simulated sunset. These exhibits would allow visitors to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of different ecosystems without leaving the zoo.",
    "Night Zoo Adventures: Host nighttime events at the zoo, complete with glow-in-the-dark pathways, special lighting effects, and nocturnal animals that are active at night. Visitors could explore the zoo under the stars, enjoying the unique experience of seeing animals in their natural nighttime behavior.",
    "Interactive Animal Encounters: Create interactive experiences where visitors can get up close and personal with animals, such as feeding a giraffe or petting a penguin. These encounters could be led by trained zoo staff and would provide a unique and memorable experience for visitors.",
    "Zoo-to-Go: Create a mobile zoo experience where animals are taken on the road to visit schools, nursing homes, and other community organizations. This would provide an opportunity for people who may not be able to visit the zoo in person to still experience and learn about animals in a fun and interactive way."
