    "**Biological Timekeeping**: I would tune into my body's natural rhythms and cues. I would use the need for food, drink, and rest as times of day. For instance, I might eat when I feel hungry and rest when I feel tired.",
    "**Social Timekeeping**: I would rely on social cues and events in my community. For example, if there's a regular meeting at a certain time, I would use that as a reference point to schedule my day. I would also stay in sync with the community's schedule by keeping an eye on their activities.",
    "**App-Based Timekeeping**: I would use a smartphone app designed to work without an internet connection. The app would use GPS to track my location and movement, and I would use these data to estimate the time of day.",
    "**Sound-Based Timekeeping**: I would listen to the sounds around me to estimate the time of day. For example, the number of bird chirps or the sound of a nearby stream could be used as a clock.",
    "**Chemical Timekeeping**: I would use a personal device that reacts to changes in temperature or humidity to estimate time. This device could be carried in my pocket and would gradually change color or shape in response to environmental conditions, providing an estimate of the time of day."
