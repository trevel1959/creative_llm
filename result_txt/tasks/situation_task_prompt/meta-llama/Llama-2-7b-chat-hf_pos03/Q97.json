    "Bioluminescent Jewelry: In a world without jewels or precious metals, you could create ornaments that produce their own light through bioluminescence. This could be achieved through the use of genetically engineered microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that produce light when exposed to oxygen. By embedding these microorganisms in a substrate, such as a polymer or a plant-based material, you could create jewelry that glows in the dark.",
    "Crystal Glass Jewelry: In a world without precious metals, you could create ornaments that mimic the sparkle and shine of diamonds or other precious stones using crystal glass.
