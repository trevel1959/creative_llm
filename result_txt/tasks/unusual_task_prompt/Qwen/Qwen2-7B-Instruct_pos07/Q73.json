    "**Innovative Solar-Powered Light Bulbs**: Create a line of light bulbs that harness solar energy during the day to store electricity. At night, these bulbs can illuminate homes and streets, reducing reliance on traditional power sources. The bulbs would have adjustable brightness levels and could be installed in public spaces like parks or sidewalks, providing eco-friendly lighting.",
    "**Interactive Smart Bulbs**: Develop smart bulbs that incorporate voice recognition technology and can be controlled through an app on smartphones. Users can change the color, brightness, and even set timers for the lights, creating a more personalized and efficient lighting experience. This idea could also integrate with other smart home devices, enhancing overall home automation.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant-Light Bulbs**: Design bulbs that mimic the bioluminescence of certain marine creatures. These bulbs would use bioluminescent bacteria to emit light, offering a unique aesthetic appeal while being energy-efficient. They could be used in art installations, aquariums, or as a decorative element in modern interiors.",
    "**Emergency Power Bulbs**: Create a series of rechargeable LED bulbs designed for emergency situations. These bulbs would come with a built-in USB port to charge electronic devices, making them invaluable in power outages or disaster scenarios. They would also feature a bright flashlight mode for navigating in darkness.",
    "**Color-Therapy Light Bulbs**: Develop bulbs that emit specific wavelengths of light known to influence mood and sleep patterns. For example, cool white light could boost alertness during the day, while warmer hues could aid relaxation at night. These bulbs could be customized to users' schedules and preferences, promoting better mental health and productivity."
