    "**Fortified Grains and Legumes**: We could develop a range of fortified grains and legumes that are enriched with essential vitamins and minerals typically found in fruits and vegetables. For instance, rice, quinoa, and lentils could be enhanced with nutrients like vitamin C, potassium, and magnesium through innovative processing techniques, ensuring that staple foods can meet daily nutritional requirements.",
    "**Mushroom Cultivation**: Mushrooms are not only a versatile food source but also packed with nutrients. By focusing on the cultivation of various mushroom species, we could create a new food industry centered around their health benefits. Certain mushrooms are known to provide B vitamins, selenium, and other minerals. Additionally, bioengineering could enhance their nutritional profiles further.",
    "**Insect Protein**: Insects are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Cultivating insects for human consumption could fill the nutritional gap left by the absence of fruits and vegetables. Crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers can be processed into flour, snacks, or protein bars, offering a sustainable and nutrient-dense alternative.",
    "**Synthetic Nutrient Blends**: The food industry could pivot to create synthetic nutrient blends that mimic the vitamin and mineral profiles of fruits and vegetables. These blends could be designed to be added to various food products, ensuring that consumers receive the necessary nutrients. For example, a powdered blend could be mixed into sauces, soups, or baked goods, making it easy to incorporate into daily meals.",
    "**Nutrient-Infused Water**: Developing nutrient-infused water that contains essential vitamins and minerals could serve as a refreshing alternative to traditional beverages. This water could be fortified with electrolytes, vitamins A, C, and D, and minerals like calcium and iron, providing hydration along with nutritional benefits. It could be marketed as a convenient way to stay healthy without relying on fruits and vegetables."
