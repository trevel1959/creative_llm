    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Collection and Filtration System: Create a system that harnesses the sun's energy to collect and purify water from the island's rainfall or water sources. This could involve using solar-powered pumps to collect and transport water, and then using a series of filters to remove impurities and bacteria. The filtered water could then be stored in a large, underground tank for later use.",
    "Create a Vertical Garden for Food Production: Develop a vertical garden using a combination of hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This would allow for efficient use of space on the island, while also providing a reliable source of fresh produce. The garden could be powered by a small, solar-powered pump to irrigate the plants.",
    "Build a Wind Turbine for Electricity Generation: Utilize the island's wind resources to generate electricity using a small, portable wind turbine. This could provide a reliable source of power for charging electronic devices, running a water filtration system, or powering a small radio for communication.",
    "Develop a Rainwater Harvesting System: Design a system that collects and stores rainwater from the island's rainfall, which could be used for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene. This could involve building a series of small, interconnected tanks to store the collected water, and using a small, solar-powered pump to transfer the water to the tanks.",
    "Create a Natural Shelter Using Local Materials: Using materials found on the island, construct a natural shelter that provides protection from the elements. This could involve using palm fronds, vines, and other local vegetation to create a sturdy roof and walls, while also incorporating natural ventilation and insulation to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the shelter."
