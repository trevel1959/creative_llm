    "초기 장비 비용: The initial costs for the equipment, including the solar panels and other necessary components, can be high.",
    "Energy infrastructure costs: The installation of solar panels will require maintenance and repair costs to be borne by a central energy system, which might be a concern.",
    "Negative environmental impact: The installation of solar panels generates waste during the production and disposal process. This waste could be a source of environmental pollution.",
    "Energy storage and backup system: While solar panels can generate electricity, they are not a constant supply of energy. If there is a power outage or the solar panels are not working, another energy source is needed. This requires additional infrastructure such as batteries.",
    "Maintenance and repair costs: Solar panels need to be cleaned and maintained regularly to function efficiently. This includes costs for replacement of panels or inverter if damaged or malfunctioning."
