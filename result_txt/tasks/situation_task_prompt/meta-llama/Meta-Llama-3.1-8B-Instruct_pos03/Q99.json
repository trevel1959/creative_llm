    "**Shape-based Identification**: In a world without colors, objects could be identified based on their unique shapes. For instance, a sphere (like a basketball) could be distinguished from a cylinder (like a can) by its curved and smooth surface. A cube (like a Rubik's Cube) could be identified by its sharp corners and flat surfaces. This system would rely on the distinct geometric features of each object, allowing people to differentiate between them based on their shapes.",
    "**Texture-based Categorization**: Another approach would be to focus on the textures of objects. A smooth, glossy surface (like a mirror) could be distinguished from a rough, bumpy surface (like a tree bark). A soft, fluffy texture (like a feather) could be differentiated from a hard, rigid texture (like a rock). This system would rely on the tactile properties of each object, allowing people to identify them through touch.",
    "**Sound-based Differentiation**: In a world without colors, objects could be identified by the sounds they produce when interacted with. For instance, a glass object (like a glass vase) could be distinguished from a metal object (like a metal can) by the sound it makes when struck. A wooden object (like a wooden chair) could be identified by the sound it produces when tapped. This system would rely on the unique acoustic properties of each object, allowing people to identify them through sound.",
    "**Smell-based Classification**: Another approach would be to focus on the scents of objects. A fragrant object (like a flower) could be distinguished from a pungent object (like a rotten fish). A sweet object (like a piece of candy) could be differentiated from a sour object (like a lemon). This system would rely on the olfactory properties of each object, allowing people to identify them through smell.",
    "**Size-based Distinction**: Finally, objects could be identified based on their sizes. A large object (like a building) could be distinguished from a small object (like a coin). A tall object (like a tree) could be identified from a short object (like a book). This system would rely on the spatial properties of each object, allowing people to identify them based on their dimensions."
