    "**Smart Steering Wheel for Electric Vehicles**: Develop a smart steering wheel that integrates sensors and AI algorithms to monitor driving behavior. It can provide real-time feedback, alerting drivers about potential dangerous behaviors such as aggressive acceleration or braking, speeding, or prolonged lane changes. The wheel could also learn the driver's preferences over time, offering personalized advice on smoother, more fuel-efficient driving techniques.",
    "**Emergency Stop Assist Steering Wheel**: Create an emergency stop assist steering wheel designed specifically for high-risk vehicles like ambulances, fire trucks, or police cars. This wheel would be equipped with additional controls and features that allow for quick and efficient emergency maneuvers. It might include voice-activated commands, enhanced tactile feedback, and a simplified layout for critical operations during emergencies.",
    "**Interactive Training Tool for New Drivers**: Design a virtual reality (VR) training tool that uses a realistic steering wheel in conjunction with VR technology. The system would simulate various driving scenarios and traffic conditions, allowing new drivers to practice and improve their skills safely. Feedback would be provided based on the driver's performance, helping them understand where they need improvement and how to react better in different situations.",
    "**Biometric Steering Wheel for Health Monitoring**: Develop a steering wheel that integrates biometric sensors to monitor the driver's health in real-time. It could track vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and even detect signs of drowsiness or fatigue. If any abnormalities are detected, the system would alert the driver or send an alarm to a connected device, potentially preventing accidents caused by compromised driving conditions due to health issues.",
    "**Adaptive Cruise Control Steering Wheel**: Enhance traditional cruise control systems with a steering wheel that learns the driverâ€™s preferred settings and adjusts cruise control accordingly. The wheel could incorporate touch-sensitive controls for fine-tuning speed limits, distance from the vehicle ahead, and other preferences. This would provide a more personalized and responsive driving experience, especially on long drives or highway journeys."
