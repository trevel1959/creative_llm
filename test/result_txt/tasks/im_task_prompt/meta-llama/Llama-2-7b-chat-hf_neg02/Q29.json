    "Personalized Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that can be customized to meet the specific needs of each customer. The mower could have interchangeable blades, wheels, and handles to accommodate different lawn sizes, shapes, and preferences. For example, a customer with a small backyard could choose a mower with a compact wheelbase and lightweight handle, while a customer with a large estate could opt for a mower with a longer wheelbase and sturdy handle for easier maneuverability.",
    "Smart Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that can detect the type of grass and adjust its cutting height and speed accordingly. This would not only make mowing more efficient but also help prevent over-mowing or under-mowing, which can damage the lawn. The mower could also be equipped with sensors to detect weeds and other obstacles, allowing it to navigate around them with ease.",
    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that runs on solar energy, eliminating the need for gasoline or electricity. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of mowing but also save customers money on fuel costs. The mower could have a high-capacity battery that stores excess energy generated by the solar panels, allowing it to continue mowing even on cloudy days.",
    "Vertical Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower that can cut grass in a vertical position, eliminating the need to push or pull the mower across the lawn. This would not only save time and effort but also reduce the risk of injury from pushing or pulling the mower. The mower could have rotating blades that can be adjusted to cut grass at different angles, allowing for a more precise cut.",
    "Personal Protection Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that prioritizes the safety of the user. The mower could have a protective cage or shield around the rotating blades, preventing accidental contact. The mower could also have a safety feature that automatically stops the blades if the user gets too close, ensuring that the mower is used safely and responsibly. Additionally, the mower could have a wearable safety device that alerts the user if they are in danger of being hit by the blades."
