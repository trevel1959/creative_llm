    "**Spice Grinder**: Adapt your coffee grinder for spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or black pepper. Coffee grinders are great for spices because they have blades that work well for small particles. By doing this, you can save money on buying pre-ground spices and ensure that you're using fresh spices in your cooking. Simply clean the grinder thoroughly before switching from coffee to spices.",
    "**Baking Tool**: Use your coffee grinder to finely grind nuts, chocolate, or other ingredients for baking. For example, finely ground almonds can be used in cakes or cookies for an added crunch. Chocolate can also be finely chopped using the grinder, creating a homemade, personalized chocolate experience. This is especially useful if you want to make small batches of specialty baked goods.",
    "**Garden Mulch Maker**: Transform your coffee grinder into a mini mulch maker by grinding up coffee grounds, which are rich in nitrogen, a key nutrient for plants.

This eco-friendly use of coffee grounds benefits both the environment and your plants.",
    "**Herbal Infuser**: Use your coffee grinder to grind various herbs and spices for making teas or herbal remedies. For instance, grinding dried mint leaves, chamomile flowers, or ginger root can create custom blends for tea-making.

This can be a relaxing activity that promotes healthy living."
