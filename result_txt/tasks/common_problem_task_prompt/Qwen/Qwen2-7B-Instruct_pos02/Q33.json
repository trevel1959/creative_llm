    "**Building a \"Tree House\"**: You could construct a sturdy structure using branches and vines from the surrounding trees. This would provide shelter from the elements and potentially protect you from wild animals. It can also be elevated to avoid any potential water issues from rain or rising tides. You might use leaves for insulation and fruits for food.",
    "**Creating a Water Collection System**: To ensure a steady supply of fresh water, you could build a system that collects rainwater or condensation. For example, you could make a large canopy out of leaves or fabric to collect rainwater in barrels. Additionally, you could set up a solar still to distill seawater into drinkable water.",
    "**Growing Your Own Food**: Utilize the island's natural resources to start a small garden. Depending on the climate, you could cultivate fruits like coconuts, bananas, or citrus fruits. If there's a suitable environment, you might also grow leafy greens or vegetables like tomatoes or peppers. Insects can serve as a protein source if you learn how to catch and prepare them safely.",
    "**Crafting Tools and Equipment**: Use available materials like bamboo, wood, and shells to create tools such as spears, fishhooks, and fishing nets. Tools are crucial for survival, especially for hunting, gathering, and constructing shelters. Additionally, learning to make fire by striking two stones together or finding natural sources of heat (like hot springs) will be essential for warmth, cooking, and safety.",
    "**Signal Creation and Usage**: While waiting for rescue, itâ€™s crucial to signal other humans. You could create a large, visible signal using natural resources such as driftwood, rocks, or even a signal fire. Alternatively, you could create a series of distress signals using mirrors or reflective objects to reflect sunlight and catch the attention of passing aircraft or ships. Always remember to stay calm and conserve energy until help arrives."
