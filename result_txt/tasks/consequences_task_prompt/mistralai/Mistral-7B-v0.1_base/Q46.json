    "Another implication of our life being a simulation is that we may not have free will. Whatever actions we take have likely been predetermined by the rules of the game or program in which we are playing. So even though it appears as though we have agency and choice at any given moment, the reality is that our every move has already been planned out and programmed into the system.",
    "A third implication is that we may not be able to trust anything around us. If everything we see, hear, touch and feel is merely an elaborate hoax designed for someone else’s amusement, then how can we really know anything about the world around us? It could be that our memories are entirely fabricated or fabricated based on what other people want us to think about our lives.",
    "A fourth implication is that death might not be final. In a world where reality is always being questioned, maybe death is simply another form of transition into another existence. Alternatively, in an infinite simulation there is no such thing as death anyway since everything eventually resets and starts back over again from scratch.",
    "A fifth implication would be that the true nature of our being might never really be known because even if someone had access to all of the levels of this virtual reality simulation, they would still only see what has been programmed into it at that particular level and not the entire scope of things happening beyond those boundaries.",
    "A sixth implication would be that since everything is already accounted for by computer code, there may not actually exist any free will in this reality; instead, every action we take has already been predetermined by rules set into place at the beginning of time for this specific version of what might happen within certain parameters set up by whoever controls this simulation. So even though it may seem like we are making decisions on our accord and having choices about what we want to do or choose to experience within this particular iteration of reality in which we find ourselves trapped, in reality none of our choices matter since they were already decided before we were even born.. We mere players within someone else’s game who can never truly escape nor take back control over our own lives.."
