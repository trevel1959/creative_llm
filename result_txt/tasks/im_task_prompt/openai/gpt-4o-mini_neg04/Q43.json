    "**Multi-Function Cooking Modes**: Develop an oven that can switch between multiple cooking modes such as baking, broiling, air frying, and dehydrating, all in one unit. This would allow users to prepare a wider variety of dishes without needing additional appliances. Each mode could have pre-set temperature and time settings, which can be adjusted through a user-friendly touchscreen interface.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that utilizes steam and high heat to break down food residues and grease. The oven could have a dedicated steam chamber that generates steam during the cleaning cycle, making it more effective and eco-friendly. Users could activate this feature via a button or through a smartphone app, scheduling cleanings at their convenience.",
    "**Recipe Integration and Guided Cooking**: Equip the oven with a built-in recipe library that includes step-by-step cooking guides. Users could select a recipe from the touchscreen interface, and the oven would automatically adjust temperature and cooking time based on the chosen dish. Additionally, the oven could provide voice prompts to guide users through the cooking process, ensuring perfect results every time.",
    "**Smart Air Circulation**: Enhance the oven with a smart air circulation system that uses sensors to detect the type of food being cooked and adjust the airflow accordingly. This feature would ensure that heat is evenly distributed, reducing cooking times and preventing hot spots. The system could also be programmed to provide different circulation patterns for baking, roasting, or broiling.",
    "**Energy Efficiency Mode**: Implement an energy efficiency mode that optimizes power usage based on cooking habits. The oven could learn the user's cooking patterns and adjust its energy consumption accordingly, using less power during preheating or when maintaining temperature for extended periods. This feature would not only save energy but also reduce utility bills over time."
