    "**Jealousy Jar**: Create a physical jar where individuals can write down their feelings of jealousy when they witness others completing tasks efficiently. The twist? For every jealous thought, they must contribute a small amount of money or a skill they possess (e.g., baking, photography) to help someone else achieve their goals. This fosters a sense of community and encourages people to support each other's success.",
    "**Task Swap**: Organize a platform where people can swap tasks with others. For instance, someone who excels at cleaning might trade tasks with someone who is great at cooking. This exchange not only helps individuals learn new skills but also promotes mutual support and understanding that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "**Efficiency Coach**: Develop an AI-powered assistant that analyzes an individual's work habits and provides personalized recommendations to improve their productivity. This coach could offer suggestions on time management, goal setting, and task prioritization, helping people overcome their jealousy by focusing on their own growth.",
    "**Gratitude Jar**: Introduce a gratitude practice where individuals write down three things they appreciate about someone who has successfully completed a task. This practice helps shift the focus from jealousy to appreciation, promoting a positive and supportive environment.",
    "**Jealousy Hackathon**: Host a hackathon where participants are challenged to come up with innovative solutions to overcome jealousy. This event encourages collaboration, creativity, and out-of-the-box thinking, helping individuals find unique ways to manage their feelings of jealousy and focus on their own success. [/INST] "
