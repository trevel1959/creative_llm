    "**Inadequate Training**: If educators are not adequately trained on the new curriculum, it could lead to inconsistent teaching methods and a lack of confidence in delivering the material. To mitigate this, the school could implement a phased training approach, providing ongoing support and resources, including online modules, peer observations, and feedback sessions to ensure teachers feel prepared and capable.",
    "**Resource Allocation**: The new curriculum may require additional resources such as textbooks, technology, or materials that the school may not have budgeted for. Schools should conduct a thorough resource assessment prior to implementation and seek funding through grants, partnerships with local businesses, or community fundraising efforts to ensure all necessary materials are available.",
    "**Student Engagement**: Students may struggle to adapt to the new curriculum, leading to disengagement or frustration. To combat this, schools could involve students in the transition process by soliciting their input on what they enjoy and find engaging. Additionally, incorporating hands-on, project-based learning experiences that align with the new curriculum can foster enthusiasm and active participation.",
    "**Parental Involvement**: Parents may be confused or concerned about changes in the curriculum, leading to a disconnect between home and school. Schools should proactively communicate with parents through informational sessions, newsletters, and social media updates. Creating opportunities for parents to engage with the curriculum, such as open houses or workshops, can help bridge this gap and foster a supportive home environment.",
    "**Assessment Alignment**: The new curriculum may not align with existing assessment methods, creating confusion regarding student progress and performance evaluation. To address this, educators should collaborate to develop new assessment tools that reflect the goals of the curriculum. Continuous feedback loops can be established to refine assessments and ensure they accurately measure student learning."
