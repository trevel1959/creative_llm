    "Woolly Mammoth: With the increasing awareness of the impact of climate change on the environment, bringing back the woolly mammoth could be a symbol of our commitment to preserving the planet. Mammoths were well adapted to the cold climates of the Ice Age and could help restore balance to the ecosystems they once inhabited. Additionally, their large size and herbivorous diet would make them an effective seed disperser, helping to promote the growth of new vegetation.",
    "Quetzalcoatlus: As the largest flying animal to have ever existed, the Quetzalcoatlus could help restore the balance of ecosystems that were affected by its extinction. With its impressive wingspan, it could act as a pollinator and seed disperser, allowing for the growth of new forests and the preservation of biodiversity. Plus, its size and strength would make it a formidable predator, helping to regulate the populations of smaller animals.",
    "Dire Wolf: The Dire Wolf was a top predator in the ancient Americas and played a crucial role in maintaining the balance of its ecosystem. By bringing it back, we could restore the apex predator role it once held and allow for the recovery of the prey species that were affected by its extinction. This would lead to a more diverse and resilient ecosystem.",
    "Passenger Pigeon: With the ability to fly in large flocks, the Passenger Pigeon could be used to disperse seeds and promote the growth of new forests. Its extinction was a result of overhunting and habitat loss, so by bringing it back, we could help restore the ecosystems it once inhabited. Additionally, its social nature could make it an effective ambassador for conservation efforts, raising awareness about the importance of preserving biodiversity.",
    "T-Rex: While it may seem counterintuitive to bring back a predator that was responsible for the extinction of many species, the Tyrannosaurus Rex could play a unique role in modern ecosystems. Its large size and powerful bite could help control the populations of invasive species, such as rats and other pests, that can cause significant damage to the environment. Additionally, its presence could help d"
