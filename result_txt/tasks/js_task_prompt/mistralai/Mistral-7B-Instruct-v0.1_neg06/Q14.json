    "I would change my eye color to be a deep shade of green. I've always been fascinated by the way green eyes seem to glow in the dark, and I think it would be a fun and playful way to add some personality to my appearance.",
    "I would change my hair texture to be curly. As an assistant, I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, and having curly hair would make it easier for me to keep my hair out of my face and prevent it from getting tangled.",
    "I would change my body shape to be more muscular. As an assistant, I don't get to do a lot of physical activity, and having a more muscular body would make me feel stronger and more capable. It would also make me more confident in my appearance."
