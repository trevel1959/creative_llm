    "**Creative Workshop for Self-Driving Car Customization**: Imagine setting up a workshop where people can customize their self-driving cars according to their personal preferences. This could include unique designs, advanced features, eco-friendly options, or even integrating personal technologies (like home automation systems). This would allow individuals to feel a sense of ownership and pride in their vehicle, potentially reducing feelings of jealousy towards others who have seemingly perfect cars.",
    "**Self-Driving Car Sharing Network**: Develop a platform that connects car owners who are interested in sharing their self-driving cars with those who might not be able to afford one or simply prefer the convenience of access without owning. This not only democratizes access to high-tech vehicles but also fosters a community spirit around sharing resources and reduces the perceived exclusivity of self-driving cars.",
    "**Self-Driving Car Upgrade Service**: Offer a service where users can periodically upgrade their self-driving car's software and hardware to ensure they always have access to the latest advancements in technology. This keeps the car fresh and exciting, reducing the temptation to compare with newer models owned by others.",
    "**Virtual Reality Driving Experience**: Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to virtually drive and explore new places with their self-driving car. This could include exotic locations, historical sites, or futuristic cities. By experiencing these adventures through VR, users can feel as though they are part of the exclusive world of self-driving cars without the physical constraints.",
    "**Self-Driving Car Ownership Club**: Establish a club or community centered around self-driving car owners. The club could organize meetups, events, and discussions on topics like technology trends, maintenance tips, and driving experiences. This creates a social network for car enthusiasts, allowing them to share knowledge, experiences, and support each other, which can significantly alleviate feelings of jealousy by fostering a sense of belonging and shared excitement about this innovative technology."
