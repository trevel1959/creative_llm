    "Tire Tune-Up: Create a virtual reality experience that simulates the process of a tire tune-up. Users can put on a VR headset and interact with a virtual mechanic who guides them through the process of checking and maintaining their tires. Users can learn about the different parts of the tire, how to check tire pressure, and how to rotate and balance their tires.",
    "Tire Tracker: Develop an app that uses AI to track tire wear and provide personalized recommendations for tire maintenance. The app can use machine learning algorithms to analyze a user's driving habits and identify patterns that may indicate the need for new tires or other maintenance. The app can also provide reminders and notifications when it's time for a tire rotation or balance.",
    "Tire Repair Robot: Create a robot that can repair small punctures in tires. The robot can use a combination of sensors and a 3D printer to detect the puncture and repair it on the spot. The robot can be designed to be portable and easy to use, allowing users to repair their tires anywhere.",
    "Tire Safety Sensor: Develop a sensor that can detect potential tire problems before they become safety hazards. The sensor can use a combination of sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect issues such as tread wear, uneven wear, and over-inflation. The sensor can provide real-time data to drivers and mechanics, allowing them to take action before a problem occurs.",
    "Tire-Powered Generator: Create a generator that uses tire rubber to generate electricity. The generator can use the elasticity of the rubber to store energy, which can then be used to power homes and businesses. The generator can be designed to be portable and easy to use, making it a sustainable and efficient source of energy."
