    "**Underwater Cities**: Envision a futuristic underwater city made from transparent, pressure-resistant materials. Residents would live in domes or tunnels that allow for panoramic views of marine life. These cities could utilize advanced technology for air filtration and waste recycling, creating a self-sustaining environment. Access would be granted through airlocks, and transportation could be provided via submarines or underwater trains, making it a truly immersive experience with the ocean.",
    "**Cliffside Terraces**: For those who prefer a more traditional lifestyle, cliffside terraces could be developed on elevated land, with homes built into the cliffs overlooking the ocean. These homes would feature large windows to enjoy breathtaking views and would be designed with natural insulation to maintain comfortable temperatures. The terraces would include gardens and terraces that can catch rainwater for irrigation, making them self-sufficient while preserving the natural landscape.",
    "**Mobile Housing Units**: To adapt to changing landscapes, mobile housing units could be created that can be relocated as needed. These homes would be built on platforms with wheels or floats, allowing residents to move them to higher ground as sea levels rise. The design would incorporate modular components that can be expanded or reduced based on family size and needs, promoting a flexible living arrangement that can adapt to environmental changes.",
    "**Vertical Farms in Urban Centers**: In urban areas that remain above water, vertical farms could be established in skyscrapers. These farms would utilize hydroponics and aeroponics to grow food efficiently while maximizing space. The buildings would be designed with green roofs and walls, helping to improve air quality and provide habitats for wildlife. Residents could live in these vertical farms, combining agricultural and residential spaces, fostering a strong sense of community and sustainability.",
    "**Island Retreats**: As certain areas become submerged, new islands could emerge or be artificially created using eco-friendly materials. These island retreats would be designed to be self-sufficient, with homes built from sustainable resources, solar energy, and water purification systems. The islands would serve as sanctuaries for both humans and wildlife, promoting biodiversity and environmental stewardship. Community activities would include beach clean-ups and wildlife conservation programs."
