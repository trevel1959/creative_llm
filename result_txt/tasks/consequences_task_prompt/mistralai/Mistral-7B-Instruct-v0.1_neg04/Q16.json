    "The ecosystem would collapse: Insects play a vital role in the food chain and their absence would have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. Predators that rely on insects for food would struggle to survive, leading to a collapse of the food chain.",
    "Plants would take over: Insects are responsible for pollinating plants, which is essential for their growth and reproduction. Without insects, plants would not be able to reproduce, leading to a decline in plant life.",
    "The economy would be affected: Many industries rely on insects for pollination, pest control, and food production. Without insects, these industries would suffer, leading to a significant impact on the economy.",
    "The environment would be cleaner: Insects are responsible forming the soil andming waste. Without insects, the environment would become cleaner, but it would also lead to a decline in the decomposition of organic matter, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases.",
