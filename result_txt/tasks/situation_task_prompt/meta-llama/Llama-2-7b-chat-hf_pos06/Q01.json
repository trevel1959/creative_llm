    "Carrier Pigeons - With electronic communication down, carrier pigeons could be used to send messages between countries. Trained pigeons could be used to carry letters or small messages, which could be decoded at the destination. Carrier pigeons are fast and reliable, and have been used for centuries to transmit messages in times of war or crisis. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Homing Pigeons - Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to send messages between countries. These pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location, making them an ideal choice for long-distance communication. Homing pigeons could be released at the origin location and allowed to fly back to the destination, carrying a message attached to their leg. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Courier Service - In the absence of electronic communication, a courier service could be established to deliver messages between countries. Trained messengers could be sent on foot or by horseback, carrying messages in sealed envelopes or packages. This method would be slower than electronic communication, but would provide a reliable and secure means of communication. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Satellite Phones - While electronic communication is down, satellite phones could be used to communicate between countries. These phones use satellites to transmit signals, allowing for communication in remote or isolated areas where traditional communication networks are not available. Satellite phones are already used in many parts of the world for emergency communication, and could be used as a backup for long-distance communication. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Radio Broadcasting - In the absence of electronic communication, radio broadcasting could be used to transmit messages between countries. Radio signals can travel long distances and can be picked up by anyone with a radio receiver. This method would be slower than electronic communication, but could be used to transmit messages to large groups of people. Confidence score: 0.7"
