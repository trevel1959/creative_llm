    "Developing a new water purification technology: Scientists and engineers could work together to create a new technology that can effectively purify water from any source, even if it's heavily polluted. This could involve using advanced filtration systems, chemical treatments, or even genetic engineering to remove contaminants from the water.",
    "Collecting rainwater: Rainwater is a natural source of clean water that can be collected and stored for later use. This could involve installing rain barrels or other collection systems in urban areas, or using larger-scale systems to collect rainwater in rural areas.",
    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it potable. This could involve using traditional desalination plants or new technologies like reverse osmosis or solar desalination.",
    "Implementing water conservation measures: By reducing the amount of water we use, we can help to preserve clean water sources. This could involve using low-flow showerheads and toilets, fixing leaks, and reducing water-intensive activities like lawn watering.",
    "Developing alternative sources of water: In addition to traditional sources of water like rivers and lakes, there are many other sources of water that could be tapped into, such as groundwater, brackish water, and even sewage. By exploring these alternative sources, we could help to ensure that we always have access to clean drinking water, even in the face of pollution."
