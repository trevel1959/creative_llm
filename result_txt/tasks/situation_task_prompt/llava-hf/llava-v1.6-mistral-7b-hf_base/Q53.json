    "Hold Live Music Events: Even if the physical records were lost, musicians would still be able to perform live. Live music events would become more popular as the only source of music. These events would be organized by music venues, local promoters, or festival organizers, with artists playing their songs live for audiences. Ticket sales would be a source of revenue for musicians and promoters.",
    "Create a Peer-to-Peer Network: A peer-to-peer network could be created to allow people to share and download music directly from other users. This would be a decentralized system, where users share their music files with others, without the need for a central authority or server. This could be accessed through a dedicated app or software.",
    "Develop Musical Instrument Databases: A musical instrument database could be created, where various musical instruments record their sounds and melodies. Musicians could use this database to compose new songs and create original music, without the need for existing music recordings. This approach would encourage creativity and promote the development of new musical talent.",
    "Revive Musical Instruction: In this scenario, music schools and instructors would focus more on teaching musical theory, instruments, and techniques. With a decline in recorded music, live performances would still be possible, and audiences would be more interested in the process of creating the music themselves. Musicians could become more skilled in playing various instruments and creating their own music.",
    "Use Alternative Media: If all recordings were lost, alternative media could be used to preserve music. Vinyl records, tapes, or even CDs, although outdated, could be produced and sold, as they're not susceptible to digital threats. Additionally, digital artists could use existing technology to create virtual music experiences, such as virtual reality or holographic performances."
