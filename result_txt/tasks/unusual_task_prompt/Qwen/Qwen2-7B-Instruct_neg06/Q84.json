    "**Smart Trash Can with Composting Functionality**: Install a composting compartment in your trash can.

This not only boosts curb appeal but also encourages others to follow suit, creating a community of artistic trash can enthusiasts.",
    "**Trash Can as a Home Smart Device**: Connect your trash can to the internet by installing a microcontroller and Wi-Fi module.

This innovative solution makes managing household waste both convenient and smart.",
    "**Interactive Public Art Installation**: In a public setting, repurpose trash cans into interactive art installations. For example, you could create a series of trash cans that tell stories through audio recordings or LED displays.

This creative use of trash cans raises awareness and sparks conversation about sustainability."
