    "**Global Brain Drain**: With everyone suddenly possessing exceptional intelligence, the concept of a \"brain drain\" would take on a new meaning. The world's most brilliant minds would be overwhelmed with information, and their abilities would be stretched to the limit. This could lead to a global crisis, as the sheer number of geniuses would make it challenging for them to cope with the influx of knowledge and ideas. The existing social structures, educational systems, and institutions would struggle to accommodate the new intellectual landscape.",
    "**Intellectual Overload**: The sudden surge in intelligence would create a massive information overload. People would be bombarded with complex ideas, theories, and concepts, making it difficult for them to process and prioritize information. This could lead to mental fatigue, anxiety, and a sense of information paralysis, where individuals would feel overwhelmed and unable to make decisions.",
    "**Social Hierarchy Shift**: With everyone becoming geniuses, the traditional social hierarchy would be turned upside down. The existing power structures, based on intelligence, wealth, and social status, would be dismantled. A new social order would emerge, where individuals would be judged on their character, empathy, and creativity rather than their intellectual prowess. This could lead to a more equitable society, but also pose challenges in adapting to the new social dynamics.",
    "**Creative Explosion**: The sudden influx of genius-level intelligence would unleash a creative explosion, as people would be able to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to complex problems. This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries, artistic masterpieces, and revolutionary ideas that would transform various fields, from science and technology to art and literature.",
    "**Existential Crisis**: The realization that everyone has become a genius would lead to an existential crisis, as people would be forced to confront the meaning and purpose of their lives. With the traditional measures of success and achievement rendered obsolete, individuals would need to redefine their goals and aspirations. This could lead to a period of introspection and self-discovery, as people seek to find new meaning and purpose in their lives."
