    "**Tactile Sensory Experience:** One could create a dining experience that focuses on touch rather than taste. Using textured plates, cutlery, and food, guests can explore their food through touch alone. For example, using a combination of crunchy, smooth, and soft textures in a dish can offer a satisfying sensory experience. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Enhanced Aromatics:** Since taste is lost, relying more heavily on aroma can enhance the enjoyment of food. Dishes could be prepared with an emphasis on strong scents like rosemary, lavender, or cinnamon. The power of scent in triggering memories and emotions makes this approach quite impactful. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Sensory Soundscapes:** Pairing meals with music or ambient sounds that match the flavor profile or cultural context of the dish can create a multi-sensory experience. For instance, playing jazz music with a French meal or soft, calming sounds with a Japanese sushi experience. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Visual Flavor:** Using food coloring, garnishes, and presentation to mimic the colors associated with flavors could stimulate the visual senses as a proxy for taste. For example, a dish could have green (symbolizing freshness) and red (symbolizing heat) elements to suggest it might taste spicy and refreshing. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Interactive Cooking Classes:** Involve guests in the cooking process where they learn about ingredients and techniques instead of just tasting the end result. This can help them understand the flavor profiles and nuances of different dishes. Confidence Score: 0.7"
