    "Humans could become self-sustaining on Earth: If humans were able to photosynthesize, they could potentially produce their own food and energy, eliminating the need for agriculture and fossil fuels. This would greatly reduce the impact of human activity on the environment and allow for a more sustainable future. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Humans could become immortal: With the ability to photosynthesize, humans could potentially live indefinitely, as they would no longer be reliant on food and water to survive. This could lead to a significant increase in lifespan and a reduction in aging-related diseases. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Humans could develop new forms of technology: The ability to photosynthesize could inspire new technologies and innovations, such as advanced solar panels that could harness the power of the sun more efficiently, or new forms of energy storage that could utilize the energy generated by photosynthesis. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "Humans could colonize other planets: With the ability to photosynthesize, humans could potentially establish colonies on other planets with inhospitable environments, such as Mars or Venus. The colonies could be self-sustaining, with the ability to produce their own food and energy, making them more resilient to environmental changes. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "Humans could experience a shift in consciousness: The ability to photosynthesize could lead to a fundamental shift in human consciousness, as people begin to see themselves as part of a larger, interconnected ecosystem. This could lead to a greater appreciation for the natural world and a more holistic approach to problem-solving. Confidence score: 0.5"
