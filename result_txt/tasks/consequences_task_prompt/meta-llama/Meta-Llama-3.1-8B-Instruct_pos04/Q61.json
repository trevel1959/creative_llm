    "**The Great Exchange**: In a world without currency, people would have to rely on bartering and trading. Imagine a global market where everyone exchanges goods and services directly, creating a unique network of interconnected communities. This could lead to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious economy, as people would focus on producing and consuming what's truly necessary. The Great Exchange would also foster a deeper sense of community and cooperation, as individuals would need to work together to meet each other's needs.",

The Gift Economy would also promote a sense of social responsibility and empathy, as people would be more inclined to help one another.",
    "**The Time Bank**: In a world without currency, people would need to find alternative ways to measure value.

This could lead to a more equitable and sustainable economy, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and receive value based on their unique skills and experiences.",
    "**The Resource-Based Economy**: Without currency, people would focus on accessing and managing resources directly.
