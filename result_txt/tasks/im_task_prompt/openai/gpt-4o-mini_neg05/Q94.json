    "**Eco-Friendly Refill System**: Create a candle that comes with a refillable container and eco-friendly wax. Once the candle has burned down, users can purchase wax refills that come in biodegradable packaging. This not only reduces waste but also allows customers to experiment with different scents without needing to buy a whole new candle each time.",
    "**Color-Changing Wax**: Innovate candles with wax that changes color as it burns. Using heat-sensitive pigments, the candle could transition through various colors, creating a visual spectacle. This feature could be tied to specific scents or moods, enhancing the overall ambiance and experience of the candle.",
    "**Interactive Candle Storytelling**: Design a candle that includes an embedded NFC chip. When lit, users can scan the candle with their smartphones to access a short story or a guided meditation that corresponds to the candle's scent. This immersive experience would elevate the candle from a simple object to a storytelling device, enhancing relaxation and mindfulness.",
    "**Mood-Reflecting Candles**: Introduce candles that change their scent based on the environment. Using sensors, these candles could detect changes in humidity, temperature, or even the emotional state of the room (via voice analysis) and adjust their fragrance accordingly. For example, a calming scent could be released during stressful moments, promoting relaxation.",
    "**Candle with Built-in Speaker**: Create a candle that incorporates a small Bluetooth speaker. Users can connect their devices to play music or nature sounds while the candle burns. This would create a multi-sensory experience, combining light, scent, and sound to enhance relaxation or create a festive atmosphere."
