    "**Food Preservation Challenges**: Refrigeration is not possible without electricity, leading to food spoilage and waste. To mitigate this, communities could implement a cooperative food storage system using icehouses or root cellars, where perishables can be stored in cooler, more stable environments. Additionally, promoting the use of canning and preserving techniques can help extend the life of food supplies.",
    "**Water Supply Issues**: Many modern water supply systems rely on electric pumps. In a power outage, access to clean water could be compromised. To counter this, households could invest in manual water pumps or rainwater harvesting systems that utilize gravity to collect and store water, ensuring a steady supply even without electricity.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: The absence of electric lighting can lead to increased safety risks, particularly at night. To address this, communities can create a network of solar-powered streetlights and encourage residents to use solar lanterns or candles responsibly. Neighborhood watch programs can also be established to enhance security through increased vigilance.",
    "**Health Care Access**: Without electricity, medical devices and equipment that rely on power cannot function, which can be critical for individuals with chronic health conditions. Establishing a community health resource center with backup power solutions, such as generators or solar panels, can ensure that essential medical services remain available.",
    "**Educational Disruptions**: Students may struggle to complete homework or access educational resources without electricity. To combat this, local libraries or community centers could provide solar-powered study spaces and resources, and organize outdoor learning sessions to ensure educational continuity despite the lack of power."
