    "\"Ski Poles with Built-in GPS Tracking System\": This idea involves integrating GPS technology into ski poles, allowing skiers to track their movements and performance while on the slopes. The GPS system could provide real-time data on speed, distance traveled, and route taken, helping skiers to improve their skills and stay safe.",
    "\"Ski Poles with Adjustable Length\": This idea involves creating ski poles with adjustable lengths, allowing skiers to easily switch between different lengths depending on their terrain and style of skiing. For example, shorter poles would be ideal for steep, technical runs, while longer poles would be better for flat, open slopes.",
    "\"Ski Poles with Integrated Lighting\": This idea involves adding LED lighting to ski poles, providing skiers with a source of light in low-light conditions. This could be especially useful for night skiing or for navigating through tree-lined areas where visibility is limited.",
    "\"Ski Poles with Built-in Camera\": This idea involves integrating a camera into ski poles, allowing skiers to capture their experiences on the slopes. The camera could be mounted on the pole and positioned to capture footage of the skier's movements and perspective.",
    "\"Ski Poles with Built-in Music Player\": This idea involves adding a music player to ski poles, allowing skiers to listen to music while on the slopes. The music player could be built into the pole and controlled through a button or touch screen on the grip."
