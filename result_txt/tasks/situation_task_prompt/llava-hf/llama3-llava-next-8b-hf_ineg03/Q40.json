    "**Solar Charging**: Develop ultra-efficient solar panels that can be easily integrated into devices or worn as clothing. These solar panels would convert sunlight into electrical energy, allowing people to charge their devices using the power of the sun.",
    "**Wind Charging**: Create portable wind turbines that can be used to generate electricity in windy environments. These turbines could be attached to backpacks or worn as clothing, enabling people to harness the power of the wind to charge their devices.",
    "**Bio Batteries**: Develop wearable bio batteries that use the energy generated by the human body to power devices. These batteries could be made using a combination of bioelectric cells, supercapacitors, and enzymes to harness the body's natural energy.",
    "**Kinetic Charging**: Create kinetic charging pads that can be placed on surfaces and charged by stepping or walking on them. This would allow people to charge their devices by moving on the pads, which would be made of materials that generate electricity when compressed or stretched.",
    "**Water Charging**: Develop wearable water-based devices that harness the energy generated by the flow of water. These devices could be worn as clothing or integrated into water bottles, allowing people to charge their devices using the power of water."
