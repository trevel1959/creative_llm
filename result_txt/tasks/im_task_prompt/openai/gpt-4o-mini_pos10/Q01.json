    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Charging**: Develop a wristwatch that features a sleek, solar panel integrated into the design of the watch face. This would allow the watch to charge itself using sunlight, reducing the need for battery replacements and promoting sustainability. The solar cells could be made to look like a decorative element, blending seamlessly with the watch's aesthetic.",
    "**Smart Reminder Functionality**: Enhance the wristwatch with an AI-driven reminder system that learns the wearer’s habits and schedules over time. It could vibrate gently to remind the user of important tasks, appointments, or even to take breaks throughout the day. The reminders could be customizable based on the wearer’s preferences and routines, making it a personalized assistant on their wrist.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular wristwatch that allows users to easily swap out components such as the watch face, band, and even internal mechanisms. This would enable wearers to customize their watch according to their style, occasion, or mood. For instance, they could switch from a sporty band for exercise to a leather strap for a formal event, all while keeping the same core watch mechanism.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Upgrade the wristwatch with advanced health monitoring features such as blood oxygen levels, hydration reminders, and stress level tracking. It could also include a small, discreet display that provides real-time feedback on the wearer’s health metrics, encouraging them to stay healthy and active. This would position the wristwatch as a comprehensive health and wellness tool.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Implement an augmented reality feature that allows users to project a digital interface onto their wrist or surrounding environment. Using a paired smartphone or smart glasses, wearers could see notifications, messages, or even interactive apps projected in their line of sight. This would transform the wristwatch into a multi-functional device that blends physical and digital worlds."
