    "I would start a visual journal to capture my thoughts and emotions. I would use a combination of drawings, paintings, and collages to express myself.",
    "I would learn sign language and communicate with my loved ones through gestures and facial expressions.",
    "I would focus on my sense of touch and explore different textures through tactile activities like knitting, weaving, or pottery.",
    "I would create a silent storytelling performance using mime and pantomime to convey emotions and narratives.",
    "I would learn to play a musical instrument using only body percussion, such as tapping my feet, hands, or clapping, to create rhythms and melodies."
