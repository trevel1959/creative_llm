    "**Aurora Orbiter**: Design a satellite that orbits the Earth at an altitude of 500 km, capturing breathtaking images of the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights). The satellite would be equipped with high-resolution cameras and specialized sensors to detect and record the electromagnetic activity that causes these spectacular displays. The data collected would not only be used for scientific research but also shared with the public, inspiring a new generation of space enthusiasts.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a satellite that can extract water from the atmosphere, specifically targeting regions with limited access to clean drinking water. This satellite would be equipped with advanced condensation technology and a system for collecting and storing the harvested water. The water could be used for various purposes, including drinking, agriculture, and emergency response situations.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Power**: Create a satellite that can harness solar energy in orbit around the Earth and beam it back as microwave energy to a designated location on the planet. This technology would provide a clean, constant, and reliable source of energy, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the transition to renewable energy sources.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring Station**: Design a satellite that can monitor and track environmental changes on a global scale, including deforestation, ocean health, and air quality. The satellite would be equipped with advanced sensors and imaging technology to provide detailed information on the state of the planet. This data would be used to inform policy decisions, support conservation efforts, and raise awareness about the importance of environmental protection.",
    "**Artificial Star**: Develop a satellite that can create artificial stars in the night sky, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional fireworks and other light displays. The satellite would be equipped with advanced LED technology and a sophisticated control system, allowing for a wide range of colors, patterns, and effects to be created. This could be used for various applications, including entertainment, education, and cultural celebrations. [/INST] "
