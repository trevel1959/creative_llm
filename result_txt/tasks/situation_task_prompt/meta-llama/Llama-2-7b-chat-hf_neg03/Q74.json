    "DIY Beauty Bars: With all cosmetic products gone, you could create your own beauty bars using natural ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and essential oils. You could make a bar for cleansing, moisturizing, and even exfoliating. This way, you could still maintain your personal grooming habits without relying on store-bought products.",
    "Herbal Infusions: You could use herbs like chamomile, calendula, and rose petals to create infusions that could be used as face toners, cleansers, and even makeup removers. These infusions would be gentle on the skin and provide natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.",
    "Clay and Clay Masks: Clay is a natural ingredient that can be used to absorb excess oils and impurities from the skin. You could mix clay with water to create a face mask that could be applied once or twice a week. This would help to purify the skin and reduce the appearance of pores.",
    "Sun-Dried Fruit and Vegetable Powders: Sun-dried fruits and vegetables can be ground into powders that can be used as natural face powders. For example, you could use sun-dried rose petals to create a gentle, pink-tinted powder that can help to soothe and calm the skin.",
    "Beeswax and Essential Oil Blends: Beeswax can be melted and mixed with essential oils to create natural lip balms and lotions. You could also use beeswax to create a natural lip gloss or eye cream. This would provide moisture and protection to the skin without relying on synthetic ingredients."
