    "Teleportation: If planes were no longer an option, teleportation could be the ultimate solution. This technology would allow individuals to transport themselves instantly from one location to another, bypassing the need for any physical mode of transportation. This could be achieved through the use of advanced quantum entanglement technology, which would allow for the instantaneous transfer of matter from one location to another.",
    "Space Travel: If planes were no longer an option, space travel could be the ultimate solution. This would involve the development of spacecraft that could transport individuals from one location to another, allowing them to travel faster than the speed of light. This could be achieved through the use of advanced propulsion systems, such as wormholes or antimatter engines.",
    "Underwater Travel: If planes were no longer an option, underwater travel could be the ultimate solution. This would involve the development of advanced submarines or underwater vehicles that could transport individuals from one location to another, allowing them to travel through the world's oceans. This could be achieved through the use of advanced propulsion systems, such as nuclear reactors or hydrogen fuel cells.",
    "Magnetic Levitation: If planes were no longer an option, magnetic levitation could be the ultimate solution. This would involve the development of vehicles that could levitate and fly using magnetic fields, allowing individuals to travel through the air without the need for traditional planes. This could be achieved through the use of advanced magnetic levitation technology, such as superconducting magnets or ionic propulsion systems.",
    "Hyperloop: If planes were no longer an option, the hyperloop could be the ultimate solution. This would involve the development of a high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to transport individuals from one location to another, allowing them to travel at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. This could be achieved through the use of advanced propulsion systems, such as electromagnetic propulsion or air propulsion."
