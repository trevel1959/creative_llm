    "Plant-based remedies: In a world without modern medicine, plant-based remedies could play a significant role in treating common colds. Herbs like peppermint, eucalyptus, and echinacea have natural decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties, which could help alleviate symptoms like congestion and sore throats. Steeped in hot water, these herbs could be consumed as tea or added to a humidifier for relief.",
    "Salt water gargle: Gargling with salt water could help soothe a sore throat and reduce inflammation.

Additionally, the antibacterial properties of salt could help combat the infection causing the cold.",
    "Honey and lemon: A mixture of honey and lemon juice could serve as a natural cough syrup.

Mixing equal parts honey and lemon juice and consuming it several times a day could help alleviate coughing and congestion.",

Additionally, the calming properties of lavender could help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, which is essential for the body to fight off the infection."
