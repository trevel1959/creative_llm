    "**Thermos 3D Printer**: Design a thermos with a built-in 3D printer that can print objects on the go. The printer would use a special type of filament that can withstand extreme temperatures, allowing users to print objects while their drinks stay hot or cold. This innovative design would make thermoses more than just a container for liquids, but a tool for creativity and productivity.",
    "**Smart Thermos with Temperature Control**: Develop a thermos with a built-in temperature control system that can adjust the temperature of the contents to the user's liking. This would be achieved through a mobile app that allows users to set the desired temperature, and the thermos would use advanced heating and cooling elements to maintain the perfect temperature. This feature would be especially useful for people who enjoy hot or cold beverages at specific temperatures.",
    "**Thermos with Integrated Power Bank**: Design a thermos that doubles as a power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. The thermos would have a built-in battery that can be charged via USB, and users could then use it to charge their smartphones, tablets, or other devices. This feature would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts, commuters, or anyone who spends a lot of time away from power outlets.",
    "**Thermos with Built-in Water Purification System**: Create a thermos that has a built-in water purification system, allowing users to safely drink from any source. The system would use advanced filtration technology to remove bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants from the water, making it safe for consumption. This feature would be especially useful for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, or people living in areas with questionable water quality.",
    "**Thermos with Augmented Reality Display**: Design a thermos with an augmented reality (AR) display that provides users with information about their drinks, such as the temperature, nutritional content, or even the ingredients used to make it. The AR display would be activated through a mobile app, and users could scan their thermos to access the information. This feature would be especially useful for people who are health-conscious or want to learn more about their drinks.
