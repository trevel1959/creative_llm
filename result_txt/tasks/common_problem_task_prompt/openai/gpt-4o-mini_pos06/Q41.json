    "**Life Support Systems**: Maintaining a sustainable environment for astronauts is crucial. The spaceship must have reliable life support systems that provide oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate temperature and humidity. Problems can arise if these systems fail or if the resources become depleted during long missions. Designing redundancy into these systems, along with emergency protocols, is essential to mitigate risks.",
    "**Navigation and Communication**: Navigating through space poses significant challenges, especially given the vast distances and the need for precision. Communication with Earth can be hindered by distance, leading to delays in data transmission. The design must include advanced navigation systems that utilize both onboard sensors and external data sources, along with robust communication systems that can function even in low-bandwidth conditions.",
    "**Power Generation and Storage**: Spacecraft require a reliable power source to operate systems, conduct experiments, and maintain life support. Solar panels are a common choice, but they depend on proximity to the sun and can be less effective in deep space. The design must consider energy storage solutions, such as advanced batteries or nuclear power, to ensure a consistent power supply throughout the mission.",
    "**Human Factors and Ergonomics**: The design must take into account the physical and psychological needs of the crew. Limited space can lead to discomfort and stress, affecting performance. The layout of the spaceship should allow for ease of movement, access to essential equipment, and areas for relaxation. Moreover, the design should include features that help mitigate the effects of isolation and confinement, such as virtual reality environments or exercise facilities.",
    "**Safety and Emergency Protocols**: Space travel inherently carries risks, and the design must incorporate safety measures for potential emergencies, such as cabin depressurization, fire, or medical emergencies. This includes designing escape routes, fire suppression systems, and medical facilities. Additionally, the crew should be trained in emergency protocols, and the design should facilitate quick and effective responses to various crisis scenarios."
