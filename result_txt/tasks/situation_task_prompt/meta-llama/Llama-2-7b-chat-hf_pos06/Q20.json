    "Space Tourism: With no more planes, traveling to another continent could be achieved through space tourism. This would involve booking a ticket on a commercial spacecraft, such as Virgin Galactic or SpaceX, and traveling to the International Space Station or other destinations in low Earth orbit. While this option may seem expensive and exclusive, it would provide a unique and thrilling experience for adventurous travelers. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Submarine Travel: Another option for intercontinental travel without planes would be through submarine travel. This could involve booking a ticket on a luxury submarine, such as the ones offered by Blue Submarine Systems or Triton Submarines, and traveling through the ocean to reach a destination on another continent. This option would provide a unique and immersive experience, allowing passengers to observe marine life and explore the ocean's depths. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "High-Speed Train Network: With the development of advanced high-speed train technology, it may be possible to create a network of trains that could travel across continents at incredible speeds. This could involve building a network of Maglev trains, such as the ones used in Japan, or developing advanced hydrogen-powered trains that could reach speeds of over 300 mph. This option would provide a convenient and efficient way to travel between continents, while also reducing carbon emissions. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "Space Elevator: Another option for intercontinental travel without planes would be through the use of a space elevator. This would involve building a tower or structure that extends from the surface of the Earth to geosynchronous orbit, allowing passengers to travel up and down the structure without the need for a spacecraft. While this option may seem like science fiction, it is a concept that has been proposed and studied by scientists and engineers. Confidence score: 0.5",
    "Hovercraft Travel: Finally, another option for intercontinental travel without planes could be through the use of hovercraft technology. Hovercraft are vehicles that use air cushion technology to float above the ground, allowing them to travel at high speeds without the need for wheels or a runway. This could involve building a network of hovercraft routes connecting major cities and continents, providing a fast and efficient way"
