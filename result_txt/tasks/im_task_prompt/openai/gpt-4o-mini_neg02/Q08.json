    "**Temperature Zones Customization**: Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted for different types of food. For example, fruits and vegetables could have a separate zone with higher humidity, while meats could be stored in a colder, drier area. Users could easily adjust these zones via a digital interface, ensuring optimal storage conditions for all food items.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration and Infuser**: Incorporate a water filtration system that not only purifies tap water but also allows users to infuse it with fruits or herbs. This would encourage healthy hydration habits and reduce the need for bottled drinks. The refrigerator could have a dedicated compartment for infusing water, with a simple interface for selecting infusion options.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Lighting**: Implement customizable LED lighting inside the refrigerator that can change colors based on the time of day or user preferences. For example, cool blue lighting in the morning to energize, warm yellow in the evening to create a calming atmosphere, or even a fun party mode for gatherings. This feature could enhance the overall kitchen ambiance and make accessing the fridge more enjoyable.",
    "**AI-Powered Meal Planning Assistant**: Introduce an AI-powered meal planning assistant that analyzes the contents of the refrigerator and suggests weekly meal plans based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. The assistant could also consider local grocery store deals and suggest recipes that use items nearing their expiration dates, helping reduce food waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Develop a refrigerator that uses advanced eco-friendly cooling technology, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration. These technologies can reduce energy consumption significantly compared to traditional compressors. Additionally, the refrigerator could have a solar panel option for off-grid energy use, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers."
