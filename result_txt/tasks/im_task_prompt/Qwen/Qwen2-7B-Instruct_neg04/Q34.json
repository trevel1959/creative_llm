Each frame could be made from recycled or repurposed materials like reclaimed wood, metal scraps, or old windows. The idea is to allow users to personalize their mirrors according to their tastes and home decor, making each mirror unique.",
    "**Interactive Smart Mirror**: Develop a smart mirror that integrates technology such as facial recognition, augmented reality, and voice commands.

It could also connect to your smart home devices for a seamless experience.",
    "**Portable Mirror with Built-in Lights**: Design a compact, lightweight mirror that comes with built-in LED lights. This portable mirror can be used in low-light environments, such as bathrooms, bedrooms, or even outdoors. The lights can be adjusted for different tasks, such as applying makeup or doing hair, and the mirror could have touch controls for easy operation.",
    "**Therapeutic Mirror with Sound Therapy**: Introduce a mirror that incorporates sound therapy into its design. The mirror could emit soothing sounds or white noise that help reduce stress and anxiety when looking at oneself. This product could be particularly beneficial for individuals who find self-reflection stressful or triggering. The sounds could be adjustable, allowing users to customize the experience.",
    "**Sustainable Mirror with Self-cleaning Technology**: Develop a mirror that utilizes nanotechnology to clean itself. This mirror would use a special coating that repels water and dust, making it easier to maintain. Additionally, it could incorporate solar panels to power the cleaning mechanism, ensuring the mirror remains self-sufficient and eco-friendly. This innovative mirror would require minimal maintenance while also reducing environmental impact."
