    "**Modular Temperature Zones**: Design a refrigerator with modular compartments that can be adjusted to different temperatures based on the type of food stored. For example, a section for dairy could be set to a cooler temperature than the section for fruits and vegetables. Users could customize the settings for each compartment, ensuring optimal freshness and longevity for all items.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and ozone technology to sanitize the interior of the refrigerator. This would not only help eliminate odors but also kill bacteria and mold, ensuring a healthier food storage environment. Users could activate this feature with a simple button press or schedule it to run at specific times.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Solar Panel Integration**: Develop a refrigerator that incorporates solar panels on its exterior, allowing it to harness renewable energy. This would significantly reduce energy consumption and lower electricity bills. The solar power could also be used to charge devices via USB ports built into the refrigerator, providing convenience for users.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional controls with an interactive touchscreen interface that allows users to customize settings, access recipes, and create shopping lists. The interface could also display nutritional information for stored items and suggest meal ideas based on dietary preferences, making the refrigerator a hub for culinary creativity.",
    "**Climate Control Features**: Introduce advanced climate control features that mimic natural environments for specific food types. For instance, a section could replicate the conditions of a root cellar for potatoes and onions, while another could simulate a humid environment for leafy greens. This would enhance the longevity and quality of various food items by providing optimal storage conditions."
