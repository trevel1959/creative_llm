    "Nature-Inspired Decor: Embrace the beauty of nature and use natural elements to decorate your house. Instead of paint, use materials like branches, rocks, and leaves to create a unique and organic look. For example, you could use branches to create a living wall, or use rocks to create a mosaic pattern on the floor.",
    "Light Installations: Since paint is no longer an option, focus on using light to create a visually striking interior design. Install LED lights in different shapes and colors to create a mesmerizing display. You could also use mirrors to reflect light and create the illusion of more space.",
    "Textile-Based Decor: Instead of painting walls, use textiles to create a colorful and cozy atmosphere. Hang colorful tapestries, throw pillows, and blankets to add warmth and personality to your home. You could also use natural fibers like wool or cotton to create a textile-based wall art.",
    "Origami-Inspired Design: Take inspiration from origami and create three-dimensional decorative pieces using paper. You could create a paper lantern to hang from the ceiling, or use folded paper to create a unique piece of art. This approach will add a playful and whimsical touch to your home.",
    "Food-Based Decor: Since paint is no longer an option, why not use food as a decorative element? Use edible ingredients like fruit, vegetables, and spices to create a colorful and unique interior design. For example, you could create a fruit salad wall, or use spices to create a colorful mosaic pattern on the floor. This approach will not only add flavor to your home but also create a fun and playful atmosphere."
