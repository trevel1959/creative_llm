    "Use the position of the stars: We could use the position of the stars to schedule our day. We could create a chart that shows the position of the stars at different times of the day and use that to schedule our activities.",
    "Use a sound-based system: We could use a sound-based system to schedule our day. For example, we could set a timer to go off every hour and use that to remind us to switch tasks.",
    "Use a time-tracking app: We could use a time-tracking app to schedule our day. We could start each task and end each task at a specific time and use that data to create a schedule for the day.",
