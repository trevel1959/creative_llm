    "I would listen to live performances, as they would be the only remaining way to experience music. This would give me a unique opportunity to connect with musicians and their art in a more personal way.",
    "I would try to create my own music using instruments or software, as it would be a new challenge and a way to express myself creatively.",
    "I would explore new genres and artists that I haven't heard before, as I would be forced to discover new music in a different way.",
    "I would listen to audio descriptions of music, as they would help me imagine the sound and emotion in my mind.",
    "I would listen to music in my mind, as I would still have the memories of the sounds and emotions associated with each piece."
