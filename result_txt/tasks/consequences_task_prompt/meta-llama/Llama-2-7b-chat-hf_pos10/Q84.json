    "Loss of Cultural Identity: Adopting a single universal language could lead to the erasure of unique cultural identities and the homogenization of languages. Each language is a reflection of its culture, and the loss of these languages would result in the loss of cultural diversity.",
    "Language Barriers: While a single universal language could facilitate communication among nations, it could also create new barriers. Non-native speakers may struggle to learn and communicate in the new language, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications.",
    "Power Dynamics: The adoption of a single universal language could also lead to power imbalances. The language may be dominated by the more powerful nations, leading to a loss of agency and voice for marginalized communities.",
    "Economic Consequences: A single universal language could also have significant economic implications. Multinational corporations may prefer to use the dominant language, leading to a loss of economic opportunities for smaller languages and regions.",
    "Technological Innovation: On the other hand, a single universal language could also lead to technological innovations. A single language could facilitate the development of more advanced language processing and translation technologies, making communication more efficient and accessible."
