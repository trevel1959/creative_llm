    "On a frosty winter morning, a young girl named Lily built a snowman in her backyard, giving him a carrot nose and a scarf made from her old sweater. As night fell, a magical star twinkled above, and with a soft whisper, the snowman named Frosty came to life. He blinked his coal eyes and stretched his twig arms, marveling at the world around him. Together, Lily and Frosty danced under the moonlight, creating snowflakes that sparkled like diamonds. But as dawn approached, Frosty knew he had to return to his snowy form, leaving Lily with a heart full of joy and a promise to return next winter.",
