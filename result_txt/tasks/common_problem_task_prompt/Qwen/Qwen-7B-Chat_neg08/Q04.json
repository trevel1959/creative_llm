    "Embrace your unique strengths: Instead of feeling jealous of others' success, focus on what makes you special and use it to your advantage in starting your own business. For example, if you have a talent for marketing, invest more time into developing that skill and use it to promote your business effectively.",
    "Learn from others: Instead of feeling jealous, seek out successful entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences. Attend networking events or read books by successful business owners to gain insight into what worked (and didn't work) for them.",
    "Create a support system: Surround yourself with people who encourage and support you as you start your business. Join a local entrepreneur group or find a mentor who can offer guidance and advice along the way.",
    "Set realistic goals: When starting a new business, it's important to set achievable goals and not compare yourself to others who may be further along in their journey. Celebrate small wins along the way and stay focused on your long-term vision.",
    "Practice gratitude: Finally, take some time each day to practice gratitude for the opportunities and blessings in your life. This can help shift your mindset away from jealousy and towards a positive, growth-oriented attitude."
