    "Thermal Mass Storage: Thermal mass storage involves using materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete, brick, or stone, to absorb and release heat during the day. By strategically placing these materials in the building, you can create a natural cooling system. During the day, the thermal mass absorbs heat from the sun and stores it, and at night, it releases the stored heat to maintain a comfortable temperature. This approach can be particularly effective in buildings with thick walls and high thermal mass.",
    "Passive Ventilation: Passive ventilation involves using natural airflows to regulate indoor temperature. This can be achieved through strategic placement of windows, vents, and other openings. By opening windows on opposite sides of the building during different times of the day, you can create a cross-breeze that helps to cool the space. Additionally, using a ventilation system that takes advantage of the wind direction and air pressure can further enhance the cooling effect.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Evaporative cooling involves using water to cool the air. This can be achieved through the use of wet towels, sprays, or even a dedicated evaporative cooling system. By evaporating water, you can cool the surrounding air through a process called latent heat transfer. This approach is particularly effective in dry climates, where the air is already hot and humidity is low.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that can store thermal energy by melting and freezing at specific temperatures. By incorporating PCMs into building design, you can create a natural cooling system. For example, you can use PCMs in walls, floors, or ceilings to absorb heat during the day and release it at night. This approach can be particularly effective in buildings with limited windows or in areas with extreme temperature fluctuations.",
    "Green Roofs: Green roofs are covered with vegetation, providing insulation and reducing the amount of heat that enters the building. By planting a variety of plants, such as succulents, grasses, and herbs, you can create a natural cooling system. The plants absorb heat during the day and release it at night, helping to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. Additionally, green roofs can provide a habitat for"
