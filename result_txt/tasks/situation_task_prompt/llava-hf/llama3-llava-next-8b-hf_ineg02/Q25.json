    "Emergency Escape Routes: Buildings with multiple levels would need to have emergency escape routes clearly marked and accessible. These routes would need to be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure they are functional and safe. In the event of an elevator malfunction, occupants would need to follow the marked escape routes to reach the ground safely.",
    "Ropes and Harnesses: In some cases, a rope and harness system could be installed on the outside of the building. This would allow occupants to descend from the top of the building to a lower level safely. Building management would need to ensure that the ropes and harnesses are regularly inspected and maintained to prevent any accidents.",
    "Helicopter Rescue: In extreme cases, a helicopter could be used to rescue those trapped in an elevator. Building management would need to have a plan in place for emergency helicopter rescues and ensure that the necessary equipment and trained personnel are available.",
    "Emergency Elevator Repair: In some cases, it may be possible to repair an elevator in place. Building management would need to have a plan in place for emergency elevator repairs and ensure that the necessary equipment and trained personnel are available.",
    "Evacuation Drills: Building management would need to conduct regular evacuation drills to ensure that occupants are aware of the emergency escape routes and know how to use them in the event of an elevator malfunction."
