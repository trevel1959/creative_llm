    "**Portable Rehabilitation Station**: Design a wheelchair that can be transformed into a mobile rehabilitation station. The chair could have built-in sensors to detect muscle movements and provide resistance training as needed. It could also include adjustable positioning options for different exercises, such as arm lifts or leg extensions. This would allow individuals to perform physical therapy sessions while on the go, enhancing mobility and independence.",
    "**Environmental Sensing Wheelchair**: Integrate advanced sensor technology into the wheelchair frame to detect environmental hazards like uneven surfaces, obstacles, or temperature changes. The system would alert the user via vibrations, sounds, or visual cues, enabling them to navigate safely and avoid potential accidents. Additionally, it could monitor air quality and alert the user if the environment becomes unsafe due to pollution or allergens.",
    "**Smart Learning Wheelchair**: Incorporate AI-powered educational tools into the wheelchair, allowing users to access educational content, online courses, and interactive learning experiences. The chair could feature a large, touch-sensitive screen for easy navigation and a voice-activated assistant to facilitate communication with tutors or educational platforms. This setup would promote lifelong learning and self-improvement for users with disabilities.",
    "**Virtual Reality Experience Hub**: Design a wheelchair with a high-resolution VR headset integrated into its frame, providing immersive experiences such as virtual travel, museum tours, or even attending events remotely. Users could explore new environments, engage in social activities, and participate in educational programs without leaving their homes. This technology would enhance social interaction, reduce feelings of isolation, and offer a sense of adventure.",
    "**Smart Home Integration System**: Create a wheelchair that seamlessly integrates with smart home devices, allowing users to control various aspects of their living environment from their chair. This could include lighting, heating/cooling systems, security features, and entertainment devices. By using voice commands or touch controls within the wheelchair, users can manage their home environment independently, promoting greater comfort, safety, and convenience in daily life."
