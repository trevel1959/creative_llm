    "Inadequate Cyber Security Awareness: Another potential problem is a lack of awareness amongst employees in the company about cyber security. Many employees may not be aware of the importance of protecting sensitive information, the potential risks of cyber-attacks, or how to identify and respond to them effectively. This can increase the likelihood of a security breach. To address this, it is essential to implement cyber security awareness training programs that are tailored to the company's needs and the specific risks it faces.",
    "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation: MFA is an effective way to strengthen the security of a company's login systems, but implementation can be complex. One potential issue is the high cost of licensing and managing MFA solutions. Additionally, some employees may find it cumbersome to use, leading to a negative user experience. To overcome this, the cyber security solution should include comprehensive MFA implementation to protect against password attacks and ensure that it is affordable, user-friendly, and integrated into existing systems.",
    "Insider Threats: A potential problem in multinational companies is the risk of insider threats. These are individuals within the company who have access to sensitive information and can misuse it. To address this, the cyber security solution should include monitoring and detection features that can detect unusual activity and alert the security team. Additionally, access control measures should be implemented to limit the amount of sensitive information that employees can access based on their job roles and responsibilities.",
    "Cyber-Attacks and Ransomware: Multinational companies are often targets for cyber-attacks and ransomware. These attacks can cause significant damage to the company's operations and reputation. To address this, the cyber security solution should include robust anti-virus and anti-malware protection, real-time threat intelligence, and incident response plans to minimize the impact of an attack and ensure a quick recovery.",
    "Compatibility and Integration: A potential problem is ensuring that the cyber security solution is compatible with existing systems and applications. This requires careful planning and testing to avoid disruptions to the company's operations. Additionally, the solution must integrate seamlessly with existing security systems and be able to work with a variety of devices and platforms."
