    "Design an underwater robot that can withstand extreme pressures and temperatures, and collect data on marine life, ocean currents, and geological features. The robot could be controlled remotely by a team on land or aboard another vessel, and its findings could be transmitted back to shore for analysis.",
    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the depths of the ocean in a safe and immersive way. Users could wear VR headsets and navigate through virtual coral reefs, encounter exotic sea creatures, and learn about the mysteries of the deep sea.",
    "Develop a new type of underwater camera that can capture high-quality images and videos of marine life in real-time. This camera could be used by scientists, researchers, and filmmakers to document the beauty and diversity of our oceans.",
    "Create a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to identify different species of marine animals based on their photos. Users could take pictures of fish, whales, dolphins, and other creatures they see while snorkeling or scuba diving, and the app would provide information on their identity, habitat, and behavior.",
    "Design a portable laboratory that can be set up in the middle of the ocean to conduct scientific experiments. This lab could include equipment for measuring water temperature, salinity, and acidity levels, as well as tools for collecting samples of marine organisms and analyzing their DNA. By conducting research in the field, scientists could gain valuable insights into the health of our oceans and the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems."
