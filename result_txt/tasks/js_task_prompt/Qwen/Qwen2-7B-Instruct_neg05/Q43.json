    "**Crime Prevention and Detection**: You could use your ability to see through walls as a crime prevention tool. For example, while on patrol or during surveillance operations, you could detect suspicious activity behind closed doors or in secluded areas that might be hidden from regular view. This could include illegal activities like drug dealing, unauthorized gatherings, or even potential threats against individuals.",
    "**Emergency Response and Rescue Operations**: In situations where time is of the essence, such as natural disasters or building collapses, being able to see through walls could help locate survivors trapped inside. Emergency responders could use this power to quickly identify where people are stuck or trapped, allowing for faster and more effective rescue efforts.",
    "**Architecture and Urban Planning**: Architects and urban planners could benefit from this ability by being able to visualize interior spaces without physically entering them. This would allow for better space utilization, improved designs, and potentially reduce construction costs by minimizing the need for extensive exploratory work.",
    "**Property Inspection and Maintenance**: Real estate agents, property managers, and home inspectors could leverage this power to thoroughly inspect buildings for structural issues, water damage, or other potential problems without having to tear down walls or floors. This would save time and money, providing clients with a more accurate assessment of property conditions.",
    "**Educational and Research Purposes**: Scientists and educators could utilize this ability for various research and teaching purposes. For instance, in biology, researchers could study internal organs or cellular structures without invasive procedures. In education, students could learn about the anatomy of buildings or understand the layout of historical sites without physical access. Additionally, this could also aid in forensic investigations, helping to reconstruct crime scenes or analyze past events within a building."
