    "Time Travel: Humans could use their ability to change their biological age to travel through time, visiting different eras and experiencing historical events firsthand. This could be achieved by slowing down or speeding up their biological aging process, allowing them to live longer or shorter lives depending on their destination.",
    "Age-Based Social Hierarchy: In a world where humans can change their biological age at will, a new social hierarchy based on age could emerge. Those who are younger and more energetic could hold positions of power and influence, while those who are older and wiser could serve as mentors and advisors.",
    "Age-Based Skill Acquisition: With the ability to change their biological age, humans could potentially acquire new skills and abilities at any point in their lives. For example, a 40-year-old person could suddenly become physically stronger and more agile, allowing them to excel in sports or other physical activities.",
