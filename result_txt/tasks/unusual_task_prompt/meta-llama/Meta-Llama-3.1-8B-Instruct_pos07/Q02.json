    "**Mirrored Reality**: In this immersive experience, participants are given a mirror reflection of their own hand, but with a twist. The reflected hand is made of a rubber material that can be manipulated and molded to create an uncanny sense of disorientation. The participant's own hand is then placed in a position where it appears to be attached to the rubber hand, creating a sense of detachment from their own body. This experience challenges the concept of self-perception and blurs the lines between reality and illusion.",
    "**Tactile Telepresence**: This installation uses a combination of tactile sensors, robotic arms, and a virtual reality system to create a sense of telepresence. Participants wear a VR headset and are presented with a virtual environment where they can interact with virtual objects using their own hands. However, the twist lies in the fact that their physical hands are being manipulated by robotic arms, which are controlled by the participant's brain activity. This experience explores the intersection of physical and digital reality, allowing participants to transcend their physical presence.",
    "**Handmade Universe**: In this interactive installation, participants are given a set of rubber hands with different textures, colors, and shapes. As they manipulate the rubber hands, they create a unique, three-dimensional representation of their own universe. The installation uses AI-powered algorithms to generate a corresponding digital representation of the participant's hand movements, creating a mesmerizing display of color and light. This experience delves into the relationship between human creativity and the digital world.",
    "**The Disappearing Act**: This performance piece features a participant who is given a set of rubber hands with a hidden compartment. As the participant manipulates the rubber hands, they begin to disappear, one by one, leaving behind a trail of invisible threads. The audience is left wondering what is real and what is not, as the participant's physical presence seems to be dissolving into thin air. This experience explores the concept of identity and the fragility of human connection.",
    "**Hand in Hand**: In this collaborative installation, participants are paired with a \"partner\" who is actually a robotic arm with a rubber hand attached. As the participants interact with their partner, they create a synchronized dance of hand movements, generating a mesmerizing display of light and sound. However, the twist lies in the fact that the partner is actually a machine, and the participants are unaware of this until the end of the experience. This experience explores the themes of trust, communication, and the blurring of boundaries between human and machine"
