    "New Sports and Recreational Activities: The ability to fly would open up new opportunities for sports and recreational activities. People could participate in aerial sports, such as flying races or freestyle aerial acrobatics. It could also lead to the development of new sports that combine elements of flying and traditional sports.",
    "Environmental Impact: The increased number of people flying could have a significant impact on the environment. The increased use of personal flight devices would likely lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Governments would need to implement regulations to mitigate the environmental impact of personal flight.",
    "Impact on Education and Work: The ability to fly would change the way people commute to work or school. People could choose to fly to work or school instead of using traditional methods of transportation, such as cars or public transport. This could lead to changes in the way people live and work, as well as changes in the way education is delivered.",
    "Economic Impact: The ability to fly would likely lead to a new industry of personal flight devices and related services, such as flight training and maintenance.
