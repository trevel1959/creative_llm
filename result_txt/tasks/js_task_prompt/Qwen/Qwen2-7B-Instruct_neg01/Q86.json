    "**Underwater City**: Imagine a new underwater city that's built within a large, naturally-occurring cavern in the ocean floor, accessible through an artificial tunnel from the surface. The city would feature glass domes for housing, restaurants, and even shopping areas, providing breathtaking views of the marine life outside. It would incorporate sustainable technologies, like solar panels on the surface dome and water recycling systems to minimize environmental impact.",
    "**Sky-Sailing Gondolas**: A series of large, floating gondolas that can be used as both a tourist attraction and a form of public transportation. These gondolas are powered by clean energy sources such as wind or solar power. They would sail through the clouds, offering panoramic views of the world below. The gondolas themselves could be designed with transparent domes to provide an immersive experience.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lighthouse**: Rather than a traditional lighthouse, imagine a modern structure that harnesses the power of the sun. This lighthouse could have a unique shape, perhaps a spiral design that maximizes its exposure to sunlight. It would not only serve as a beacon but also as a symbol of renewable energy and progress. ",
    "**Living Library**: This concept combines a traditional library with a living space where people can interact with books and stories. Think of it as a giant, interactive bookshelf that contains actual human experts who embody the knowledge of the texts they're associated with. For example, someone might embody the character of Sherlock Holmes, helping patrons solve mysteries using historical techniques and methods.",
    "**Eco-Park**: An eco-park built around the principles of sustainability, conservation, and education. It would include various habitats, such as a rainforest area, a desert zone, and a wetland, each showcasing native flora and fauna. The park would educate visitors about environmental issues, offer hands-on learning experiences, and provide a space for scientific research. It could also include innovative green technologies, like vertical gardens and solar-powered facilities, demonstrating how to live in harmony with nature."
