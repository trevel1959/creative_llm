    "**\"The Task Tamer\"**: Develop a mobile app that helps users break down their tasks into manageable chunks, set realistic deadlines, and track progress. The app could include features like a \"task buddy\" system, where users can share their progress with friends or colleagues, fostering a sense of accountability and community. This would help users stay motivated and see the bigger picture, reducing feelings of jealousy and competition.",
    "**\"The Envy Engine\"**: Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to step into the shoes of someone who has accomplished a task or achieved a goal. This could be done through a guided meditation or a simulated scenario, where users can feel the emotions and sensations of success. By experiencing the thrill of accomplishment firsthand, users might shift their focus from envy to inspiration and motivation.",
    "**\"The Task Thermometer\"**: Design a physical or digital tool that visualizes the progress of a task, using a thermometer-like design. As users complete tasks, the thermometer would fill up, providing a tangible representation of their accomplishments. This would help users see their progress and feel a sense of accomplishment, reducing feelings of jealousy and inadequacy.",
    "**\"The Success Swap\"**: Develop a social platform where users can share their stories of overcoming obstacles and achieving goals. The platform would allow users to swap stories with others who have faced similar challenges, creating a sense of solidarity and community. By sharing and hearing others' stories, users might gain new insights and perspectives, shifting their focus from envy to empathy and understanding.",
    "**\"The Task Treasure Hunt\"**: Create a gamified experience that turns tasks into a treasure hunt. Users would receive a series of clues and challenges that lead them to complete tasks and achieve goals. As users progress, they'd uncover hidden \"treasures\" – rewards, recognition, or privileges – that motivate them to keep going. This would help users see tasks as exciting adventures rather than tedious chores, reducing feelings of jealousy and increasing a sense of accomplishment. </s> [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/"
