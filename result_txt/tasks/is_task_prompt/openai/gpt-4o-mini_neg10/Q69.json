At school, he loved reading aloud, savoring the rich notes of “adventure” and the zing of “friendship.” However, not all words were delicious. “Bully” left a rancid aftertaste, and “failure” was a dry, dusty sensation.

The crowd gasped as the air filled with the delightful taste of strawberry and cream, transforming the atmosphere into one of joy.",
