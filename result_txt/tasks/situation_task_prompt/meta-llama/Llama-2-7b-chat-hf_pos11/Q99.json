    "Use texture: Since colors are no longer available, the texture of an object can be used to distinguish it from others. For instance, rough surfaces like rocks or tree bark would be easier to identify than smooth surfaces like glass or metal. You could also use the texture of different materials like fabric, wood, or plastic.",
    "Shapes and contours: Objects would still have their unique shapes and contours, which could be used to identify them. For example, a rounded shape like a ball would be different from a more angular shape like a chair. You could also use the contours of an object, like the shape of a book or a vase, to tell them apart.",
    "Size and proportions: Even without colors, objects would still have their own unique sizes and proportions. For instance, a small toy car would be distinguishable from a large building by its scale. You could also use the proportions of an object, like the height of a person compared to a tree, to identify it.",
    "Sound: Objects could be identified by the unique sounds they make. For example, a metal object might make a different sound when struck than a wooden object. You could also use the sounds of moving objects, like the rustling of leaves or the chirping of birds, to identify them.",
    "Light and shadow: Even in a black-and-white world, objects would still cast shadows and reflect light differently. For instance, a round object like a ball would cast a round shadow, while a flat object like a book would cast a more irregular shape. You could also use the way objects reflect light to identify them, like the way a mirror reflects light differently than a piece of paper."
