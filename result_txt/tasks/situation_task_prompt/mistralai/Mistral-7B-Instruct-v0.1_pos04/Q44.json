    "Bicycle: One of the most sustainable and eco-friendly ways to travel long distances without a car is by using a bicycle. It's a great way to explore new cities, get some exercise, and enjoy the fresh air. If you don't own a bicycle, you can rent one from a local bike or bike-sharing service.",
    "Train: If all public transport stopped working, trains could still be a viable option for traveling long distances. You can take a train from one city to another, and then use local transportation to get around the destination city.",
    "Bus: Buses are another option for traveling long distances without a car. They are often more affordable than trains and can take you to many different destinations.",
    "Boat: If you live near a body of water, such as a river or a lake, you can consider taking a boat to your destination. This can be a relaxing and scenic way to travel, and you can enjoy the natural beauty of the water along the way.",
    "Walking: If you are physically fit and enjoy walking, you can consider traveling long distances on foot. This can be a great way to get some exercise and explore new places, but it may not be the most practical option for everyone."
