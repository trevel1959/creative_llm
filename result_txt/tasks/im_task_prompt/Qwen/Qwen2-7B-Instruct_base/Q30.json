    "**Integrating Solar Panels with Air Conditioners**: Design an air conditioning system that includes solar panels for energy generation. This system can collect sunlight during the day to power the air conditioner, reducing reliance on grid electricity. The excess energy generated can be stored in batteries for use when the sun is not shining, making the system more self-sufficient and eco-friendly.",
    "**Smart Air Conditioning with Weather Forecast Integration**: Create a smart air conditioning system that adjusts its operation based on real-time weather forecasts. When the forecast predicts hot weather, the air conditioner starts cooling earlier or at a higher capacity. Conversely, during cooler periods, it reduces its operation, saving energy and costs. ",
    "**Air Conditioning Units with Self-Cleaning Filters**: Develop air conditioners equipped with filters that clean themselves periodically. This feature helps maintain optimal performance by removing dust, allergens, and other pollutants, ensuring cleaner air delivery. Additionally, this can reduce maintenance costs and extend the life of the air conditioner.",
    "**Portable Air Conditioning Units with Built-in Humidity Control**: Design compact, portable air conditioners that come with built-in humidity sensors and control mechanisms. These units automatically adjust their operation to maintain a comfortable humidity level, which is particularly beneficial in humid climates where both temperature and humidity control are crucial for comfort.",
    "**Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) Integrated Air Conditioners**: Combine air conditioning with energy recovery ventilation systems. ERVs recover heat and moisture from the outgoing indoor air to pre-heat and dehumidify incoming fresh air. This integrated system ensures efficient temperature control while improving indoor air quality and reducing overall energy consumption."
