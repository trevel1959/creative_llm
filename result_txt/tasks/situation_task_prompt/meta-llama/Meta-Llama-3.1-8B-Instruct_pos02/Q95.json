    "**Inflatable Headrests**: Develop a system of inflatable headrests that can be easily set up and adjusted to provide optimal support for the head. These inflatable headrests could be made of a lightweight, flexible material that can be easily deflated and stored when not in use. They could be designed to fit snugly around the head, providing a comfortable and supportive surface for resting.",
    "**Smartphone-Based Headrest**: Design a smartphone app that uses the phone's camera and sensors to detect the user's head position and adjust a virtual headrest accordingly. This could be achieved through a combination of machine learning algorithms and augmented reality technology. The app could also provide real-time feedback on the user's head position and adjust the virtual headrest to ensure optimal comfort and support.",
    "**3D-Printed Custom Headrests**: Develop a 3D printing technology that can create custom headrests tailored to individual users' head shapes and sizes. This could involve scanning the user's head and creating a digital model that can be used to print a custom headrest. The headrest could be made of a variety of materials, such as soft plastics or foams, to provide optimal comfort and support.",
    "**Adjustable Headrest Straps**: Design a system of adjustable headrest straps that can be easily attached to a chair or bed. These straps could be made of a durable, flexible material that can be adjusted to fit different head sizes and shapes. They could also be designed to provide additional support and stability for users with neck or back pain.",
    "**Gravity-Defying Headrests**: Develop a system of headrests that use advanced materials and engineering to create a weightless, floating experience. This could involve the use of magnetic levitation technology or other innovative materials that can create a sense of weightlessness. The headrests could be designed to provide optimal support and comfort while also creating a unique and futuristic sleeping experience. [/INST] [/INST] "
