    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Design a removable infusion chamber that allows users to add fruits, herbs, or other flavorings to their water. This chamber could have a built-in mesh filter to keep the solid ingredients contained while still allowing their flavors to infuse into the water. Users could switch out different ingredients based on their preferences, encouraging hydration with a fun twist.",
    "**Hydration Reminder System**: Integrate a smart hydration reminder system that syncs with a mobile app. The bottle could have sensors to track how much water is consumed and send notifications to the user’s smartphone when it’s time to drink more. The app could also provide personalized hydration goals based on the user’s activity level, climate, and health needs.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular water bottle that allows users to customize its size and features. The bottle could come with detachable sections that can be added or removed to increase or decrease capacity. Users could also attach compartments for snacks, vitamins, or a small first-aid kit, making it a versatile companion for hiking, workouts, or travel.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Develop a water bottle with a built-in filtration system that allows users to fill it from any water source, including lakes or rivers, and still drink safely. The filter could be replaceable and designed to remove contaminants, heavy metals, and unpleasant tastes. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts and travelers in areas with questionable water quality.",
    "**Interactive Temperature Display**: Equip the bottle with an interactive LED temperature display on the side that shows the current temperature of the liquid inside. This feature could change colors based on the temperature (e.g., blue for cold, red for hot) and could help users avoid burns from hot beverages or ensure their cold drinks stay refreshing."
