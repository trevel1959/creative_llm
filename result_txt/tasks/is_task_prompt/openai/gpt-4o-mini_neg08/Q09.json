    "Once upon a time in the heart of the savanna, there lived a giraffe named Gerald. Unlike his towering friends, Gerald had a short neck, making him the butt of many jokes. He often felt out of place, but he was determined to find his unique strength. One day, a terrible drought struck, and the high trees were stripped bare. Gerald, with his low stature, discovered a hidden grove of lush, green bushes. He invited his friends to feast, proving that sometimes being different is a gift. From that day on, Gerald was celebrated not for his height, but for his big heart.",
