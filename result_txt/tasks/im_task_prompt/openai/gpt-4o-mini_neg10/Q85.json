    "**Modular Bread Box**: Design a bread box with modular compartments that can be rearranged based on the type of bread stored. For example, one section could be for loaves, another for rolls, and another for bagels. Each compartment could have its own humidity control, allowing for optimal storage conditions tailored to each type of bread.",
    "**Bread Box with a Built-in Knife**: Create a bread box that features a retractable, built-in bread knife. The knife could be designed to slide out from the side of the box when needed, making it easy to slice bread right after opening the box. This would eliminate the need for a separate cutting board and knife, making it a more convenient solution for bread lovers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bread Box**: Develop a bread box made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, with a design that promotes air circulation to keep bread fresh longer. It could also include a compost bin at the bottom for stale bread, encouraging users to compost rather than throw it away. This would not only help the environment but also promote a zero-waste lifestyle.",
    "**Interactive Bread Box**: Imagine a bread box that features a touchscreen interface on the lid. Users could input their favorite bread types, and the box would display the optimal storage conditions and lifespan for each type. It could also feature a recipe section where users can browse and save their favorite bread-based recipes, making the bread box a hub of culinary inspiration.",
    "**Aromatic Bread Box**: Create a bread box that incorporates aromatherapy. It could have a compartment for essential oils or herbs that release pleasant scents while keeping the bread fresh. For example, a hint of rosemary or lavender could be added to the storage area, enhancing the sensory experience of opening the box and making the kitchen smell delightful."
