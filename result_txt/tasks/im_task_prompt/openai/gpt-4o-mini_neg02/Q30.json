    "**Air Quality Monitoring**: Incorporate advanced air quality sensors into the air conditioning unit that not only monitor temperature but also detect pollutants, allergens, and humidity levels. The unit could then automatically adjust its settings to improve air quality, providing users with real-time feedback on their indoor environment via a mobile app.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light and automated brushes to clean the evaporator and condenser coils. This would reduce maintenance needs and enhance efficiency, ensuring that the air conditioner operates at peak performance without the need for frequent manual cleaning.",
    "**Energy Recovery Ventilation**: Design an air conditioning unit that incorporates energy recovery ventilation (ERV) technology. This would allow the unit to exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while recovering energy from the outgoing air to pre-condition the incoming air, thereby improving energy efficiency and indoor air quality.",
    "**Personalized Climate Zones**: Create a modular air conditioning system that allows for personalized climate zones within a home. Each zone would have its own temperature and humidity settings, controlled by individual smart thermostats. This would cater to the preferences of different occupants in the same space, enhancing comfort and reducing energy consumption.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refrigerants**: Develop an air conditioning unit that uses eco-friendly, low-global-warming-potential refrigerants. Additionally, the unit could feature a closed-loop system that recycles refrigerants, minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainability."
