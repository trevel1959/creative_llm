    "**Customized Hairbrush**: Create a personalized hairbrush where each bristle is attached to a small LED light. The lights can change colors or patterns according to different music beats or moods. This could be especially appealing for children who might enjoy a fun, interactive way to brush their hair, making it a part of their playtime.",
    "**Heated Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush that has a built-in heating element to help detangle wet hair more easily without causing damage from high heat. This would be particularly useful for individuals with thick or curly hair, as it can reduce the time spent on styling and minimize frizz.",
    "**Wireless Charging Hairbrush**: Combine the convenience of wireless charging technology with a hairbrush. Users could simply place their phone or other devices on the base of the brush to charge while they groom themselves. This not only saves counter space but also ensures that the device stays charged while being used.",
    "**Scented Hairbrush**: Incorporate small, replaceable scent capsules into the handle of the hairbrush. As the user brushes their hair, the scent diffuses, leaving a subtle fragrance behind. This idea can be tailored to different preferences, such as lavender for relaxation, mint for freshness, or vanilla for comfort.",
    "**Voice-Activated Hairbrush**: Integrate voice recognition technology into the hairbrush so users can control its settings through voice commands. For instance, they could request the brush to switch to a gentler mode, turn off the lights (if there are any), or even play music or guided meditation sessions while brushing. This feature adds an extra layer of convenience and personalization to the grooming routine."
