    "**Multi-Tone Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that offers multiple tones and sounds, allowing the rider to choose different alerts based on the situation. For example, a cheerful chime for friendly passing, a more urgent tone for alerting pedestrians, and a melodic tune for leisurely rides. Riders can select their preferred tone through a simple button interface or a mobile app.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bell with LED Lights**: Integrate solar panels into the bell's design to power a set of LED lights that activate when the bell is rung. This dual-functionality serves to enhance visibility while riding in low-light conditions. The lights can flash in different patterns or colors, increasing safety by making the cyclist more noticeable to drivers and pedestrians.",
    "**Personalized Sound Options**: Allow users to upload custom sounds to their bicycle bell through a connected app. This feature could let cyclists choose their favorite tunes, sounds from nature, or even voice messages. Imagine riding through the park with a gentle bird chirping or your favorite song playing as you alert others to your presence.",
    "**Integrated Warning System**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates a small motion sensor to detect when a cyclist is approaching a crowded area or a pedestrian. The bell could automatically activate and ring at a preset volume, ensuring that cyclists alert pedestrians without needing to manually ring the bell, making it more intuitive and safer.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a bicycle bell made from sustainable materials, such as recycled metals or biodegradable plastics. This bell could come with a unique design that highlights its eco-friendly credentials, appealing to environmentally conscious cyclists. Additionally, it could be marketed with a program where a portion of sales goes towards local cycling infrastructure improvements."
