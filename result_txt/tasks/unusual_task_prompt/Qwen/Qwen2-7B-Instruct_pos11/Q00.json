    "**Brick-Making Workshops for Education**: Establish workshops in schools and community centers where participants can learn about the history and techniques involved in brick-making. Include hands-on activities like shaping clay into bricks, firing them in kilns, and learning about the chemistry behind the process. This educational approach not only preserves traditional skills but also sparks interest in science, engineering, and art among young people.",
