    "In a land where dragons soared through fiery skies, there lived a peculiar dragon named Ember. Unlike his kin, Ember feared fire. While others breathed flames and danced through blazing sunsets, he shivered at the thought of flames licking his scales. One day, a fierce wildfire threatened his valley. The other dragons roared and flew high, but Ember, trembling, sought a different path. He used his cunning to redirect a river, creating a barrier against the flames. The other dragons, impressed by his bravery, learned that strength lies not just in fire but in the heart. Ember became a hero, proving that courage can take many forms.",
