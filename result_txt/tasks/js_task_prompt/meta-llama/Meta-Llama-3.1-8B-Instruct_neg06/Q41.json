    "**The Global Time-Out**: Establish a universal \"time-out\" period where all nations, governments, and individuals would pause for 24 hours to reflect on their actions and consider the consequences of their decisions. This would be a time for self-reflection, mediation, and constructive dialogue to resolve conflicts peacefully. During this time, all forms of media, communication, and transportation would be suspended, allowing people to focus on their personal growth and the betterment of the world. This rule would promote empathy, understanding, and cooperation, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and peaceful global community.",
    "**The Gift Economy**: Implement a global system where all resources, skills, and knowledge are shared freely, without the need for monetary transactions.

This rule would foster a sense of community, cooperation, and mutual support, as people would work together to create a more equitable and sustainable world.",
