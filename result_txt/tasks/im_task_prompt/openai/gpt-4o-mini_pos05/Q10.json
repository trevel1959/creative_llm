    "**Self-Cleaning Keyboard**: Integrate a self-cleaning technology into the laptop's keyboard using UV-C light and antimicrobial coatings. The keyboard would have a built-in mechanism that activates at certain intervals to eliminate germs and bacteria, ensuring a hygienic typing experience. This feature would be particularly appealing for users in shared environments or during flu seasons.",
    "**Dynamic Display Adjustment**: Implement a display that can automatically adjust its brightness and color temperature based on the ambient light and time of day. This would not only enhance user comfort but also reduce eye strain during prolonged use. Additionally, incorporating a feature that adjusts the screen to minimize glare and reflections could improve usability in various environments.",
    "**Integrated Virtual Assistant with Holographic Display**: Develop an integrated virtual assistant that uses a holographic display for visual interactions. This assistant could project a 3D interface above the laptop, allowing users to interact with their digital environment in a more immersive way. It could assist with tasks, provide reminders, and even facilitate video calls in a unique format.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Sources**: Create a laptop using sustainable materials such as recycled plastics and biodegradable components. Additionally, incorporate solar panels on the lid to harness solar energy for charging. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in technology.",
    "**Enhanced Battery Life with Graphene Technology**: Utilize graphene-based batteries that offer significantly higher energy density and faster charging times compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. This technology could lead to laptops that last for days on a single charge, reducing the need for frequent charging and making them more suitable for on-the-go professionals."
