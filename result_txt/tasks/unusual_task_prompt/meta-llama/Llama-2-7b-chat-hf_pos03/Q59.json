    "Garden Hose with Built-in Watering Can: Create a garden hose with a built-in watering can feature that allows users to water their plants without having to stop and detach the hose. This innovative design would save time and effort, making it easier for gardeners to water their plants. The watering can could be located at the end of the hose, and the user could simply turn on the water to fill it, then use it to water their plants.",
    "Garden Hose with Automatic Watering System: Develop a garden hose with an automatic watering system that uses sensors to detect when a plant needs water. The hose would be equipped with a small pump and water tank, which would be triggered by the sensors to release water as needed. This would eliminate the need for manual watering, saving time and ensuring that plants receive the right amount of water.",
    "Garden Hose with UV-Blocking Technology: Design a garden hose with UV-blocking technology to protect plants from harmful UV rays.

This innovative hose would block UV rays, ensuring that plants are protected from the sun's harmful effects.",
    "Garden Hose with Adjustable Water Pressure: Create a garden hose with adjustable water pressure, allowing users to customize the water flow to their plants. Some plants require a stronger water flow, while others prefer a gentler flow. This feature would give gardeners more control over their watering, ensuring that their plants receive the right amount of water.",
    "Garden Hose with Integrated Plant Labels: Design a garden hose with integrated plant labels, making it easier for gardeners to identify their plants. The labels could be placed along the length of the hose, providing clear identification of each plant. This feature would save time and reduce confusion, as gardeners would no longer have to search for plant labels or miss label plants."
