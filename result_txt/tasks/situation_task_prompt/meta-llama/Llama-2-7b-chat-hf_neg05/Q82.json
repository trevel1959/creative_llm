    "Gestures and Facial Expressions: In a world without language, people would rely heavily on non-verbal cues like hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey their thoughts and emotions. People could use exaggerated gestures to convey complex ideas or emotions, such as waving their arms wildly to indicate excitement or pointing to their chest to show ownership.",
    "Drawings and Pictures: Visual communication would become more important, and people might use drawings, paintings, or other forms of art to convey their ideas. They could draw pictures to represent objects, actions, or concepts, and use color to convey different emotions or meanings.",
    "Music and Rhythm: Music has been a universal language throughout history, and it could play an even more significant role in a world without language. People could use rhythm, melody, and harmony to convey emotions, ideas, or stories. They could create complex musical compositions to represent abstract concepts or simple melodies to convey basic needs or desires.",
    "Dance and Movement: Similar to gestures and facial expressions, dance could become a primary means of communication. People could use different dance styles, steps, and movements to convey emotions, ideas, or stories. They could use the body to express complex concepts or simple messages, such as swaying their hips to indicate happiness or stomping their feet to show anger.",
    "Touch and Physical Contact: In a world without language, people might rely more heavily on physical contact to communicate. They could use touch to convey emotions, comfort, or support, such as a gentle touch on the arm to show empathy or a firm handshake to indicate confidence. They could also use physical contact to convey more complex ideas, such as a hug to show affection or a pat on the back to offer encouragement."
