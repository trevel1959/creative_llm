    "**Maths Magic Show**: Create a calculator that doubles as a magic show. The calculator's screen displays a math problem, and with a swipe of the user's finger, the solution appears in a puff of smoke (projected by a mini projector). The calculator could also include interactive elements like \"pick a number\" and \"solve the mystery equation\" games.",
    "**Mood Meter**: Develop a calculator that detects the user's emotions through facial recognition and adjusts the display accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling anxious, the calculator's screen could display calming patterns or soothing colors. If the user is feeling excited, the calculator could display vibrant patterns or animations.",
    "**Time Traveler's Companion**: Design a calculator that allows users to input historical events and dates, and then provides them with relevant information and trivia about those events. The calculator could also include a \"time travel\" feature that simulates the experience of traveling through time, complete with sound effects and visuals.",
    "**Personalized Learning Assistant**: Create a calculator that uses AI to assess the user's math skills and provides personalized learning recommendations. The calculator could also include interactive lessons and exercises tailored to the user's learning style and pace.",
    "**Artistic Expression**: Develop a calculator that uses math concepts to generate unique artwork. Users can input parameters like shape, color, and pattern, and the calculator generates a corresponding piece of art. The calculator could also include features like \"generate a random art piece\" or \"create a collaborative art piece with friends.\" [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST"
