    "Use the position of the sun: One idea would be to use the position of the sun to determine the time. By paying attention to the position of the sun in the sky, people could estimate the time of day and schedule their activities accordingly. For example, if the sun is directly overhead at noon, it's probably time for lunch. This method would work best in areas with clear skies and little pollution. Confidence score: 8/10",
    "Use sundials: Another option would be to use sundials to determine the time. Sundials are devices that use the shadow of a vertical stick or object to indicate time. By placing a sundial in a fixed location, people could use it to tell the time throughout the day. This method would work best in areas with consistent sunlight and a clear view of the sky. Confidence score: 9/10",
    "Create a rhythmic system: A third option would be to create a rhythmic system based on the natural rhythms of the body. For example, people could use the cycles of breathing, heartbeats, or other bodily functions to determine the time. This method would require a great deal of discipline and practice, but it could be an interesting and unique way to tell time. Confidence score: 7/10",
    "Use a \"time stick\": A \"time stick\" is a long, thin stick with markings on it that indicate the hours of the day. By holding the stick vertically and observing the position of the markings relative to the sun or other reference points, people could determine the time. This method would work best in areas with clear skies and a fixed reference point for the stick. Confidence score: 8/10",
    "Use a \"time circle\": A \"time circle\" is a circular chart with markings for the hours of the day. By rotating the circle to align with the position of the sun or other reference points, people could determine the time. This method would work best in areas with clear skies and a fixed reference point for the circle. Confidence score: 9/10"
