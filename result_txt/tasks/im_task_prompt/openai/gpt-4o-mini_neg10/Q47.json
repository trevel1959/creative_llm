    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a self-cleaning feature that automatically cleans its own filters and brushes after each use. This could involve a built-in brush system that removes hair and debris from the brushes and a filtration system that can be rinsed or vacuumed out without user intervention, maintaining peak performance without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Create a vacuum cleaner with an eco-friendly mode that utilizes less energy and operates with lower noise levels. This mode would be ideal for nighttime cleaning or for homes with pets and children, ensuring that the vacuum is not disruptive. The design could also include biodegradable bags and recyclable components to minimize environmental impact.",
    "**Modular Design**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out parts for different cleaning tasks. For example, users could change the head for carpet cleaning, hard floors, or upholstery. Additionally, the vacuum could have attachments for specialized tasks, such as a mini vacuum for tight spaces or a mop attachment for hard floors, making it versatile and user-friendly.",
    "**Interactive App Integration**: Introduce a companion app that connects to the vacuum cleaner via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The app could provide real-time cleaning statistics, allow users to set cleaning schedules, and even provide maintenance reminders. Gamification elements, such as rewards for consistent cleaning, could encourage users to maintain a cleaner home while making the process more engaging.",
    "**Air Purifying Feature**: Incorporate an air purifying feature into the vacuum cleaner that not only cleans floors but also filters and purifies the air as it operates. This could be achieved through a HEPA filter and an activated carbon layer that captures allergens, dust, and odors, improving overall air quality in the home while cleaning."
