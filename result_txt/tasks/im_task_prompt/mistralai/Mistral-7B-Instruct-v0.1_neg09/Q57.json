    "A virtual assistant that uses machine learning to anticipate your needs and make suggestions based on your previous behavior with the computer mouse. For example, if you tend to move the mouse to the left corner of the screen when you open a new document, the assistant could automatically move the cursor to that location.",
    "A computer mouse that can be controlled with voice commands. You could say \"move up,\" \"move down,\" \"click,\" \"double-click,\" and \"scroll,\" and the mouse would respond accordingly. This would be particularly useful for people with disabilities or for those who prefer not to use a keyboard or touchpad.",
    "A computer mouse that changes colors based on the application you're using. For example, if you're using a photo editing software, the mouse could turn red to indicate that you're selecting an object, or if you're using a word processing software, it could turn blue to indicate that you're typing. This would make it easier to switch between different applications and keep track of what you're doing.",
    "A computer mouse that has a built-in LED light that can be used as a desk lamp. This would be particularly useful for people who work in dimly lit environments or for those who need to read small text on their computer screen.",
    "A computer mouse that can be used as a remote control for other devices in your home, such as a TV or audio system. This would allow you to control your entire home entertainment system with just one device, making it easier to relax and enjoy your favorite movies and music."
