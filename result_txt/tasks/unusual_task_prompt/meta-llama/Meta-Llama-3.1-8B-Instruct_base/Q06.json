    "**Eco-Friendly Tire Recycling**: Develop a system that collects used tires and recycles them into new products such as playground surfaces, athletic tracks, and even furniture. The process would involve collecting used tires, shredding them into small pieces, and then mixing them with other materials like rubber, sand, and wood chips to create a durable and sustainable product. This not only reduces waste but also provides a unique and eco-friendly solution for playgrounds and athletic facilities.",
    "**Smart Tire Technology**: Design a tire that incorporates advanced sensors and AI to monitor tire pressure, temperature, and wear. This would enable real-time monitoring and alerts for drivers, allowing them to maintain optimal tire pressure, extend tire life, and improve fuel efficiency. The system could also integrate with vehicle computer systems to provide personalized recommendations for tire maintenance and replacement.",
    "**Tire-Based Energy Harvesting**: Develop a tire that can harness kinetic energy generated by vehicle movement and convert it into electrical energy. This could be achieved through the use of piezoelectric materials or electromagnetic induction. The harvested energy could be used to power onboard systems, such as lights, radios, and GPS, reducing the need for batteries and improving overall efficiency.",
    "**Self-Healing Tires**: Create a tire that can repair punctures and damage autonomously using advanced materials and nanotechnology. This could involve the use of microcapsules that release sealant materials when a puncture occurs, or the use of self-healing polymers that can repair cracks and tears. This would significantly reduce the need for tire replacements and improve road safety.",
    "**Tire-Based 3D Printing**: Develop a system that uses recycled tires as a feedstock for 3D printing. The shredded tire material could be mixed with other materials and extruded through a 3D printer to create complex shapes and structures. This could be used to create custom tire molds, car parts, and even architectural features, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.
