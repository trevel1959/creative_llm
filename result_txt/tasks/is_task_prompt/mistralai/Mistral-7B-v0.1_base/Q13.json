    "On the way to the prom my shoes were lost. After a couple days of searching, a good friend found them in a box in her parents' garage.",
    "One day I thought it was fun to dance with my shoes on until I realized that my grandmother had given them to me. I could hear the voices in my shoes, talking to the music. That was the end of dancing on stage.",
    "It was the summer after middle school that I realized my shoes were alive, their feet twitched in my hand, their toes and toes looked as if they were dancing. I didn't know what else to do.",
    "It was my favorite shoes that had the weirdest feet of all, they twisted and twisted, they even seemed to have feet that came out of the ends of the soles that weren't worn out.",
    "The shoes had never been worn out, the feet were twisted and all of them seemed to be dancing. How could I have known?"
