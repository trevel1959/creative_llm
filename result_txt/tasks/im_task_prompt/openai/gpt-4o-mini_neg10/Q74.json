    "**Multi-Functional Watering Can**: Design a watering can that can be transformed into different gardening tools. For instance, it could have detachable parts that convert into a small rake or trowel. This all-in-one tool would save space and reduce the number of items needed in the garden shed, making it easier for gardeners to carry everything they need in one go.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Incorporate a self-watering mechanism that allows the can to draw water from a reservoir in the base. This would keep the water at a consistent level and allow the user to set a timer for automatic watering. This feature would be particularly useful for busy individuals or those who travel frequently.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering System**: Create a watering can with color-coded sections to indicate the amount of water needed for different types of plants. For example, a green section could indicate a standard watering level, while a blue section could represent a deep watering for larger plants. This would help novice gardeners better understand the needs of their plants.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Built-In Grip**: Redesign the watering can to have an ergonomic handle and a textured grip that reduces strain on the wrist and hand. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals with limited strength or arthritis. Additionally, a lightweight, balanced design would make it easier to carry and pour.",
    "**Decorative Planter Integration**: Transform the watering can into a decorative planter that can double as a watering can when needed. By incorporating a removable base, users can plant flowers or herbs in the can itself, and when it's time to water, they can simply fill it up and use it as intended. This would add a stylish touch to home decor while serving a practical purpose."
