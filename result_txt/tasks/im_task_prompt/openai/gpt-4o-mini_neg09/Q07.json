    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Refillable Heads**: Instead of disposable toothbrushes that contribute to plastic waste, create a toothbrush with a durable handle made from sustainable materials, like bamboo or recycled plastics, and interchangeable heads. Users can simply replace the head every few months, significantly reducing waste while maintaining effective cleaning. The packaging could be compostable, and a subscription service could remind users to change their heads regularly.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Introduce a toothbrush that features a UV light compartment within the handle. After brushing, users can place their toothbrush inside the compartment, which will sanitize the bristles using UV light. This innovation can help eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring a cleaner brushing experience and promoting better oral health.",
    "**Multi-Function Toothbrush with Integrated Flosser**: Develop a toothbrush that combines brushing and flossing into one device. The handle could have a retractable flosser that can be easily pulled out when needed. This design would encourage users to floss more regularly, as it removes the barrier of needing to have separate tools, making oral hygiene routines more efficient and effective.",
    "**Toothbrush with Color-Changing Bristles**: Create a toothbrush with bristles that change color based on how well the user is brushing. For instance, the bristles could be blue when clean and turn white when plaque is present, indicating that the area has not been brushed effectively. This visual cue can help users develop better brushing habits and ensure they are maintaining good oral hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Timer and Pressure Sensor**: Design a toothbrush that features a built-in timer to ensure users brush for the recommended two minutes. Additionally, it could include a pressure sensor that vibrates or alerts the user if they are brushing too hard, helping to prevent gum damage. The toothbrush could also connect to an app that tracks brushing duration and pressure over time, offering insights into oral health trends."
