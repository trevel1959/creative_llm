    "**UV-Blocking Hat with a Visor**: After losing all your hair, protecting your head from sunburn is crucial. A UV-blocking hat with an adjustable visor can provide comprehensive coverage. The wide-brimmed visor will shade your face, ears, and neck while the hat itself will cover the top of your head. Look for hats made from tightly woven fabrics like polyester or nylon that are labeled as having UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) protection.",
    "**Reflective Fabric Cap**: Design a cap made from a reflective fabric material. This type of cap not only reflects sunlight away from the head but also keeps the head cool by reflecting heat back into the environment. This innovative solution could be especially useful in hot climates where sunburns can be more severe due to higher temperatures.",
    "**Inflatable Sun Shield**: An inflatable sun shield can be designed to fit over the head like a helmet. It can be inflated when needed to provide immediate protection against sunburn. The shield can be made from a lightweight, durable, and breathable material that blocks UV rays. This idea combines modern technology with traditional sun protection methods.",
    "**Transparent Sunscreen Capsule**: Develop a wearable, transparent capsule that fits around the head and face. This capsule could be made from a flexible, see-through material that allows visibility while providing high UV protection. It could have small vents to ensure proper air circulation, preventing overheating, and could be attached to a helmet or worn alone for maximum flexibility.",
    "**Customized UV-Protective Headwear**: Utilize 3D printing technology to create custom UV-protective headwear that fits perfectly on any head shape. This headwear could be designed with intricate patterns that not only provide UV protection but also add a unique aesthetic appeal. It could be made from biodegradable materials to cater to eco-conscious individuals. Additionally, this headwear could be personalized with designs or logos, making it a fashionable accessory as well as a practical sun protection tool."
