    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Create a paintbrush with a magnetic or snap-on mechanism that allows users to easily switch between different brush heads (e.g., flat, round, filbert, fan) without needing multiple brushes. This would save space and provide artists with the flexibility to change styles on the fly, enhancing creativity during their painting process.",
    "**Built-in Paint Reservoir**: Integrate a small reservoir within the brush handle that can hold a small amount of paint. This would allow artists to paint without constantly dipping their brush into a palette, leading to a more fluid painting experience. The reservoir could have a controlled release mechanism to prevent excess paint from spilling.",
    "**Color-Changing Bristles**: Develop bristles that change color based on the temperature or pressure applied. This feature could help artists gauge the amount of pressure they are using or indicate when the brush is getting too hot from prolonged use. It could also serve as a fun, interactive way to engage with the painting process, adding a visual element to their work.",
    "**Integrated Cleaning System**: Design a paintbrush with a built-in cleaning mechanism, such as a small reservoir of water or cleaning solution that can be activated with a button. When pressed, it would release the cleaning fluid through the bristles, allowing artists to quickly clean their brush between color changes without needing a separate container.",
    "**Smart Brush Technology**: Incorporate sensors into the brush that can connect to an app on the artist's smartphone or tablet. This app could provide real-time feedback on brush strokes, suggest techniques based on the user's style, or even offer tutorials. The brush could track usage patterns and recommend the best brush types for specific projects or mediums."
