    "Smart Car Keys: Develop a smart car key system that can be controlled through a smartphone app. The app can remotely start the car, lock and unlock the doors, and even track the location of the car. This would be particularly useful for people who frequently forget where they left their keys or need to share access to their car with others.",
    "Keyless Car Entry: Develop a car entry system that uses a keyless entry mechanism, such as a fingerprint scanner or a retinal scanner, to unlock the doors. This would be particularly useful for people who have difficulty remembering to carry their keys or have lost their keys.",
    "Car Key Finder: Develop a device that can be attached to the key fob or keychain to help people find their car keys. The device could use GPS or Bluetooth technology to track the location of the keys and provide real-time updates on their whereabouts.",
    "Car Key Wallet: Develop a smart wallet that can store multiple car keys, as well as other important items such as ID, credit cards, and cash. The wallet could be equipped with a touch screen or other interface to make it easy to access the keys and other items.",
    "Car Key Converter: Develop a device that can convert a traditional car key into a smart key that can be used with a smartphone app or other smart devices. This would be particularly useful for people who have an older car that does not have a smart key system."
