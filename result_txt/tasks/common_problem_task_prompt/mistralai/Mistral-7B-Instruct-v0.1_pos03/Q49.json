    "\"Smart\" Contact Lenses: Develop a pair of contact lenses that can monitor your health, track your movements, and provide augmented reality information. The lenses would use sensors to gather data about your heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels, and send it to a mobile app. They could also provide real-time information about the environment, such as directions, weather, and sports scores.",
    "\"Smart\" Clothing: Create a line of clothing that is equipped with sensors and technology to improve your daily life. For example, a shirt could monitor your heart rate and blood pressure, and send alerts to your phone if there are any abnormalities. A pair of pants could use sensors to track your movements and provide feedback on your posture and balance.",
    "\"Smart\" Home Automation: Develop a system that allows you to control your home's lighting, temperature, and security from your phone. The system would use machine learning algorithms to learn your preferences and habits, and adjust the settings accordingly. It could also use facial recognition technology to unlock doors and turn on lights when you enter a room.",
    "\"Smart\" Personal Shopping: Create an app that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend products based on your preferences and purchase history.
