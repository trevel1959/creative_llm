    "**Nature Navigation**: I would rely on nature to guide me. I would observe the position of the sun, stars, and constellations to estimate direction. I would also use landmarks like mountains, rivers, and coastlines to navigate. For example, if I'm near a mountain range, I would follow the direction of the mountains to find my way.",
    "**Dead Reckoning**: I would use dead reckoning, a method of navigation that involves tracking the distance and direction traveled from a known starting point. I would use a makeshift compass made from a magnetized needle and a piece of cork to estimate direction. I would also use my knowledge of the terrain to estimate the distance traveled.",
    "**Map Drawing**: I would create my own map of the area by drawing a sketch of the terrain, including notable features like roads, rivers, and buildings. I would use this map to navigate and update it as I move through the area.",
    "**Human Network**: I would rely on the help of other people to navigate. I would ask locals for directions and use their knowledge of the area to find my way. I would also use my own social network to ask for help and guidance.",
    "**Observation of Animal Behavior**: I would observe the behavior of animals like birds, squirrels, and deer to navigate. For example, birds often fly in a specific direction to find food, and squirrels often follow the same paths to forage for nuts. By observing their behavior, I could estimate the direction of food sources, water, and other important resources."
