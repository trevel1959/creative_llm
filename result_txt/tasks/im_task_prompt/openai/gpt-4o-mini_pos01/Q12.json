    "**Modular Wallet System**: Design a wallet that consists of interchangeable modules. Users can customize their wallet according to their needsâ€”adding or removing sections for cards, cash, coins, or even a mini battery pack for charging devices on the go. This would cater to different preferences and usage scenarios, making the wallet adaptable and personal.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a wallet made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics, organic cotton, or vegan leather. This wallet could also incorporate a biodegradable feature, ensuring that when it reaches the end of its life, it can decompose without harming the environment. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "**Integrated Payment System**: Develop a wallet that includes a digital payment system, like a built-in NFC chip, allowing users to make contactless payments directly from their wallet. This could streamline transactions, eliminating the need for a separate phone or card. Users could link their bank accounts or digital wallets to this feature for convenience.",
    "**RFID-Blocking Technology**: Enhance the wallet with advanced RFID-blocking technology to protect against electronic pickpocketing. This would ensure that sensitive information on credit cards and IDs is safe from unauthorized scanning. A unique design element could be a stylish RFID-blocking layer that also adds to the wallet's aesthetic appeal.",
    "**Wallet with Built-in Tracker**: Incorporate a small GPS tracker into the wallet that connects to a smartphone app. This would allow users to track their wallet's location if lost or stolen. The app could also provide reminders for checking the wallet before leaving places, ensuring that users never forget it behind."
