    "**DNA Verification**: In the absence of traditional forms of identification, DNA could serve as a unique identifier for an individual. A national or global database could be established to store genetic profiles of citizens. When needed, a sample could be taken from a person, their DNA extracted, and compared against the database to verify their identity.",
    "**Unique Fingerprints and Iris Scans**: Every person has unique fingerprints and iris patterns. These can be used as digital identifiers that can be stored in secure databases. When someone needs to prove their identity, they can present their finger or eye to a scanner which would compare the scan to the records in the database.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: This involves analyzing human behavior such as typing patterns, voice recognition, and gait analysis. Each person's unique way of moving, speaking, or typing can be recorded and stored as a form of identification. When needed, these behaviors can be matched against the stored data to verify identity.",
    "**Personalized Puzzles**: Each individual is given a unique puzzle that they must solve to prove their identity. The puzzles could be complex enough to be challenging but simple enough to be solved by the individual in question. The solutions could be kept on file, and when needed, individuals would have to provide the solution to confirm their identity.",
    "**Physical Characteristics Verification**: Certain physical characteristics like height, weight, hair color, and facial features can be used as unique identifiers. These could be recorded and cross-referenced in a database. When needed, an officer could visually inspect the person and compare them to the database to verify their identity. "
