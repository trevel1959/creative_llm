    "**Wish for World Peace and Unity**: I would grant the wish of everyone on Earth to experience peace and unity. This idea is inspired by the desire for global harmony, understanding, and cooperation that has been a universal aspiration throughout history. By granting this wish, conflicts would cease, cultural barriers would break down, and humanity could focus on collective growth, innovation, and prosperity. It's a transformative wish that could lead to a more equitable and just world.",
    "**Global Access to Clean Water**: My wish would be to ensure that every person in the world has access to clean water. This is crucial because access to clean water is fundamental to health, sanitation, and economic development. By making this wish come true, millions of lives could be saved from waterborne diseases, children would have more time for education instead of fetching water, and communities would become more resilient and sustainable.",
    "**Universal Education for All**: I would wish for every individual on Earth to receive free, high-quality education from primary school through university. This idea aims to level the playing field for all, giving everyone an equal opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to society. Universal education would foster critical thinking, creativity, and empathy, leading to a more informed and compassionate global community.",
    "**End of Extreme Poverty**: My fourth wish is to eradicate extreme poverty worldwide. This ambitious goal would involve lifting billions out of poverty, ensuring they have access to basic necessities like food, shelter, healthcare, and education. By addressing the root causes of poverty, such as lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and social inequality, societies could thrive, and people could focus on personal and communal development rather than survival.",
    "**Sustainable Energy for Everyone**: Lastly, I would wish for every country to have access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy sources. This would help combat climate change, reduce pollution, and ensure energy security for all. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can mitigate environmental degradation, promote green jobs, and foster sustainable economic growth, ultimately benefiting both current and future generations."
