    "\"Subterra\": A high-speed underground transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tunnels to reduce air resistance and enable vehicles to reach incredible speeds. Subterra would be powered by advanced magnetic levitation technology, allowing for smooth and quiet travel. The system would be designed with safety features such as emergency exits, air purification systems, and communication devices to ensure the comfort and safety of passengers.",
    "\"Gravimove\": A transportation system that utilizes gravitational forces to move vehicles along tracks. Gravimove would consist of specially designed vehicles that can be propelled by gravitational fields, eliminating the need for engines or batteries. The tracks would be elevated above the ground, allowing for seamless integration with existing infrastructure.",
    "\"OceanBike\": A hybrid transportation system that combines elements of biking and sailing. OceanBike would use a specially designed bike that can be converted into a sailboat. The rider would pedal to generate power for the sail, allowing them to navigate through both water and air. The bike would be equipped with advanced navigation systems and safety features to ensure safe and efficient travel.",
    "\"AirWheels\": A transportation system that uses inflatable, air-powered wheels to move vehicles across various terrains. AirWheels would consist of large, inflatable wheels that can be inflated and deflated as needed, allowing for smooth movement on land, water, and even ice. The system would be powered by a compact, lightweight battery that could be recharged in minutes.",
    "\"MagneticLoop\": A transportation system that uses magnetic fields to move vehicles along a continuous loop. MagneticLoop would consist of specially designed vehicles that can be propelled by magnetic fields, eliminating the need for engines or batteries. The tracks would be elevated above the ground, allowing for seamless integration with existing infrastructure."
