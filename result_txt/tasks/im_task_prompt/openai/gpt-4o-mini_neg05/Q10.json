    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Incorporate solar panels into the laptop’s casing to provide an additional power source. This would allow users to charge their laptops while on the go, especially in outdoor settings or during travel. The solar panels could be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and lightweight, ensuring they don’t compromise the laptop’s portability or style.",
    "**AI-Powered Performance Optimization**: Develop an AI assistant integrated into the laptop’s operating system that learns the user’s habits and optimizes performance accordingly. For example, it could manage background processes, allocate resources based on usage patterns, and even suggest app removals or upgrades to enhance efficiency. This would ensure that the laptop runs smoothly and meets the user’s specific needs over time.",
    "**Adaptive Display Technology**: Implement a display that can adjust its color temperature and brightness based on the ambient lighting and the time of day. This feature would reduce eye strain and improve user comfort, especially during long working hours. Additionally, the display could include a blue light filter that activates during night hours to promote better sleep hygiene.",
    "**Holographic Interface Option**: Introduce a holographic projection feature that allows users to interact with their laptop through a 3D interface. This could be especially useful for creative professionals, such as designers and architects, who could manipulate 3D models more intuitively. The holographic interface could also support gesture controls, allowing for a more immersive and futuristic user experience.",
    "**Enhanced Security Features**: Develop a biometric security system that goes beyond fingerprint scanning. This could include facial recognition combined with an iris scan for multi-factor authentication. Additionally, the laptop could have a built-in physical shutter for the webcam and a hardware kill switch that disables all microphones and cameras, ensuring user privacy and security."
