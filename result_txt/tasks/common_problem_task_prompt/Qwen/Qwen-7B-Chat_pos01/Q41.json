    "\"Solar Sails\": A solar sail is a spacecraft that uses sunlight to propel itself through space. The sails are made of lightweight materials like Mylar or Kevlar, and they are covered in reflective coatings that capture the sun's rays. As the ship moves closer to the sun, the pressure on the sails increases, causing them to expand and push the ship forward. This idea has a high potential for sustainability and low cost, but it requires careful engineering to ensure safe and efficient operation.",
    "\"Hybrid Propulsion System\": A hybrid propulsion system combines traditional chemical engines with advanced technologies like electric motors or nuclear reactors. This approach can provide faster acceleration and higher fuel efficiency than traditional systems, while also reducing emissions and environmental impact. However, developing such a system requires significant investment in research and development, as well as regulatory approval.",
    "\"Artificial Gravity\": Creating artificial gravity on a spaceship could improve the health and wellbeing of astronauts during long-duration missions. One possible solution is to use centrifugal force to create a rotating environment around the ship. This would simulate the experience of being weightless, while also providing a sense of orientation and stability. However, this technology is still in the experimental stage and requires further testing before it can be used on commercial flights.",
    "\"Inflatable Habitat\": An inflatable habitat is a modular structure that can be deployed in space and expanded as needed. It is made of lightweight materials like nylon or polyethylene, and it can be easily packed and transported to orbit. Once deployed, the habitat can be inflated using pressurized air or helium, and it can be equipped with everything necessary for life support and scientific experiments. This approach offers many benefits over traditional rigid structures, including flexibility, adaptability, and reduced launch costs.",
    "\"Mars Base\": Designing a self-sustaining base on Mars is one of the most challenging and exciting challenges facing humanity today. A Mars base would require a combination of advanced technologies, including nuclear power, water recycling, and food production. It would also need to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and dust storms. While there are many technical hurdles to overcome, designing a Mars base could pave the way for future human exploration of the red planet and beyond. Confidence score: 9/10"
