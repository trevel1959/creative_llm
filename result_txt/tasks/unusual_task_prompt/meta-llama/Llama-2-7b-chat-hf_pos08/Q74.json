    "Virtual Reality Steering Wheel: Develop a virtual reality steering wheel that allows drivers to experience a realistic driving experience from the comfort of their own homes. The wheel could be connected to a VR headset, providing a fully immersive experience, complete with realistic sounds, vibrations, and even scents. This could be particularly useful for people who are unable to drive in real life, such as those with disabilities or those who live in areas with heavy traffic.",
    "Steering Wheel for the Elderly: Design a specialized steering wheel for the elderly that is easier to grip and use. The wheel could have larger buttons and a more ergonomic design to make it easier for older adults to operate. Additionally, the wheel could be equipped with sensors that detect when the driver is becoming fatigued and provide gentle reminders to take a break. This could help to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents caused by driver fatigue.",
    "Smart Steering Wheel: Develop a smart steering wheel that can detect and respond to a driver's emotions. The wheel could be equipped with sensors that monitor the driver's heart rate, facial expressions, and other physiological signals. If the driver is feeling stressed or anxious, the wheel could provide calming messages or music to help relax them. This could help to improve driver safety and well-being, particularly in heavy traffic or stressful driving conditions.",
    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Navigation: Create a steering wheel that includes built-in navigation, eliminating the need for a separate GPS device. The wheel could be equipped with a high-resolution touchscreen display and advanced GPS technology, providing drivers with real-time traffic updates, turn-by-turn directions, and other navigation information. This could be particularly useful for long road trips or unfamiliar areas, where it can be difficult to navigate without a GPS device.",
    "Adjustable Steering Wheel: Design a steering wheel that can be adjusted to fit the driver's body and preferences. The wheel could be made of a flexible, ergonomic material that can be molded to fit the driver's hand size and shape. Additionally, the wheel could include adjustable buttons and controls, allowing the driver to customize the wheel to their liking"
