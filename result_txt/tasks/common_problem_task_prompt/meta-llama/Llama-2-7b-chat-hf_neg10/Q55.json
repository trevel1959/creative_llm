    "Inadequate funding: Establishing a nature conservation park requires significant investment in infrastructure, including roads, trails, and facilities. Without sufficient funding, the park may not be able to provide adequate facilities for visitors, which can lead to dissatisfaction and negatively impact the park's reputation.",
    "Conflicts with local communities: Establishing a nature conservation park in an area inhabited by local communities can lead to conflicts over land use and ownership. If not managed properly, these conflicts can escalate and harm the park's reputation and the environment.",
    "Degradation of the ecosystem: Establishing a nature conservation park can lead to unintended consequences, such as habitat destruction or disruption of the ecosystem. This can occur if the park management does not take into account the park's ecological dynamics and the impact of their actions on the environment.",
    "Inadequate waste management: Establishing a nature conservation park can generate significant waste, including plastic, food waste, and other materials. If not managed properly, this waste can harm the environment and negatively impact the park's reputation.",
    "Climate change impacts: Climate change can have significant impacts on the environment and ecosystems, including increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels. These impacts can affect the park's biodiversity and ecological balance, and may require adaptive management strategies."
