    "**Eco-Friendly Stapler with Recycled Materials**: Develop a stapler made entirely from recycled materials, such as repurposed plastics and metals. This stapler could also feature biodegradable staples made from plant-based materials, reducing plastic waste. To further enhance its eco-friendliness, the stapler could come with a refillable staple cartridge system, encouraging users to reduce single-use products and promote sustainability in the workplace.",
    "**Ergonomic Stapler with Adjustable Grip**: Create a stapler that features an adjustable grip mechanism, allowing users to customize the handle's width and contour based on their hand size and comfort preferences. This ergonomic design could help reduce strain during prolonged use, making it ideal for individuals who staple frequently, such as teachers or office workers. The stapler could also have a soft-touch coating for added comfort.",
    "**Multi-Function Stapler with Integrated Paper Cutter**: Design a stapler that also functions as a paper cutter. This dual-purpose tool could have a retractable blade that allows users to easily cut paper before stapling, reducing the need for multiple tools on a desk. The stapler could feature a safety lock to ensure that the blade is only exposed when in use, making it safe for schools and home offices.",
    "**Color-Coded Stapler for Document Organization**: Create a line of staplers that come in a variety of colors, each representing a specific category or project. For example, a red stapler could signify urgent documents, while a blue stapler could represent financial reports. This color-coding system would help users quickly identify and organize their paperwork, making it easier to find and manage documents at a glance.",
    "**Wireless Charging Stapler**: Imagine a stapler that can charge wirelessly through a charging pad, eliminating the need for batteries or power cords. This stapler could have a built-in rechargeable battery that powers an LED light for better visibility when stapling in dimly lit areas. Users would simply place the stapler on the charging pad when not in use, ensuring itâ€™s always ready for action."
