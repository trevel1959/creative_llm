    "**Herbal Remedies**: In the absence of medicines, herbal remedies could become essential for treating common colds. Herbs such as echinacea, ginger, and licorice have been traditionally used to boost the immune system, reduce inflammation, and soothe sore throats. These can be brewed into teas or made into tinctures.",
    "**Nutritional Supplementation**: A diet rich in vitamins and minerals like Vitamin C, Zinc, and Vitamin D can significantly help the body fight off infections. Supplementing these nutrients through food or supplements might offer some relief. Foods high in Vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, and broccoli; zinc is abundant in shellfish, red meat, and legumes; and vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight exposure or fortified foods.",
    "**Hydration and Steam Inhalation**: Drinking plenty of fluids can help keep nasal passages moist and ease congestion. Steam inhalation can also help loosen mucus in the airways. Boiling water, adding a few drops of essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint, and inhaling the steam can provide relief.",
    "**Homeopathic Treatments**: Homeopathy, which uses highly diluted substances to stimulate healing, might be another option. For instance, Arnica can be used for pain and inflammation, while Belladonna might be beneficial for severe symptoms of fever and headache. Homeopathic remedies are often taken in pill or liquid form.",
    "**Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Practices**: TCM emphasizes balance and harmony within the body. Techniques like acupuncture, cupping, and massage can help improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost immunity. Herbal teas and decoctions, along with dietary adjustments, are also central to TCM practices for treating colds."
