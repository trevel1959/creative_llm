    "The new type of energy would be called \"Spark Energy\". It would be a clean, renewable energy source that is generated from the kinetic energy of lightning. Spark Energy would be harnessed using specialized turbines that capture the energy released during lightning strikes and convert it into usable electricity. This energy source would be virtually limitless, as lightning strikes occur naturally and frequently around the world.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Mind Energy\". It would be a form of energy that is generated from the mental focus and concentration of individuals. This energy could be harnessed through the use ofovation technology, which measures and captures the brain waves of individuals during meditation or other focused activities. The energy generated could then be used to power devices or even entire cities.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Solar-Wind Energy\". It would be a hybrid energy source that combines the power of solar energy with the power of human focus and concentration. This energy would be generated through the use of specialized solar panels that are designed to capture the energy released during focused meditation or other mental activities. The energy generated could then be used to power devices or even entire cities.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Wave Energy\". It would be a form of energy that is generated from the collective consciousness of individuals. This energy could be harnessed through the use of a global network of meditation centers that are connected through a quantum entanglement device. The energy generated could then be used to power devices or even entire cities.",
    "The new type of energy would be called \"Harmony Energy\". It would be a form of energy that is generated from the power of music and sound. This energy could be harnessed through the use of sound waves that are generated by instruments or even the human voice. The energy generated could then be used to power devices or even entire cities."
