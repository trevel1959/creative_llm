    "**Bioluminescent Insect Traps**: Develop insect traps that harness bioluminescent technology to attract and capture pests. These traps would emit a specific wavelength of light that is irresistible to insects, luring them into a contained area where they could be safely removed or repurposed as a food source for other animals. The bioluminescent aspect would also allow for the traps to be powered by a sustainable energy source, reducing the environmental impact.",
    "**Edible Insect Repellents**: Create a line of edible products that repel insects, such as flavored candies, spices, or even insect-repellent infused honey. These products would be marketed as a sustainable alternative to traditional insecticides, providing a safe and tasty way to keep pests at bay. The idea would be to make the repellents appealing to humans, while also being unappealing to insects.",
    "**Insect-Friendly Urban Planning**: Redesign urban spaces to incorporate insect-friendly features, such as insect hotels, bee gardens, and pollinator-friendly plants. This would not only help to mitigate the pest problem but also create a more sustainable and biodiverse urban environment. The idea would be to create a harmonious coexistence between humans and insects.",
    "**Insect-Based Pest Control**: Develop a line of insect-based pest control products, such as insect-based pesticides or insect-attracting baits. These products would be made from the natural predators of pests, such as ladybugs or lacewings, and would provide a safe and effective way to control pest populations. The idea would be to tap into the natural balance of the ecosystem to solve the pest problem.",
    "**Insect-Tracking Wearables**: Create wearable devices that track and monitor insect populations, providing real-time data on pest activity and movement patterns. These devices would be equipped with sensors that detect insect activity, allowing users to track and respond to pest infestations more effectively. The idea would be to provide a proactive approach to pest management, allowing users to stay one step ahead of the problem.
