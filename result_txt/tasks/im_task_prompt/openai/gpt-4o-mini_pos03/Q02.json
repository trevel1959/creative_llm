    "**Adaptive Suspension Technology**: Develop an adaptive suspension system that automatically adjusts to different terrains. Using sensors to detect the type of surface (e.g., gravel, asphalt, or cobblestones), the bike would alter its suspension settings for optimal comfort and performance. This would enhance the riding experience, especially for those who frequently switch between urban roads and off-road trails.",
    "**Integrated Solar Charging**: Design a bicycle with integrated solar panels on the frame and/or rear fender that can charge a built-in battery. This battery could power LED lights, a GPS tracker, and even charge small devices like smartphones or cycling computers. This sustainable feature would allow cyclists to ride longer without worrying about running out of battery for their electronic devices.",
    "**Modular Accessory System**: Create a modular system for bicycle accessories that allows users to easily swap out components based on their needs. For instance, a user could switch between a cargo rack, a child seat, or a bike-mounted cooler in just a few clicks. This would make the bike more versatile for different activities, whether commuting, shopping, or family outings.",
    "**Personalized Ergonomics**: Introduce a bicycle with customizable ergonomic features, such as adjustable handlebars, seats, and pedal positions that can be fine-tuned based on the rider's body dimensions and preferences. Utilizing 3D scanning technology, the bike could recommend optimal adjustments for comfort and efficiency, catering to riders of all shapes and sizes.",
    "**Augmented Reality Safety Features**: Implement augmented reality (AR) technology into a bike helmet or glasses that provides real-time safety alerts. This could include notifications about approaching vehicles, obstacles, or even directions. By using a heads-up display, cyclists can stay aware of their surroundings without taking their eyes off the road, enhancing safety during rides."
