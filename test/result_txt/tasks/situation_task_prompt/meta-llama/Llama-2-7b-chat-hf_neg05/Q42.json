    "Build a shelter: The first thing I would do is find or create a shelter to protect myself from the elements. I would use natural materials like palm fronds, branches, and rocks to construct a sturdy hut that can provide shade, protection from the wind and rain, and a sense of security. I would also consider building a fire pit in front of the hut to keep warm and cook food.",
    "Find food and water: Being stranded on a deserted island means there is no access to a steady food supply, so I would need to find a way to catch fish and other sea creatures for sustenance. I would use a makeshift fishing net made from vines or seaweed to catch fish and crabs, and gather coconuts and other fruits from the trees for a source of hydration.",
    "Start a fire: Fire is essential for survival on a deserted island, as it provides warmth, light, and a way to cook food. I would gather dry wood and other flammable materials to start a fire, and use it to cook my catch of the day. I would also use the fire to purify water and keep myself warm at night.",
    "Signal for help: Since there is no way to communicate with the outside world, I would need to find a way to signal for help. I would use a combination of natural materials like coconut shells, palm fronds, and rocks to create a makeshift flag or signal fire to alert any passing boats or planes of my presence on the island.",
    "Explore the island: While survival is the top priority, it's also important to explore the island to see what resources it has to offer. I would venture into the jungle to find medicinal plants, and search for fresh water sources like streams or springs. I would also look for signs of other living creatures on the island, like birds or monkeys, to see if they could be a source of companionship or additional resources."
