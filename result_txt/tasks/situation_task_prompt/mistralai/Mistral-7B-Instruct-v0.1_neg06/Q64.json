    "Create a scrapbook or photo album of your memories. Even though photos and paintings may disappear, physical objects can serve as a reminder of past experiences. You can include tickets, souvenirs, and other keepsakes that have special meaning to you.",
    "Keep a list of important dates and events. This can be a helpful way to remember the order of things and to keep track of important milestones in your life.",
