    "Water harvesting from the air: Building structures called fog- or cloud collectors to gather water droplets from the sky. These could be erected in hilly regions, where high elevation and humidity create ideal conditions for this method.",
    "Artificial rain generation: Utilizing large cloud seeding devices that emit silver or dry ice into the atmosphere to encourage cloud formation and increase precipitation in targeted areas. This could be especially beneficial in drought-prone regions.",
    "Underground aquifers: Drilling deep wells to access water stored beneath the Earth's surface. This method is widely used in many parts of the world to access fresh groundwater, and could be expanded to meet growing water demand.",
    "Seawater desalination: Installing large-scale seawater desalination plants to convertsaline ocean water into fresh drinking water. This would provide a reliable and independent source of water, especially in coastal areas with limited rainfall.",
    "Recycling and reusing water: Implementing wastewater treatment facilities that can purify and recycle water from industrial, residential, and agricultural sources. This would reduce the overall demand for fresh water and help in conserving precious resources."
