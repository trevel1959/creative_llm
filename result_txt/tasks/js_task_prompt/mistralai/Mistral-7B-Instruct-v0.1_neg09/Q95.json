    "The first idea for a new animal habitat would be a modular and adaptable structure that can be easily customized to fit the needs of different animal species. This habitat would be made of durable and eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled metal, and would be designed to provide a comfortable and natural living environment for the animals.",
    "The second idea would be a habitat that is specifically designed for rehabilitation and conservation of endangered species. This habitat would include features such as specialized feeding and breeding areas, as well as areas for exercise and enrichment. It would also be equipped with advanced monitoring and tracking technology to help scientists better understand the behavior and needs of these animals.",
    "The third idea would be a habitat that is designed to mimic the natural environment of the animal species as closely as possible. This could include features such as natural vegetation, water sources, and shelter, as well as areas for foraging and hunting. The habitat would be located in a natural setting, such as a forest or grassland, to provide the animals with a truly immersive and authentic living experience.",
    "The fourth idea would be a habitat that is designed to be interactive and engaging for visitors. This could include features such as glass tunnels or underwater windows that allow visitors to observe the animals up close, as well as interactive exhibits and educational materials that help visitors learn more about the animals and their conservation status.",
    "The fifth idea would be a habitat that is designed to be self-sustaining and eco-friendly. This could include features such as solar panels and wind turbines to provide power, rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store water, and composting toilets to reduce waste. The habitat would also be designed to minimize its impact on the local ecosystem, by using native plants and avoiding the introduction of invasive species."
