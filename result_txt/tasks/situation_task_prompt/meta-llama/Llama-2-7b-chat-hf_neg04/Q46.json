    "Personal Waste Management Systems: Develop a personal waste management system that includes a portable, collapsible trash bag holder that can be attached to a belt or backpack. This would allow individuals to carry their waste with them until they can find a designated disposal area.",
    "Community Waste Exchanges: Establish a community-wide waste exchange program where individuals can exchange their waste with others in their area. This could include organic waste, recyclables, and other non-organic waste. This would help to reduce the amount of waste that is produced and increase the amount of waste that is recycled or composted.",
    "Waste-to-Energy Conversion: Develop a technology that can convert waste into energy, such as biofuels or electricity. This would help to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills and provide a sustainable source of energy.",
    "Circular Economy App: Create an app that connects individuals with local businesses and organizations that can accept their waste. The app would allow users to track their waste and find the best places to dispose of it. This would help to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills and increase the amount of waste that is recycled or composted.",
    "Waste-Based Currencies: Implement a system where individuals can earn rewards or discounts for recycling or composting their waste. This could be done through a digital currency or a physical token that can be redeemed for goods or services. This would incentivize individuals to take action to reduce their waste and promote sustainable practices."
