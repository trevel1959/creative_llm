    "Move inland: Another option would be to move inland to higher ground. This could involve relocating cities and towns to areas that are less prone to flooding. This would require significant infrastructure development, such as the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings, but it could be a viable option for certain communities.",
    "Develop flood-resistant buildings: Another solution would be to build structures that are designed to withstand flooding. This could involve constructing buildings with reinforced foundations, walls, and roofs that are designed to protect against water damage. This could be a cost-effective and sustainable solution for certain areas.",
    "Create barriers and dunes: Building barriers and dunes could be another solution to protect coastal areas from rising sea levels. These barriers could be constructed using natural or artificial materials, and they could be designed to absorb the impact of waves and prevent flooding. Dunes could be built using sand or other materials to create a natural barrier that would protect communities from flooding.",
    "Use floating homes: Another option would be to use floating homes, which are houses that are built on a floating platform. These homes could be anchored to the ocean floor or moored to a dock, and they could be designed to be self-sufficient and energy-efficient. This could be a cost-effective and sustainable solution for certain communities.",
    "Develop coastal resilience: Another solution would be to develop coastal resilience, which involves building infrastructure and systems that can withstand the impacts of rising sea levels. This could involve constructing sea walls, dunes, and other barriers to protect communities from flooding, as well as developing early warning systems and emergency plans to help communities prepare for and respond to coastal hazards."
