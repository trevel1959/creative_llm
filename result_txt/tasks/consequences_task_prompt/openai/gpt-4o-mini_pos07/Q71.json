    "**Economic Disruption**: The labor market would face significant upheaval. With people living indefinitely, traditional career trajectories could be disrupted, leading to a stagnation in job openings for younger generations. This could create a societal divide between the older, immortal workforce and the younger, mortal workforce, potentially leading to economic inequality and unrest. Additionally, retirement systems would need to be restructured, as the concept of retirement would be obsolete.",
    "**Philosophical and Ethical Dilemmas**: The discovery of immortality would challenge long-held beliefs about life, death, and the human experience. Philosophers, ethicists, and religious leaders would grapple with questions about the meaning of life and the moral implications of living forever. Would immortality diminish the value of life, or would it enhance it? Debates about the ethical distribution of immortality could arise, leading to potential societal rifts based on who gets access to life-extending technologies.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation**: With individuals living for centuries or even millennia, cultural evolution might slow down. The wisdom and experiences of older generations could lead to a preference for traditional values and ideas, potentially stifling innovation and creativity. The arts, sciences, and social movements might struggle to gain traction as older generations resist change, leading to a homogenization of culture and a lack of fresh perspectives.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The extended lifespan of individuals could lead to increased consumption and environmental degradation. As people live longer, their carbon footprints may grow, contributing to climate change and resource depletion. The pressure on natural ecosystems would intensify, leading to further biodiversity loss and environmental crises. Society would need to find sustainable ways to manage resources to accommodate a growing population living indefinitely.",
    "**Social Stratification**: Access to immortality might not be equal, leading to a new class of \"immortals\" and a marginalized group of \"mortals.\" Wealthy individuals could afford the life-extending treatments, while poorer populations may be left behind, exacerbating existing social inequalities. This could create tensions and divisions within society, leading to potential uprisings or movements advocating for equal access to immortality technologies."
