    "**Global Productivity Crisis**: Without sleep, humans would be unable to recharge and function optimally. This would lead to a significant decrease in productivity, causing widespread disruptions in industries, economies, and societies. People would struggle to focus, make decisions, and complete tasks efficiently, resulting in a global productivity crisis. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Massive Mental Health Epidemic**: The sudden loss of sleep would lead to widespread mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and psychosis. The constant pressure to stay awake would cause immense stress, and people would struggle to cope with the demands of daily life. This would result in a massive mental health epidemic, overwhelming healthcare systems and social services. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Unprecedented Rise in Accidents and Errors**: Without sleep, humans would be more prone to accidents, errors, and reckless behavior. This would lead to a significant increase in traffic accidents, workplace injuries, and medical mistakes. The consequences would be devastating, with far-reaching impacts on individuals, families, and communities. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Global Food and Water Crisis**: As people struggle to cope with the loss of sleep, they would become increasingly irritable, aggressive, and disorganized. This would lead to food shortages, as people would be unable to maintain their usual routines and schedules. Water distribution systems would also be disrupted, exacerbating the crisis. (Confidence: 0.78)",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptation and New Species Emergence**: In the long term, humans might adapt to the loss of sleep by evolving new physiological and behavioral traits. This could lead to the emergence of new species, as the human population undergoes a process of natural selection. The consequences would be profound, with far-reaching impacts on the future of humanity and the planet. (Confidence: 0.92) </s> "
