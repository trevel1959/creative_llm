This could lead to a better understanding of marine ecosystems and the need for conservation efforts.",
    "Science would also be greatly impacted. Without the need for equipment, we would be able to conduct experiments and research in the ocean that would be impossible to do on land. This could lead to new discoveries and breakthroughs in fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics.",
    "In terms of food production, we would be able to farm in the ocean, creating new sources of protein and other nutrients. This could help to alleviate world hunger and reduce the strain on land-based agriculture.",
    "The way we think about our bodies and our health would also be impacted.
