The toothbrush itself would be equipped with sensors to track the user's brushing habits and provide real-time feedback on their technique.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Whitening and Desensitizing Technology**: Design an electric toothbrush that incorporates a small LED light system to whiten teeth and a desensitizing mode to help alleviate tooth sensitivity. The toothbrush would use a combination of blue light and gentle vibrations to break down stains and reduce sensitivity. The desensitizing mode would use a specific frequency of vibrations to stimulate the nerves and reduce sensitivity.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Dental Flossing**: Create an electric toothbrush that comes with a built-in flossing mechanism, allowing users to floss their teeth in a single step. The toothbrush would have a small, rotating flossing head that would be able to remove plaque and food particles from between teeth. The flossing head would be designed to be gentle on gums and would come with different flossing attachments for various types of teeth.",
    "**Toothbrush with AI-Powered Oral Health Analysis**: Develop an electric toothbrush that uses AI to analyze the user's oral health and provide personalized recommendations for improvement. The toothbrush would use machine learning algorithms to detect issues such as plaque buildup, gum disease, and tooth decay. The AI would then provide users with tailored advice on how to improve their oral health, including suggestions for better brushing techniques, dietary changes, and regular check-ups with a dentist.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flossing and Oral Irrigation**: Design an electric toothbrush that combines the benefits of water flossing and oral irrigation.
