    "**Insect Protein Farms**: Create insect protein farms that focus on cultivating nutrient-rich insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers. These insects can be an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins, iron, and zinc. The farming process would be sustainable and environmentally friendly, providing a high-protein food source while also addressing the nutrient gap left by the absence of fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Synthetic Nutrient Drinks**: Innovate a line of synthetic nutrient drinks that mimic the nutritional profiles of various fruits and vegetables. These drinks would be created using advanced food technology to synthesize essential vitamins and minerals in a liquid form. Flavored to taste like popular fruit juices, these drinks could serve as a convenient alternative, ensuring that individuals receive their daily required nutrients without needing traditional produce.",
    "**Vertical Hydroponic Gardens**: Establish vertical hydroponic gardens in urban areas that specialize in growing microgreens and nutrient-dense plants. While not traditional fruits and vegetables, microgreens are packed with vitamins and minerals and can be harvested quickly. These gardens would provide fresh produce alternatives, utilizing limited space and resources, and would serve as community hubs for education on nutrition and sustainability.",
    "**Fortified Food Innovations**: Partner with food scientists to develop fortified staple foods like bread, pasta, and rice that are enriched with essential vitamins and minerals. These foods would be designed to meet the nutritional needs of various populations, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly. By integrating nutrients into commonly consumed foods, it would be easier for individuals to maintain their health without relying on fruits and vegetables.",
    "**Bioengineered Nutrient-Rich Crops**: Invest in bioengineering efforts to create crops that naturally contain higher levels of essential vitamins and minerals. This could include crops like potatoes or corn that are genetically modified to produce enhanced nutrient profiles. These crops could be grown in a variety of environments and would serve as a direct replacement for the nutrients lost with the disappearance of fruits and vegetables."
