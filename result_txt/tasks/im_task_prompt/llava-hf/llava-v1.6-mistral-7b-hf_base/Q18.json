    "Autonomous Driving System: Upgrading the car with advanced sensors, cameras, and computer algorithms can transform it into a self-driving vehicle. This technology will significantly improve safety by minimizing human error and promoting smoother traffic flow. Such a car would also enhance mobility for people who do not have the ability to drive, including the elderly and disabled.",
    "Smart Interiors: Adding a touchscreen interface inside the car can create a more user-friendly and connected experience for the driver and passengers. The interface can offer features like real-time traffic updates, navigation, and even suggestions for routes and destinations based on historical travel patterns.",
    "Aerodynamic Design: Optimizing the car's aerodynamics by adopting advanced wind resistance techniques, such as windshield edge blenders or shark-let design, can significantly improve fuel efficiency and reduce air resistance. This will result in decreased fuel consumption and longer driving distances on a single charge.",
    "Electric Vehicle Conversion: Transforming an existing car into an electric vehicle by replacing its internal combustion engine with an electric motor and battery pack can produce minimal pollution while providing the same practicality as a gas-powered car. This will help reduce air pollution and contribute to a cleaner environment.",
    "Carpooling/Ride-Sharing App Integration: Incorporating a carpooling or ride-sharing app into the car's onboard computer system can encourage carpooling by providing real-time information on nearby riders or drivers. This can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road, leading to less traffic congestion and improved air quality."
