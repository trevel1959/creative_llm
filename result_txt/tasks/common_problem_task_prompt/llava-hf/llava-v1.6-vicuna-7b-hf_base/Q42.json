    "Lack of qualified personnel: Another potential problem is a lack of qualified personnel. Conducting large-scale experiments requires a team of experts with different skills and expertise. If there aren't enough people with the right qualifications, the experiment may not be able to proceed or may not be carried out effectively.",
    "Ethical concerns: Large-scale scientific experiments can raise ethical concerns. Researchers must ensure that the experiments they conduct are ethical and do not cause harm to humans or the environment. If ethical concerns are not addressed, the experiment may be stopped or face legal issues.",
    "Difficulty in obtaining necessary equipment: Conducting large-scale experiments often requires specialized equipment that may not be readily available. Researchers may have to spend a lot of time and resources trying to obtain the necessary equipment, which could delay the experiment or increase costs.",
    "Inexperienced researchers: Inexperienced researchers may struggle with the logistics of conducting a large-scale experiment. They may not have the necessary skills or knowledge to plan and execute the experiment effectively, which could lead to mistakes or delays.",
    "Difficulty in coordinating with other researchers: Large-scale experiments often require collaboration with other researchers or institutions. Coordinating with others can be challenging, and there may be delays or misunderstandings that could impact the experiment's progress."
