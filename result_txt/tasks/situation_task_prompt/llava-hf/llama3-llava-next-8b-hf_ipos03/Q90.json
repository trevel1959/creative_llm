    "Solar-powered water extraction: Create a solar-powered device that uses the heat from the sun to extract water from the ground or soil. This would be especially useful in arid regions or during droughts.",
    "Fog collection: Develop fog collection nets that could be installed in areas prone to fog. These nets would capture fog and condense it into water, which could then be collected and used.",
    "Atmospheric water harvesting: Utilize a technology that harvests water from the atmosphere, similar to the way fog collectors do. This system would be placed on rooftops or buildings and could be used to collect water during dry seasons.",
    "Underground water storage: Build large underground water reservoirs to store water collected from other sources, such as rainwater or snowmelt. These reservoirs could be used to supply water to communities during periods of drought.",
    "Water recycling and reuse: Implement advanced water recycling systems that can extract clean drinking water from wastewater, greywater, or other sources. This would help conserve water and reduce the strain on natural water resources."
