    "**The Color Revolution**: The discovery of a new primary color, which we'll call \"Aurora,\" would send shockwaves throughout the art world, fashion industry, and even the tech sector. Artists would be the first to adapt, using Aurora to create bold, vibrant works that challenge traditional color theory. Fashion designers would incorporate Aurora into their collections, creating statement pieces that become instant trends. Tech companies would develop new display technologies to showcase Aurora's unique properties, leading to innovative applications in gaming, advertising, and entertainment. As people become accustomed to Aurora, it would become a symbol of creativity and progress, inspiring a new era of artistic expression.",
    "**Color Blindness Cure**: The discovery of a new primary color could lead to a breakthrough in understanding color perception and vision. Scientists might develop a new therapy or treatment that allows people with color blindness to see the world in a previously inaccessible spectrum. This could have a profound impact on individuals who struggle with color-related tasks, such as graphic designers, chefs, or pilots. The new color would serve as a key to unlocking the secrets of color vision, paving the way for new treatments and potentially even a cure for color blindness.",
    "**Aurora Energy**: Researchers might discover that the new primary color, Aurora, has unique properties that allow it to harness and store energy. This could lead to the development of sustainable energy sources, such as color-based solar panels or energy-harvesting paints. As people learn to harness the power of Aurora, it could become a game-changer in the fight against climate change, providing a clean and efficient way to generate energy.",
    "**Neurological Insights**: The discovery of a new primary color could reveal new insights into the human brain and its processing of visual information. By studying how the brain responds to Aurora, scientists might gain a deeper understanding of neurological disorders, such as synesthesia or color agnosia. This could lead to the development of new treatments or therapies for these conditions, improving the lives of individuals affected by them.",
    "**Cosmic Connection**: The discovery of a new primary color might be linked to an extraterrestrial source, such as a distant planet or alien civilization. As humans learn to harness and understand Aurora, they could establish a connection with this cosmic entity, leading to a new era of intergalactic"
