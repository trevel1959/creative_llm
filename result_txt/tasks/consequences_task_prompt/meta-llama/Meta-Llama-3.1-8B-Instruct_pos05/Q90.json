    "**Global Economic Rebalancing**: Erasing all world debt would lead to a massive influx of money into the global economy, causing a surge in economic activity. This could result in a global economic rebalancing, where countries that were previously debt-ridden would experience a significant boost in their GDP, while countries that were creditors would see a decrease in their economic influence. This could lead to a shift in global economic power dynamics, with emerging economies potentially surpassing traditional powers.",
    "**Debt Jubilee and Social Unrest**: The sudden erasure of debt could lead to a debt jubilee, where individuals and governments are relieved of their financial burdens. While this might seem like a positive outcome, it could also lead to social unrest, as those who had invested in debt instruments, such as pension funds, might see their investments become worthless. This could lead to widespread protests and potential instability in the financial system.",
    "**Inflation and Monetary Policy Challenges**: Erasing all world debt would result in a massive increase in the money supply, leading to inflation. Central banks would face significant challenges in implementing monetary policy to control inflation, as the sudden increase in money would put upward pressure on prices. This could lead to a period of high inflation, potentially destabilizing the global economy.",
    "**Global Cooperation and New Economic Order**: The erasure of all world debt could lead to a new era of global cooperation, as countries would no longer be burdened by debt obligations. This could lead to increased collaboration on global issues, such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. A new economic order could emerge, where countries prioritize cooperation and mutual benefit over national interests.",
    "**Risk of New Forms of Debt**: The erasure of all world debt could lead to a temporary reprieve, but it could also create a new set of problems. As countries and individuals would no longer be burdened by debt, they might take on new forms of debt, such as unsustainable borrowing or investments in speculative assets. This could lead to a new wave of debt crises, potentially worse than the one that was erased."
