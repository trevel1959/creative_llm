    "**Compartmentalized Trash Can**: Design a trash can with multiple compartments for different types of waste (recyclables, compost, and general waste). Each compartment could have a separate lid that opens based on voice commands or motion sensors. This would encourage users to dispose of their waste correctly and make it easier to manage household waste.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Trash Can**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light and a small amount of biodegradable cleaning solution to sanitize the interior of the trash can regularly. This feature would help eliminate odors and bacteria, making it more hygienic for households, especially those with pets or young children.",
    "**Trash Can with Odor Neutralization**: Integrate a built-in odor neutralization system that uses activated charcoal or a similar material to absorb and eliminate unpleasant smells. Additionally, the trash can could have a small fan that circulates air, ensuring that odors are kept at bay, making it ideal for kitchens or bathrooms.",
    "**Mobile Trash Can**: Create a trash can with wheels and a handle, making it easy to move from one location to another, especially during events or outdoor activities. This would encourage people to keep their surroundings clean by making it more convenient to dispose of trash, whether at home, in parks, or during picnics.",
    "**Trash Can with Incentive Program**: Develop a trash can that tracks the amount of waste disposed of and rewards users with points for proper disposal habits. These points could be redeemed for discounts at local businesses or for eco-friendly products. This gamification approach would encourage responsible waste disposal and recycling habits in communities."
