    "In a mystical forest, there lived a unicorn named Lira, who was unlike any other—she had no horn. While other unicorns pranced with their shimmering horns, Lira felt incomplete. One day, she stumbled upon a hidden glade where a wise old owl revealed that true magic lies within. Inspired, Lira discovered her unique gift: the ability to heal the forest’s creatures with her gentle touch. As she helped a wounded bird and a sickly fawn, the forest flourished, and the other unicorns began to admire her. Lira learned that her worth wasn’t in her appearance but in her kindness and courage.",
