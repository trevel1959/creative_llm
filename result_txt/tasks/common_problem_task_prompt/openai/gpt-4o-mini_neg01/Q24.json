    "**Language Barriers**: If the exchange student is not fluent in the host family's language, this can lead to frustration and isolation for both parties. Miscommunication can occur in everyday conversations, leading to misunderstandings about household rules, schedules, or social activities. To address this, families can use translation apps, encourage the student to practice the language, and consider language exchange activities to foster communication.",
    "**Integration into Family Life**: The foreign exchange student may struggle to integrate into the host family's daily routines and traditions. They might feel like an outsider during family meals or celebrations, leading to feelings of loneliness or homesickness. To help with integration, families can involve the student in planning activities, celebrating their cultural traditions, and encouraging them to share their own customs with the family.",
    "**Academic Pressure**: The exchange student may experience academic pressure to perform well in a new educational system, which can be overwhelming. They might find the curriculum challenging or feel anxious about making friends in school. Host families can support their academic journey by checking in on their schoolwork, helping them with study habits, and encouraging them to join clubs or extracurricular activities to build friendships.",
    "**Homesickness**: Being away from home can lead to intense feelings of homesickness for the exchange student. They may miss their family, friends, and familiar surroundings, which can affect their emotional well-being. Host families can help alleviate homesickness by creating a supportive environment, encouraging regular communication with home, and planning activities that help the student feel more at home in their new surroundings.",
    "**Different Dietary Preferences**: The foreign exchange student may have different dietary restrictions or preferences based on their culture, which could lead to challenges in meal planning. For example, they may be vegetarian, vegan, or have food allergies that the host family is unaware of. To address this, families should have an open conversation about dietary needs and preferences and involve the student in meal preparation to ensure everyone is satisfied."
