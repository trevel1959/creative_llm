    "Use a portable grill: Another option would be to use a portable grill, which you can find at many hardware stores. This would allow you to cook food over an open flame, just like a campfire.",
    "Use a pressure cooker: If you have a pressure cooker, you could use it to cook food quickly and efficiently. This would be especially useful if you need to cook a large meal for a group of people.",
    "Use a slow cooker: If you have a slow cooker, you could use it to cook food slowly and evenly over a long period of time. This would be especially useful if you need to cook a meal that requires a lot of time and attention, such as a stew or soup.",
    "Use a pressure cooker and a slow cooker: If you have both a pressure cooker and a slow cooker, you could use them together to cook a meal quickly and efficiently.
