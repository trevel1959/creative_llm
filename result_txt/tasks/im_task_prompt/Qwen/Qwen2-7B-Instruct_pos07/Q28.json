    "**Inflatable Bicycle Helmet**: Design a bicycle helmet that inflates upon impact to provide additional cushioning and protection. This could be achieved by incorporating small airbags or inflatable chambers within the helmet structure. The inflation process could be triggered automatically through sensors detecting high-speed impacts, or manually via a button if a rider feels they are about to crash.",
    "**Biodegradable Bicycle Helmets**: Develop a helmet made from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics or natural fibers, which can decompose over time. This would significantly reduce the environmental impact of discarded helmets and promote sustainable practices in the cycling community. To ensure safety, these materials would need to undergo rigorous testing to meet or exceed current safety standards.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Augmented Reality (AR) Technology**: Integrate AR technology into the helmet design to provide real-time information to the rider. This could include navigation guidance, speed and distance data, traffic alerts, and even projected virtual road signs. The helmet would feature an integrated display system and use sensors to interpret the rider's environment, enhancing both safety and convenience.",
    "**Heated Bicycle Helmets**: Address the discomfort of cold weather riding with a helmet equipped with built-in heating elements. These could be battery-powered and controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to adjust the temperature based on weather conditions or personal preference. This innovation would make winter cycling more comfortable and accessible.",
    "**Customizable Bicycle Helmets**: Offer a helmet design that allows riders to personalize their protective gear. This could involve a modular system where different components (like visors, colors, or designs) can be swapped out or customized online. Users could choose from a wide range of options to match their style or team colors, promoting a sense of individuality and brand loyalty among cyclists."
