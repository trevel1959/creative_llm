    "Global Transition to Renewable Energy Sources: If the world were to run out of oil, it would be a pressing incentive for nations to transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. This shift would not only address the oil shortage but also help combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and corporations could invest in renewable energy infrastructure, and individuals could make lifestyle changes such as installing solar panels on their homes or purchasing electric vehicles.",
    "Increased Investment in Advanced Energy Technologies: A global oil shortage would likely lead to a surge in investment in advanced energy technologies such as nuclear power, hydrogen fuel cells, and advanced biofuels. These technologies could help mitigate the energy crisis and provide sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Governments and private companies could collaborate to develop and commercialize these technologies, and research grants and funding could be made available to support innovation in the field.",
    "Efficiency and Conservation: With oil becoming scarce, there would be a renewed focus on energy efficiency and conservation. Buildings, homes, and industries could be designed and retrofitted to reduce energy consumption through the use of insulation, efficient lighting and appliances, and smart grid technologies. Individuals could also make conscious choices to reduce their energy usage, such as carpooling, using public transportation, or biking or walking to work.",
    "Alternative Transportation Modes: A global oil shortage would likely lead to a shift away from fossil fuel-based transportation and towards alternative modes such as electric or hybrid vehicles, high-speed rail, and bicycles. Governments could invest in infrastructure to support these alternative modes, such as building out charging stations for electric vehicles or upgrading public transportation systems. Individuals could also choose to purchase electric or hybrid vehicles, or invest in alternative modes of transportation such as bicycles or scooters.",
    "Space Exploration and Mining: In the face of an oil shortage, humanity might turn to space exploration and mining as a means of securing a stable energy supply. NASA and other space agencies could focus on developing technologies to extract resources from asteroids, comets, and"
