    "**Eco-Friendly Cargo Bikes**: In a world where cars have stopped working, cargo bikes become a viable alternative for transporting people and goods over long distances. I would design a fleet of sturdy, electric-assisted cargo bikes with comfortable seating and storage compartments. Each bike would be equipped with a solar panel to charge its batteries, ensuring a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. To make it more efficient, I would create a network of cargo bike routes, with designated bike lanes and rest stops along the way. This would allow people to travel safely and comfortably from one city to another, while also promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.",
    "**Hydrofoil Ferry Network**: With cars no longer an option, I would focus on developing a hydrofoil ferry network that connects cities along coastlines and rivers. Hydrofoils are fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly, making them an ideal solution for long-distance travel. I would design a fleet of sleek, modern hydrofoils with comfortable seating and amenities, such as Wi-Fi and food and beverage services. To make it more convenient, I would create a mobile app that allows passengers to book tickets, track their journey, and receive real-time updates on ferry schedules and routes.",
    "**Solar-Powered Airships**: In a world without cars, airships become a unique and exciting way to travel. I would design a fleet of solar-powered airships that use advanced materials and technology to provide a comfortable and sustainable mode of transportation. Each airship would be equipped with solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced propulsion systems, allowing it to travel long distances without emitting any emissions. To make it more accessible, I would create a network of airship routes that connect major cities, with designated airship terminals and amenities, such as restaurants and lounges.",
    "**High-Speed Maglev Trains**: With cars no longer an option, I would focus on developing a high-speed maglev train network that connects cities across the country. Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to propel trains at incredible speeds, making them an ideal solution for long-distance travel. I would design a fleet of sleek, modern trains with comfortable seating and amenities, such as Wi-Fi and food and beverage services. To make it more convenient, I would create a mobile app that allows passengers to book tickets, track their journey, and receive real-time updates on train schedules and routes.",
