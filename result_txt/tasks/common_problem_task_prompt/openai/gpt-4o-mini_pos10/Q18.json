    "**Food Preservation**: Refrigeration is essential for keeping perishable food items fresh. Without electricity, food spoilage becomes a significant issue. People would need to rely on non-perishable food items or develop alternative preservation methods, such as canning or drying, which require time and effort. Additionally, this could lead to increased food waste if not managed properly.",
    "**Water Supply**: Many modern water systems rely on electric pumps to deliver water to homes. Without electricity, access to clean water could be compromised, leading to hygiene issues and increased risk of waterborne diseases. Residents would need to find alternative water sources, which could involve significant physical labor and planning.",
    "**Heating and Cooling**: Climate control is a significant aspect of modern living. In colder climates, the lack of electric heating can lead to dangerous living conditions during winter months. Conversely, in warmer climates, the absence of air conditioning can result in heat-related illnesses. Individuals would need to find alternative heating sources, such as wood stoves or fireplaces, or learn to adapt their living environment to cope with extreme temperatures.",
    "**Safety and Security**: Without electricity, home security systems, streetlights, and emergency alarms become inoperative. This could lead to increased vulnerability to theft or accidents. Residents would need to develop alternative safety measures, such as neighborhood watch programs or community patrols, to ensure safety and security in their living environment.",
    "**Loss of Entertainment and Leisure Activities**: Modern entertainment options like television, video games, and streaming services rely on electricity. The absence of these forms of entertainment could lead to boredom and a lack of social interaction. People might need to rediscover traditional pastimes, such as board games, storytelling, or outdoor activities, which could foster stronger community bonds but may not provide the same level of engagement for everyone."
