    "Artificial Intelligence-Controlled Sunflowers: Develop a system of AI-controlled sunflowers that would follow the sun across the sky. Each sunflower would be equipped with a light source that mimics the sunlight, and they could be strategically placed to create a widespread distribution of sunlight. This would allow for continuous illumination even on overcast days.",
    "Earth-Based Satellite System: An earth-based satellite system, like a giant array of mirrors or lenses, could be used to trap and concentrate the Earth's sunlight. This would allow for the generation of a continuous source of light, which could be distributed to various locations on Earth.",
    "Underground Light Tunnels: Create a network of underground light tunnels that utilize fiber-optic cables to carry sunlight from solar panels on the surface. These tunnels could be dug deep into the Earth, allowing sunlight to be transmitted through them to any location, regardless of cloud coverage.",
    "Large-Scale Solar-Powered Mirrors: Develop a massive array of mirrors that are strategically placed to focus and concentrate sunlight, even on cloudy days. The mirrors could be arranged in a way that the reflected light travels through a lens, creating a focused beam of light that can be directed to any location on Earth.",
    "Artificial Suns: Create artificial suns that are large enough to replicate the sun's illuminating power. These could be situated in low Earth orbit and could harness energy from other sources, such as nuclear fission, to generate sunlight. This would provide a constant, reliable source of light that is not affected by cloud coverage."
