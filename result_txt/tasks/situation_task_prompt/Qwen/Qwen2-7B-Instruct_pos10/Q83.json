    "**Incorporating Light into the Bedroom Environment**: You could create a sleep-friendly environment that incorporates ambient lighting. This could include using dimmable LED lights, soft lamps, or even installing a custom light system that mimics natural daylight during the day and then gradually changes to a softer, warmer light as evening approaches, helping your body prepare for sleep.",
    "**Sleep-Enhancing Technologies**: Utilize advanced sleep technology such as smart beds that adjust their firmness, temperature, and vibrations to optimize your sleep quality. These beds might also integrate features like noise cancellation, light-blocking curtains, and white noise generators to ensure a peaceful sleep environment.",
    "**Biophilic Design**: Since plants are known to improve air quality and reduce stress, you could incorporate them into your bedroom. Consider having large potted plants or even a small garden on your balcony or roof if available. The presence of nature can help regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality.",
    "**Soundscapes and White Noise Machines**: Create a relaxing soundscape that mimics natural nighttime sounds, such as ocean waves, rain, or birds chirping. This can be achieved through sound machines or apps that play these soothing sounds continuously throughout the night, helping to drown out any disruptive noises and facilitate better sleep.",
    "**Adapting Your Sleep Schedule to Daylight Hours**: Instead of trying to force yourself to sleep at night when there is no darkness, adjust your lifestyle to match the natural sunlight cycle. Start your day earlier (or later) than usual to align with sunrise and sunset times. Incorporate activities that mimic the effects of natural light, such as spending time outside during the day or using full-spectrum lighting indoors, to regulate your internal clock and enhance your sleep patterns."
