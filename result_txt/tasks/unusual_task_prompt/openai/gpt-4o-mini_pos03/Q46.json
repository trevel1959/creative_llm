    "**Travel Laundry Bag**: Use a pillowcase as a travel laundry bag. When packing for a trip, designate one pillowcase to hold all your dirty clothes. This keeps them separate from clean items and helps maintain organization in your suitcase. Once home, simply dump the contents into the washing machine, making laundry day easier.",
    "**Plant Pot Cover**: Turn a pillowcase into a stylish cover for your potted plants. Slip the pillowcase over a plastic pot to add a decorative touch to your indoor plants. You can also use it to create a temporary plant holder while repotting. This gives your home a bohemian vibe and can easily be switched out for different seasons or occasions.",
    "**Costume Accessory**: Repurpose a pillowcase into a fun costume accessory. For example, you can cut and decorate it to create a ghost costume for Halloween, or use it as a makeshift cape for a superhero outfit. With some creativity, you can add embellishments like glitter or fabric paint to make it more festive.",
    "**Pet Bed**: Create a cozy pet bed by filling a pillowcase with soft materials like old towels, fleece, or other fabric scraps. Tie the end securely and place it in your pet’s favorite spot. This DIY pet bed is not only budget-friendly but also allows you to customize the size and softness to suit your furry friend’s preferences.",
    "**Emergency Water Collector**: In a survival situation, a pillowcase can be used to collect rainwater. Hang the pillowcase in an open area where it can catch falling rain.
