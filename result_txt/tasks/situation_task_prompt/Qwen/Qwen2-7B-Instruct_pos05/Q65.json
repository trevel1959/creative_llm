    "**Luminous Painted Surfaces**: One creative solution could involve using luminous paint on walls, ceilings, and furniture. Luminous paints absorb light during the day and emit light at night. This would not only light up the room but also add a unique aesthetic element to the space. The intensity of the glow can be adjusted by the amount of light the paint absorbs during the day.",
    "**Interactive Light Sculptures**: Design large, interactive light sculptures that could be activated by motion sensors or even through user interaction. These could be placed strategically in the room to provide ambient lighting. For example, a chandelier-like structure with multiple light sources that change color or intensity based on proximity could create a dynamic and engaging lighting experience.",
    "**Solar-Powered LED Windows**: Utilize transparent solar panels embedded into windows. During the day, they collect sunlight to charge small LED lights that can illuminate the room at night. This not only provides light but also generates electricity, potentially reducing energy consumption in the long run. The design could be such that the panels are seamlessly integrated into the window frame, maintaining the aesthetics of the room.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Integration**: Introduce bioluminescent plants into the room. These plants naturally emit light, which could serve as a sustainable source of illumination. They can be strategically placed around the room to provide a soft, diffused light that complements the overall ambiance. The choice of plants should consider their light output, growth rate, and maintenance requirements to ensure they meet the lighting needs effectively.",
    "**Illuminated Water Features**: Incorporate water features that include illuminated elements, such as LED-lit fountains or pools with underwater lighting. Water reflects and refracts light beautifully, enhancing the visual impact and creating a serene atmosphere. These features could be designed to provide a focal point in the room, offering both functional and decorative benefits. They could be controlled to adjust brightness and color, providing versatility in lighting options."
