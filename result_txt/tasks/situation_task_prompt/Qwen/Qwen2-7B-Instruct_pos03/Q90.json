    "**Rainwater Harvesting Systems:** Construct a series of large-scale tanks that can collect water from rooftops or any elevated surfaces. These tanks could be designed to filter out pollutants and debris before storing the collected water for use. The water can then be stored underground in wells or used for irrigation purposes.",
    "**Evaporation Ponds:** Create shallow ponds filled with water that are designed to capture atmospheric moisture. These ponds should be located in areas where wind speed is sufficient to increase evaporation rates. As water evaporates, it leaves behind salts and minerals which can be harvested periodically, while the remaining water can be collected for use.",
    "**Water Absorption Pads:** Utilize large, absorbent materials such as fabric or cellulose that can soak up water from various sources like streams, rivers, or lakes. These pads can be strategically placed in areas prone to drought, and their saturated water can be transported via pipes or trucks to areas in need.",
    "**Underground Water Collection Wells:** Drill deep into the ground to tap into groundwater sources. This method requires advanced drilling equipment but can provide a consistent supply of water. The collected water can be treated using filtration systems to ensure it's safe for consumption or other uses.",
    "**Cloud Seeding:** Engage in cloud seeding techniques, where substances like silver iodide or dry ice are introduced into clouds to enhance precipitation. This process involves using aircraft or specialized vehicles to disperse the materials over targeted areas, potentially increasing rainfall in those regions. While not a permanent solution, it can provide temporary relief during drought periods."
