    "Injury: The physical strain of running a half marathon can lead to injuries such as runner's knee, plantar fasciitis, or musculoskeletal injuries. To prevent injuries, runners should train carefully, wear appropriate footwear with good support, and pay attention to their body's signals to avoid overexertion.",
    "Nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential for running a half marathon, as it provides the body with the necessary energy and nutrients. However, poor food choices before the race, such as high-sugar or high-fat foods, can lead to a stomach upset. Runners should choose a balanced diet with plenty of complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats.",
    "Heat: Extreme heat or high humidity can make running a half marathon more challenging and increase the risk of heat-related illnesses. To cope with heat, runners should acclimate to the weather, wear light, breathable clothing, and stay well-hydrated.",
    "Mental stress: The mental aspect of a half marathon is just as important as the physical aspect. Running a long race can be mentally challenging, especially across different terrains. Runners need to stay mentally strong and focused, remind themselves of their training, and use positive self-talk.",
    "Race logistics: Runners need to ensure they have the logistics of the race down pat, including parking, access to water and restrooms, and the start line. Arriving early and staying flexible can also help alleviate stress during the race."
