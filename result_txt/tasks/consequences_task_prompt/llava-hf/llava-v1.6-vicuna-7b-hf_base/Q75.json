    "Global Food Supply Disruption: Oceans are a significant source of food for billions of people, with fish and other seafood being a staple in many diets. If the oceans were turned into freshwater, the global food supply would be severely disrupted, leading to widespread famine and malnutrition.",
    "Climate Change: Oceans play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. If the oceans were turned into freshwater, the Earth's climate would be thrown off balance, leading to more extreme weather patterns and rising sea levels.",
    "Loss of Hydroelectric Power: Many hydroelectric power plants rely on the water from oceans to generate electricity. If the oceans were turned into freshwater, these power plants would no longer be able to operate, leading to a significant loss of clean energy.",
    "Displacement of Coastal Communities: Coastal communities rely on the oceans for their livelihoods, from fishing and tourism to transportation. If the oceans were turned into freshwater, these communities would be displaced, leading to widespread social and economic disruption.",
    "Loss of Geopolitical Influence: Many countries have territorial claims over oceans and control over their resources. If the oceans were turned into freshwater, these countries would lose their geopolitical influence, leading to shifts in global power dynamics."
