    "**Nutrition and Hydration Issues**:    - **Explanation**: Many runners underestimate the importance of nutrition and hydration during training and on race day. Inadequate fueling can lead to fatigue, cramping, or even hitting the wall during the race. Conversely, overhydrating can cause hyponatremia, a dangerous condition where sodium levels drop too low. Runners should practice their nutrition strategy during long training runs to find what works best for them.",
    "**Weather Conditions**:    - **Explanation**: Weather can greatly affect race performance. Extreme heat can lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, while cold weather can cause muscle stiffness and increase the risk of injury. Runners need to be prepared for various weather conditions by dressing appropriately, adjusting their pacing, and staying hydrated.",
    "**Mental Challenges**:    - **Explanation**: Running a half marathon is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one. Many runners experience self-doubt, anxiety, or a lack of motivation during training or on race day. Mental strategies such as visualization, positive self-talk, and setting small, achievable goals can help overcome these mental barriers.",
    "**Logistical Issues**:    - **Explanation**: Race day logistics can be a source of stress. Problems such as transportation to the race site, finding parking, or navigating the check-in process can lead to a rushed or chaotic start. Runners should plan ahead by familiarizing themselves with the race route, arriving early, and having a clear plan for race day.",
    "**Gear Malfunctions**:    - **Explanation**: Issues with running gear can arise, such as chafing from poorly fitting clothing, blisters from new shoes, or malfunctioning watches or fitness trackers. To avoid this, runners should test their gear during training runs and ensure everything is broken in and comfortable before race day."
