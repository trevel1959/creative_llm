    "**Rainwater Harvesting with Filtration Systems**: Design a comprehensive rainwater harvesting system that includes a series of filters to purify the collected rainwater. The system would involve a roof catchment area, gutters, and storage tanks, along with multiple filtration stages (such as sand, charcoal, and UV light) to ensure the water is free from contaminants. This approach not only provides a clean water source but also promotes water conservation.",
    "**Biomimetic Water Purification**: Develop a water purification system inspired by nature, using materials that mimic the filtration processes of natural ecosystems. For example, using layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal to create a filter that emulates a riverbed. This system would be low-cost, environmentally friendly, and could be constructed using locally available materials.",
    "**Portable Water Purification Devices**: Invent a compact, portable water purification device that uses advanced technologies like nanotechnology or membrane filtration. This device could be powered by a small hand-crank generator, making it accessible for use in remote areas or during emergencies. Users could fill the device with contaminated water, and within minutes, they would have access to clean drinking water.",
    "**Community Bio-Sand Filters**: Establish community bio-sand filter systems where local residents can bring contaminated water for purification. These large-scale filters would use layers of sand, gravel, and biofilm to remove pathogens and impurities. Community members could be trained to maintain and operate these systems, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration while ensuring access to clean water.",
    "**Water-from-Air Technology**: Invest in atmospheric water generators that extract moisture from the air to produce drinking water. These machines would condense humidity, filter the resulting water, and store it for consumption. This technology could be particularly effective in humid climates and could provide a sustainable water source without relying on traditional water supplies."
