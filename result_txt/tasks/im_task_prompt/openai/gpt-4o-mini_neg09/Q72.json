    "**Modular Surfboard Design**: Create a surfboard with a modular construction that allows surfers to easily swap out different components, such as fins, tail shapes, or even the boardâ€™s material. This customization can cater to various wave conditions and personal preferences, enabling surfers to tailor their boards for specific environments or styles.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Surfboard Materials**: Innovate surfboards made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bio-resins, without compromising performance. These eco-friendly boards would appeal to environmentally conscious surfers, helping to reduce the carbon footprint of surfing while still delivering high-quality rides.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in Storage**: Design a surfboard that includes a waterproof compartment for storing essentials like keys, wallets, or sunscreen. This would eliminate the need for surfers to leave their belongings on the beach or risk losing them while out on the water, enhancing convenience and security.",
    "**Interactive Surfboard with Augmented Reality**: Incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology into a surfboard, allowing surfers to see real-time overlays of wave conditions, tide information, and even surf spots on their board's surface. Using AR goggles or a smartphone, surfers could enhance their experience by receiving visual cues and navigational aids while they ride.",
    "**Surfboard with Built-in GPS and Safety Features**: Equip surfboards with GPS tracking and emergency signaling features. In case of an emergency, surfers could activate a distress signal that sends their location to rescue services or friends. This added safety feature would be especially beneficial for surfers who venture into remote or challenging waters."
