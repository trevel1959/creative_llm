    "Floating Beds: In a world without beds, I would create a community of floating beds that can be summoned and docked at will. These beds would be made of a lightweight, buoyant material that can be inflated and deflated as needed. Each bed would come equipped with a personalized sleeping pod, complete with a soft, cushioned interior and a built-in sound system for a peaceful night's rest.",
    "Bubble Tents: Another solution would be to create portable, inflatable tents that can be set up in any open space. These tents would be made of a durable, waterproof material and would provide a comfortable, cushioned surface for sleeping. The tents could be equipped with built-in lighting, temperature control, and even a built-in sound system for a cozy night's sleep.",
    "Sleeping Pods: In a world without beds, I would create a network of interconnected sleeping pods that can be accessed via a central hub. Each pod would be a small, enclosed space with a soft, cushioned interior and a built-in sound system for a peaceful night's rest. The pods could be made of a lightweight, durable material and could be easily moved or rearranged as needed.",
    "Foldable Furniture: Another option would be to create furniture that can be folded and unfolded as needed. This could include a foldable bed frame with a removable mattress, or a foldable chair that can be converted into a makeshift bed. This furniture would be lightweight and easy to transport, making it ideal for a world without beds.",
    "Community Sleeping Areas: In a world without beds, I would create designated community sleeping areas where people can come together to rest. These areas could be equipped with comfortable mats or cushions, and could be located in public spaces such as parks, plazas, or community centers. This would provide a safe and comfortable space for people to sleep, regardless of their living situation."
