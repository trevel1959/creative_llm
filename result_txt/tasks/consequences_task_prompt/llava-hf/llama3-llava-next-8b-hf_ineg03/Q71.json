    "Demographic Imbalance: With immortality, the population would grow exponentially. The current age distribution would become unbalanced, leading to a shortage of younger generations and a surplus of older individuals. This imbalance could strain resources, impact the economy, and create societal and political challenges.",
    "Environmental Impact: With an ever-growing population, the strain on resources such as food, water, and energy would increase. Immortality would also mean that pollution and other environmental issues would persist for an indefinitely long time, causing irreparable harm to the planet.",
    "Personal Growth and Stagnation: Immortality would mean that individuals would have all the time in the world to achieve their goals, learn new skills, and explore the world. However, it could also lead to stagnation, as people might be less motivated to grow and change once they have all the time in the world to achieve their desired state.",
    "Longevity and Health: The medical industry would face a significant shift with immortality, as the need for health care and treatments for age-related diseases would decrease. However, it could also lead to new challenges, such as the prevention of chronic diseases and maintaining optimal health over an extended period.",
    "Interactions with Other Species: The discovery of immortality would also raise questions about the interactions between humans and other species. Would animals and other living beings also become immortal? This could lead to new ecological dynamics and challenges."
