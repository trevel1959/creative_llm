    "\"Eco-Friendly Energy Harvesting\": Create a community where residents generate their own electricity using sustainable methods such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Each home could have its own micro-grid system that harnesses local renewable energy sources, reducing reliance on the grid and promoting energy independence.",
    "\"Nature-Inspired Lighting\": Develop a unique lighting system that mimics the natural light-dark cycle, using sensors and algorithms to adjust the brightness and color temperature of the lighting based on the time of day and season. This would not only conserve energy but also create a more natural and comfortable living environment.",
    "\"Energy-Harvesting Furniture\": Design furniture pieces that can harness and store energy from everyday activities, such as typing on a keyboard or moving around. These pieces could then be used to power small devices and appliances, reducing the need for external electricity sources.",
    "\"Smart Energy Storage\": Create a community-wide energy storage system that stores excess energy generated from renewable sources during the day and releases it during the night, providing a consistent and reliable source of power. This would reduce the strain on the grid and provide a more sustainable energy solution.",
    "\"Bioluminescent Materials\": Develop materials that emit light through a process called bioluminescence, mimicking the natural light produced by living organisms. These materials could be used to create sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solutions, reducing the need for traditional lighting sources and creating a more environmentally friendly living space."
