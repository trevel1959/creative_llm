    "Economic benefits: A universal language would greatly enhance international trade and commerce as people and businesses could transact across borders with ease. The elimination of language barriers would also lead to the emergence of a more equitable global economy, as less privileged countries and regions would gain access to new markets and resources.",
    "Cultural exchange and global identity: A common language could encourage a sense of global citizenship and shared identity among people from diverse backgrounds. This, in turn, might promote social cohesion and bridge cultural gaps, leading to a more peaceful and harmonious world.",
    "Loss of cultural diversity: While a universal language could bring people closer, it may also cause some people to lose their unique cultural identities. Smaller languages and dialects may fade into extinction as people adopt the new language, leading to a loss of linguistic and cultural diversity.",
    "Power dynamics and inequality: The adoption of a dominant language could reinforce existing power imbalances between regions and countries. The language spoken by the dominant culture might become the standard, and speakers of less common languages may face marginalization and discrimination.",
    "Challenges for education and learning: While a universal language would simplify learning for many, it could also create challenges for individuals learning their second or third languages. The shift to a new language could create a significant learning curve for some, leading to a temporary loss of ability to communicate effectively in their native tongues."
