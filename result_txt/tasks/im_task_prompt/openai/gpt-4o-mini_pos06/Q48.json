    "**Portable Folding Piano**: Design a lightweight, portable piano that can be easily folded and carried like a laptop. This would appeal to musicians who travel frequently or those with limited space. The folding mechanism could utilize durable materials and a collapsible frame that maintains the feel of a traditional piano while being practical for transport.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a piano made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled wood. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of piano production but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers. The design could highlight the natural beauty of these materials, offering a unique aesthetic that stands out from traditional pianos.",
    "**Customizable Sound Profiles**: Develop a piano with the ability to switch between various sound profiles or presets, emulating different types of pianos (e.g., grand, upright, electric) or even other instruments. This could be achieved through digital sampling technology, allowing players to explore diverse musical styles without needing multiple instruments.",
    "**Integrated Composition Tools**: Equip the piano with built-in composition software that allows users to record their performances, layer tracks, and experiment with different arrangements. This could include a user-friendly interface with features like MIDI compatibility, a variety of virtual instruments, and the ability to share compositions online for collaboration.",
    "**Piano Health Monitoring System**: Implement a health monitoring system that tracks the condition of the piano over time. Sensors could monitor humidity, temperature, and the condition of the strings, providing alerts when maintenance is needed. This feature would be particularly useful for professional musicians and piano technicians, ensuring optimal performance and longevity."
