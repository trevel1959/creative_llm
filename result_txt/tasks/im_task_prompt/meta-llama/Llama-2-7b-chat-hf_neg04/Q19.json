    "Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired: Develop smart glasses that can enhance the vision of people with visual impairments. These glasses could have multiple built-in sensors and cameras that can detect and analyze the environment, then provide real-time visual enhancements to the wearer's field of view. This could include magnification, contrast enhancement, and even object recognition.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses for Artists: Create glasses that allow artists to see their work in a new dimension. These glasses could have a built-in display that shows a virtual representation of the artwork, allowing the artist to see how their work will look in different lighting conditions, colors, and perspectives. This could help artists to better visualize their work and make more accurate adjustments.",
    "Virtual Reality Glasses for Travel: Develop glasses that allow people to experience virtual reality destinations while they are still in their own home. These glasses could have built-in sensors that track the wearer's head movements and provide a virtual representation of a destination, such as a beach or mountain range. This could help people to relax and unwind in a virtual environment before they even leave their house.",
    "Smart Glasses for Athletes: Create glasses that provide real-time data and analysis for athletes. These glasses could have built-in sensors that track the athlete's performance, such as speed, distance, and heart rate. The glasses could also provide real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement, helping athletes to optimize their performance.",
    "Glasses with Built-In Projector: Develop glasses that have a built-in projector that can display content onto any surface. These glasses could be used for a variety of purposes, such as presentations, movies, or even video games. The projector could be powered by a small battery or even a miniature solar panel, making the glasses portable and convenient to use."
