    "Bicycle Helmet with a Built-in Music System: Create a bicycle helmet with a built-in music system that includes speakers and a microphone. This would allow riders to listen to their favorite tunes while cycling, creating a more enjoyable and engaging experience. The music system could be controlled through a Bluetooth connection on the helmet, or through voice commands using the microphone.",
    "Smart Bicycle Helmet with Impact Detection: Develop a smart bicycle helmet that detects impact and alerts the rider in case of an accident. The helmet could use sensors to monitor the rider's movements and detect any unusual impact, such as a crash. If an impact is detected, the helmet could alert the rider with a vibration or an audible alarm, providing an added layer of safety.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with a HUD Display: Design a bicycle helmet with a heads-up display (HUD) that projects important information onto the rider's field of vision. The HUD could display information such as speed, distance traveled, and navigation instructions, making it easier for riders to stay focused on the road while still being able to see important data.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Integrated Lighting: Create a bicycle helmet with integrated lighting that provides visibility for the rider and other road users. The helmet could include LED lights that illuminate the front and rear of the helmet, making it easier for the rider to be seen in low-light conditions. This could be especially useful for riders who commute to work or school in the early morning or evening.",
    "Bicycle Helmet with Augmented Reality Display: Develop a bicycle helmet with an augmented reality (AR) display that overlays digital information onto the rider's field of vision. The AR display could show information such as traffic conditions, road signs, and even bike lanes, making it easier for riders to navigate their route. This could be especially useful in unfamiliar areas or for riders who are new to cycling."
