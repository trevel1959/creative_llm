    "Insect-based cuisine: With all other animals gone, insects could become a new source of protein and other essential nutrients. To make it more palatable, insects could be farmed and processed into various dishes, such as cricket stir-fries, mealworm tacos, or grasshopper burgers. Insects like ants and bees could also be harvested for their honey and other byproducts.",
    "Insect-repelling architecture: Buildings and homes could be designed with insect-repelling features, such as textured surfaces, colorful patterns, or even built-in insect traps. This would help minimize the need for pesticides and other chemicals that could harm the environment.",
    "Insect-based medicine: Insects have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, and their potential for healing properties could be explored further. For example, the venom of certain insects could be used to create new painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs. Insect-based remedies could also be used to treat various diseases, such as malaria or Zika.",
    "Insect-powered transportation: Insects could be used as a sustainable source of energy for transportation. For example, beetles could be harnessed to generate electricity, while dragonflies could be used as bio-hybrid flying machines. This could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.",
    "Insect-based agriculture: Insects could be used to pollinate crops, pest-control, and even fertilize the soil. For example, ladybugs could be introduced to gardens to control aphids, while lacewings could be used to control pests in greenhouses. This could lead to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers."
