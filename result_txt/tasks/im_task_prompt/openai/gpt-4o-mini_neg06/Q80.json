Users could easily swap heads by pressing a button, allowing them to seamlessly switch between tasks without needing multiple tools.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Featuring a built-in cleaning mechanism, this whisk could have a compartment that sprays a cleaning solution while spinning the whisk in water.

This would save time on cleanup and ensure that the whisk is always hygienic and ready for use.",
    "**Whisk with Integrated Recipe App**: This whisk could be paired with a smartphone app that offers a database of recipes.

Additionally, the whisk could have a built-in sensor that communicates with the app to track progress, ensuring that users achieve the perfect consistency every time.",
    "**Whisk with Vibration Feedback**: This whisk would feature a vibration mechanism that provides tactile feedback based on the mixture's consistency.

This would help novice cooks understand the textures they should aim for, making the cooking process more intuitive and enjoyable."
