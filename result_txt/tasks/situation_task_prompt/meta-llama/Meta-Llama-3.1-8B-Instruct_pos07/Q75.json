    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) Technology**: Develop an AWH system that extracts water vapor from the air, even in arid regions, and uses it to generate hydrogen through electrolysis. This hydrogen can be used as a clean energy source to power fuel cells, which in turn power vehicles. The system would be powered by solar panels or wind turbines, making it a sustainable and renewable energy solution.",
    "**Bio-Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**: Design and develop BEVs that use microorganisms like bacteria or yeast to convert organic waste into bio-electricity. This bio-electricity would be stored in advanced batteries and used to power electric vehicles. The organic waste could come from various sources, including food waste, agricultural waste, or even wastewater treatment plants.",
    "**Graphene-Based Super Capacitors**: Create advanced graphene-based super capacitors that can store and release massive amounts of electrical energy quickly and efficiently. These super capacitors would be used to power electric vehicles, providing a high-performance and long-lasting energy storage solution.",
    "**Solar-Powered Piezoelectric Roads**: Develop roads with integrated piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as vehicles drive over them. This energy would be harnessed and stored in advanced batteries, providing a sustainable and renewable energy source for electric vehicles. The roads could also be designed to harvest energy from vibrations caused by wind, traffic, or other environmental factors.",
    "**Advanced Nuclear Batteries**: Design and develop advanced nuclear batteries that use small, modular nuclear reactors to generate electricity. These batteries would be compact, safe, and efficient, providing a reliable and long-lasting energy source for electric vehicles. The nuclear batteries could be powered by a variety of fuels, including uranium, thorium, or even nuclear waste. [/INST] "
