    "Smart Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox that can track your child's food intake and nutrient levels. It can use a built-in scale to measure food weight, and a built-in accelerometer to track food intake. The lunchbox can also have a Bluetooth connection to sync with a smartphone app, allowing parents to monitor their child's eating habits remotely.",
    "Thermal Lunchbox: Design a lunchbox that can keep food hot for several hours. The lunchbox can use a phase-change material to absorb and release heat, keeping food at a consistent temperature. This would be ideal for parents who need to pack a hot meal for their child to take to school or work.",
    "Modular Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox that can be easily customized to suit different meals and dietary needs. The lunchbox can have interchangeable compartments, allowing parents to switch out different ingredients and portion sizes as needed. This would be especially helpful for children with food allergies or dietary restrictions.",
    "Sustainable Lunchbox: Design a lunchbox made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic or biodegradable materials. The lunchbox can also be reused multiple times, reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impact of single-use lunchboxes.",
    "Augmented Reality Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox with an augmented reality (AR) display that can show fun and educational content related to food. The lunchbox can have a built-in AR display, or it can be paired with a smartphone or tablet app. The AR display can show pictures of different foods, nutritional information, and fun animations or games related to food. This would be a fun and engaging way for children to learn about healthy eating habits and nutrition."
