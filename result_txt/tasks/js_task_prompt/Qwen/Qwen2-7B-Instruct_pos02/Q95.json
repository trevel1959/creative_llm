    "**Intergalactic Zoo**: Design an animal habitat that is a replica of a distant planet or moon. This habitat would include elements like different gravity levels, unique atmospheres (e.g., oxygen-rich, nitrogen-based), and varied terrains (deserts, forests, oceans). Animals native to this \"planet\" would be carefully selected based on their ability to thrive in such extreme conditions, providing visitors with a truly out-of-this-world experience.",
    "**Underwater Oasis**: Create a massive underwater habitat that mimics the lush coral reefs and deep-sea ecosystems. This habitat would be designed with transparent domes or tunnels allowing visitors to swim among schools of fish, interact with marine mammals, and observe various sea creatures in their natural habitats. It could also include interactive exhibits where visitors can learn about ocean conservation and sustainable fishing practices.",
    "**Temporal Forest**: Design a habitat that simulates different time periods in Earth's history, from prehistoric times to the future. The habitat would feature living organisms adapted to these specific eras, alongside recreated landscapes such as dense rainforests, ancient deserts, and futuristic cityscapes. This would offer a unique educational opportunity to explore the evolution of life and the impact of human activity on the environment.",
    "**Aerobic Atmosphere**: Create a habitat that mimics high-altitude environments found in the stratosphere or mountainous regions. This habitat would simulate low oxygen and high pressure conditions, allowing visitors to experience life at these altitudes. It could include species adapted to these environments, such as birds of prey and high-altitude plants, along with interactive experiences like virtual flights and high-altitude survival training.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Architecture**: Design a habitat that integrates principles of biomimicry, where architectural features and materials are inspired by natural phenomena. For example, structures might mimic the strength-to-weight ratio of spider webs, the self-cleaning properties of lotus leaves, or the aerodynamics of bird wings. This habitat would house animals that have evolved to thrive in environments influenced by these natural designs, offering both a visually stunning experience and an opportunity to learn about the efficiency and beauty of nature's solutions."
