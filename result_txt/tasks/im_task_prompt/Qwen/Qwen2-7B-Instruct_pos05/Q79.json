    "**Smart Clothing Hanger**: Design a hanger that integrates technology such as sensors or Wi-Fi connectivity to track clothing items. For instance, it could notify the user when an item is removed from the closet or when the item has not been worn for a certain period of time, encouraging rotation in wardrobe. This hanger could also sync with fashion apps or personal style preferences to suggest outfits or notify of upcoming events that match the wearer's attire.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hangers**: Create a line of hangers made from sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled plastic, or cork. These eco-friendly hangers can help reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry by promoting more environmentally conscious clothing storage solutions. They could also feature designs that are both stylish and functional, enhancing the overall appearance of the wardrobe space.",
    "**Interactive Hangers for Children**: Develop a series of hangers specifically designed for childrenâ€™s clothes that incorporate fun, interactive elements. For example, hangers could have embedded LED lights that change colors or patterns based on the child's mood or the weather outside. They could also include small compartments for storing accessories like hair ties or small toys, keeping these items organized and accessible for children.",
    "**Fashion-Forward Hangers**: Design hangers that double as decorative art pieces. They could be made from unique materials like metal with intricate designs, wood with hand-carved patterns, or glass with colorful, artistic designs. These hangers can be displayed as part of the home decor, adding a touch of elegance and creativity to any room, while still serving their primary function of hanging clothes.",
    "**Adjustable and Multi-Purpose Hangers**: Create a set of hangers that can be adjusted in height, width, and angle to accommodate various clothing items and accessories. This could include padded hangers for delicate garments, slim hangers for suits or pants, and wider, more stable hangers for larger items like coats or jackets. The ability to adjust these hangers would provide versatility and organization, helping users efficiently manage their wardrobes without sacrificing space or functionality."
