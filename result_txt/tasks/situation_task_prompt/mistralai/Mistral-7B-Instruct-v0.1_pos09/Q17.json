    "If all electricity was cut off, I would need to rely on natural light and alternative sources of energy. I would find ways to generate my own power through methods such as solar panels, wind turbines, or hydroelectricity.",
    "I would also need to find alternative ways to communicate and access information. I could use a hand-cranked radio or a solar-powered phone to stay connected.",
    "I would need to find ways to store food and water, as well as to cook it. I could use a camping stove or a wood-fired oven to prepare meals.",
    "I would need to find ways to light my home and workspace. I could use candles, oil lamps, or gas lamps to provide light.",
    "I would need to find ways to stay comfortable and productive. I could use a portable fan or a solar-powered air conditioner to stay cool, and I could use a portable generator or a solar-powered laptop to continue working."
