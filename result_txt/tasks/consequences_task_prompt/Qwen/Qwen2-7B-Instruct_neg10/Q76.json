    "**Dinosaurs as Sustainable Workers**: One creative idea could involve using genetically engineered dinosaurs as labor force for industries like mining or agriculture. They could work in harsh environments that are unsafe or difficult for humans. For instance, they might dig out deep mines, clear forests, or cultivate land in extreme climates. This would not only provide a novel solution to labor shortages but also offer a sustainable alternative to traditional methods.",
    "**Dinosaurs as Eco-Tourism Attractions**: Bringing dinosaurs back to life could revolutionize the tourism industry. Visitors could experience a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe these creatures up close, potentially leading to a surge in eco-tourism. Special parks could be developed where dinosaurs roam freely, allowing people to interact with them in controlled environments.",
    "**Dinosaurs as Educational Tools**: In schools and museums, life-sized dinosaur models or holograms could be used as interactive educational tools. Children could learn about prehistoric life through hands-on experiences and simulations, enhancing their understanding of biology, history, and evolution.",
    "**Dinosaurs in Medical Research**: Genetic material from preserved dinosaur fossils could be used for medical research. Scientists might attempt to sequence dinosaur DNA to better understand evolutionary processes, which could have implications for human medicine. For example, studying dinosaur immunity could lead to new insights into disease resistance and the development of vaccines.",
