    "Smart Glove for Virtual Reality: Develop a smart glove that can detect hand movements and gestures in real-time, allowing users to interact with virtual objects in immersive VR environments. The glove could use sensors and AI algorithms to track the movements of the user's hand and fingers, providing a more natural and intuitive way to interact with virtual objects.",
    "Fitness Glove with Biofeedback: Create a fitness glove that provides real-time biofeedback to users during exercise. The glove could use sensors to track heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle activity, providing users with information on their physical performance and helping them optimize their workouts. The glove could also vibrate or provide haptic feedback to encourage users to push themselves harder during exercise.",
    "Glove for Musicians: Develop a glove that helps musicians play instruments more efficiently and accurately. The glove could use sensors to detect the position and movement of the musician's fingers and hands, providing real-time feedback on their technique and helping them improve their playing. The glove could also be used to control virtual instruments or effects in a digital environment.",
    "Haptic Feedback Glove for Gaming: Create a glove that provides haptic feedback to gamers during gameplay. The glove could use motors and sensors to simulate the feel of different textures, temperatures, and forces in the virtual world, providing a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. The glove could also be used to control game characters or objects, allowing gamers to feel like they are truly part of the game.",
    "Smart Glove for Robotics: Develop a smart glove that allows users to control robotic arms or hands with their bare hands. The glove could use sensors and AI algorithms to detect the movements of the user's hand and fingers, allowing them to control the robotic arm or hand with precision and accuracy. This could be useful in manufacturing, research, or other applications where precise control of robotic systems is important."
