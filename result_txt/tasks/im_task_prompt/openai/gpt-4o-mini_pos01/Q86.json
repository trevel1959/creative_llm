    "**Modular Design for Customization**:    - Create a modular wheelchair design that allows users to customize their wheelchair based on personal needs and preferences. Components like armrests, footrests, and back support could be easily swapped out or adjusted. This would cater to various body types and mobility needs, making the wheelchair more comfortable and functional for individual users.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**:    - Develop a wheelchair with built-in health monitoring systems that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be sent to a smartphone app or healthcare provider, allowing for proactive health management. Alerts could be set for abnormal readings, ensuring timely medical attention when needed.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging System**:    - Integrate solar panels into the design of the wheelchair, allowing it to charge while in use or parked outdoors. This would extend the battery life of electric wheelchairs and reduce the need for frequent charging. Additionally, the solar panels could power auxiliary devices like lights or phone chargers, enhancing the wheelchair's utility.",
    "**All-Terrain Capabilities**:    - Design a wheelchair with advanced all-terrain capabilities, utilizing adaptive suspension systems and rugged tires that can handle various surfaces such as sand, gravel, or snow. This would empower users to explore outdoor environments more freely, promoting an active lifestyle and reducing the barriers posed by traditional wheelchair designs.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**:    - Incorporate an AR interface into the wheelchair that can project navigational aids, information about the surroundings, or even entertainment options onto a heads-up display. Users could receive real-time directions, highlights of local attractions, or even engage in interactive games while waiting or resting, making the wheelchair experience more engaging."
