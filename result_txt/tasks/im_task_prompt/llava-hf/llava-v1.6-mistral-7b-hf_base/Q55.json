    "Smart Ink Pen: The pen would be equipped with a small, built-in display screen that would display instructions, tips, or tricks related to writing, drawing, or calligraphy. This would make it an ideal tool for beginners learning to write, design, or develop their calligraphy skills. The screen could be customizable, allowing the user to choose from various templates or themes.",
    "Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip: Introducing an ergonomic design that adapts to the user's hand's size, shape, and writing angle, providing a more comfortable writing experience. The pen could have adjustable grip options that allow users to customize the pen's grip to accommodate their hand's position and prevent strain or cramps during extended writing sessions.",
    "Voice Command and Recording Functionality: Equipping the pen with voice command technology and a small built-in microphone. The pen would allow users to control their writing and other functions through voice commands. Additionally, it could record spoken content alongside the written text for easy reference, voice-to-text transcription, or even as a creative writing tool.",
    "Fountain Pen Converter: A tool that would enable users to switch between inks and nibs quickly and easily. The converter would have a variety of popular ink and nib combinations, allowing users to try different writing styles and colors without purchasing multiple pens.",
    "Eco-Friendly Refillable: Creating a pen made from sustainable materials, like recycled plastic, and designed to be refillable with eco-friendly ink cartridges. This would make the pen more environmentally-friendly compared to single-use disposable pens."
