    "**Character Development**: Developing well-rounded and relatable characters is crucial for a screenplay's success. A potential problem could be creating flat or clich√©d characters that fail to resonate with the audience. To avoid this, writers should invest time in character backstories, motivations, and arcs. Workshops or feedback sessions with peers can provide fresh perspectives and highlight areas for improvement.",
    "**Pacing Issues**: Maintaining the right pace throughout the screenplay is essential for keeping the audience engaged. Problems may arise when scenes feel rushed or drag on too long, leading to a disjointed narrative. To address pacing, writers can outline their screenplay in acts and sequences, ensuring that each scene serves a purpose and transitions smoothly to the next. Regularly reading the screenplay aloud can also help identify pacing problems.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing realistic and engaging dialogue can be challenging. A common issue is creating conversations that sound forced or unnatural, which can detract from character authenticity. To combat this, writers should observe real-life conversations, conduct interviews, or participate in workshops that focus on dialogue writing. Additionally, having actors read the dialogue can provide insight into its flow and believability.",
    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: Screenplays must maintain logical coherence to avoid confusing the audience. Plot holes or inconsistencies can undermine the story's credibility. Writers can prevent this by outlining their plot thoroughly and keeping track of character actions and motivations. Peer reviews and script consultations can help identify potential issues before they become problematic.",
    "**Target Audience Misalignment**: Understanding the target audience is crucial for a screenplay's marketability. A potential problem arises when the screenplay does not align with audience expectations or genre conventions, resulting in a lack of interest. Writers should conduct market research, analyze successful films within their genre, and consider audience demographics to ensure their screenplay resonates with viewers."
