    "Design a chocolate river that changes colors based on the temperature of the water. This would create an interactive display for customers and make the chocolate factory stand out from the competition.",
    "Use the chocolate river as a form of transportation for employees between different departments in the factory. This could be done by building bridges or other structures over the river, allowing people to walk or bike across it.",
    "Create a chocolate river that flows through a maze, with clues and challenges hidden along its path. Visitors could participate in a treasure hunt or race to see who can reach the end first.",
    "Use the chocolate river as a source of power for the factory. By using turbines to harness the flow of the river, the factory could generate electricity and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels."
