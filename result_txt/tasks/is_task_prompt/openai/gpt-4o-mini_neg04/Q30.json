    "Once upon a time in the mystical land of Eldoria, there lived a dragon named Ember. Unlike his fiery kin, Ember was terrified of fire. While others soared through the skies, breathing flames, he cowered in the cool shadows of the ancient forest. One fateful day, a raging inferno threatened his home. The other dragons rallied, but Ember hesitated, his heart racing. Suddenly, he spotted a trapped fawn amidst the flames. Summoning every ounce of courage, Ember took a deep breath and unleashed a stream of water instead. The fire sizzled, and the fawn was saved. From that day, Ember learned that true strength lies in overcoming oneâ€™s fears.",
