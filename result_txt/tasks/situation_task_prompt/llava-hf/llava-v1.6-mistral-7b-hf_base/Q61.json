    "Insect-attracting plants: Introduce a variety of insect-attracting plants into the area to lure pollinators like bees, butterflies, and ladybugs. These plants will create a thriving ecosystem that supports pollination as well as other beneficial insects.",
    "Manual pollination: In case of a localized flower decline, it's possible to manually pollinate the flowers using handheld tools or brushes. This can be a labor-intensive but effective method, especially for indoor or rooftop gardens.",
    "Micro-pollinator bots: Design tiny robots that can efficiently crawl or fly over flowers and use sensors to detect the presence of pollen. These micro-pollinators can either pick up pollen from one flower and transfer it to another or deposit pollen onto the stigmas manually.",
    "Genetic modification: Use gene editing techniques to create flower varieties that can produce larger amounts of nectar, making them more attractive to pollinators, or to produce flowers with vibrant, brightly colored patterns that draw more pollinators to the plants.",
    "Biomimicry-based pollination: Develop systems inspired by natural mechanisms, such as wind pollination, to disperse pollen in cases where traditional methods like bees and other insects become less efficient. For example, wind-powered turbines could be used to blow pollen across flowers."
