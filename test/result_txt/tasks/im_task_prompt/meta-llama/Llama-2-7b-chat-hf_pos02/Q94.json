    "Scent-sational Storytelling: Create a candle line that tells a story through its scent. Each candle could be inspired by a different literary work, such as a romantic candle with notes of rose and vanilla, a spooky candle with a blend of cinnamon and pumpkin, or a calming candle with a blend of lavender and chamomile. The packaging could include a book excerpt or quote to further enhance the storytelling experience.",
    "Artisanal Collaborations: Partner with local artists to create one-of-a-kind candles that showcase their unique styles. For example, a candle maker could collaborate with a painter to create a candle that mimics the colors and textures of their artwork, or a sculptor to create a candle that resembles their sculptures. This would not only provide a unique product but also help to promote the artist's work.",
    "Customizable Candles: Offer a line of candles that allow customers to customize their scent and design. This could include a variety of fragrances, such as essential oils or blended scents, as well as different wax colors and container shapes. Customers could also be able to upload their own artwork or designs to create a truly personalized candle.",
    "Candle Subscription Service: Offer a subscription service where customers can receive a new, unique candle each month. This could include a mix of seasonal and limited-edition scents, as well as collaborations with other small businesses or artists. The subscription service could also include a book or zine that explores the inspiration behind each candle and the art of candle making.",
    "Candle Workshops: Host workshops and classes where customers can learn the art of candle making. These workshops could cover different techniques, such as pouring, dipping, and blending, and provide customers with the opportunity to create their own unique candles. This could also include a take-home kit with all the necessary supplies to continue creating candles at home."
