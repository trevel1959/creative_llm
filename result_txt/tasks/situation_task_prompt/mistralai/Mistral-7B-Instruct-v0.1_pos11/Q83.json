    "Sleep in a daytime-only bed: One solution could be to adjust your sleep schedule to match the daytime only. This could be achieved by gradually waking up earlier each day and going to bed earlier each night until you are completely adjusted to a daytime-only sleep cycle. You could also try to mimic the natural light of day by using bright lights in your room during the day and avoiding bright screens before bedtime.",
    "Use natural light to your advantage: Another solution could be to take advantage of natural light during the day to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. This could involve opening your curtains or blinds to let in natural light during the day, or taking short naps during the day in a brightly lit room.",
    "Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help you fall asleep and stay asleep. You could try incorporating these techniques into your daily routine to help you relax and prepare for bed.",
    "Use white noise: White noise can be a helpful tool for people who have trouble sleeping due to noise. You could try using a white noise machine or app to create a soothing background noise that can help you fall asleep and stay asleep.",
    "Try different sleep positions: The way you sleep can have a big impact on your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. You could try experimenting with different sleep positions to see which one works best for you. For example, some people find that sleeping on their side helps them fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer."
