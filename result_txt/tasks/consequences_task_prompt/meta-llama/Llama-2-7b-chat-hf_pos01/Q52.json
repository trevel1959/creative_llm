    "Catastrophic Weather Patterns - If the Earth stopped rotating, the Coriolis force, which causes the formation of hurricanes and typhoons, would cease to exist. This would result in a significant decrease in the number of severe storms, but the remaining storms would be much more intense and frequent. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Extreme Temperature Fluctuations - Without the rotation of the Earth, the atmosphere would no longer be able to distribute heat evenly, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations between the equator and the poles. This would result in the melting of polar ice caps and a significant increase in global temperatures. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Gravity Shifts - The rotation of the Earth also affects the planet's gravitational field. Without rotation, the gravitational field would become weaker, causing massive changes in the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and landmasses. This could result in catastrophic flooding, tsunamis, and changes in ocean currents. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "Disruption of Magnetic Field - The Earth's rotation also plays a crucial role in maintaining the planet's magnetic field. Without rotation, the magnetic field would weaken, exposing the planet to harmful solar radiation and potentially causing widespread electrical failures and communication disruptions. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Unpredictable Geological Events - The Earth's rotation also affects the movement of tectonic plates, which can lead to unpredictable geological events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Without rotation, these events would become more frequent and intense, leading to widespread destruction and loss of life. Confidence Score: 0.95"
