    "Another alternative could be using metal for the structure of the house. Metal is strong, durable, and can be shaped into different forms, making it an excellent choice for building a house.",
    "We could also use a combination of materials such as concrete and fiberglass. Concrete is strong and can be molded into different shapes, while fiberglass can be used to create insulation and provide a smooth exterior finish.",
    "A new form of building material could be developed using biodegradable polymers. These materials are sustainable, can be molded into various shapes, and have the ability to degrade over time, reducing the environmental impact of building construction.",
    "In this scenario, we could explore using alternative building methods such as modular construction or prefabricated homes. These methods involve assembling the structure off-site and then transporting it to the construction site for installation, reducing the need for traditional building materials.",
    "Another option could be using 3D printing technology to create a house. 3D printing can create complex shapes and structures using a variety of materials, including concrete and fiberglass."
