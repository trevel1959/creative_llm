    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the park can be a significant hurdle. Initial costs may include land acquisition, infrastructure development, and staffing. To overcome this, a multi-faceted funding strategy could be developed, including grants from environmental organizations, partnerships with local businesses, crowdfunding campaigns, and establishing a membership program that encourages community involvement and investment in the park.",
    "**Community Engagement and Support**: Gaining the support of the local community is crucial for the success of a nature conservation park. Potential issues may arise if local residents feel excluded from the planning process or if their needs are not addressed. To foster community engagement, public forums, workshops, and surveys could be organized to gather input and involve locals in decision-making. Additionally, educational programs highlighting the benefits of conservation could be implemented to increase public awareness and support.",
    "**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating the legal landscape surrounding land use, conservation laws, and zoning regulations can be complex. There may be potential conflicts with existing landowners, developers, or industries. To mitigate these issues, a thorough review of local, state, and federal regulations should be conducted, and legal counsel may be required to ensure compliance. Building relationships with regulatory agencies and stakeholders can also facilitate smoother operations.",
    "**Infrastructure Development**: Creating necessary infrastructure such as trails, visitor centers, and restrooms while minimizing environmental impact can be challenging. Poorly planned development can lead to habitat destruction or pollution. To address this, a sustainable design approach should be adopted, utilizing eco-friendly materials and practices. Engaging landscape architects and environmental engineers can help create infrastructure that enhances visitor experience while protecting the parkâ€™s natural resources.",
    "**Wildlife Management and Human Interaction**: Establishing a conservation park often leads to increased human-wildlife interactions, which can result in conflicts. Wildlife may become habituated to human presence, leading to safety concerns or disruptions in natural behaviors. To manage this, educational programs for visitors about wildlife safety and behavior should be developed, along with strict guidelines for interactions. Implementing measures such as designated viewing areas and proper waste management can help minimize negative impacts."
