    "**Volunteer Burnout**: Overworked and underappreciated volunteers may become exhausted, leading to decreased morale and increased turnover rates. To address this, the festival could provide regular breaks, recognition, and incentives for volunteers, such as exclusive access to film screenings or a free ticket to a special event.",
    "**Cultural Insensitivity**: The festival's programming may inadvertently offend or alienate certain cultural or ethnic groups, leading to negative publicity and a loss of credibility. To prevent this, the festival could establish a diverse advisory board to ensure that all films and events are culturally sensitive and representative.",
    "**Technical Issues**: Technical problems with sound, video, or lighting equipment may disrupt screenings, causing frustration for attendees and filmmakers. To minimize these issues, the festival could conduct thorough equipment checks before each screening and have a backup plan in place in case of technical failures.",
    "**Food and Beverage Shortages**: Insufficient food and beverage options may lead to long lines, dissatisfied attendees, and negative reviews. To prevent this, the festival could work with local vendors to provide a diverse range of options, including vegan and gluten-free choices, and ensure that there are sufficient staff and resources to manage food and beverage sales.",
    "**Safety Concerns**: The festival's large crowds and confined spaces may pose safety risks, such as overcrowding, noise pollution, or even accidents. To mitigate these risks, the festival could implement crowd control measures, such as designated entry and exit points, and provide clear signage and instructions to attendees."
