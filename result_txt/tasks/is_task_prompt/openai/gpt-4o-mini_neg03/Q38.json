    "Once, in a quiet village, a brilliant star named Liora longed to experience life on Earth. One fateful night, she descended, transforming into a radiant girl. The villagers were enchanted by her glow, but Liora felt lonely, missing the cosmos. A kind child named Leo befriended her, sharing dreams and laughter. Together, they explored fields and danced under the moonlight. Liora taught Leo to wish upon stars, igniting hope in the village. When the time came for her to return, she gifted Leo a sparkling stone, promising to watch over him. With a heavy heart, she soared back, forever a guardian of dreams.",
