    "**Smart Waffle Iron with App Integration**: Develop a smart waffle iron that connects to a mobile app. The app could provide users with recipes, cooking times, and temperature settings based on the type of batter being used (gluten-free, vegan, etc.). It could also feature a built-in timer and notifications when the waffles are ready, ensuring perfectly cooked results every time.",
    "**Built-in Batter Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in batter dispenser with adjustable portion control. This feature would allow users to easily pour the exact amount of batter needed for each waffle, reducing mess and ensuring uniformity in size and thickness. The dispenser could also be designed to accommodate different types of batters.",
    "**Customizable Temperature Settings**: Introduce a waffle iron with customizable temperature settings that allow users to select their desired level of crispiness. This feature would cater to personal preferences, enabling some users to enjoy soft, fluffy waffles while others could opt for extra crispy ones.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Create a waffle iron with a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam to clean the plates after use. Users would simply add water to a designated compartment, and the waffle iron would heat up to create steam, loosening any stuck-on batter. This innovation would save time and effort in cleaning.",
    "**Waffle Iron with a Built-in Griddle**: Design a waffle iron that also functions as a griddle. This dual-functionality would allow users to cook eggs, bacon, or other breakfast items alongside their waffles. A hinged design could allow the top to lift away, providing ample cooking space for a complete breakfast."
