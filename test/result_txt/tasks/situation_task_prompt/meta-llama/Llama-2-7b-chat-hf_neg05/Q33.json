    "Nature's Rhythm: Utilize the natural rhythm of the environment to keep track of time. For instance, observe the sun's position in the sky to estimate time. Mark the position of the sun at different times of the day and use those marks to determine the time.",
    "Body Clock: Use the human body's internal clock to keep track of time. The body's circadian rhythm regulates the sleep-wake cycle, and people tend to feel more alert during specific times of the day. By observing these patterns, one can estimate the time. For example, if a person feels more alert during the morning hours, they can assume it's around 9 am.",
    "Sand Hourglass: Create a sand hourglass with different-sized grains of sand to indicate different time intervals. The faster the grains flow, the less time has passed. This method is similar to the traditional hourglass, but with a more creative twist.",
    "Music Timing: Use music to keep track of time. Different genres and tempos can be associated with specific time intervals. For example, a fast-paced song can indicate 15 minutes have passed, while a slow and melancholic tune can indicate 30 minutes have passed. This method requires a good sense of rhythm and musical knowledge.",
    "Shadow Strikes: Observe the position and length of shadows to estimate time. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadows change position and length. By marking the position and length of shadows at different times of the day, one can determine the time. This method requires careful observation and attention to detail."
