    "Personalized recommendations: The shopping cart could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the customer's previous purchases and suggest complementary items that they may be interested in. For example, if a customer frequently buys chocolate, the shopping cart could suggest other sweet treats or snacks.",
    "Virtual try-on: The shopping cart could include a virtual try-on feature, allowing customers to see how clothes, makeup, or other products would look on them before making a purchase. This could be especially useful for online shopping, where customers can't physically try on items before buying.",
    "Price comparison: The shopping cart could include a price comparison feature, allowing customers to see if the items in their cart are the best price available online. This could help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and potentially save them money.",
    "Sustainable shopping: The shopping cart could include a feature that suggests sustainable or eco-friendly alternatives to the items in the customer's cart. This could help customers make more environmentally conscious purchasing decisions.",
    "Recipe suggestions: If the shopping cart contains items commonly used in cooking, such as vegetables or meats, the shopping cart could suggest recipes that use those items. This could help customers make more use of the items they already have and potentially reduce food waste."
