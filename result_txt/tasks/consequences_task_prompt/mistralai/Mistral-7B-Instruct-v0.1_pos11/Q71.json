    "If immortality was discovered, it could revolutionize the way we approach science and medicine.

However, it could also lead to a lack of innovation as people no longer have the pressure of dying to drive them forward.",
    "The discovery of immortality could have a significant impact on religion and spirituality. It could lead to a shift in beliefs about the afterlife and the purpose of life. People might become more focused on living in the present and less concerned with the afterlife. However, it could also lead to a rise in religious extremism as people struggle to come to terms with the new reality.",
    "If immortality was discovered, it could have a profound impact on society. It could lead to a more egalitarian society as people no longer have to worry about their place in the afterlife. However, it could also lead to a society where people become complacent and lose their drive to achieve.",
    "The discovery of immortality could lead to a revolution in the way we approach technology. With people living longer, there would be a greater demand for advanced medical technologies and treatments.
