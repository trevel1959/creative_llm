    "Radiation Exposure: Mars has a thin atmosphere, and there is no magnetic field to protect against solar radiation. This could lead to health problems such as skin cancer and cataracts.",
    "Lack of Gravity: Mars has only 38% of the gravity of Earth, which could lead to bone density loss and muscle atrophy.",
    "Extreme Temperatures: Mars has extreme temperatures, ranging from -195 degrees Fahrenheit at the poles to 70 degrees Fahrenheit at the equator. This could make it difficult to build structures and conduct experiments.",
    "Lack of Breathable Air: Mars' atmosphere is thin and contains carbon dioxide, which is toxic to humans. This could make it difficult to breathe and could lead to respiratory problems.",
    "Communication Challenges: Communication with Earth could be challenging due to the distance between the two planets. This could make it difficult to receive instructions and support from mission control."
