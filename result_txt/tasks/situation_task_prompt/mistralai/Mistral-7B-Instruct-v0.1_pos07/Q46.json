    "Create a composting system: One way to manage waste without trash cans would be to create a composting system. This could involve setting up a compost bin or pile in a designated area of your property, where you can collect organic waste such as food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings. The compost can then be used to fertilize plants and gardens, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.",
    "Reuse containers: Another way to manage waste would be to reuse containers as much as possible. This could involve using jars, cans, and other reusable containers to store and transport food, rather than using single-use plastic bags or containers.",
    "Recycle properly: Recycling is still an important part of waste management, even without trash cans. To properly recycle, you would need to sort your waste by type and dispose of it in the appropriate recycling bin or location. This could involve setting up a recycling station in your home or garage.",
    "Donate or sell: If you have items that you no longer need or use, consider donating or selling them instead of throwing them away. This can help reduce waste and give someone else the opportunity to use or enjoy the item.",
    "Compostable products: Another way to manage waste without trash cans would be to switch to using compostable products. This could involve using compostable plates, cups, and utensils instead of plastic ones, as well as using compostable cleaning products and personal care items. While compostable products may not break down as quickly as advertised, they are still a better alternative to traditional plastic products."
