    "**Smart Mug with Built-in Thermometer and Temperature Control**: Design a coffee mug that not only keeps drinks at the perfect temperature but also allows users to adjust the temperature to their liking. The mug would have a built-in thermometer and a temperature control system that can be adjusted using a mobile app. This would ensure that the coffee is always at the perfect temperature, whether it's piping hot or just right.",
    "**Coffee Mug with Integrated Coffee Grinder and Brewer**: Create a coffee mug that has an integrated coffee grinder and brewer. The user would simply add coffee grounds to the mug, close the lid, and the built-in grinder would grind the beans to the perfect consistency. The brewer would then heat the water to the optimal temperature and brew the coffee directly into the mug. This would eliminate the need for separate coffee makers and grinders.",
    "**Smart Mug with Personalized Coffee Recommendations**: Develop a coffee mug that uses AI to analyze the user's coffee preferences and provide personalized recommendations. The mug would have a built-in sensor that tracks the user's coffee consumption and preferences, and would suggest new coffee blends and brewing methods based on their data. This would help users discover new coffee flavors and improve their coffee-making skills.",
    "**Coffee Mug with Built-in Coffee Flavor Enhancer**: Design a coffee mug that has a built-in flavor enhancer that can add a variety of flavors to the coffee. The mug would have a built-in cartridge system that allows users to switch between different flavors, such as vanilla, hazelnut, or caramel. This would allow users to customize their coffee to their liking and try new flavors without having to buy separate flavorings.",
    "**Coffee Mug with Integrated Coffee Storage and Travel Case**: Create a coffee mug that has an integrated storage compartment for coffee beans, sugar, and creamer. The mug would also have a built-in travel case that allows users to take their coffee on-the-go. The storage compartment would be accessible through a small door on the side of the mug, and the travel case would be designed to fit snugly in a backpack or purse. This would make it easy for users to take their coffee with them wherever they go.
