    "**Smart Fridge Shelf**: A shelf that adjusts its temperature and humidity levels based on the type of food stored on it. For example, a shelf for fruits would maintain a high humidity level, while a shelf for meats would maintain a low humidity level. This would ensure that food is stored at optimal conditions, reducing spoilage and extending shelf life.",
    "**Automated Meal Planning and Grocery List Generation**: A built-in AI-powered system that suggests meal plans based on the user's dietary preferences and the ingredients available in the fridge. It would also generate a grocery list for the user to pick up the necessary ingredients.",
    "**Fridge-to-Table Integration**: A feature that allows users to scan the contents of their fridge and generate a recipe based on the ingredients available. The recipe would be displayed on a screen, and the user could even order the necessary ingredients online.",
    "**Smart Fridge Storage**: A system that uses sensors and AI to optimize storage space in the fridge. It would suggest the best way to store food to minimize waste and make the most of the available space.",
    "**Freshness Tracking**: A feature that tracks the freshness of food stored in the fridge and provides users with a \"freshness score\" for each item. This would help users keep track of when food is near its expiration date and make meal planning easier."
