    "\"Everyone else managed to do it; why can't you?\" is a negative and self-defeating question. It's important to focus on what you can do and how you can improve rather than dwelling on what others have done.",
    "Instead of focusing on what you can't do, try to break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you focus on progress rather than failure.",
    "Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone else was able to do something, it doesn't mean that you can't do it too.",
    "Seek out guidance and support from others who may have more experience or expertise in the task at hand. This can help you learn from their mistakes and improve your own performance.",
    "Don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to make mistakes and fail sometimes. The key is to learn from those experiences and use them to improve in the future."
