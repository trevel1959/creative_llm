    "**Multi-Function Wine Tool**: Design a wine opener that incorporates multiple tools into one device. Besides the corkscrew, it could include a foil cutter, a wine aerator, and a bottle stopper. This all-in-one tool would simplify the wine-opening process, making it convenient for picnics or gatherings where space is limited.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Grip Enhancements**: Create a wine opener with an ergonomic design that fits comfortably in the hand. Incorporate soft-touch grips made from a non-slip material that provides better control, especially for those with limited hand strength. This design could also feature a rotating handle that requires less effort to extract the cork.",
    "**Cork Recycling Compartment**: Innovate a wine opener with a built-in compartment for storing used corks. This feature would encourage users to recycle corks instead of throwing them away. The compartment could be easily accessible and designed to hold multiple corks, promoting sustainability and allowing users to keep track of the wines they've enjoyed.",
    "**Temperature-Sensing Corkscrew**: Develop a wine opener with a built-in temperature sensor that informs the user whether the wine is at its ideal serving temperature. The device could use color-coded LED lights to indicate if the wine is too cold, too warm, or just right. This would enhance the overall wine-drinking experience by ensuring optimal flavor and aroma.",
    "**Self-Adjusting Corkscrew**: Introduce a wine opener that automatically adjusts to different cork types (natural, synthetic, etc.) and sizes. Using sensors, the device would detect the cork material and apply the appropriate amount of torque to extract it without breaking. This innovation would be especially useful for novice wine drinkers who may struggle with different cork types."
