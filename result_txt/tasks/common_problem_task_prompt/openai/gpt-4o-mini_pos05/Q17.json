    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and facilities can lead to significant environmental degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and wildlife displacement. Additionally, the carbon footprint of international travel for athletes and spectators can be substantial. To address this, host cities can adopt sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials for construction, implementing waste reduction strategies, and promoting carbon offset programs for travel.",
    "**Security Concerns**: With a massive gathering of people from around the world, security becomes a major issue. Potential threats include terrorism, protests, and health emergencies (like pandemics). Ensuring the safety of athletes and spectators requires careful planning and coordination among various security agencies. To enhance security, host cities can employ advanced surveillance technology, conduct thorough background checks, and establish emergency response protocols.",
    "**Economic Disparity**: While the Olympics can boost local economies, there is a risk that the benefits may not be evenly distributed. Local businesses may struggle to compete with large corporations that dominate sponsorship and advertising opportunities. Additionally, the costs associated with hosting the Olympics may lead to increased taxes for residents. To combat this, organizers can create programs that prioritize local businesses, offer grants to small enterprises, and ensure that profits from the event are reinvested into the community.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity**: Hosting the Olympics in a culturally diverse environment presents challenges related to cultural representation and sensitivity. Misrepresentation or appropriation of local customs and traditions can lead to backlash from the community. To foster inclusivity, organizers should involve local cultural leaders in planning and decision-making processes, ensure diverse representation in ceremonies, and educate athletes and visitors about local customs and practices.",
    "**Athlete Welfare**: The pressure to perform at the Olympics can lead to mental health issues among athletes, exacerbated by rigorous training schedules and high expectations. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding athlete safety, especially in contact sports. To prioritize athlete welfare, organizers can provide mental health resources, establish a support system for athletes, and ensure that safety protocols are in place for all events."
