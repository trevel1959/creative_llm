    "Adjustable Frame Design: Another idea could be to create glasses with adjustable frame designs. This would allow users to customize the fit of their glasses to their face shape and comfort level. The frames could be made from lightweight materials and have adjustable nose pads and temple tips to ensure a comfortable fit.",
    "Self-cleaning Glasses: Another improvement could be to create glasses with self-cleaning properties. This could be achieved by incorporating nanotechnology into the lens material, which would repel dirt, dust, and moisture. This would eliminate the need for lens cleaners and make the glasses more durable and long-lasting.",
    "Temperature-sensitive Lenses: Another idea could be to create glasses with temperature-sensitive lenses. These lenses could change color and tint based on the temperature of the environment. For example, the lenses could become darker in bright sunlight and lighter in low light conditions.",
    "Wireless Connectivity: Another improvement could be to create glasses with wireless connectivity. This could be achieved by incorporating Bluetooth technology into the design. This would allow users to listen to music, answer phone calls, and access other smartphone features without having to take their phone out of their pocket.",
    "Prescription-less Glasses: Another idea could be to create glasses that do not require a prescription. These glasses could be designed to correct common vision problems such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. They could be made using a combination of specialized lens designs and materials to provide clear vision for a wide range of users."
