    "Develop a new type of technology that allows individuals to \"see\" through their skin or other body parts. This could be done through a special device or app that uses sensors to detect vibrations or pressure changes in the surrounding environment, which could then be translated into visual information for the user.",
    "Create a community-based system where people with poor vision can share their experiences and knowledge with one another. This could involve hosting regular meetings or events where individuals can exchange tips on how to navigate their surroundings, as well as provide emotional support and encouragement.",
    "Develop a line of wearable devices that use advanced artificial intelligence to help individuals with poor vision better understand their surroundings. These devices could use a combination of cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms to analyze images and provide real-time feedback to the wearer about what they are seeing.",
    "Create a virtual reality experience that allows individuals with poor vision to explore and interact with their surroundings in a safe and controlled environment. This could involve using specialized VR headsets and controllers to create realistic simulations of different environments, such as streets, parks, and buildings.",
    "Partner with local organizations and businesses to offer training and education programs for individuals with poor vision. These programs could cover a range of topics, including navigation techniques, communication strategies, and self-care practices, and could be tailored to meet the specific needs and challenges faced by each individual."
