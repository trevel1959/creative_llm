    "**Personal Drone Transport**: With the disappearance of roads, personal drones could become the primary mode of transportation. Individuals could own small, user-friendly drones equipped with AI navigation systems that would allow them to travel short distances quickly and efficiently. Drones could be designed to take off and land vertically, making them ideal for urban environments. This system could also include designated landing zones on rooftops, reducing congestion at ground level.",
    "**Waterway Utilization**: In cities with rivers, lakes, or canals, boats and ferries could become the main form of transport. A network of water taxis could be established, providing efficient routes across the city. These boats could be solar-powered or use clean energy sources, ensuring minimal environmental impact. Additionally, floating bike docks could allow cyclists to pedal to the water's edge, park their bikes, and hop on a water taxi for longer distances.",
    "**Magnetic Levitation Pods**: Inspired by futuristic concepts, cities could implement a network of magnetic levitation pods that glide silently above the ground. These pods would be powered by renewable energy and could transport passengers quickly from one point to another without the need for traditional roads. They could operate on a subscription model, where users can summon a pod through a smartphone app, making commuting convenient and eco-friendly.",
    "**Automated Pedestrian Shuttles**: Envision a fleet of automated, electric shuttles that operate on predetermined routes throughout the city. These shuttles would be designed for pedestrians, allowing them to hop on and off at various stops without the need for a road network. The shuttles could be equipped with interactive displays providing information about local attractions, events, and public services, creating an engaging and informative travel experience.",
    "**Neighborhood Zip Lines**: For a more adventurous mode of transport, neighborhoods could implement zip line systems connecting various points of interest. Residents could travel between parks, community centers, and markets by gliding through the air on harnesses. This system would not only provide a fun way to get around but also foster a sense of community as people share the experience of traveling together through the sky."
