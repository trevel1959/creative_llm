    "Introduce a smart vacuum cleaner that can navigate through a house on its own, but also responds to voice commands to clean specific areas or rooms. This can be done through the use of sensors and machine learning algorithms that allow the vacuum to learn the layout of the house and the preferred cleaning patterns of the user.",
    "Develop a vacuum cleaner that uses advanced suction technology to remove dirt and debris from hard-to-reach areas, such as under furniture or in corners. This can be achieved through the use of flexible suction hoses and brushes that can easily maneuver into tight spaces.",
    "Create a vacuum cleaner that is designed to be eco-friendly, using energy-efficient motors and filters that can be easily replaced. The vacuum can also be programmed to clean at specific times or on a schedule, reducing the need for manual cleaning.",
    "Develop a vacuum cleaner that is equipped with a robotic arm that can pick up and dispose of small objects, such as toys or paper clips. The arm can be controlled through a mobile app or voice commands, allowing the user to easily clean up clutter without having to bend down.",
    "Create a vacuum cleaner that is designed to be self-cleaning, using advanced cleaning technology to remove dirt and debris from the brush rolls and filters. The vacuum can also be programmed to clean itself on a regular basis, reducing the need for manual maintenance."
