    "Cosmic Whale: Create a constellation in the shape of a majestic whale, swimming through the cosmos. The whale's body would be depicted as a large, glowing arc, with smaller stars and galaxies forming the tail, fins, and eyes. The constellation would be visible in the night sky during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Celestial Garden: Imagine a constellation resembling a lush, vibrant garden, filled with stars and galaxies that twinkle and shine like flowers and trees. The constellation would feature a central \"tree\" made of a cluster of bright, blue stars, surrounded by a halo of smaller, yellow stars that resemble blossoms. The constellation would be visible in the springtime in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Cosmic Dragon: Create a constellation in the shape of a powerful dragon, soaring through the cosmos. The dragon's body would be depicted as a long, curved line of stars, with smaller stars and galaxies forming the wings, tail, and eyes. The constellation would be visible in the autumn months in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Galactic Wheel: Imagine a constellation that looks like a giant cosmic wheel, with stars and galaxies forming the spokes and rim. The wheel would be surrounded by a halo of smaller stars, creating the illusion of movement and rotation. The constellation would be visible year-round in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Stellar Fractal: Create a constellation that resembles a fractal, with stars and galaxies repeating patterns of self-similarity at different scales. The constellation would feature a central \"seed\" of bright, blue stars, surrounded by a halo of smaller, yellow stars that repeat the pattern in a never-ending spiral. The constellation would be visible in the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere."
