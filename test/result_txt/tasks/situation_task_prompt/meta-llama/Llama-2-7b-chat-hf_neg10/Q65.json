    "Mirrors as Reflective Surfaces: One creative solution to light up a room without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use mirrors as reflective surfaces. By positioning mirrors strategically around the room, you can bounce light from one mirror to another, creating a warm and cozy ambiance. For example, you could place a large mirror on one wall and hang smaller mirrors on the opposite wall, creating a chain reaction of light reflection. This not only provides adequate lighting but also adds a touch of elegance to the room.",
    "Natural Light Harvesting: Another creative solution is to harness the power of natural light. By opening curtains, blinds, or windows during the day, you can allow natural light to enter the room and illuminate it naturally. This not only saves energy but also creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. Additionally, you could consider installing skylights or larger windows to maximize the amount of natural light entering the room.",
    "Glowing Plants: Indoor plants with glowing leaves or stems can provide a unique and creative solution to lighting a room.

By placing these plants around the room, you can create a subtle and soothing glow without the need for artificial lighting.",
    "Light-Emitting Artwork: Another creative solution is to incorporate light-emitting artwork into the room. Artists have been experimenting with various light-emitting materials, such as LEDs, EL wire, and neon, to create unique and eye-catching pieces. By hanging these artworks on the walls or placing them on shelves, you can add a touch of color and light to the room without the need for traditional lighting fixtures.",
    "Sound-to-Light Technology: Finally, you could explore the use of sound-to-light technology to create a unique and immersive lighting experience. By attaching sensors to sound-sensitive light bulbs, you can create a system where sound waves trigger the lights to change color, brightness, or pattern. This can create a dynamic and interactive lighting experience that responds to the sounds in the"
