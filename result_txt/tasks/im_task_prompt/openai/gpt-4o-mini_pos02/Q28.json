    "**Adjustable Ventilation System**: Design a helmet with an adjustable ventilation system that allows cyclists to control airflow based on weather conditions. The helmet could have sliding vents that open or close with a simple mechanism, providing maximum comfort during hot days while still maintaining safety standards.",
    "**Customizable Exterior Panels**: Create a helmet with interchangeable exterior panels that can be easily swapped out. Cyclists could personalize their helmets with different colors, patterns, or even reflective materials for visibility. This feature would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also allow for easy updates to reflect seasonal trends or personal style.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Incorporate a Bluetooth communication system within the helmet that allows cyclists to connect with their smartphones for navigation, music, or hands-free calling. The system could include bone conduction speakers that deliver sound directly to the ear without blocking ambient noise, ensuring the cyclist remains aware of their surroundings.",
    "**Enhanced Impact Resistance Materials**: Research and implement advanced materials such as graphene or carbon fiber composites to improve the helmet's impact resistance while keeping it lightweight. This innovation would provide better protection against concussions and head injuries without sacrificing comfort or increasing bulk.",
    "**Built-in Cooling and Heating Technology**: Introduce a temperature-regulating feature within the helmet, utilizing phase change materials that absorb heat in the summer and release it in the winter. This technology would ensure that cyclists remain comfortable regardless of the weather, encouraging longer rides and more frequent use."
