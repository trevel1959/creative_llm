    "Wear a Solar Hat: Design a hat with a special UV-blocking material that can absorb and deflect harmful sunrays, providing a barrier between your head and the sun. This hat could be worn during outdoor activities and would offer a stylish and practical solution for protecting your head from sunburn.",
    "Use a Sun-Sensing Scarf: Develop a scarf with a built-in UV sensor that detects the sun's rays and adjusts its thickness accordingly. When the sun is strongest, the scarf would expand to provide maximum protection, and when it's weaker, it would contract to allow for better airflow and cooling.",
    "Create a Solar Shield: Design a lightweight, portable shield that can be placed on top of your head to protect it from the sun. This shield could be made of a reflective material that bounces UV rays away from your head, or it could be made of a mesh material that allows for airflow while still providing coverage.",
    "Invent a Hair-Like Fabric: Develop a fabric that mimics the properties of human hair, with a special UV-absorbing coating that protects your head from sunburn. This fabric could be woven into clothing or used as a standalone fabric for hats or scarves.",
    "Use a Sun-Blocking Spray: Create a spray that can be applied to your scalp to provide on-the-go sun protection. This spray could contain UV-absorbing ingredients that block harmful rays, providing a quick and easy way to protect your head from sunburn without the need for a hat or scarf."
