    "**GPS Tracking Device**: Integrate a GPS tracking system into car keys to ensure they're never lost. This would allow users to locate their keys through a smartphone app or website. If the keys are misplaced or stolen, the owner can still track their location, which can be a lifesaver in situations where keys are needed urgently.",
    "**Biometric Security**: Develop car keys that incorporate biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition technology. This ensures only authorized individuals can access the vehicle, enhancing security and privacy. The keys would also double as personal identification devices for accessing various services related to the car, like booking maintenance appointments or purchasing fuel.",
    "**Vehicle Health Monitoring**: Create car keys that monitor the overall health of the vehicle and alert the owner to potential issues before they become serious. By connecting to the car’s onboard diagnostics (OBD) system, the key could detect problems with the engine, brakes, or other critical components, sending notifications to the driver's phone when maintenance is required.",
    "**Smart Fuel Management**: Design car keys equipped with sensors that monitor fuel levels and efficiency. This would enable drivers to easily check how much fuel is left in the tank and estimate the range of the vehicle. Additionally, these keys could suggest more fuel-efficient routes or driving styles based on real-time data, helping to save money on gasoline and reduce environmental impact.",
    "**Emergency Response Integration**: Implement car keys that include emergency features, such as一键呼叫（one-touch call）to local emergency services. In case of an accident or medical emergency, pressing a specific button on the key could immediately contact emergency responders with the vehicle's location and basic information about the occupants, potentially saving valuable time in critical situations."
