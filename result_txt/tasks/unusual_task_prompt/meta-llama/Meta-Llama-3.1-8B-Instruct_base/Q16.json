    "**Edible Art Cereal Box**: Design a cereal box that doubles as a canvas for edible art. The box would be made of a special material that can withstand the humidity and temperature changes during shipping and storage. Upon opening the box, the consumer would find a set of edible paints and brushes made from natural ingredients like food coloring, honey, and plant-based dyes. The consumer can then create their own edible art on the box, using the cereal as a base. The artwork can be a simple design or a complex masterpiece, depending on the consumer's creativity. The finished artwork can be shared on social media using a special hashtag, and the consumer can even win prizes for their creations.",
    "**Cereal Box VR Experience**: Create a cereal box that comes with a VR headset and a companion app. When the consumer opens the box, they're transported to a virtual world where they can explore different environments, play games, and interact with virtual characters. The VR experience would be tied to the cereal's brand and theme, such as a jungle adventure for a tropical fruit-flavored cereal or a space exploration for a galaxy-themed cereal. The VR experience would be a unique way to engage consumers and make breakfast more exciting.",
    "**Sustainable Cereal Box**: Design a cereal box made from a biodegradable material that can be composted and turned into nutrient-rich soil. The box would be made from a plant-based material like cornstarch or sugarcane, and would be fully compostable. The cereal itself would be made from sustainable ingredients, such as organic oats and fair-trade cocoa. The consumer can compost the box and use the resulting soil to grow their own herbs or vegetables, promoting a closed-loop system and reducing waste.",
    "**Cereal Box Mystery Box**: Create a cereal box that contains a mystery surprise inside. The box would be designed to look like a regular cereal box, but when the consumer opens it, they'd find a hidden compartment containing a unique item, such as a collectible toy, a sticker, or a special coupon. The mystery item would be tied to the cereal's brand and theme, and would encourage consumers to share their finds on social media using a branded hashtag.",
    "**Cereal Box Time Capsule**: Design a cereal box that doubles as a time capsule. The box would be made from a special material that can withstand the test of time, and would contain a letter or message from the consumer to their future self. The cereal itself would be a special \"time capsule\" flavor"
