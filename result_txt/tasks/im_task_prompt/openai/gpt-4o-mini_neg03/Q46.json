    "**Integrated Measurement Tool**: Incorporate a measuring tape along the side of the scissors. This would allow users to measure and cut materials in one motion, eliminating the need for a separate measuring tool. The tape could be retractable and marked in both metric and imperial units, making it versatile for various crafting or DIY projects.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade Technology**: Introduce color-coded blades that change color based on the type of material being cut. For example, a blade might turn green for paper, red for fabric, and blue for plastic. This feature would help users quickly identify the right scissors for the job and prevent cross-contamination of materials, especially in crafting and sewing.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Mechanism**: Develop a self-sharpening blade system that uses a small ceramic sharpening edge integrated into the scissors. As the blades are used, they would automatically sharpen themselves, ensuring they remain effective over time without the need for manual sharpening. This would be particularly beneficial for professionals who rely on sharp scissors daily.",
    "**Built-In Safety Features**: Design scissors with a retractable blade feature that can be engaged when the scissors are not in use. This would prevent accidental cuts and injuries, making them safer for children and in busy work environments. Additionally, the scissors could have a locking mechanism that keeps the blades closed when not in use.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors**: Create a pair of scissors that incorporates additional tools, such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, or even a small knife blade. This would transform the scissors into a versatile multi-tool, ideal for outdoor activities, crafting, or home repairs. Each tool could be designed to fold into the handle when not in use to maintain a compact size."
