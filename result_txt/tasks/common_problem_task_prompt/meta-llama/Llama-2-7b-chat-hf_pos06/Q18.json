    "Community-based energy sharing: Create a network of community-based energy sharing systems, where homes and businesses can share excess energy generated from renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would reduce the reliance on the grid and provide a more sustainable and resilient energy system. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Vertical farming: Develop vertical farming techniques that can be used in urban areas, allowing for more efficient use of land and reduced transportation costs. This would increase food security and reduce the carbon footprint of food production. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Solar-powered water purification: Develop a solar-powered water purification system that can be used in remote areas without access to clean water. This would provide a sustainable and reliable source of clean water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Biogas-powered transportation: Develop biogas-powered vehicles that can run on waste biomass, such as food waste and agricultural waste. This would reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Smart energy storage: Develop advanced energy storage systems that can store excess energy generated from renewable sources for use during periods of high demand or when the sun is not shining. This would improve the overall efficiency of the energy system and reduce the need for fossil fuels. Confidence score: 0.9"
