    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester (AWH)**: Develop a device that can extract water from the air, even in arid environments. This could be achieved by using a network of nanomaterial-based fibers that can absorb moisture from the air, similar to how a sponge works. The fibers would be arranged in a mesh-like structure, allowing for maximum surface area exposure to the atmosphere. As the air passes through the mesh, the fibers would absorb the water vapor, which would then be collected and condensed into liquid water. This system could be powered by solar energy, making it a sustainable and efficient solution for water collection.",
    "**Condensation-based Water Collector (CW)**: Design a system that utilizes a network of fine tubes or channels to collect and condense water vapor from the air. The tubes would be coated with a hydrophilic (water-attracting) material that enhances water absorption. As the air passes through the tubes, the water vapor would condense onto the inner surface, forming droplets that would then be collected and channeled into a central reservoir. This system could be integrated into buildings or structures, providing a reliable source of clean water.",
    "**Mist Collector (MC)**: Develop a device that captures and condenses water droplets from the air, even in low-humidity environments. The MC would consist of a series of concentric rings or discs with a mesh-like structure, allowing air to pass through while trapping water droplets. As the air passes through the rings, the water droplets would be collected and condensed onto the surface, where they would be channeled into a central collection point. This system could be powered by wind or solar energy.",
    "**Bio-inspired Water Harvester (BIWH)**: Draw inspiration from nature to create a water-harvesting system that mimics the way plants collect water. The BIWH would consist of a network of thin, branching channels that resemble the vascular system of plants. As air passes through the channels, water vapor would condense onto the surface, forming droplets that would then be collected and channeled into a central reservoir. This system could be powered by solar energy and would require minimal maintenance.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Fog Collector (SPWFC)**: Design a system that collects water from fog, even in areas with low precipitation. The SPWFC would consist of a series of vertical or inclined panels coated with a hydrophilic material. As fog passes through the panels, the water droplets would"
