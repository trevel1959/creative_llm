The museum could feature interactive exhibits, virtual reality experiences, and preserved specimens of the ocean's former inhabitants. Visitors could learn about the impact of climate change on the ocean and the importance of preserving marine ecosystems.",
    "Floating Cities: The dried-up ocean could become the foundation for floating cities, providing a unique and sustainable way of living. The cities could be designed to mimic the natural habitat of the ocean, with buildings and infrastructure integrated into the landscape. The cities could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and could serve as a model for sustainable urban planning.",
    "Aquatic Parks: The dried-up ocean could be converted into a series of interconnected aquatic parks, offering a variety of water-based attractions and activities. The parks could feature water slides, wave pools, and lazy rivers, as well as more educational exhibits and experiences, such as interactive displays on marine life and conservation efforts.",
    "Desert Oasis: The dried-up ocean could be transformed into a desert oasis, complete with palm trees, sandy beaches, and a variety of flora and fauna that are adapted to the harsh desert environment. The oasis could become a popular tourist destination, offering visitors a unique and exotic experience.",
    "Artificial Reef: The dried-up ocean could be transformed into an artificial reef, providing a new habitat for marine life. The reef could be designed to mimic the natural structure of a coral reef, with artificial coral formations and a variety of marine species. The artificial reef could also serve as a platform for scientific research and conservation efforts, providing a unique opportunity to study the behavior and ecology of marine life in a controlled environment."
