    "**Reflective Fabrics**: Imagine a world where clothing and textiles are embedded with reflective materials. You could wear a garment made of a fabric that reflects light, allowing you to catch glimpses of your reflection as you move. These outfits could come in various styles and colors, turning self-admiration into a fashion statement. This would spark creativity in fashion design, as individuals would seek to incorporate these materials into everyday wear.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: With the disappearance of physical mirrors, AR technology could fill the gap by allowing users to see their reflections through smart glasses. By using facial recognition and overlaying a digital representation of the individual, these glasses could provide an interactive experience where users can try on different hairstyles, makeup, or outfits in real-time, blending the virtual and physical worlds seamlessly.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces in Architecture**: Urban design could evolve to include buildings with highly reflective surfaces, such as polished metals or glass facades. People could walk through city streets and see their reflections in the architecture around them. This would not only serve the purpose of self-reflection but also create an artistic and dynamic urban environment, where the interplay of light and reflections becomes part of the city's aesthetic.",
    "**Personal Reflection Apps**: With the absence of mirrors, mobile apps could be developed that use the front camera of smartphones or tablets to show users their reflections. These apps could include features like beauty filters, makeup try-ons, or even body shape analysis. This digital solution would allow individuals to engage with their appearance in a modern way, integrating technology into daily self-care routines.",
    "**Reflective Art Installations**: Artists could create immersive installations using reflective materials such as polished metal, glass, or even holographic displays. These installations would not only serve as a means to see oneself but also provoke thought and self-exploration through artistic expression. Visitors could walk through these installations, interacting with the art while reflecting on their identities and perceptions."
