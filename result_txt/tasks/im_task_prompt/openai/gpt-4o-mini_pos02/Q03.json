    "**Multi-Zone Cooking Technology**:    Introduce a microwave with a multi-zone cooking feature that allows users to cook different foods at different power levels simultaneously. This would involve a rotating turntable that can separate sections, ensuring that delicate items donâ€™t overcook while denser foods are heated. This feature would be perfect for reheating leftovers or cooking multiple components of a meal at once.",
    "**Built-In Food Scanner**:    Incorporate a food scanning system that uses sensors and cameras to identify the type of food placed inside the microwave. Once detected, it would suggest optimal cooking times and settings, eliminating guesswork and preventing overcooking. This feature could be paired with a voice assistant for hands-free operation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**:    Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses steam technology to sanitize the interior of the microwave. Users could activate this function after cooking, and the microwave would heat water to create steam, loosening any food particles and odors. This would simplify maintenance and ensure a hygienic cooking environment.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Eco Mode**:    Design a microwave with an eco mode that optimizes energy consumption based on usage patterns. For example, it could reduce power during standby times or use energy-efficient settings for common tasks like reheating coffee or defrosting food. Users could monitor their energy savings through an app, promoting sustainable cooking habits.",
    "**Customizable Interior Lighting**:    Create a microwave with customizable LED interior lighting that changes color based on the cooking process. For instance, a blue light could indicate defrosting, while a green light could signify reheating. This not only enhances the user experience but also adds a modern aesthetic to the kitchen."
