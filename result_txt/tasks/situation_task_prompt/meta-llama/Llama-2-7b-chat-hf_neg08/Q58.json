    "Insect-Repelling Plant Covers: Develop a line of plant covers that use natural dyes and essential oils to repel insects. These covers can be placed over plants in gardens, greenhouses, and indoor spaces to prevent infestations without harming the environment.",
    "AI-Powered Insect Traps: Create an automated insect trap that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify and capture specific pest species. The trap could be powered by solar energy and use a combination of sensors, cameras, and robotics to efficiently capture and remove pests.",
    "Insect-Repelling Textiles: Develop a new type of textile that incorporates insect-repelling properties into the fabric. This could involve using natural fibers infused with essential oils or synthetic materials coated with insect-repelling coatings. The textiles could be used for clothing, bedding, or upholstery.",
    "Swarm Intelligence-Inspired Pest Control: Develop a decentralized pest control system that leverages the collective behavior of artificial swarms to manage insect populations. This could involve using small, lightweight drones that communicate with each other to locate and eliminate pest insects.",
    "Bioluminescent Insects: Genetically engineer insects to produce bioluminescence, which can be used to repel other insects. This could involve introducing a light-emitting gene into insects, which would make them less attractive to pests and reduce the need for pesticides. The bioluminescent insects could also be used for biocontrol purposes, such as controlling pest populations in agricultural fields."
