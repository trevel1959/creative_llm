    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Collection System**: Develop a vacuum cleaner that uses biodegradable or reusable dust bags made from sustainable materials. This system could include a built-in composter that turns collected organic waste into compost, thus promoting environmental sustainability while reducing the need for disposable bags.",
    "**Multi-Surface Adaptation Technology**: Create a vacuum cleaner equipped with sensors that automatically adjust suction power and brush type based on the surface being cleaned. For instance, when transitioning from carpet to hardwood, the vacuum would lower its suction power to avoid damaging the surface while still effectively picking up dirt and debris.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light or a sonic cleaning process to disinfect and clean the vacuumâ€™s brush rolls and filters after each use. This would ensure that the vacuum maintains optimal performance and hygiene without requiring manual cleaning from the user.",
    "**Modular Design with Attachments**: Design a vacuum cleaner with a modular system that allows users to easily swap out components based on their cleaning needs. Attachments could include specialized tools for pet hair, upholstery, hard-to-reach corners, and even a mini vacuum for car interiors, making the device more versatile and tailored to various cleaning tasks.",
    "**Voice-Activated Control and Integration**: Incorporate voice recognition technology that allows users to control the vacuum cleaner through voice commands. This feature could also enable integration with smart home systems, allowing users to set cleaning schedules or activate the vacuum from anywhere in the house using simple voice prompts."
