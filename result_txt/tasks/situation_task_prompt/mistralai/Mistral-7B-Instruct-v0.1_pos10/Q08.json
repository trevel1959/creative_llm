    "Solar still: A solar still is a simple device that can be used to extract clean drinking water from polluted sources. It uses the sun's heat to evaporate the water, which is then collected in a container. The container is placed in a shaded area, where the water condenses and is collected. This process removes contaminants and impurities, leaving clean drinking water.",
    "Water filtration system: A water filtration system can be used to remove contaminants and impurities from polluted water sources. The system can be designed to target specific types of contaminants, such as bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals. This can be an effective way to obtain clean drinking water from polluted sources.",
    "Water distillation: Water distillation is a process that involves boiling water and then condensing it into a clean, sterile container. This process removes impurities and contaminants, leaving clean drinking water. Water distillation can be done using a variety of devices, including a still or a boiling kettle.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is a process that involves collecting rainwater from rooftops, surfaces, or other sources and storing it for later use. This water can be used for drinking, irrigation, and other purposes. By collecting and storing rainwater, individuals can obtain clean drinking water from polluted sources.",
    "Water purification tablets: Water purification tablets can be used to remove contaminants and impurities from polluted water sources. The tablets work by reacting with the contaminants in the water, neutralizing them and making them harmless. This can be an effective way to obtain clean drinking water from polluted sources, especially in emergency situations."
