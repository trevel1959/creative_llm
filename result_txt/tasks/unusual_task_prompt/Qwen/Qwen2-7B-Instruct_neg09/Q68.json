    "**Interactive Soap Dispenser with Smart Features**: Design a soap dispenser that integrates smart technology, such as touchless activation, real-time health reminders, and energy-saving modes. For instance, it could remind users to wash their hands for the recommended duration (20 seconds) or suggest when they might need to replace the soap refill based on usage data. This innovation not only promotes hygiene but also encourages healthy habits through technology.",
    "**Sustainable Soap Dispenser with Refillable System**: Create a soap dispenser that comes with a refillable container made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastic. Users can easily remove the refillable container, fill it up with their preferred soap, and reuse it, significantly reducing waste compared to traditional single-use dispensers. Additionally, the design could include a label system where users can track the type of soap used, its ingredients, and expiration dates.",
    "**Therapeutic Soap Dispenser with Aromatherapy**: Introduce a soap dispenser that emits essential oils, enhancing the user's experience while promoting relaxation or alertness depending on the chosen scent. For example, lavender oil can be used for relaxation, while peppermint oil can help increase alertness. This feature could be especially beneficial in public spaces like hotels or hospitals, improving the ambiance and overall user experience.",
    "**Customizable Soap Dispenser with Color-Changing LED Lights**: Design a soap dispenser that features LED lights that change color based on the type of soap being dispensed or the time of day. The colors could range from calming blues during bedtime to energizing reds in the morning. This innovative feature adds an aesthetic appeal and personalizes the experience, making the mundane task of washing hands more engaging and enjoyable.",
    "**Smartphone-Controlled Soap Dispenser**: Develop a soap dispenser that connects to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Users can control the dispenser remotely, adjust settings (like the amount of soap dispensed), and receive notifications about maintenance needs or low soap levels. This innovation is particularly useful for busy individuals who may forget to check their soap supply regularly. It also allows for easy integration with home automation systems, providing a seamless and efficient user experience."
