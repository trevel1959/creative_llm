    "food forest: A community-run food forest would be an excellent way to obtain food without supermarkets. Members would contribute to the upkeep of the forest by planting, maintaining, and harvesting their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The food forest would provide a sustainable source of fresh produce, reducing reliance on industrial agriculture and promoting a connection to nature.",
    "Urban farming: With supermarkets gone, urban farming could become a viable alternative for food production. Individuals or communities could set up vertical farms, hydroponic systems, or community gardens in unused spaces such as rooftops, vacant lots, or even indoor spaces. These farms could produce a variety of crops, including leafy greens, herbs, and even meat, providing a reliable source of fresh food.",
    "Local food networks: Closing supermarkets could lead to the rise of local food networks, where individuals and communities come together to share and trade food. This could involve setting up a system of community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, where consumers pay a subscription fee to receive a weekly share of fresh produce from local farmers. Local food networks could also include pop-up markets, farmers' markets, or even time-banking systems, where individuals exchange goods and services based on their skills and resources.",
    "Food salvage and preservation: In the absence of supermarkets, people might turn to salvaging and preserving food waste to ensure a steady supply of food. This could involve foraging for wild edibles, salvaging food from dumpsters, or preserving food through canning, pickling, or dehydrating. Community kitchens or food banks could also play a crucial role in redistributing surplus food to those in need.",
    "Online marketplaces: With supermarkets gone, online marketplaces could become the primary source of food procurement. Platforms like Farmigo or Farmstand could connect consumers directly with local farmers, allowing them to purchase fresh produce and other goods directly from the source. These platforms could also offer educational resources on sustainable food production and consumption, fostering a more informed and connected food culture."
