    "**Immersive Storytelling Experience**: Create an interactive, brick-themed escape room where participants are \"trapped\" in a giant, maze-like brick structure. As they navigate through the labyrinth, they uncover a narrative about a city's history, architecture, and the people who built it. The twist: the bricks themselves become a storytelling device, with hidden messages, symbols, and even augmented reality (AR) elements that bring the story to life.",
    "**Brick-Making Workshop**: Host a hands-on, artisanal brick-making workshop where participants learn the traditional techniques of brick crafting. From mixing and molding to firing and glazing, attendees will create their own unique bricks, which they can take home as a keepsake. The workshop can be paired with a talk on the history and cultural significance of brick-making, highlighting its importance in architecture and community building.",
    "**Brick-Inspired Art Gallery**: Curate an art exhibition featuring works that incorporate brick as a primary medium or theme. Artists can use bricks, brick dust, or even brick-inspired materials to create sculptures, installations, or paintings that explore the tactile, textural, and symbolic qualities of brick. The gallery can also include interactive elements, such as a \"brick-making\" station where visitors can create their own miniature brick art pieces.",
    "**Brick-Themed Board Game Cafe**: Design a board game cafe where players can enjoy a variety of brick-themed games, from strategy and puzzle games to cooperative and competitive titles. The cafe can be designed to resemble a giant brick structure, complete with brick-patterned walls, brick-shaped tables, and brick-inspired decor. Players can also participate in brick-themed challenges and tournaments, with prizes for the winners.",
    "**Brick-Inspired City Planning**: Host a design thinking workshop where participants are tasked with creating a sustainable, brick-based urban development plan for a fictional city. Using a combination of traditional drawing tools and digital software, attendees will design and propose innovative brick-based infrastructure, from eco-friendly buildings to community spaces and public art installations. The workshop can be paired with a talk on the role of brick in urban planning and the importance of sustainable architecture."
