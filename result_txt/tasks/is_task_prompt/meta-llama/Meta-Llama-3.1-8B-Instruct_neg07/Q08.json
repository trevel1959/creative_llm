    "**Cloud Campus**: Design a futuristic school where the entire campus is housed within a massive, floating cloud. The cloud is made of a unique, translucent material that allows natural light to filter in, reducing the need for artificial lighting. The campus is divided into different \"floors\" or \"layers,\" each with its own unique theme and curriculum. Students can move between floors using a network of walkways and elevators, allowing for a seamless and immersive learning experience. The cloud campus also features a range of innovative amenities, including a \"cloud garden\" where students can grow their own food and a \"sky lounge\" with breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.",
