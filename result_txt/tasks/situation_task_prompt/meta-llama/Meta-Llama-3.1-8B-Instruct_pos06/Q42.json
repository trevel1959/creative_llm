    "**Irrigation System**: Create a network of canals and reservoirs to collect and store rainwater. This will provide a reliable source of drinking water and help to irrigate the island's vegetation, potentially attracting wildlife and increasing the chances of rescue. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Fish Farming**: Utilize the island's coral reefs and ocean resources to establish a fish farm. This can be done by constructing a net enclosure around a section of the reef, allowing fish to swim in and out while keeping predators at bay. The farm can provide a sustainable source of protein and help to replenish the island's marine ecosystem. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Solar-Powered Distillation**: Design and build a solar-powered still to purify seawater and make it drinkable. This can be achieved by using a clear plastic sheet to cover a shallow pit, allowing the sun's heat to evaporate the water, which can then be collected and condensed into fresh water. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Coconut Tree Farming**: Plant and nurture coconut trees to provide a source of food, shelter, and tools. Coconuts can be used for their milk, meat, and oil, while the trees' leaves and husks can be used for roofing, bedding, and kindling. (Confidence score: 0.88)",
    "**Signaling Fire and Mirror System**: Create a signaling fire on a hilltop or prominent landmark to attract attention from potential rescuers. Additionally, use a mirror or shiny surface to reflect sunlight towards any passing aircraft or ships during the day, increasing the chances of being spotted. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
