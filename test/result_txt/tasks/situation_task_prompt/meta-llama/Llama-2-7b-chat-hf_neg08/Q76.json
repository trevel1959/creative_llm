    "Carrier Pigeons: In a world without phones, people could use carrier pigeons as a means of long-distance communication. Trainers could be employed to teach pigeons to fly between locations and deliver messages. This method would be slow but reliable, as pigeons could travel long distances in a relatively short amount of time.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to transmit messages over long distances. These pigeons are trained to find their way back home, even when released far away. By attaching a message to the pigeon's leg, the recipient could receive the message when the pigeon returns.",
    "Signal Fires: In ancient times, people used signal fires to communicate over long distances. This method involves building a fire on a hill or mountain and using smoke signals to convey messages. While this method may not be as fast as modern technology, it could be an effective way to communicate in areas with limited infrastructure.",
    "Mirror Signals: In the absence of phones, people could use mirrors to signal messages to each other. This method involves using a mirror to reflect sunlight and create a message in the sky. The message could be created by moving a mirror to reflect light in a specific pattern, such as a series of dots or letters. The recipient could then observe the message by looking for changes in the reflection.",
    "Acoustic Communication: In a world without phones, people could use sound waves to communicate over long distances. This could involve using a series of specific sounds to convey messages, such as a series of whistles or drum beats. The sounds could be used to convey information, such as a specific sequence of notes to represent a message. The recipient could then decipher the message by listening for the specific sounds."
