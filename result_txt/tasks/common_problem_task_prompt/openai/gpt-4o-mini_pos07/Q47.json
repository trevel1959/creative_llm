    "**Power Supply Insufficiency**: A common oversight is underestimating the power requirements of the system. Users may select a power supply unit (PSU) that does not provide enough wattage for all components, especially if they plan to upgrade in the future. To avoid this, one can use a power supply calculator to determine the wattage needed based on the chosen components, ensuring a sufficient power supply is purchased.",
    "**Thermal Management Problems**: Building a high-performance computer can lead to overheating if adequate cooling solutions are not implemented. This can result in hardware failure or reduced performance. To mitigate this, builders should invest in quality cooling systems, such as liquid cooling or high-efficiency air coolers, and ensure proper airflow within the case by managing cable organization and fan placement.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Static electricity can easily damage sensitive components like the CPU or RAM during installation. To prevent this, users should utilize anti-static wrist straps and work on non-static surfaces. Additionally, grounding oneself by touching a metal object can help discharge any static buildup before handling components.",
    "**BIOS Configuration Challenges**: After assembling the computer, users may face issues with the BIOS setup, including incorrect boot order or failing to recognize newly installed hardware. This can be resolved by familiarizing oneself with the motherboard manual and accessing the BIOS setup to make necessary adjustments. Online forums and video tutorials can also provide guidance on troubleshooting common BIOS issues.",
    "**Software Installation Hurdles**: Once the hardware is set up, installing the operating system and drivers can be problematic, especially for first-time builders. They may encounter issues such as incompatible drivers or installation errors. To alleviate this, users should prepare by downloading all necessary drivers and the operating system installation media in advance, and following step-by-step guides available online."
