The preservation system could be activated by a button or a sensor that detects when the wine is being opened.",
    "Wine Opener with Integrated Wine Tasting Notes: Create a wine opener that includes a built-in database of wine tasting notes.

    "Wine Opener with Smart Cap: Create a wine opener that includes a smart cap that tracks the wine's temperature, humidity, and exposure to light. This would allow users to monitor the wine's condition and make informed decisions about when to drink it. The smart cap could also provide recommendations for wine storage and preservation."
