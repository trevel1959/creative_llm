    "Thermal Mass Design: Utilize thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat. These materials can help regulate the temperature by storing heat energy during the day and releasing it at night. This approach can be particularly effective in buildings with thick walls or floors made of thermal mass materials.",
    "Passive Ventilation: Take advantage of natural ventilation by opening windows and doors to allow cooler air to enter and warmer air to escape. This can be especially useful in buildings with high ceilings, large windows, and well-insulated walls. By strategically placing vents and windows, you can create a natural airflow that maintains a comfortable temperature.",
    "Radiant Cooling: Install a radiant cooling system that uses pipes filled with a coolant, such as water or glycol, to absorb heat from the building and transfer it outside. This system can be more energy-efficient than traditional HVAC systems, especially in warm climates. Radiant cooling can be achieved through a variety of methods, including ground-source heat pumps, water-source heat pumps, or evaporative cooling towers.",
    "Evaporative Cooling: Use evaporative cooling towers to absorb heat from the air and transfer it to the atmosphere. These towers work by spraying water onto a heat exchanger, which is then cooled by the surrounding air. The cooled water is then sprayed back into the building, providing a cooling effect. Evaporative cooling towers are particularly effective in dry climates, where the air is already hot and humidity is low.",
    "Nighttime Cooling: Utilize the cooler nighttime temperatures by opening windows and doors to let cool air in and using fans to circulate it. This approach can be particularly effective in buildings with large windows or clerestory windows that allow for natural ventilation. By opening windows and doors strategically, you can create a natural airflow that maintains a comfortable temperature during the night, without relying on any mechanical cooling systems."
