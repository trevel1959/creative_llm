Also, try to find ways to celebrate and support others in their accomplishments, rather than feeling threatened by them.\"",

    "\"Jealousy can be a destructive emotion, try to channel it into motivation and inspiration. Take a look at how others finished their tasks and try to learn from their methods and strategies. Remember that you can't control how others behave or how their tasks turn out, but you can control how you react to it and how you approach your own tasks.\"",
