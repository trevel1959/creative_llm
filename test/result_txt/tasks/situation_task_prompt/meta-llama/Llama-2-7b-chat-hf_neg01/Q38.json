    "Natural Soap-Making: One way to maintain hygiene without commercial soap and cleaning products is to learn how to make natural soap using ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and essential oils. This soap can be used for washing hands, body, and hair, and can be made in various fragrances and forms, such as bars, liquid, or even solid shampoo.",
    "Water Filtration Systems: Another option is to invest in water filtration systems that can remove impurities and bacteria from water, making it safe for personal hygiene. These systems can be installed at home or in public spaces, such as schools or community centers, and can be powered by solar energy or other renewable sources.",
    "Plant-Based Cleansers: Plants have natural cleansing properties, and certain herbs like tea tree, lavender, and chamomile can be used to make natural cleansers for the skin. For example, a mixture of tea tree oil and coconut oil can be used as a face wash, while a mixture of lavender oil and water can be used as a body wash.",
    "Solar-Powered Distillation: In areas where access to clean water is limited, solar-powered distillation systems can be used to purify water from any source. These systems use the heat of the sun to evaporate water, leaving impurities behind, and can produce clean drinking water for personal hygiene.",
    "DIY Disinfectants: If soap and cleaning products are unavailable, homemade disinfectants can be made using common household items like baking soda, vinegar, and lemon juice. For example, a mixture of baking soda and water can be used to clean surfaces, while a mixture of vinegar and water can be used to disinfect surfaces and kill bacteria."
