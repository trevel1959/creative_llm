    "\"Arctic Ark\": A large, artificial ice structure designed to preserve and protect polar bears and other vulnerable Arctic species. It would include a habitat that simulates the frozen tundra, with ice floes and land masses for hunting and resting. It would also include a monitoring and research center to study climate change and its effects on Arctic ecosystems.",
    "\"Rainforest Resilience\": A network of interconnected treehouses and platforms that allow researchers and conservationists to live and work within the rainforest. The habitat would include cutting-edge renewable energy sources, rainwater collection systems, and organic waste management. It would also serve as a base for patrolling against illegal logging and poaching.",
    "\"Sea Floor Sanctuary\": An underwater habitat designed for the conservation of marine species. It would include a network of interconnected domed structures, each housing a different species or a group of species. The habitat would provide a safe space for species to breed and reproduce without the threat of overfishing or pollution.",
    "\"Urban Oasis\": A network of green spaces within the heart of a city, designed to provide a natural haven for wildlife. The habitat would include interconnected green roofs, community gardens, and green walls, creating a network of interconnected ecosystems within the urban landscape. It would also serve as a place for city dwellers to connect with nature and learn about urban wildlife.",
    "\"Desert Oasis\": A large, artificial oasis within the heart of a desert, designed to provide a sustainable habitat for desert-dwelling species. The habitat would include a water recycling system, greenhouses for growing food, and structures that mimic the natural landscape. It would also serve as a research center for studying desert ecosystems and their conservation."
