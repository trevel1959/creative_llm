    "Build a shelter using natural materials: First, I would look for materials that are readily available on the island, such as palm fronds, branches, and rocks. I would use these materials to construct a simple shelter that provides protection from the elements, including rain, wind, and sun. The shelter could be in the form of a lean-to or a debris hut, with a thatched roof to keep me dry. I would also create a bed made of leaves and vines to ensure a comfortable night's sleep.",
    "Find a source of fresh water: Locating a source of fresh water is crucial for survival on a deserted island. I would search for a stream, river, or pond, or even create my own water source by digging a well or collecting rainwater. I would use a container made of natural materials, such as a hollowed-out coconut shell or a woven basket, to store the water and keep it clean and safe to drink.",
    "Catch food using natural methods: To catch food on a deserted island, I would use natural methods such as fishing and hunting. I would create a makeshift fishing net using vines and rocks, and cast it into the ocean or a nearby body of water to catch fish. For hunting, I would use a bow and arrow made from natural materials, such as a straight branch and some vines, to hunt for small game like birds or rodents. I would also gather fruits, nuts, and berries from the island's plants and trees to supplement my diet.",
    "Create a signal fire: To signal for help and attract attention, I would create a signal fire on a hill or a high point on the island. I would gather dry wood and other flammable materials and build a fire that is visible from a distance. I would keep the fire burning throughout the day and night to increase the chances of being seen by passing boats or planes. I would also create a makeshift flag using a piece of cloth or a large leaf, and attach it to a long stick to wave it above the fire.",
    "Use the island's natural resources for medicine: On a deserted island, I would use the island's natural resources to create a makeshift medicine cabinet. I would gather plants with healing properties"
