    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: This idea combines technology with safety by integrating a solar panel into the bicycle helmet's design. The helmet would be equipped with an integrated solar panel that can charge an internal battery. The battery could then power various features such as LED lights for visibility during night rides, a built-in speaker for music or GPS navigation, or even a small fan to help keep the rider cool in hot weather.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Bicycle Helmet with Brainwave Technology**: A helmet that uses brainwave sensors to adjust its fit and position based on the user's comfort and balance. By monitoring brain activity, the helmet can automatically make adjustments to ensure optimal support and stability. This would be especially beneficial for long-distance riders who might experience fatigue over time.",
    "**Recyclable and Biodegradable Bicycle Helmet**: This innovative idea focuses on sustainability. The helmet would be made from biodegradable materials that break down much faster than traditional plastic, reducing environmental impact. Moreover, it could also incorporate recycled materials like old bicycle tires or other sustainable resources. This not only reduces waste but also encourages a circular economy.",
    "**Smart Bicycle Helmet with Facial Recognition for Security**: This helmet would include facial recognition technology that can identify the rider when they put on the helmet. This feature could be used for security purposes, such as accessing secure bike parking areas or verifying the identity of the helmet's owner, particularly useful in shared or communal bike spaces.",
    "**Therapeutic Bicycle Helmet with Vibration Therapy**: For individuals recovering from head injuries, this helmet would provide therapeutic benefits. It would be designed to deliver low-frequency vibrations that can help stimulate blood flow and promote healing in the brain. This could potentially speed up recovery times and enhance cognitive function, making it a valuable tool for physical therapy. "
