    "**Cyberbullying and Online Safety**: The digital age exposes children to the risk of cyberbullying and online predators. Parents may find it difficult to monitor their child's online interactions without infringing on their privacy. To address this, parents can educate their children about online safety, encourage open conversations about their digital experiences, and utilize parental control tools that help them track online behavior while fostering trust.",
    "**Information Overload**: With an abundance of information available online, children can easily become overwhelmed or misinformed. They may struggle to discern credible sources from unreliable ones, leading to confusion and misinformation. Parents can help by teaching critical thinking skills and guiding their children on how to research effectively, evaluate sources, and differentiate between fact and opinion.",
    "**Digital Footprint Awareness**: Children often lack an understanding of the long-term implications of their online actions. They may share personal information or engage in behaviors that could negatively affect their future. Parents can initiate discussions about digital footprints and the importance of maintaining a positive online presence, as well as establish guidelines for what is appropriate to share on social media.",
    "**Impact on Mental Health**: The digital age can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, often exacerbated by social media comparisons. Parents may find it challenging to recognize signs of distress in their children due to the virtual nature of interactions. To mitigate this, parents can promote healthy self-esteem by encouraging offline hobbies, physical activities, and face-to-face friendships while being vigilant about their child's emotional well-being.",
    "**Dependency on Technology**: Children may develop a reliance on technology for entertainment and education, leading to a decrease in creativity and critical thinking skills. Parents might struggle to encourage independent play and problem-solving in a world filled with instant gratification. To counter this, families can establish tech-free zones or times, encouraging activities that stimulate creativity, such as arts and crafts, outdoor exploration, and board games."
