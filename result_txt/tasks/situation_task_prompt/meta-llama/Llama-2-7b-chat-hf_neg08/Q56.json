    "You would look for a reflective surface: Without mirrors, you would have to rely on other reflective surfaces to see your reflection. You might look for a shiny metal surface, a polished stone, or even a still body of water to catch a glimpse of yourself. You might have to get creative and use a small mirror or a magnifying glass to check your reflection.",
    "You would use technology to your advantage: In a world without mirrors, you might turn to technology to see your reflection. You could use a smartphone app that uses facial recognition software to create a virtual mirror, or you could use a 3D scanner to capture a digital model of your face. You could even use a virtual reality headset to see yourself in a virtual environment.",
    "You would rely on others for confirmation: Without mirrors, you might have to rely on others to confirm your appearance. You might ask a friend or family member to check your reflection for you, or you might have to rely on a stranger passing by to give you a nod of approval. You might even have to resort to asking a dog to give you a \"woof\" of approval.",
    "You would embrace the change: Rather than feeling jealous or frustrated about the lack of mirrors, you could embrace the change and see it as an opportunity to focus on other aspects of yourself. You might use the time to work on your inner self, such as developing your personality, skills, or creativity. You could even see the lack of mirrors as a chance to explore your spiritual side and connect with the world around you.",
    "You would create your own mirror: Finally, you could take matters into your own hands and create your own mirror. You could use a piece of reflective glass, a shiny metal surface, or even a piece of paper to create a makeshift mirror. You could get creative and decorate the mirror with drawings or writings, or you could use it as a canvas to express yourself artistically. By creating your own mirror, you could take control of your reflection and make it your own."
