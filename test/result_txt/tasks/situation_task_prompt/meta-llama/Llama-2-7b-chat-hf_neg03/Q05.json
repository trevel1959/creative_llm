    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution would be to use solar-powered lanterns that can provide light during the day. These lanterns can be charged during the day using solar panels, and then provide light at night. They can be placed in various locations around the house or community to provide adequate lighting.",
    "Mirrors and Reflectors: Another idea would be to use mirrors and reflectors to redirect sunlight indoors during the day. By placing mirrors and reflectors in strategic locations, it can help to reflect sunlight into dark areas, providing additional light during the day. This can be especially useful in rooms that don't receive direct sunlight.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Some plants have the ability to emit light, such as glowing mushrooms or plants that emit a blue-green light. By incorporating these plants into your home or community, you can create a natural and sustainable source of light during the day.",
    "Light-Harvesting Windows: By installing special windows that can harvest light during the day and release it at night, you can create a constant source of light. These windows can be designed to capture light from any direction, ensuring that your home or community is always well-lit.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Another creative solution would be to use cloud-based lighting, where light is generated using cloud-based technology. This can involve using drones or balloons equipped with LED lights to create a soft, diffuse light in the sky. By using cloud-based lighting, you can create a unique and sustainable source of light during the day."
