    "**Smart Bike Helmet with Integrated Safety Features**: Design a helmet with a built-in computer that tracks the rider's speed, distance, and time. It also includes a GPS system, allowing the rider to navigate through unfamiliar territories. The helmet's AI-powered system can detect potential hazards, such as potholes or pedestrians, and alert the rider with a warning light or vibration. Additionally, the helmet can connect to the rider's smartphone, allowing them to receive calls, texts, and navigation instructions while keeping their hands free.",
    "**Air-Powered Bike Helmet**: Develop a helmet that uses compressed air to provide a cushioning effect in the event of a crash. The air is stored in a compact tank within the helmet, which can be refilled at a specialized station. This innovative design would reduce the risk of head injuries and provide a unique solution for cyclists.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Bike Helmet**: Create a helmet that can adapt to different riding conditions. Using advanced materials and AI-powered sensors, the helmet can change its shape and size to optimize protection and aerodynamics. For example, it could expand to provide extra protection in the event of a crash or compress to reduce wind resistance during high-speed rides.",
    "**Solar-Powered Bike Helmet**: Design a helmet with integrated solar panels that charge a built-in battery. This battery powers a variety of features, such as a heads-up display, a navigation system, and a communication device. The helmet's solar panels would be made from a thin, flexible material that provides a sleek and aerodynamic design.",
    "**Biometric Bike Helmet**: Develop a helmet that tracks the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data can be used to provide personalized feedback and recommendations for improving the rider's performance and overall health. The helmet's biometric sensors can also detect signs of fatigue or stress, alerting the rider to take regular breaks and rest. This innovative design would revolutionize the way cyclists approach their sport and prioritize their well-being. [/INST] Assistant: Here are five creative and original ideas for a bicycle helmet with detailed explanations: 1.  **Smart Bike Helmet with Integrated Safety Features**: Design a helmet with a built-in computer that tracks the rider's speed, distance, and time. It also includes a GPS system, allowing the rider to navigate through unfamiliar territories. The helmet's AI-powered system can detect potential hazards, such as potholes or pedestrians, and alert the rider with a warning light or vibration"
