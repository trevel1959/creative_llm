    "Funding: Another issue that may arise is securing funding for the development and production of the vaccine. This can be a challenge, especially if the vaccine is for a rare or newly discovered disease that may not have a large market.",
    "Clinical trials: Ensuring the safety and efficacy of the vaccine through rigorous clinical trials is a critical step in the development process. However, this can be time-consuming and expensive, which may pose a challenge in terms of resources and timelines.",
    "Public perception: The public may have concerns or skepticism about the safety and effectiveness of a new vaccine, which could impact the willingness to receive it. This can be addressed through effective communication and education, but it is still a potential issue.",
    "Resistance to change: Healthcare professionals may be resistant to adopting new technologies or procedures related to the vaccine, such as electronic records or new administration methods. This can be addressed through training and education, but it is still a potential issue.",
    "Intellectual property: The development of a new vaccine may involve the use of existing technologies or methods, which can lead to disputes over intellectual property rights. This can be addressed through clear agreements and patent protections, but it is still a potential issue."
