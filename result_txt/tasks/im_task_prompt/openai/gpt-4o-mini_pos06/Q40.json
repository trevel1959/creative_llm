    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Create sunglasses with built-in augmented reality (AR) capabilities. Users could access navigation prompts, notifications, and other digital information directly in their line of sight. This would be particularly useful for outdoor activities like hiking or cycling, where hands-free access to information can enhance safety and convenience.",
    "**Health Monitoring Features**: Incorporate health-monitoring sensors into the frame of the sunglasses to track UV exposure, heart rate, and even hydration levels. Users could receive alerts about prolonged sun exposure or dehydration through a connected app, promoting better health and wellness while enjoying outdoor activities.",
    "**Customizable Frames and Lenses**: Design a system where users can mix and match frames and lenses based on their style preferences or activities. This could involve modular components that allow users to snap on different colored or patterned frames and swap out lenses with varying tints and functionalities (polarized, blue light blocking, etc.) depending on their needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create sunglasses made entirely from biodegradable or recycled materials. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in fashion. Additionally, a program could be established for recycling old sunglasses, encouraging users to return their old pairs for discounts on new ones.",
    "**Built-in Audio**: Integrate bone conduction audio technology into the arms of the sunglasses, allowing users to listen to music or take phone calls without the need for earbuds. This would keep the ears open to ambient sounds, enhancing safety while walking or cycling, and providing a more immersive outdoor experience."
