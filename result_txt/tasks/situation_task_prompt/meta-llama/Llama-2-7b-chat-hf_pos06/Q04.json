    "Bio-Domes: Bio-domes are artificially created environments that can replicate the conditions of a particular ecosystem, including temperature, humidity, light, and nutrient availability. By building bio-domes in strategic locations around the world, we could replace the lost natural resources of forests by recreating the conditions necessary for plant and animal life to thrive. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Urban Forestry: Cities could be transformed into urban forests by planting trees and other vegetation in urban areas. This would not only provide a habitat for wildlife but also help to purify the air, reduce noise pollution, and mitigate the urban heat island effect. By creating more green spaces in cities, we could replace the lost natural resources of forests while also improving the quality of life for urban dwellers. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Aquaforestry: Aquaforestry involves using aquaculture techniques to cultivate seaweed and other aquatic plants in large-scale open-water systems. By harnessing the nutrient-rich waters of the ocean, aquaforestry could provide a sustainable source of timber, food, and other forest products. This approach could help to replace the lost natural resources of forests while also reducing the pressure on wild fisheries and improving ocean health. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Vertical Forestry: Vertical forestry involves stacking layers of vegetation on top of each other in tall, narrow structures. This approach could be used to create dense, multi-story forests in urban areas, providing a habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species. By creating vertical forests, we could replace the lost natural resources of forests while also maximizing the use of urban space. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Space-based Forestry: In space, there is no gravity, making it possible to create vast, self-sustaining forests that could provide a limitless source of timber and other forest products. By establishing space-based forests, we could replace the lost natural resources of forests while also expanding the available land area for forestry. Confidence Score: 0.9"
