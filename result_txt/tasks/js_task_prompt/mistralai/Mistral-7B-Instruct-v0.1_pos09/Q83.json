    "36 Hours: I would choose a 36-hour day because it would allow for more productivity and efficiency in completing tasks. With more time in the day, individuals could accomplish more work, finish projects faster, and have more time for leisure activities.",
    "48 Hours: I would choose a 48-hour day because it would provide more time for individuals to pursue their passions and interests.

    "60 Hours: I would choose a 60-hour day because it would allow for even more productivity and efficiency in completing tasks. With three full days in a row, individuals could work longer hours and accomplish even more work, while still having time for leisure activities and relaxation.",
