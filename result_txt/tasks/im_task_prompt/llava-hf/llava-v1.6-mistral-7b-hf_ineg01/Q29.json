    "**Intelligent Cutting System**: Implement an intelligent cutting system that uses sensors to detect the type of grass and adjust the cutting height and frequency accordingly. This would optimize the mower's performance and ensure a healthier lawn.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Incorporate an eco-friendly mode that adjusts the mower's power consumption based on the size of the lawn and the type of grass. This could be achieved through a combination of sensor technology and machine learning algorithms.",
    "**Automated Mowing Patterns**: Introduce pre-programmed mowing patterns that optimize the lawn's health by avoiding the same paths repeatedly. This could be further enhanced with GPS technology, which would allow the mower to remember and replicate the most efficient mowing patterns.",
    "**Self-Charging Feature**: Incorporate a solar panel into the mower's design, allowing it to recharge during daylight hours. This would make the mower more environmentally friendly and reduce the need for frequent manual charging.",
    "**Mower with Adjustable Heights**: Add a mechanism that allows users to adjust the cutting height on the fly, providing a customizable experience based on the user's preferences and lawn conditions."
