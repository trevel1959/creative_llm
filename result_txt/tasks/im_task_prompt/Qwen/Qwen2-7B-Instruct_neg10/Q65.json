    "**Task Customization Kit**: Develop a DIY kit that includes various attachments and accessories for your electric kettle, allowing you to customize its functionality daily. For instance, you could include a frother for making hot chocolate or coffee, a tea infuser basket, or even a simple spice-infusing bag for adding flavor to water before drinking. This way, each use feels like a new experience.",
    "**Brewing Challenge**: Set up a weekly brewing challenge where you aim to try out a different type of tea or hot beverage each day. You can explore international flavors by picking a country's specialty tea, or experiment with different herbs and spices to create unique blends. Use your electric kettle to heat the water at precisely the right temperature for each variety, enhancing the taste.",
    "**Daily Infusions**: Instead of just heating water, use your electric kettle to make infused water. Each morning, prepare a new flavor profile using fruits, herbs, or vegetables. This not only adds variety but also provides health benefits from the natural ingredients.",
    "**Smart Electric Kettle with Recipes**: Create a digital companion for your electric kettle that offers personalized recipes based on your preferences. The device could suggest recipes for teas, soups, or even cocktails, depending on the time of day or your mood. Pair this with an app that tracks your progress and suggests new recipes as you explore.",
    "**Temperature-Adjusted Drink Calendar**: Utilize your electric kettleâ€™s precise temperature control to craft daily drinks that cater to specific temperature needs for different beverages. For example, start with hot lemon water in the morning, move to iced herbal tea in the afternoon, and finish the day with a hot chocolate. The calendar could offer suggestions based on season, time of day, or even personal health goals (like hydration needs). "
