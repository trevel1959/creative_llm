    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Collection System: Create a solar-powered water collection system that utilizes the sun's energy to purify seawater or rainwater. This system could involve using a solar still or a solar-powered water filtration system, which can remove salt and impurities from the water, making it safe for consumption. This will provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, essential for survival on a deserted island.",
    "Create a Vertical Garden: Build a vertical garden using a trellis or a greenhouse, utilizing the available space on the island. This will allow you to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs, providing a sustainable source of food. You can also use the vertical garden to create a natural irrigation system, using the island's rainwater or seawater to water the plants. This will not only provide sustenance but also help to purify the air and create a more habitable environment on the island.",
    "Build a Wind-Powered Generator: Harness the power of the wind to generate electricity using a wind turbine or a kite-powered generator. This will provide a reliable source of energy for charging electronic devices, such as a radio or a flashlight, which can be used to communicate with potential rescuers or to signal for help. The wind-powered generator can also be used to power a water pump, which can be used to purify water or to irrigate the vertical garden.",
    "Create a Shelter Using Natural Materials: Use natural materials found on the island, such as palm fronds, leaves, and branches, to create a shelter that provides protection from the elements. This can be achieved by constructing a lean-to shelter or a debris hut, which can be made more durable by using a mixture of mud and sand to hold the structure together. The shelter can also be decorated with solar-powered lights or a wind-powered fan, providing a more comfortable living space.",
    "Use the Island's Resources for Navigation: Learn to navigate using the island's natural resources, such as the sun, moon, stars, and ocean currents. This can involve creating a sundial or a sextant to measure the sun's position, or using a"
