    "Sunlight Harvesting: One creative solution would be to use sunlight harvesting technology to collect and store sunlight during the day, which could then be used to light up a room at night. This could be achieved through the use of specialized windows or solar panels that capture and store sunlight, which could then be released as needed. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Glowing Paint: Another idea would be to use glowing paint on the walls and ceiling of the room to provide natural lighting at night. This paint would be designed to absorb and store light during the day, releasing it slowly at night to provide a soft, ambient glow. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Bioluminescent Decorations: Bioluminescent decorations such as mushrooms, jellyfish, or other organisms could be used to light up a room at night. These decorations would produce their own light through a chemical reaction, providing a unique and sustainable lighting solution. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Light-Emitting Vegetation: Another option would be to use light-emitting vegetation such as glowing plants or fungi to light up a room at night. These plants would be genetically engineered to produce their own light, providing a natural and sustainable lighting source. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: A creative solution could be to use mirrors to reflect light from a single source, such as a candle or a LED light, to light up a room at night. By strategically placing mirrors around the room, it would be possible to create a more spacious and brighter environment without the need for any additional lighting. Confidence Score: 0.7"
