    "**Enhanced Tactile Feedback System:** Create a wearable glove or sleeve that integrates haptic feedback technology. This system can translate visual information into tactile sensations, allowing the visually impaired to \"see\" through touch. For instance, patterns, textures, and vibrations can represent different objects, colors, or shapes. Users can 'touch' their surroundings and 'see' through the sensations provided by the device.",
    "**Audio-Visual Recognition Software:** Develop an AI-powered application that uses both audio and visual inputs to describe scenes around the user. The software can analyze the environment using cameras, microphones, and other sensors, then convert the data into spoken descriptions that the user can understand. This technology can help in navigating unfamiliar environments, recognizing objects, or understanding social cues.",
    "**Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Training Environment:** Design a VR system specifically tailored for training individuals with visual impairments. This could include simulations of daily life activities, such as grocery shopping, cooking, or navigating public transportation. The VR environment would provide real-time feedback and instructions, helping users learn new skills and build confidence.",
    "**AI-Assisted Personal Shopping Assistant:** Create a mobile app that pairs with smart home devices and wearables. The app would use AI to understand the user's preferences, needs, and past purchases. It would then suggest products, describe them using audio descriptions, and even order them online if needed. This solution aims to simplify shopping experiences for visually impaired individuals.",
    "**Interactive Braille Learning Platform:** Develop an online platform that combines multimedia elements like videos, audio, and interactive quizzes to teach braille to visually impaired learners. The platform could include features like voice recognition for inputting text in braille, real-time feedback on accuracy, and adaptive learning paths based on the learner's progress. This tool aims to make learning braille more engaging and accessible."
