    "**Multi-Functional Oven with Air Fryer Capability**: Create a versatile oven that combines traditional baking and roasting functions with an air fryer. This appliance would have a dedicated air frying compartment with a special fan and heating element designed for crisping food without excess oil. This way, users can enjoy healthier versions of their favorite fried foods without needing a separate air fryer.",
    "**Interactive Recipe Display**: Incorporate a touch-screen display on the oven that can showcase interactive recipes. Users can browse through recipes, and the oven can automatically set the temperature and timer based on the selected dish. The display could also include video tutorials, cooking tips, and ingredient substitution suggestions, making it easier for novice cooks to follow along.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology with Eco-Friendly Features**: Enhance the self-cleaning feature of ovens by integrating eco-friendly cleaning technology. This could involve a steam cleaning option that uses water and heat to loosen grime without harsh chemicals. Additionally, a smart alert system could notify users when the oven needs cleaning, and suggest the most efficient cleaning method based on the level of residue.",
    "**Built-in Food Sensor**: Design an oven with built-in food sensors that can detect the type of food being cooked and its doneness level. Using infrared technology, the oven could analyze the food's temperature and moisture content, adjusting cooking time and temperature accordingly. This would help prevent overcooking and ensure perfect results every time.",
    "**Modular Oven Design**: Introduce a modular oven design that allows users to customize their cooking experience. Different modules could be added or removed, such as a steam oven module, a pizza stone compartment, or a dehydrator.
