    "Texture: Even though everything would be black and white, the texture of objects would still be different. For example, a rough rock would feel different from a smooth piece of glass.",
    "Shape: The shape of objects would still be different, even if they were all the same color. For example, a circle and a square would still be recognizable.",
    "Size: The size of objects would still be different, even if they were all the same color and texture. For example, a small pebble and a large rock would still be recognizable.",
    "Light: Even though everything would be black and white, the way light would interact with objects would still be different. For example, a shiny object would still reflect light differently than a dull object.",
    "Sound: Even though everything would be black and white, the sound of objects would still be different. For example, the sound of water hitting a rock would be different from the sound of wind blowing through grass."
