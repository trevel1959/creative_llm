    "**Adjustable Multi-Use Hanger**: Create a hanger that can be adjusted to accommodate different types of clothing. This could include removable clips for hanging skirts or pants, and an adjustable width for shirts or jackets. The hanger could have a simple locking mechanism to keep it stable at various widths, allowing users to easily switch between different garment types without needing multiple hangers.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Hanger**: Innovate a clothes hanger made from biodegradable materials that can break down after use, reducing plastic waste. This hanger could be designed to mimic the strength and durability of traditional plastic hangers but made from natural fibers or recycled paper. The design could include a unique feature where users can plant the hanger in their garden, and it would decompose, enriching the soil.",
    "**Hanger with Built-In Aroma Diffuser**: Develop a clothes hanger that includes a small compartment for essential oils or fragrance beads. This would allow clothes to smell fresh while they are hanging. Users could choose different scents based on their preferences, and the hanger could be designed with a small fan to help disperse the fragrance evenly, ensuring that clothes maintain a pleasant aroma.",
    "**Hanger with Integrated LED Light**: Create a hanger that has built-in LED lights, which can illuminate the clothing when the closet door is opened. This feature would help users easily see their wardrobe choices, especially in dark closets. The LED lights could be motion-activated, turning on automatically when the closet is accessed, and could also come with a color-changing feature to match the user's mood or the season.",
    "**Hanger with Garment Tracker**: Introduce a clothes hanger equipped with a small RFID tag that allows users to track their clothing items through a mobile app. This feature could help users keep track of what they own, what they wear most often, and even suggest outfits based on the weather or upcoming events. The app could also remind users of items they haven't worn in a while, encouraging them to mix up their wardrobe."
