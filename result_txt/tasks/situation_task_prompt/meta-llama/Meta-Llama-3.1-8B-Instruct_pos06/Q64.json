    "**Multidimensional Memory Maps**: Imagine a vast, interconnected network of mental maps that represent memories. Each map would be a 3D representation of a specific event or person, with nodes and connections symbolizing relationships and experiences. When recalling a memory, the mind would navigate through this network, revisiting the associated maps to reconstruct the event. These maps would be constantly updated and refined as new experiences are added, allowing for a dynamic and ever-evolving memory repository. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Neural Storyweaving**: In the absence of visual records, people would rely on their brains' incredible capacity for storytelling. By leveraging the brain's neural networks, individuals would create intricate, narrative tapestries that weave together fragmented memories, emotions, and sensory details. These mental stories would be passed down through generations, with each retelling adding new layers of meaning and context. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Kinesthetic Recollection**: Without visual aids, people would focus on the tactile and kinesthetic aspects of memories. They would recall the sensation of holding a loved one's hand, the feeling of a warm summer breeze, or the texture of a favorite childhood blanket. This approach would emphasize the emotional and sensory aspects of memories, allowing individuals to relive experiences through their bodily sensations. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Echoes in the Environment**: In a world without visual records, people would rely on the physical environment to evoke memories. They would associate specific locations, scents, and sounds with particular events or people. For example, the smell of a certain flower might transport someone back to a childhood picnic, while the sound of a particular song could evoke memories of a first dance. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Emotional Resonance**: Without visual aids, people would focus on the emotional resonance of memories. They would recall the feelings and emotions associated with a particular event or person, rather than the visual details. This approach would prioritize the subjective experience of memories, allowing individuals to connect with others on a deeper, more empathetic level. (Confidence: 0.95)"
