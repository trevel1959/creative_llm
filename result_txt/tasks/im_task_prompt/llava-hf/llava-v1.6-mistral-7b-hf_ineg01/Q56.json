    "**Eco-Friendly Bicycle Bell**: Create a bicycle bell made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This would not only be environmentally friendly but also aesthetically appealing and unique.",
    "**LED Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell with integrated LED lights. The lights could change color or pattern based on the cyclist's speed or the time of day, making the bicycle more visible to motorists and pedestrians, especially in low light conditions.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Add additional safety features to the bicycle bell, such as a built-in airbag or a flashing strobe light that activates when the bell is rung. This would provide an extra layer of protection for the cyclist.",
    "**Multi-Functional Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that serves multiple purposes. For example, it could also function as a bicycle lock or a small flashlight. This would not only improve the functionality of the bell but also reduce the number of items a cyclist needs to carry.",
    "**Bicycle Bell with GPS Tracking**: Develop a bicycle bell with a built-in GPS tracking device. This would allow the cyclist to track their rides and share their location with friends or family."
