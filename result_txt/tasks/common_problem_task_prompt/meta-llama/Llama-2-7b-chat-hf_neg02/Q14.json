    "Floating Garden High-Rise: Inspired by the concept of floating gardens, this high-rise building would feature a unique and innovative design that appears to defy gravity. The building would be constructed with a series of interconnected modules, each one resembling a floating garden. The modules would be suspended in mid-air, creating a sense of weightlessness and allowing for maximum natural light and ventilation. The building would be surrounded by lush greenery, further enhancing the feeling of being in a natural oasis.",
    "Vertical Forest High-Rise: This high-rise building would be designed to resemble a towering tree, with a series of interconnected modules that wrap around a central core. Each module would be covered in lush greenery, creating a vertical forest that provides a natural oasis in the heart of the city. The building would be constructed using sustainable materials and would feature a state-of-the-art water harvesting system, ensuring that the building is self-sufficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Bamboo High-Rise: Inspired by traditional Asian architecture, this high-rise building would be constructed using bamboo as the primary building material. The building would feature a series of interconnected modules, each one covered in bamboo, creating a lightweight and sustainable structure. The bamboo would be carefully selected and arranged to create a unique and visually striking design, while also providing natural insulation and ventilation.",
    "Solar Panel High-Rise: This high-rise building would be designed to harness the power of the sun, with a series of interconnected modules that are covered in solar panels. The building would be constructed using sustainable materials and would feature a state-of-the-art energy storage system, ensuring that the building is self-sufficient and environmentally friendly. The solar panels would provide a unique and striking design element, while also generating clean and renewable energy.",
    "Bio-Dome High-Rise: Inspired by the concept of biomes, this high-rise building would be designed to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. The building would feature a series of interconnected modules, each one representing a different biome, such as a rainfor"
