    "Tissue box with a twist: Create a tissue box that changes color or pattern depending on the user's emotions. For example, if the user is feeling sad, the tissue box could change to a soothing blue color, while a happy emotion would result in a bright yellow color. This would provide a unique and personalized experience for the user, and could be marketed as a fun and innovative way to express emotions.",
    "Tissue box with a built-in diffuser: Design a tissue box that includes a small diffuser for essential oils. This would allow users to release a calming scent into the air while they blow their noses, providing a more relaxing and comforting experience. The diffuser could be filled with a variety of essential oils, such as lavender or peppermint, to suit different moods and needs.",
    "Tissue box with a hidden compartment: Create a tissue box with a hidden compartment that can be accessed by a small button or lever. This compartment could be used to store small items such as a secret note, a small toy, or even a piece of jewelry. This would provide an element of surprise and fun to the user, and could be marketed as a unique and interesting feature.",
    "Tissue box with a built-in charging station: Design a tissue box that includes a small charging station for a phone or other small electronic device. This would be particularly useful for people who are always on the go and need a convenient place to charge their devices. The charging station could be hidden within the tissue box, or it could be a separate component that can be attached to the tissue box.",
    "Tissue box with a personalized message: Create a tissue box that includes a personalized message or quote on the outside of the box. This could be a motivational quote, a funny saying, or a personal message from the giver. This would provide an extra touch of thoughtfulness and personality to the gift, and could be marketed as a unique and memorable feature."
