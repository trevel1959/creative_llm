    "**Global Economic Shift**: The sudden elimination of all world debt would lead to a massive shift in the global economy. Central banks and governments would no longer have to worry about servicing debt, freeing up massive amounts of capital to invest in infrastructure, education, and innovation. This could lead to a surge in economic growth, as resources are redirected towards productive sectors rather than debt repayment. However, it could also lead to inflation, as the increased money supply chases a limited number of goods and services.",
    "**Rise of New Global Power Structures**: The erasure of debt would create a power vacuum, as countries and institutions that had previously relied on debt to exert influence would lose their leverage. New global power structures could emerge, potentially led by countries or entities that had been relatively debt-free or had managed their debt effectively. This could lead to a more multipolar world, with new players challenging the traditional dominance of Western powers.",
    "**Increased Inequality**: The elimination of debt would disproportionately benefit those who had accumulated debt, such as consumers and small businesses. This could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, as those who had managed their finances responsibly would see their relative wealth increase, while those who had accumulated debt would see their financial burdens lifted but not necessarily their economic prospects.",
    "**Reduced Global Cooperation**: The sudden elimination of debt could create a sense of mistrust and skepticism among nations, as they would no longer have to rely on each other for financial support. This could lead to reduced global cooperation, as countries focus on their own interests and prioritize their own economic growth over collective goals.",
    "**Unprecedented Opportunity for Development**: The erasure of debt would provide a unique opportunity for developing countries to invest in their infrastructure, education, and healthcare systems, potentially leapfrogging them into a more developed state. This could lead to significant improvements in living standards, poverty reduction, and overall well-being. However, it would also require careful management to avoid the pitfalls of uncontrolled economic growth and resource misallocation."
