    "Install Solar-Powered Lighting Systems: One creative solution to get enough sunlight in a cloudy sky is to install solar-powered lighting systems. These systems use photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which can then be used to power LED lights or other energy-efficient lighting options. This would provide a reliable source of light even on cloudy days. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Build a Sun Tunnel: A sun tunnel is a specialized skylight that allows sunlight to enter a building through a narrow tunnel. By positioning the sun tunnel at a specific angle, it can capture and channel sunlight into the building, providing a consistent source of natural light even on cloudy days. This would be a creative solution to get enough sunlight in a cloudy sky. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Utilize Mirrors and Reflectors: Another creative solution to get enough sunlight in a cloudy sky is to use mirrors and reflectors. By positioning mirrors and reflectors strategically around a building, they can reflect sunlight from nearby windows or skylights onto the interior spaces, providing a brighter and more evenly lit environment. This would be an effective way to supplement natural light on cloudy days. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Develop a Cloud-Based Lighting System: A more futuristic solution to get enough sunlight in a cloudy sky is to develop a cloud-based lighting system. This system would use advanced technology to harness the energy of the clouds themselves, using it to power LED lights or other energy-efficient lighting options. This would provide a reliable and sustainable source of light even on cloudy days. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Create a Greenhouse-Like Structure: A more unconventional solution to get enough sunlight in a cloudy sky is to create a greenhouse-like structure. By using a transparent roof and walls, this structure would allow sunlight to enter and be trapped inside, providing a warm and bright environment even on cloudy days. This would be a creative solution to supplement natural light in a cloudy sky. Confidence Score: 0.7"
