    "Society would be transformed: If everyone became a genius overnight, it would likely have a profound impact on society. Knowledge and expertise would become more accessible, and the boundaries between different fields would blur. People would be able to tackle complex problems with ease, leading to rapid advancements in technology, science, and the arts.",
    "Inequality would decrease: With everyone possessing genius-level intelligence, the traditional markers of success, such as wealth and power, would become less relevant. People would be judged based on their creativity, compassion, and ability to collaborate, rather than their intellectual prowess. This could lead to a more equitable and just society.",
    "The concept of \"normal\" would change: As people's cognitive abilities were elevated, the definition of \"normal\" would shift. People would no longer be limited by their natural abilities, and the concept of \"average\" would become obsolete. This could lead to a more inclusive and accepting society, where diversity is celebrated.",
    "New forms of governance would emerge: With everyone possessing genius-level intelligence, traditional forms of governance, such as democracy and representative government, might become less effective. New forms of decision-making, such as direct democracy or technocratic governance, could emerge to take advantage of the collective intelligence of the population.",
    "The nature of work would change: As people became more intelligent, the nature of work would shift. Routine tasks would be automated, and people would focus on creative problem-solving, critical thinking, and strategic planning. The concept of a \"job\" might evolve into something more fluid and flexible, with people pursuing their passions and interests rather than simply working for a paycheck."
