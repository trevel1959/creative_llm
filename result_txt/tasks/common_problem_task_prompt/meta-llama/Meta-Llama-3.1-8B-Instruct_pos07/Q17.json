    "**Olympic Games of the Future**: Imagine a futuristic Olympic Games where athletes compete in cutting-edge sports that blend technology and human performance. For instance, a virtual reality obstacle course, a 3D-printed obstacle course that changes shape mid-competition, or a biometric-enhanced marathon where runners wear augmented reality glasses to track their progress and receive real-time feedback on their performance. The events would be designed to push the boundaries of human potential and technological innovation.",
    "**Eco-Olympics**: The Eco-Olympics would focus on sustainability and environmentalism, featuring events that showcase eco-friendly practices and technologies. For example, a solar-powered sailing regatta, a wind-powered cycling competition, or a zero-waste cooking competition where chefs create meals using locally sourced and compostable ingredients. The Eco-Olympics would serve as a platform to promote eco-consciousness and inspire a new generation of environmentally responsible athletes.",
    "**Olympic Games of Cultural Exchange**: This iteration of the Olympics would celebrate cultural diversity and exchange, featuring events that blend traditional sports with modern twists and international collaborations. For instance, a traditional Japanese sumo wrestling tournament with a twist â€“ athletes from different countries compete in sumo matches while wearing traditional attire from their respective cultures. Or, a fusion of traditional African dance with modern parkour and freerunning techniques.",
    "**Olympic Games for All**: The Olympic Games for All would be a groundbreaking event that prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity. The events would be designed to accommodate athletes with disabilities, featuring adaptive sports and competitions that break down barriers. For example, a para-athletics competition with athletes competing in customized wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, or a visually impaired triathlon where athletes navigate through a specially designed course using echolocation and tactile cues.",
    "**Olympic Games of the Past**: This nostalgic Olympic Games would celebrate the history of the Olympics, featuring events that recreate the original competitions from ancient Greece. Athletes would compete in traditional sports such as chariot racing, wrestling, and discus throw, while also incorporating modern twists and technologies to enhance the experience. The events would be held in historic venues and accompanied by educational programs and exhibits that showcase the evolution of the Olympics over time."
