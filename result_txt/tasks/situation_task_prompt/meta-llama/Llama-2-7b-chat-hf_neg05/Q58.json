    "Insect Hotels: Build structures specifically designed to house and support insects, providing them with a safe and comfortable environment. These hotels could be made from natural materials like bamboo, straws, and twigs, and could be placed around the garden or house to attract and accommodate various insect species.",
    "Insect Repellent Plants: Introduce plants that repel or deter insects, such as basil, mint, and lemongrass, which are known to naturally keep pests away. These plants could be planted around the garden or house, providing a natural barrier against pests.",
    "Solar-Powered Insect Traps: Develop solar-powered traps that use UV light to attract insects, which can then be collected and released outside in a safe area. These traps could be placed around the garden or house to efficiently capture and remove pests.",
    "Insect-Friendly Gardens: Create gardens that cater to the needs of insects, providing them with a diverse range of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. This approach would encourage a balance of insect populations, reducing the likelihood of pest infestations.",
    "Insect AI: Develop artificial intelligence that can predict and monitor insect populations, identifying potential pest threats before they become a problem. This AI could be integrated into smart home systems, providing homeowners with real-time data and recommendations on how to manage pest populations effectively."
