    "**Communication Limitations**: Communication with surface teams can be severely limited due to the ocean's depth. Traditional radio waves do not travel well underwater, especially at great depths. Developing a reliable communication system, such as using acoustic modems or satellite buoy relays, is essential for maintaining contact with the crew and transmitting data back to research facilities.",
    "**Navigation Challenges**: Navigating in the dark, featureless environment of the deep ocean poses significant problems. Without GPS signals, teams must rely on sonar and inertial navigation systems, which can be prone to errors. Creating advanced mapping technologies or utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with sophisticated navigation systems can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Human Health Risks**: Prolonged exposure to extreme conditions can pose health risks to the crew. These include decompression sickness, hypothermia, and psychological stress due to isolation and confinement. Implementing rigorous health monitoring systems and ensuring that the crew undergoes thorough training and psychological evaluations can help address these risks.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Disturbing deep-sea ecosystems can have unforeseen consequences. Activities such as drilling or collecting samples may harm delicate habitats. A comprehensive environmental impact assessment must be conducted, and measures should be put in place to minimize disruption, such as establishing no-take zones or using non-invasive sampling techniques.",
    "**Logistical Supply Chain**: Ensuring that all necessary supplies and equipment are available and functional before the mission begins is crucial. The logistics of transporting specialized equipment and maintaining a supply chain to remote locations can be complex. Creating a detailed logistical plan that includes contingency supplies and repair kits can help alleviate potential issues."
