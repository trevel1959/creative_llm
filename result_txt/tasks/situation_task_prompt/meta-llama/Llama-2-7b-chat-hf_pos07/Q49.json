    "Create a fire-resistant home: One creative solution to protect your home from a fire without fire-fighting equipment would be to build a fire-resistant home. This could involve using fire-resistant materials, such as brick, stone, or concrete, for the walls and roof of your home. Additionally, you could incorporate fire-resistant windows and doors, and use non-flammable materials for any exterior features, such as siding or trim. By building a fire-resistant home, you can create a safe haven for yourself and your loved ones in the event of a fire.",
    "Develop a fire-suppressing garden: Another creative solution would be to create a fire-suppressing garden around your home. This could involve planting fire-resistant plants, such as succulents or cacti, that are able to withstand high temperatures and help to suppress the spread of a fire. You could also incorporate fire-retardant ground cover, such as gravel or sand, to help slow the spread of a fire. By creating a fire-suppressing garden, you can help to protect your home from the flames and give yourself more time to escape in the event of a fire.",
    "Use a fire-starting drone: In a world without fire-fighting equipment, you could use a drone to start a fire that would help to suppress a larger fire. This could involve using a drone equipped with a fire-starting device, such as a flamethrower or a fire-starting potion, to create a small fire that would help to consume the oxygen around the larger fire, starving it of the fuel it needs to continue burning. By using a drone to start a fire, you could help to control the spread of a larger fire and protect your home from damage.",
    "Create a fire-detecting system: Another creative solution would be to create a fire-detecting system that would alert you to the presence of a fire before it reaches your home. This could involve using a network of sensors, such as smoke detectors or heat sensors, to detect the presence of a fire and alert you to take action. By detecting a fire early, you could have more time to escape and protect your home from damage.",
