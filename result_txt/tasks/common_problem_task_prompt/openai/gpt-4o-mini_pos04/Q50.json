    "**Diverse Stakeholder Interests**: Different residents may have varying priorities and visions for the community, leading to conflicts over land use, resource allocation, or communal activities. To address this, regular town hall meetings could be held to facilitate open dialogue, ensuring that all voices are heard. Additionally, forming a community council with representatives from different interest groups can help mediate disputes and foster collaboration.",
    "**Economic Viability**: Ensuring that the community is economically sustainable can be a challenge, especially if residents rely solely on niche markets for their goods and services. To enhance economic viability, the community could establish a local cooperative that supports small businesses, encourages barter systems, and promotes local products, thereby creating a self-sustaining economy that attracts external customers as well.",
    "**Waste Management Issues**: A sustainable community must effectively manage waste to minimize its environmental impact. However, residents may struggle with proper recycling and composting practices. Implementing a comprehensive waste management education program, along with accessible recycling stations and composting facilities, can help instill good habits. Additionally, hosting community clean-up events can raise awareness about waste reduction and encourage collective responsibility.",
    "**Social Cohesion and Inclusivity**: Creating a sense of community among diverse residents can be challenging, especially if individuals have different backgrounds, cultures, or lifestyles. To promote social cohesion, the community could organize regular social events, workshops, and cultural exchange programs. Establishing inclusive policies that celebrate diversity and encourage participation from all members can foster a sense of belonging and mutual respect.",
    "**Infrastructure and Accessibility**: Sustainable living communities may face challenges related to infrastructure, such as limited access to public transportation or essential services. To tackle this issue, the community could develop a shared transportation system, such as electric car-sharing or bicycle rental services. Additionally, ensuring that pathways and facilities are accessible for all residents, including those with disabilities, can enhance overall connectivity and inclusivity."
