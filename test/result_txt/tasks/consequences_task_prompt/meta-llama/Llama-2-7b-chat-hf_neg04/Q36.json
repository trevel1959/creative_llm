    "Enhanced Resilience: If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, they would be able to recover from injuries and amputations much faster and more efficiently. This would lead to a significant reduction in the risk of infection, blood loss, and organ failure, ultimately resulting in a lower mortality rate.",
    "Increased Mobility: With the ability to regenerate lost limbs, individuals would be able to move more freely and easily, without the burden of prosthetic limbs or the fear of injury. This would greatly improve their overall quality of life, allowing them to engage in a wider range of activities and enjoy greater mobility.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: Starfish have a highly developed sense of touch, which allows them to detect and respond to their surroundings in a way that is not possible for humans. If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, they would likely gain a similar level of sensory perception, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment in new and innovative ways.",
    "Unique Workforce Opportunities: With the ability to regenerate lost limbs, individuals could potentially take on jobs that require extensive manual labor, such as construction or manufacturing. This could lead to a significant increase in productivity and economic growth, as well as a reduction in the need for costly and time-consuming medical treatments.",
    "Ethical Concerns: The ability to regenerate limbs like starfish would raise a number of ethical concerns, including issues related to the distribution of limbs, the potential for exploitation, and the impact on the medical industry. For example, would limbs be available only to those who could afford them, or would they be distributed based on need? How would the medical industry adapt to this new technology, and what would be the impact on the role of doctors and surgeons? These are just a few of the many ethical considerations that would need to be addressed if humans were able to regenerate limbs like starfish."
