    "**Walking Meetings**: Encourage employees to hold walking meetings instead of sitting in conference rooms. Designate safe walking routes around the office or nearby parks. This not only promotes physical activity but also can lead to increased creativity and collaboration, as the change in environment can stimulate new ideas.",
    "**Gamified Fitness Challenges**: Introduce a company-wide fitness challenge where employees can form teams and compete in various activities, such as step counts, cycling, or even yoga sessions. Use an app to track progress and award points for participation, creativity, and achievements. This gamification can foster camaraderie and motivation among employees.",
    "**In-house Fitness Classes**: Hire a fitness instructor to conduct weekly classes such as yoga, Zumba, or Pilates right in the office. These classes can be scheduled during lunch breaks or after work hours, providing a convenient way for employees to engage in physical activity without having to leave the office.",
    "**Active Break Reminders**: Implement a system where employees receive reminders every hour to take a quick break and stretch or walk around the office. This can be done through a simple app or desktop notifications. Encouraging short bursts of activity can help alleviate the stiffness and fatigue that come from prolonged sitting.",
    "**Standing Desks and Movement-Friendly Workspaces**: Invest in standing desks or adjustable workstations that allow employees to alternate between sitting and standing. Additionally, create a more movement-friendly office layout by placing printers, water coolers, and communal areas further away from workstations to encourage employees to get up and move throughout the day."
