    "**Expandable Hose with Built-in Water Filter**: Design an expandable garden hose that features an integrated water filtration system. This would allow users to filter out impurities from their water source while watering their plants. The hose could have a replaceable filter cartridge, ensuring that plants receive clean water, which is especially beneficial for sensitive species.",
    "**Self-Reeling Hose with a Timer**: Create a self-reeling garden hose that incorporates a programmable timer. Gardeners could set the timer to automatically reel in the hose after a certain period, preventing tangling and damage. This would also encourage users to stick to a watering schedule, promoting efficient use of water and reducing waste.",
    "**Multi-Functional Hose with Attachments**: Develop a garden hose that comes with interchangeable attachments for various tasks. Attachments could include a spray nozzle, a brush for cleaning, a fertilizer injector, and a weeding tool. This would allow users to switch between tasks without needing multiple tools, saving time and space in the garden shed.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hose Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a garden hose made entirely from recycled materials, such as repurposed rubber or plastics. This hose would not only be durable and weather-resistant but also environmentally friendly. It could be marketed to eco-conscious consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint while gardening.",
    "**LED Light-Up Hose**: Introduce a garden hose that features built-in LED lights. This could be especially useful for nighttime gardening or watering. The lights could be solar-powered and would illuminate the area around the hose, making it easier to see where water is being applied and enhancing safety in dimly lit outdoor spaces."
