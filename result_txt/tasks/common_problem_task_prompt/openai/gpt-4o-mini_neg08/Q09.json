    "**Nutrition Mismanagement**: Nutrition plays a critical role in a runner's performance. Some may not pay attention to their dietary needs, leading to energy depletion on race day. To address this, participants should educate themselves on pre-race meals, hydration strategies, and post-race recovery nutrition. Organizing workshops or webinars with sports nutritionists could help runners make informed choices.",
    "**Mental Blocks**: Running long distances can be as much a mental challenge as a physical one. Runners might face anxiety, self-doubt, or lack of motivation as race day approaches. Incorporating mental conditioning techniques such as visualization, positive affirmations, or mindfulness practices can help runners build mental resilience. Creating a support group for runners to share their fears and strategies can also foster a sense of community and encouragement.",
    "**Inappropriate Gear**: Wearing the wrong shoes or clothing can lead to discomfort, blisters, or chafing during the race. Runners should be advised to invest time in selecting appropriate gear that suits their running style and body type. Organizing gear testing sessions or pop-up shops at local running clubs can provide runners with the opportunity to try on different shoes and apparel before race day.",
    "**Weather Conditions**: Weather can be unpredictable, and runners may not be prepared for extreme heat, cold, or rain on race day. Participants should be encouraged to check weather forecasts leading up to the event and plan accordingly. Creating a \"race day checklist\" that includes clothing options for various weather conditions can help runners feel more prepared and less anxious about potential weather-related issues.",
    "**Injury Risks**: The risk of injury is heightened during training or on race day, especially if runners push their limits. Common injuries include shin splints, runner's knee, and plantar fasciitis. Runners should be educated on proper warm-up and cool-down routines, as well as the importance of listening to their bodies. Offering injury prevention workshops or partnering with physiotherapists for pre-race assessments can be beneficial."
