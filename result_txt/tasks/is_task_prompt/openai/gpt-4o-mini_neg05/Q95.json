    "Once in the lush jungles of Sundara, there lived a fierce tiger named Tigris. Known for his strength, he ruled the forest with pride. However, Tigris harbored a secret fear: mice. Their tiny squeaks and quick movements sent shivers down his spine. One day, while prowling near the river, he stumbled upon a family of mice. They trembled at the sight of him, but one brave little mouse named Minu stepped forward. “Why are you scared of us?” she squeaked. Tigris confessed, and to his surprise, Minu offered friendship. From that day on, Tigris learned that true strength lies in overcoming fears.",
