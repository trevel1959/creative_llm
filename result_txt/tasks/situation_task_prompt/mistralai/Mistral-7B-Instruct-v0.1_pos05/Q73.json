    "Invent a shade-providing device that uses a cooling technology like a fan or a misting system. This device could be portable and easy to use, making it a viable alternative to trees on hot days.",
    "Develop a shade-producing building or structure that utilizes reflective materials or shading devices to keep the interior cool and comfortable. This could be a new type of architecture or a modification to existing structures.",
    "Create a new type of plant that is specifically designed to provide shade and cooling properties. This could be a genetically modified plant or a new species that has been engineered for this purpose.",
    "Develop a new technology that uses solar energy to power a cooling system that can be used to create shade in outdoor spaces. This could be a solar-powered misting system or a solar-powered fan that can be placed in strategic locations to provide shade.",
    "Use reflective materials like mirrors or metal to create a large-scale reflective surface that can be used to bounce sunlight back into the sky, creating a cooling effect. This could be done in urban areas or on large-scale structures to create a natural cooling system."
