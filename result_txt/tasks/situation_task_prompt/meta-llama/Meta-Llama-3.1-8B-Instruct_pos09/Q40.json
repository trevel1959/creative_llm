    "**Solar-Powered Wearables**: Develop wearable technology that harnesses solar energy to charge devices. These wearables could be wristbands, hats, or even clothing that converts sunlight into electricity, allowing people to power their devices on the go.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting**: Design a system that captures kinetic energy from human movement, such as walking or running, and converts it into electrical energy. This could be achieved through specialized shoes or insoles that generate power as you move.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Create devices that extract water from the air, even in arid environments, and use it to generate electricity through electrolysis or fuel cells. This would provide a sustainable source of power and clean water.",
    "**Bio-Electrochemical Systems**: Develop microbial fuel cells that harness the energy produced by microorganisms breaking down organic matter. This could be used to power devices in areas with limited access to traditional energy sources.",
    "**Piezoelectric Roads**: Design roads with built-in piezoelectric materials that generate electricity from the vibrations of passing vehicles. This would create a self-sustaining energy source for urban areas, reducing reliance on traditional power grids."
