    "**Waste Segregation at Home**: Encouraging households to segregate their waste at home into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories would be another effective solution. Biodegradable waste could be composted at home, while non-biodegradable waste could be taken to designated drop-off points.",
    "**Public Composting**: Installing public composting bins in parks, plazas, and other high-traffic areas would help manage organic waste. These bins could be used to collect food waste, garden waste, and other organic materials, which could then be composted and used to fertilize public spaces.",
    "**Education and Awareness**: Conducting community workshops and awareness campaigns about waste management and the importance of recycling would encourage individuals to take responsibility for their waste. This could include tips on reducing waste, proper waste segregation, and the benefits of recycling.",
    "**Incentives for Waste Management**: Implementing a system of incentives for waste management could motivate people to properly dispose of their waste. This could include rewards for recycling, discounts on products that are environmentally friendly, or even tax breaks for businesses that demonstrate good waste management practices.",
    "**Waste Management App**: Developing an app that allows users to track their waste disposal and recycling activities could be a useful tool. The app could provide information on waste segregation, local recycling facilities, and even offer rewards for responsible waste disposal."
