    "Solar-Powered Computer: Create a computer that harnesses the power of the sun to operate. This computer would be equipped with solar panels on its casing, which would absorb sunlight during the day and convert it into electrical energy to power the computer's components. This eco-friendly design would eliminate the need for a power cord, making it ideal for outdoor use or in areas with limited access to electricity.",
    "Water-Cooled Computer: Design a computer that utilizes water as a cooling mechanism instead of traditional air cooling methods. The computer would be equipped with a water-cooled CPU, GPU, and other components, which would be immersed in a water-based coolant. This design would provide efficient heat dissipation, reducing the risk of overheating and prolonging the lifespan of the components. The water cooling system would also be self-contained, eliminating the need for additional cooling fans.",
    "Modular Computer: Create a computer that consists of interchangeable modules, allowing users to upgrade or replace individual components without replacing the entire system. This design would make it easier to maintain and repair the computer, as well as enable users to upgrade their hardware as new technologies emerge. The modules could be connected using a standardized interface, making it easy to switch out components.",
    "Bendable Computer: Design a computer that can be bent, twisted, and manipulated into various shapes and forms. This flexible computer would be made of a durable, flexible material, such as a flexible OLED display or a flexible printed circuit board. This design would allow users to easily transport and store the computer, as well as use it in unique and creative ways, such as attaching it to a wall or incorporating it into a piece of furniture.",
    "Bio-Inspired Computer: Inspired by the structure and function of living organisms, design a computer that mimics the natural world. The computer would be composed of interconnected, interdependent components, such as a CPU that resembles a neuron and a GPU that resembles a network of synapses. This design would allow the computer to adapt and evolve over time, much like living organisms, and provide improved performance and efficiency. The computer's components would also be designed to be bi"
