    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Integrate solar panels into the phone’s casing to allow for solar charging. This would be particularly useful for users in areas with limited access to electricity. Challenges may include ensuring the solar panels are efficient enough to provide meaningful charge, the durability of the panels, and how to incorporate them without making the phone bulky or unattractive.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: Develop a built-in AI that learns from user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations, automate tasks, and improve overall user experience. Issues to consider include data privacy concerns, the complexity of programming the AI to understand diverse user needs, and ensuring the AI can operate offline without a significant loss in functionality.",
    "**Flexible Display Technology**: Use advanced flexible display technology to create a smartphone that can be rolled or folded without damage. This would allow for a larger screen that can fit in a pocket. Potential problems could involve durability over time, the cost of production, and the challenge of maintaining screen quality and responsiveness in a flexible format.",
    "**Sustainable Materials**: Design the smartphone using sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bioplastics or recycled metals. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Challenges include sourcing these materials, ensuring they meet durability and performance standards, and the potential increase in manufacturing costs.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Incorporate AR capabilities directly into the smartphone’s hardware and software, allowing users to interact with their environment in new ways. This could enhance gaming, navigation, and shopping experiences. Potential issues might involve the need for powerful processing capabilities, the development of AR content, and the challenge of ensuring a seamless user experience."
