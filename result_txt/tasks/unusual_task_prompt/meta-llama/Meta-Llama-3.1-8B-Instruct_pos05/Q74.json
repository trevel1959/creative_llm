    "**Smart Steering Wheel with Integrated Holographic Display**:    This concept combines the traditional steering wheel with cutting-edge technology. The steering wheel features a holographic display that projects vital information, such as navigation directions, speed, and fuel levels, directly onto the wheel. The holographic display is controlled by voice commands or hand gestures, allowing drivers to access information without taking their eyes off the road. The display can also be customized to show the driver's favorite music playlist, upcoming appointments, or even a virtual assistant to assist with tasks like sending messages or making calls.",
    "**Adaptive Steering Wheel with Shape-Shifting Design**:    This innovative steering wheel features a shape-shifting design that adjusts to the driver's preferences and driving style. The wheel can change its shape, size, and material to provide optimal comfort and control. For example, during long road trips, the wheel can expand to provide more cushioning and support, while in sports mode, it can become smaller and more responsive for a more engaging driving experience.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Integrated Biometric Sensors**:    This concept incorporates biometric sensors into the steering wheel to monitor the driver's vital signs and emotional state. The sensors can detect changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological responses to provide real-time feedback on the driver's stress levels and fatigue. The vehicle can then adjust its settings to optimize comfort and safety, such as adjusting the temperature, lighting, and music to create a more relaxing environment.",
    "**Steering Wheel with Haptic Feedback and Vibration**:    This design incorporates advanced haptic feedback technology into the steering wheel, providing a tactile and immersive experience for the driver. The wheel can simulate the sensation of road texture, bumps, and other environmental factors, creating a more engaging and realistic driving experience. The haptic feedback can also be used to alert the driver to potential hazards or provide guidance during navigation.",
    "**Steering Wheel with AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance**:    This concept integrates AI-powered predictive maintenance into the steering"
