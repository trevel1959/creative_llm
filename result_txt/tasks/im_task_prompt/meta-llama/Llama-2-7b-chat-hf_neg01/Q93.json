    "Bowling Ball-Inspired Furniture: Design and create furniture pieces that are inspired by the shape and weight of bowling balls.

The decor could feature bowling ball-shaped light fixtures, bowling ball-printed tablecloths, and even bowling ball-shaped food items like bowling ball-shaped burgers or bowling ball-shaped fries. Customers could even participate in bowling-themed games and activities, like a bowling ball-themed escape room or a bowling ball-themed bingo night.",
    "Bowling Ball-Inspired Workout Equipment: Create a line of workout equipment inspired by bowling balls. For example, a bowling ball-shaped kettlebell or a bowling ball-weighted dumbbell.

    "Bowling Ball-Themed Board Game: Design and create a board game that is inspired by the game of bowling. Players could roll dice to move around the game board, trying to knock down virtual pins and score points. The game could feature different levels and challenges, like special power-up balls that give players extra rolls or special obstacles that make it harder to knock down pins. The game could be played with two to four players and would be a fun and interactive way to enjoy the game of bowling with friends and family."
