    "**Budget Overruns**: Large-scale events often have many moving parts, and costs can spiral out of control due to unforeseen expenses such as catering price increases, additional staffing needs, or equipment rentals. To address this, create a detailed budget with a contingency fund of at least 10-15% for unexpected costs and track expenses meticulously throughout the planning process.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating transportation, accommodations, and on-site logistics can be daunting. Problems can arise from miscommunication with vendors, delays in transportation, or insufficient accommodations for guests. A solution is to create a detailed logistics plan that includes timelines, vendor contact information, and backup transportation options, along with a dedicated team to manage logistics on the event day.",
    "**Technical Failures**: A large-scale event often relies heavily on technology, from audio-visual equipment to Wi-Fi access. Technical failures can lead to disruptions in presentations, entertainment, or connectivity. To prevent this, conduct a thorough technical rehearsal prior to the event, have backup equipment on hand, and hire a reliable technical team to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the event.",
    "**Attendee Engagement**: Ensuring that attendees are engaged and enjoying the event can be challenging, especially if the agenda is packed or if there are long periods of downtime. To combat this, incorporate interactive elements such as live polls, Q&A sessions, or networking opportunities throughout the event. Consider using an event app that allows attendees to connect and participate actively.",
    "**Catering Complications**: Food allergies, dietary restrictions, and preferences can create complications when planning catering for a large group. If not addressed, this could lead to dissatisfaction among attendees. To tackle this, send out a survey ahead of the event to collect dietary preferences and allergies, and work closely with the caterer to ensure a variety of options are available."
