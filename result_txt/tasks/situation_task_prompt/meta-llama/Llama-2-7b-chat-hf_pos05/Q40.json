    "Solar-Powered Batteries: Develop a new type of battery that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. These batteries would be equipped with solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy, which can then be stored and used to power devices. This would provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy, eliminating the need for traditional batteries.",
    "Kinetic Energy Harvesting: Create devices that can harness kinetic energy from movement, such as pedaling a bike or swinging a pendulum, to generate electricity. These devices could be integrated into clothing, furniture, or even built into buildings, providing a constant source of power for devices.",
    "Thermal Energy Storage: Develop a new type of battery that stores thermal energy, which can be generated from a variety of sources such as heat from the sun, human body heat, or waste heat from industrial processes. This thermal energy can be stored in a phase-change material, which can then be used to generate electricity when needed.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Develop a new type of battery that uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity. Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, including renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and can be stored in a fuel cell to generate electricity when needed. This would provide a clean and efficient source of power for devices.",
    "Magnetic Induction Charging: Create a new type of battery that uses magnetic induction to charge devices. This technology would involve placing a device on a charging pad, which would use magnetic fields to transfer energy wirelessly to the device, eliminating the need for traditional batteries. This technology could be used for a variety of devices, including smartphones, laptops, and even electric vehicles."
