The AR display will use the phone's camera and sensors to track the user's movements and adjust the virtual objects accordingly.",
    "Smartphone-Powered Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): Create a smartphone app that acts as a brain-computer interface (BCI). Users can connect the app to a headset or other BCI device, which will read brain signals and translate them into commands for the phone. This will allow users to control their phone using only their thoughts.",
    "Smartphone-Based Home Automation System: Develop a smartphone app that can control various smart devices in the home, such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
