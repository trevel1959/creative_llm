    "**Smart Flashlight with Built-in Navigation System**: Develop a flashlight that not only provides light but also includes a built-in navigation system. This system could use GPS, compass, and accelerometer data to provide turn-by-turn directions, even in areas with no cellular service. The flashlight could also include a display screen to show maps, routes, and other navigation information. This would be particularly useful for hikers, campers, and outdoor enthusiasts who often find themselves lost in the wilderness.",
    "**Flashlight with Integrated First Aid Kit**: Design a flashlight that doubles as a portable first aid kit. The flashlight could include a small compartment that stores basic first aid supplies such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers. The compartment could be accessed by a small door or hatch on the flashlight, and could also include a guide on basic first aid techniques. This would be useful for emergency responders, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone who spends time in remote areas.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in Power Bank**: Create a flashlight that also serves as a portable power bank. The flashlight could include a rechargeable battery that can be used to charge other devices such as smartphones, tablets, and cameras. The power bank could be accessed by a USB port or wireless charging pad, and could also include a display screen to show the remaining battery life. This would be useful for anyone who spends time outdoors and needs to keep their devices charged.",
    "**Flashlight with Integrated Communication Device**: Design a flashlight that includes a built-in communication device such as a two-way radio or satellite phone. The communication device could be used to call for help in emergency situations, and could also be used to communicate with other team members or emergency responders. The flashlight could also include a display screen to show messages or call logs. This would be useful for search and rescue teams, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone who spends time in remote areas.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in Camera and Night Vision**: Create a flashlight that includes a built-in camera and night vision capabilities. The camera could be used to take photos or videos in low-light environments, and the night vision capabilities could be used to enhance visibility in complete darkness. The flashlight could also include a display screen to show the camera feed or night vision image. This would be useful for surveillance applications, search and rescue operations, and anyone who needs to navigate in low-light environments. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas leverage the functionality of a flashlight to provide additional features and benefits, making them more useful and innovative."
