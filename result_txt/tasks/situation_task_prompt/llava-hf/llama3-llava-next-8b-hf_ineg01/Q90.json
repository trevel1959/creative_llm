    "Rainwater Harvesting Systems: Cities could install rainwater harvesting systems on rooftops and other structures to collect water from rain. The water would be stored in tanks and used for various purposes, such as flushing toilets, washing dishes, and other non-potable uses.",
    "Fog Catchers: Fog catchers could be used to collect water from the air. These devices would be installed in areas where fog is prevalent and would capture the fog using mesh-like structures. The water would be collected and used for various purposes, such as drinking and irrigation.",
    "Atmospheric Water Generation: Cities could use atmospheric water generation systems to extract water from the air. These systems would use a combination of heat and humidity to condense water vapor into liquid water, which could then be collected and used for various purposes.",
    "Geothermal Energy: Geothermal energy could be used to generate water. This energy is derived from the heat generated by the Earth's core and could be used to heat water and create steam, which could then be used to power turbines to generate electricity. The electricity could then be used to power desalination plants, which would produce fresh water from saltwater.",
    "Solar Water Purification: In a world without rain, solar water purification systems could be used to clean water from other sources, such as lakes and rivers. These systems would use the sun's energy to heat water and kill bacteria and other contaminants, making the water safe to drink."
