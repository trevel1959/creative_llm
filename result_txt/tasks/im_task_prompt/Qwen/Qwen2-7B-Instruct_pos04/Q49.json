    "**Integrated Oral Health Monitoring**: Design an electric toothbrush that includes sensors capable of monitoring oral health in real-time. This toothbrush could detect issues like plaque buildup, gum inflammation, or cavities, then provide personalized feedback and recommendations to users through a mobile app. The data collected could also be shared with dental professionals for remote monitoring.",
    "**Customizable Oral Care Experience**: Create an electric toothbrush that offers a variety of interchangeable heads designed for different purposes (such as sensitive teeth, whitening, or gum health). Each head would be equipped with unique technology (like different bristle types, vibration patterns, or embedded sensors) tailored to specific oral care needs. Users can choose the head that best suits their current oral health condition.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush Integration with Voice Assistants**: Develop an electric toothbrush that integrates with popular voice assistants (like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri). This integration would allow users to control the toothbrush's settings through voice commands, get reminders about brushing times, and receive suggestions for better oral hygiene routines based on voice assistant data.",
    "**Environmental-Friendly Electric Toothbrush**: Design an eco-friendly electric toothbrush that uses rechargeable batteries made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, the toothbrush could be designed to have a longer lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements. A portion of sales could be donated to environmental causes, promoting a sense of social responsibility among users.",
    "**Socially Engaging Oral Hygiene App**: Create a mobile app that pairs with the electric toothbrush, allowing users to connect with friends or family members to compete in daily or weekly oral hygiene challenges. Users can earn points for brushing regularly, using the right technique, and achieving goals set by the app. Social features could include sharing progress, achievements, and tips, fostering a community focused on improving oral health collectively."
