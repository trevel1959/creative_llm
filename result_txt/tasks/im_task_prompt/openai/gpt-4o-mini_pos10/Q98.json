    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: One of the biggest hassles of using a juicer is cleaning it afterward. A juicer with a self-cleaning function could utilize high-pressure water jets and a rotating brush system to clean the juicing components automatically. Users would simply need to add water and a cleaning solution, and the juicer would take care of the rest, making it more convenient and encouraging regular use.",
    "**Juice Preservation Technology**: Develop a juicer that not only extracts juice but also has a built-in vacuum sealing system. After juicing, the machine could package the juice in a vacuum-sealed container, which would help preserve nutrients and extend shelf life. This would be ideal for people who want to make juice in bulk but worry about oxidation and nutrient loss.",
    "**Multi-Function Juicer**: Create a juicer that doubles as a food processor and blender. This all-in-one appliance could allow users to switch between juicing, blending smoothies, and chopping vegetables with interchangeable attachments. This versatility would save kitchen space and make meal prep more efficient, appealing to health-conscious individuals looking to streamline their cooking process.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Design a juicer made from biodegradable materials or recycled plastics to reduce environmental impact. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient motors and solar panels that can charge the juicer, allowing it to operate off-grid. This eco-friendly approach would attract environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability.",
    "**Personalized Juice Flavor Profiles**: Develop a juicer that allows users to create personalized flavor profiles through an app. The juicer could have a built-in flavor enhancer that infuses juices with natural flavorings, such as herbs or spices, based on user preferences. This would encourage creativity and experimentation, making the juicing experience more enjoyable."
