    "**Reflective Surfaces**: In the absence of mirrors, people would start to utilize other reflective surfaces around them. Shiny metal objects, glass windows, or polished stone could serve as makeshift mirrors. This could lead to a boom in the popularity of reflective art installations or architecture, where buildings are designed with highly reflective materials to provide functional and aesthetic value.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Devices**: With the disappearance of mirrors, technology would fill the gap. Wearable AR glasses could project a virtual reflection of oneself in real-time. These devices could use facial recognition and image processing to create a lifelike representation, allowing individuals to see their appearance without needing a physical mirror. This would revolutionize how people engage with their self-image, making personal grooming and fashion choices more tech-centric.",
    "**Self-Reflection Robots**: Imagine small, friendly robots equipped with cameras and screens that follow individuals around. These robots could capture a live video feed of the person and display it on their screens, allowing users to see their reflections in real-time. This concept could also integrate with social media, enabling users to take selfies or videos directly from the robot's perspective.",
    "**Light Reflection Art**: Artists and designers could create interactive installations using light and shadow to reflect a person's image. For example, a room with strategically placed lights and surfaces could project a silhouette or a colored version of a person’s image on the wall. This artistic approach would transform the act of seeing oneself into an immersive experience, blending art with personal reflection.",
    "**Reflective Clothing**: Fashion designers could innovate by creating garments made from reflective materials that can act as mirrors. When someone wears these clothes, they would be able to see their reflection in the fabric, offering a new way to check one’s appearance. This could lead to a fashion trend where clothing not only serves aesthetic purposes but also functional ones, encouraging a new wave of self-expression."
