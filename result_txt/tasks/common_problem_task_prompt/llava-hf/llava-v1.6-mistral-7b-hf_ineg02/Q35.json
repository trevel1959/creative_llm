    "Ethical Responsibilities – Zoos are often criticized for keeping animals in captivity and not providing them with an environment that replicates their natural habitat. This raises ethical questions about whether the zoo's purpose is to educate the public about wildlife conservation and care or if it prioritizes visitor satisfaction and entertainment. Addressing these ethical concerns can be a significant challenge for zoo management.",
    "Public Safety – With a large number of visitors at the zoo, security measures need to be put in place to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all attendees. This could involve training zoo staff to de-escalate situations and train visitors in appropriate behavior around potentially dangerous animals. Additionally, there might be concerns about the potential spread of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans.",
    "Staff Training and Education – To meet high standards of animal welfare, zoo staff must be well-trained in animal husbandry, veterinary care, and zoo management best practices. This can be challenging, as the cost of training and ongoing education might be high, and there may be a shortage of skilled staff in certain locations.",
    "Financial Sustainability – Running a zoo can be expensive due to the cost of housing and maintaining animals, providing adequate space, and ensuring staff are paid and trained. If not done properly, the zoo might struggle financially and fail to attract enough visitors to cover its costs.",
    "Community Outreach – Zoos play a critical role in educating the public about wildlife conservation and fostering a connection with animals. It is crucial for the zoo to develop engaging programs and experiences that attract various demographics and create a sense of stewardship towards the natural world."
