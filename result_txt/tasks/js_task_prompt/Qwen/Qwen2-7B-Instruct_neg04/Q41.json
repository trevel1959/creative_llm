    "**Global Recycling Mandate:** Enforce a global recycling policy where every product or material must be recycled or repurposed after use. This would drastically reduce landfill waste, pollution, and the demand for new raw materials. By making recycling mandatory, we can encourage innovation in recycling technologies and incentivize companies to produce more sustainable products.",
    "**Universal Basic Income (UBI):** Implement a universal basic income where every individual receives a fixed amount of money from the government on a regular basis, regardless of their employment status. This would ensure that everyone has a minimum standard of living and can afford basic necessities without needing to work. It would also eliminate poverty, encourage entrepreneurship, and reduce the need for welfare systems.",
    "**Educational Reform:** Require all educational institutions to integrate a comprehensive curriculum that includes financial literacy, emotional intelligence, and sustainability. This would equip students with essential life skills and knowledge, fostering responsible citizenship and informed decision-making. Additionally, promoting these subjects would help address societal issues like debt, mental health, and environmental degradation.",
    "**Global Health Care System:** Establish a global health care system where every person has access to affordable and quality healthcare services. This would involve international cooperation, sharing resources, and technology to provide vaccinations, treatments, and preventive care to all. By prioritizing health as a fundamental human right, we can improve overall population health, reduce healthcare disparities, and contribute to global stability.",
    "**Digital Privacy Protection:** Enact strict global laws protecting personal data privacy and requiring all tech companies to implement robust data protection measures. This would limit surveillance, prevent identity theft, and protect individuals' autonomy online. By prioritizing digital privacy, we can safeguard personal freedoms, foster trust in technology, and prevent the misuse of personal information by governments and corporations."
