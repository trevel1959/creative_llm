    "**ECHO** (Elevated Cognitive Help Overlay): ECHO is a wearable device that utilizes AI-powered computer vision and spatial audio to create a 3D map of the environment. It provides real-time audio cues, allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate through spaces with ease. ECHO's advanced algorithms can detect and alert users to potential hazards, such as stairs or uneven flooring, ensuring a safer and more independent experience.",
    "**Tactile Atlas**: This innovative tactile mapping system uses a combination of 3D printing and sensory feedback to create a tactile representation of the environment. By tracing the contours of a space, users can build a mental map, allowing them to better understand their surroundings. The Tactile Atlas can be used in conjunction with ECHO to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environment.",
    "**SoundScape**: SoundScape is an immersive audio experience that utilizes 3D audio technology to recreate the sounds of a space. By wearing a pair of specialized headphones, visually impaired individuals can \"see\" their surroundings through sound. This technology can be used to detect and identify objects, people, and even emotions, providing a more nuanced understanding of the environment.",
    "**SmartCane**: The SmartCane is an advanced, AI-powered cane that uses sensors and computer vision to detect and alert users to potential hazards. It can detect stairs, uneven flooring, and even obstacles like low-hanging branches. The SmartCane also includes a built-in GPS and mapping system, allowing users to navigate through unfamiliar spaces with confidence.",
    "**EyeConnect**: EyeConnect is a wearable device that uses electrooculography (EOG) to detect and interpret eye movements. This technology can be used to control a computer or other devices, allowing visually impaired individuals to interact with the world in a more intuitive way. EyeConnect can also be used to provide real-time feedback and guidance, helping users to better navigate their surroundings."
