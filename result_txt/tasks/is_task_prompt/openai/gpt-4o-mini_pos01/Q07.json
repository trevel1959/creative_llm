    "In a forgotten valley, a colossal mountain stood still for centuries, watching over the villagers below. One fateful night, a comet streaked across the sky, striking the mountain's peak. To everyone's astonishment, the mountain began to shift, inching closer to the village. The villagers, terrified, believed it was a curse. However, as the mountain settled, it revealed a hidden cave filled with precious gems and ancient artifacts. The villagers soon realized the mountain had moved not to harm them but to share its treasures, transforming their lives forever. They celebrated, honoring the mountain that became their protector.",
