    "**Building a Shelter**: The first priority upon waking up on a deserted island is to find or build shelter. You can use natural resources like branches, leaves, and vines to create a sturdy structure that will protect you from the elements. A conical or dome-shaped shelter is ideal as it maximizes space and minimizes material usage.",
    "**Water Collection and Purification**: Access to clean water is crucial for survival. You can construct a water collection system by digging a small hole and creating a funnel using leaves or a plastic bag to collect rainwater. For purification, consider using UV light devices or boil water for at least 3-5 minutes to kill any potential pathogens.",
    "**Wild Food Gathering**: Learning about edible plants and fruits on the island can provide immediate sustenance. Take time to identify safe foods and understand their uses. Additionally, fishing can be an excellent source of protein. You can use simple tools like a homemade spear, line, or even a handline to catch fish in nearby waters.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: Creating a signal for rescue is essential. Use materials found on the island to build a large cross, SOS sign, or smoke signals. If possible, collect dry wood and use it to start a fire, which can also serve as a way to keep warm, cook food, and purify water.",
    "**Survival Skills Training**: Use this time to learn new survival skills such as first aid, basic carpentry, or how to navigate using the stars. These skills could be invaluable not just for immediate survival but also for long-term resilience on the island. Consider creating a rudimentary map of your surroundings to help guide your daily activities and potential escape routes. "
