    "Build a satellite-on-a-rocket: Create a satellite that can be launched into space using a rocket. The satellite can be designed to collect data on various aspects of space, such as temperature, radiation, and atmospheric conditions. The satellite can also be equipped with advanced communication systems to enable real-time communication with Earth. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Space-based Solar Power: Design a satellite that can harness the energy of the sun and convert it into electricity. The satellite can be equipped with solar panels and advanced energy storage systems to provide a reliable source of clean energy. The satellite can also be used to provide power to remote areas on Earth. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Space Tether: Develop a satellite that can be used to create a space tether, which is a long, thin cable that can be used to generate electricity by harnessing the energy of the Earth's rotation. The satellite can be equipped with a rotor or a set of solar panels to generate electricity, which can then be transmitted to Earth through the tether. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Space-based Weather Station: Create a satellite that can be used to monitor weather patterns in space. The satellite can be equipped with advanced sensors and cameras to collect data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related factors. The satellite can also be used to monitor the health of satellites and spacecraft in orbit. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Space-based Gravity Research: Design a satellite that can be used to study the effects of microgravity on living organisms. The satellite can be equipped with specialized containers that can hold various types of plants, animals, and even humans in a simulated microgravity environment. The satellite can also be used to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and to develop countermeasures for long-term space travel. Confidence Score: 0.9"
