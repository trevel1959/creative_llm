    "Solar Still: Create a large, shallow dish with a clear plastic sheet and a weight on top to create a solar still. As the sun heats the plastic, water vapor will condense and collect in the bottom of the dish. This method is effective in dry climates with little to no humidity.",
    "Dew Collection: Create a series of shallow, sloping channels on a roof or surface, allowing dew to collect and pool in the bottom. The channels can be covered with a mesh or net to prevent insects and debris from entering.",
    "Water-Absorbing Materials: Develop a specialized material that can absorb and retain water, such as a sponge or gel-like substance. This material could be placed in a container or attached to a surface to collect water.",
    "Atmospheric Water Generators: Create a device that can extract water from the air, using a process called atmospheric water generation. This device can be powered by solar energy and can collect water in a container or tank.",
    "AquaBloom: Develop a system that utilizes a specialized type of algae that can convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into water. This system can be placed in a container or attached to a surface and can provide a sustainable source of water in dry climates."
