    "Desert-dwelling species, such as camels, would face significant habitat loss, while other species that rely on forests, such as many birds and small mammals, would gain new habitats.",
    "Forests would also become more biodiverse as new plant and animal species that were once limited to the desert could now thrive in the newly formed forests.",
    "Water sources in the desert would be replenished, potentially providing new sources of freshwater for drinking and agriculture.",
    "The sudden change in climate would likely lead to a rapid shift in global weather patterns, potentially affecting global temperatures and precipitation levels.",
    "The increased forest cover could lead to a significant reduction in dust storms and sand dunes, which are common in desert environments."
