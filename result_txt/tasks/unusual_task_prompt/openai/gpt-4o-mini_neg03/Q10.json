    "**Bookmark**: Instead of a traditional bookmark, use a pen to mark your page. Simply clip the pen onto the page you want to save, and it will hold your place while also being easily accessible for writing notes or thoughts as you read. You can even use different colored pens to mark different sections or types of notes.",
    "**Artistic Stencil Maker**: Create unique designs or stencils by using the pen to draw shapes on paper, then cutting them out. The hollow barrel of some pens can also be used to create circular stencils. This can be particularly useful for crafting, scrapbooking, or creating art projects.",
    "**Emergency Phone Stand**: If you need to prop up your phone for a video call or to watch a video, a pen can serve as a makeshift stand. By placing the pen in a triangular position with the phone resting on it, you can create a stable support. This is particularly useful when youâ€™re on the go and need to use your phone hands-free.",
    "**Scented Air Freshener**: Soak the ink cartridge of a pen in essential oils, then place it in a small, open container. The pen will release a subtle fragrance into the air as the oil evaporates. This is a creative way to utilize old pens while also keeping your space smelling fresh.",
    "**DIY Musical Instrument**: Transform a pen into a simple wind instrument by blowing across the top of the pen. The hollow body can produce different pitches depending on how you cover the end with your fingers. This can be a fun activity for kids or a quirky way to make music when you're in a pinch."
