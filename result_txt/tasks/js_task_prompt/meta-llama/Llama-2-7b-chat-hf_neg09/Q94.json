    "Gravity Energy: Imagine a world where gravity is harnessed and converted into a usable form of energy. This new form of energy, dubbed \"Graviton,\" would be generated by manipulating the gravitational forces between objects. With Graviton, we could power entire cities with the sheer force of gravity. Buildings could be designed to harness this energy, and even personal devices could be created to generate a small amount of Graviton for everyday use. The possibilities are endless!",
    "Sonic Energy: Introducing \"Sonic Energy,\" a revolutionary new form of power that harnesses the vibrational frequencies of sound. By harnessing the energy of sound waves, Sonic Energy could be used to generate electricity, power vehicles, and even treat medical conditions. Imagine a world where the hum of a car engine is not just a nuisance, but a source of sustainable energy. With Sonic Energy, we could create a future where sound is not just something we hear, but something we harness to power our lives.",
    "Aurora Energy: What if we could harness the majestic beauty of the aurora borealis to generate electricity? Introducing \"Aurora Energy,\" a new form of energy that captures the ethereal light of the northern lights and converts it into a sustainable source of power. Aurora Energy would be generated by installing specialized panels in areas with high levels of auroral activity, allowing us to harness the natural light show for energy. Imagine a world where the aurora borealis is not just a natural wonder, but a source of clean, sustainable energy.",
    "Solar Wind Energy: Imagine a world where the sun's energy is harnessed not just from its rays, but from the very wind it creates. \"Solar Wind Energy\" is a new form of power that captures the charged particles emitted by the sun and converts them into electricity. By installing specialized turbines in space, we could harness the solar wind and generate a sustainable source of energy that is both limitless and clean. With Solar Wind Energy, we could power entire cities without contributing to climate change.",
    "Quantum Energy: Welcome to the world of \"Quantum Energy,\" a revolutionary new form of power that harnesses the strange and"
