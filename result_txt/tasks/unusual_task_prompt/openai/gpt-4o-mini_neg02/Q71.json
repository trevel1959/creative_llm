This creates a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a dinner party or a relaxing evening at home. You could even use multiple teapots of varying sizes for an eclectic centerpiece.",
    "**Bird Feeder**: Convert an old teapot into a whimsical bird feeder. Attach it to a tree branch or a post, and fill it with birdseed.
