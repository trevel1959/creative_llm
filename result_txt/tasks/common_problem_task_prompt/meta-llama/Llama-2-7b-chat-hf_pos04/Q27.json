    "Mucosal vaccine delivery: Developing vaccines that are specifically designed to target mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts.",
    "DNA-based vaccines: Developing vaccines that use DNA to encode for viral antigens, which are then expressed in the body and stimulate an immune response.",
    "Recombinant viral vectors: Developing vaccines that use recombinant viruses to deliver viral antigens to immune cells, which would then stimulate an immune response.",
