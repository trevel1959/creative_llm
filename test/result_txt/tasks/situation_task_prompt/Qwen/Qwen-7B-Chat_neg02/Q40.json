    "Use human energy: If all batteries stopped working, one creative solution could be to harness the power of human movement. People could use their body heat to generate electricity through special suits or devices that convert kinetic energy into electrical energy. This could power everything from smartphones to vehicles.",
    "Solar-powered charging stations: Another option could be to install solar-powered charging stations in public places like parks, bus stops, and train stations. These charging stations would use solar panels to capture energy from the sun and store it in batteries, which could then be used to charge electronic devices.",
    "Wind turbines: In areas with high winds, wind turbines could be installed to generate electricity. These turbines would use blades to capture the wind's kinetic energy and convert it into electrical energy, which could then be stored in batteries.",
    "Hydroelectric power: If there are rivers or other bodies of water nearby, hydroelectric power could be generated. Dams could be built to create a reservoir of water, which could then be released to turn turbines and generate electricity.",
    "Nuclear power: While nuclear power is not typically considered a renewable energy source, it could still be used as a backup in the event of a widespread battery failure. Nuclear reactors could be used to generate electricity without relying on batteries, although this would require careful planning and safety measures to ensure that the reactor does not malfunction and cause harm."
