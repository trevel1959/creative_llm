    "**Cognitive Decline**: The human brain relies on sleep for memory consolidation, learning, and cognitive function. Without sleep, the brain would struggle to process new information effectively, leading to potential cognitive decline over time. This could manifest in difficulties with problem-solving, decision-making, and maintaining focus.",
    "**Physical Health Issues**: Sleep is essential for physical health, including recovery from injuries, maintaining metabolism, and regulating hormones like insulin and cortisol. Without it, people might experience chronic fatigue, increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. ",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Sleep deprivation has been linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Without sleep, individuals might experience heightened emotional responses, increased irritability, and a greater susceptibility to mental health issues.",
    "**Social Disruption**: Sleep patterns are deeply embedded in social structures and daily routines. Without the need for sleep, social norms around work schedules, education, and leisure activities would likely collapse. This could lead to significant disruption in societal organization and productivity.",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptation Challenges**: Sleep has evolved over millions of years to protect us from predators, regulate bodily functions, and conserve energy. Without the need for sleep, humans would face evolutionary challenges. For instance, we might evolve into more nocturnal species or develop mechanisms to efficiently manage our energy resources without sleep cycles."
