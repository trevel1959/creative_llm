    "Invent a Water Purification Appliance: Create a smartphone appliance that can purify any water source, regardless of its quality. The device would use a combination of UV light, ozone, and activated carbon to remove pollutants and contaminants, producing clean and safe drinking water. The appliance could be powered by a small battery or even harness energy from the sun.",
    "Build a Community-Run Water Filtration System: Develop a community-based filtration system that relies on the collective efforts of the local population. The system could involve a network of filtration stations located throughout the community, each equipped with a different type of filtration technology. Members of the community could contribute to the system by donating their time and resources to maintain and upgrade the filtration stations.",
    "Utilize Algae-Based Water Purification: Algae are capable of purifying water through a process called phycoremediation. By cultivating algae in large quantities and using them to purify water, it could provide a sustainable and efficient means of producing clean drinking water. The algae could be grown in a controlled environment, such as a greenhouse, and then added to the water source to be purified.",
    "Create a Personal Water Bottle Purifier: Design a portable water bottle with an integrated filtration system that can remove pollutants and contaminants from any water source. The purification system could use a combination of carbon filtration, UV light, and ozone to produce clean and safe drinking water. The bottle could also have a built-in UV light to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, ensuring that the water is completely safe to drink.",
    "Develop a Water Harvesting System: In areas where water is scarce, a water harvesting system could be implemented to collect and store rainwater for drinking purposes. The system could involve the construction of large underground storage tanks or cisterns, which could be placed strategically around the community to collect and store rainwater. The water could then be pumped to a central location for distribution and purification, ensuring that everyone has access to clean drinking water."
