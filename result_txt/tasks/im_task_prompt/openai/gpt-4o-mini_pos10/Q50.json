    "**Modular Design**:    Introduce a modular smartphone that allows users to customize and upgrade individual components like the camera, battery, or processor. Users could easily swap out parts based on their needs, such as upgrading to a high-resolution camera for photography enthusiasts or enhancing battery life for travelers. This would not only extend the lifespan of the device but also reduce electronic waste by allowing users to replace only the parts that need upgrading.",
    "**Integrated Holographic Display**:    Instead of a traditional screen, envision a smartphone that projects a 3D holographic display. This would allow users to interact with their apps and content in a more immersive way. Users could manipulate 3D images with gestures, view videos from different angles, and even conduct video calls where participants appear as holograms. This technology could revolutionize how we consume media and communicate.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy**:    Develop a smartphone made entirely from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics and recycled metals. Additionally, integrate solar charging capabilities into the design, allowing the phone to recharge itself using sunlight. This eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of technology.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring**:    Equip smartphones with advanced health monitoring features that go beyond basic fitness tracking. By integrating sensors that can monitor blood glucose levels, hydration, and even stress hormones, the smartphone could serve as a personal health assistant. Users could receive real-time feedback on their health metrics, along with personalized tips for improvement, potentially preventing health issues before they arise.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**:    Enhance smartphones with built-in AR capabilities that transform everyday tasks. For example, users could point their camera at a recipe and see step-by-step cooking instructions overlaid in their kitchen. Shopping apps could allow users to visualize how furniture would look in their home before purchasing. This integration of AR would make smartphones indispensable tools for everyday life, enhancing both productivity and creativity."
