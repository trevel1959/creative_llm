    "In a world where magic was a part of everyday life, there was a witch who stood out from the rest. She was known for her incredible powers, but there was one thing that set her apart from the other witches: she didn't own a broomstick. They would often tease her, saying that her magic was so weak that she couldn't even fly without one. But the witch didn't let their jokes bother her. She had discovered that she could fly using her own two legs, and she was just as powerful without a broomstick as with one. She proved her strength to the world, and the witches learned to respect her for who she was, not for the tool she used.",
