    "**Fan-based Cooling**: Use fans to create airflow and circulate cooler air around the room. This would require positioning the fans to maximize air circulation and ensuring the airflow is evenly distributed.",
    "**Thermal Insulation**: Improve the insulation of the building to reduce heat transfer. This could involve adding insulation to walls, floors, and ceilings, as well as using energy-efficient window treatments.",
    "**Ceiling Fans**: Install ceiling fans to create airflow and help circulate air. This would require planning the fan placement to ensure even air circulation and using the fans to create a breeze to cool the room.",
    "**Thermal Mass**: Use materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete or brick walls, to absorb and release heat. This would require designing the interior space to maximize heat absorption and release, and using fans to circulate air around the thermal mass.",
    "**Shade and Sun Control**: Use window treatments, such as blinds or curtains, to block direct sunlight and reduce heat gain. This would require planning the window treatments to maximize shade and minimize heat gain, and using fans to circulate air around the room."
