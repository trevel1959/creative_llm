    "If we could predict the future, we could plan our lives better and make informed decisions. This could lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful existence.",
    "Predicting the future could lead to a decrease in stress and anxiety, as we would know what to expect and be better prepared for it.",
    "It could also lead to a decrease in spontaneity and a lack of adventure, as we would always know what was coming next.",
    "It could lead to a society where people are less motivated to work hard and take risks, as they would know the outcome of their actions before they even started.",
    "Predicting the future could also lead to a society where people are more complacent and less likely to take action to change their lives or the world around them, as they would know that things will always turn out the way they expect them to."
