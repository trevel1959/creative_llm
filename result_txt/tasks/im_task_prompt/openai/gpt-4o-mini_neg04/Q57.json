    "**Integrated Touchscreen Controls**: Incorporate a small touchscreen interface on the top of the mouse that allows users to perform gestures, shortcuts, or access applications without needing to switch to the keyboard. This feature could enable quick actions like zooming in and out, scrolling through documents, or launching frequently used programs, enhancing productivity and streamlining workflows.",
    "**Adaptive Sensitivity Technology**: Develop a mouse that uses sensors to detect the userâ€™s activity level and automatically adjust its sensitivity and speed. For example, when the user is working on detailed graphic design, the mouse could switch to a lower sensitivity for precision, and when browsing the web, it could increase sensitivity for faster navigation. This adaptive technology would improve the overall user experience by providing tailored performance.",
    "**Built-in Voice Assistant**: Equip the mouse with a voice recognition system that allows users to execute commands hands-free. Users could say commands like \"open browser,\" \"scroll down,\" or \"switch tabs,\" allowing for a more fluid and efficient workflow, especially during multitasking. This feature would be particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments.",
    "**Wireless Charging and Extended Battery Life**: Design a mouse that utilizes a wireless charging pad that also functions as a mousepad. This pad would keep the mouse charged while in use, eliminating the need for batteries or frequent recharging. Additionally, the mouse could incorporate energy-efficient technology to extend battery life, ensuring it lasts longer between charges.",
    "**Haptic Feedback for Enhanced Interaction**: Integrate haptic feedback technology into the mouse to provide tactile responses to user actions. For instance, when clicking on links or performing specific tasks, users would feel subtle vibrations or resistance, giving a more immersive experience. This feature could be particularly useful for gamers or professionals working in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction with digital content."
