    "**Multi-Functionality**: Develop a microwave that combines the features of a steamer, air fryer, and convection oven. This would allow users to not only heat food but also steam vegetables, crisp leftovers, and bake items all in one appliance. This would save space in the kitchen and provide versatile cooking options.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Introduce a self-cleaning function that uses steam to sanitize the interior. By filling a small water reservoir, the microwave could generate steam that loosens food particles and odors, making it easier for users to wipe down the interior after use. This would promote hygiene and reduce the need for harsh chemical cleaners.",
    "**Interactive Touchscreen Interface**: Replace traditional dials and buttons with a large, interactive touchscreen that provides step-by-step cooking instructions, recipe suggestions, and even video tutorials. This would enhance user engagement and make cooking more accessible for individuals who may not be familiar with certain techniques.",
    "**Built-in Food Sensor**: Implement advanced sensors that can detect the moisture content and temperature of the food inside the microwave. This would allow for automatic adjustments to cooking time and power levels, ensuring that food is heated evenly and preventing overcooking or undercooking.",
    "**Customizable Interior Layout**: Design a microwave with adjustable shelves or removable racks that can be reconfigured based on the size and shape of the food being cooked. This would allow for more efficient use of space and enable users to heat multiple dishes at once without compromising on cooking quality."
