    "Mental Object Manipulation: I would use this ability to help people in various situations. For instance, I could move objects out of the way to save someone from danger, such as a child trapped under a heavy object or a person stuck in a burning building. I could also use this ability to retrieve items that are out of reach, like a book on a high shelf or a remote control that has rolled under the couch.",
    "Mindful Meditation: With the ability to move objects with my mind, I would use this power to create a meditative environment. I could move objects around in a way that promotes relaxation and inner peace. For example, I could create a gentle breeze by moving a small fan with my mind, or I could create a soothing light show by manipulating a string of fairy lights. This would allow people to focus their minds and achieve a state of deep relaxation.",
    "Mind-Melding: I would use this ability to connect with other people on a deeper level. By moving objects with my mind, I could create a shared experience between myself and another person. For example, I could move a small object, like a pencil, back and forth between two people, creating a mental connection between them. This would allow us to communicate in a more intuitive way, without the need for words.",
    "Telekinesis Training: I would use this ability to teach people the power of their minds. By demonstrating the ability to move objects with my mind, I could show others that they too can harness their own mental abilities. I could create a series of exercises and challenges that help people develop their telekinetic powers, allowing them to move objects with their minds as well.",
    "Object Memory: I would use this ability to uncover hidden secrets and stories. By moving objects with my mind, I could gain insight into their past and the experiences they have been through. For example, I could move a small object, like a vase, and sense the emotions and memories associated with it. This would allow me to uncover hidden stories and secrets that are buried within the object, providing a unique perspective on history and culture."
