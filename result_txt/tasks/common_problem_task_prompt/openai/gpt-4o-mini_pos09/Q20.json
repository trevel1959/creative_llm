    "**Liability and Insurance Issues**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can be complicated. Is it the manufacturer, the software developer, or the car owner who is responsible? This ambiguity could lead to lengthy legal battles and complications in insurance claims. Current insurance models may not adequately cover self-driving vehicles, requiring new regulations and policies to address these unique challenges.",
    "**Cybersecurity Threats**: Self-driving cars are connected to the internet and other networks, making them vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. A malicious actor could potentially take control of the vehicle, manipulate its functions, or steal personal data. This concern necessitates robust cybersecurity measures and constant vigilance to protect both the vehicle and its occupants.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make ethical decisions, such as choosing between the lesser of two harms in an unavoidable accident scenario. For instance, if a collision is imminent, should the car prioritize the safety of its passengers over pedestrians? These ethical dilemmas raise questions about programming morals into AI systems and how to navigate such scenarios.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: Many people may be hesitant to trust self-driving technology due to fears of accidents or loss of control. Building public trust is crucial for widespread adoption, and any high-profile accidents involving self-driving cars could significantly hinder acceptance. Companies must engage in transparent communication and education efforts to alleviate concerns and showcase the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Impact on Employment**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in industries reliant on driving, such as trucking, taxi services, and delivery. This disruption could exacerbate economic inequalities and create social unrest as workers transition to new job markets. Solutions must be developed to retrain affected workers and provide support during this transition."
