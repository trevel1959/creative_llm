    "Renewable Energy Infrastructure Overhaul: If the world were to run out of oil, governments and corporations would need to invest heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. This would involve building new power plants, upgrading existing infrastructure, and developing new technologies to harness these sources of energy. This overhaul would not only provide a sustainable alternative to oil but also create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.",
    "Electric Vehicles and Public Transportation: With oil becoming scarce, there would be a shift towards electric vehicles and public transportation to reduce dependence on oil. This would involve investing in electric buses, trains, and cars, as well as improving public transportation systems to make them more efficient and convenient. This transition would not only reduce oil consumption but also improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Carbon Capture and Storage: As oil reserves dwindle, there would be a growing need to find ways to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes. This would involve developing new technologies and infrastructure to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. This could help to slow down global warming and mitigate its impacts.",
    "Advanced Nuclear Power: As oil becomes scarce, nuclear power could become a more viable option for generating electricity. Advanced nuclear power technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced fuel cycles could provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy, while reducing waste and environmental impacts.",
    "Space Exploration and Mining: In the long term, the world may need to look to space for oil alternatives. Space exploration and mining could provide a new source of energy resources, such as helium-3, a rare isotope that could be used as a fuel for nuclear fusion. While this may seem like a distant possibility, it could become a reality as technology advances and the cost of space exploration decreases."
