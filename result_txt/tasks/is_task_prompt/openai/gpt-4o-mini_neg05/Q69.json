    "Once in a vibrant village, there lived a boy named Felix who possessed a peculiar gift: he could taste words. Each syllable was a flavor, each sentence a feast. When his mother whispered sweet nothings, he savored honey and vanilla. But harsh words tasted like sour lemons, leaving a bitter aftertaste. ",
    "At school, Felix often shied away from confrontations, for the sharpness of insults felt like biting into raw onions. One day, he decided to share his gift, inviting friends to express their feelings. As they spoke, laughter and kindness filled the air, transforming words into a delightful banquet of flavors.",
