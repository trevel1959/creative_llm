    "Smart Lunchbox: Develop a smart lunchbox that can track what your child eats and drinks throughout the day. It could have a built-in scale, temperature sensor, and RFID tags to monitor food inventory and alert parents when their child's meals are close to expiring. This would help parents ensure their child is eating a balanced diet and avoid food waste.",
    "Personalized Lunchbox: Create a customizable lunchbox that allows children to express their personality through colorful designs and characters. The lunchbox could have interchangeable inserts and a detachable lid, making it easy for kids to customize their lunch every day. This would encourage creativity and self-expression in children.",
    "Healthy Lunchbox: Design a lunchbox with a built-in air purifier that can remove harmful toxins and bacteria from food. This would ensure that children's lunches are always fresh and safe to eat, even when they're on the go. The lunchbox could also have a built-in cooling system to keep food at the ideal temperature for several hours.",
    "Educational Lunchbox: Create a lunchbox with educational games and activities printed on the inside of the box.
