    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Navigation System**: Imagine ski poles with built-in GPS, compass, and altimeter. The poles would have a small display screen that shows your current location, direction, and elevation. This would be especially helpful for skiers who get lost or disoriented in the mountains.",
    "**Ski Poles with Traction Control**: Design ski poles with small, retractable spikes that can be deployed when skiing on icy or hardpack snow. This would provide extra grip and stability, reducing the risk of falls. The spikes could be made of a lightweight, durable material and be easily retracted when not in use.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Light System**: Create ski poles with built-in LED lights that can be adjusted to different colors and patterns. This would allow skiers to be seen more easily in low-light conditions, making it safer to ski at dawn or dusk. The lights could also be used to create a fun and festive atmosphere on the slopes.",
    "**Ski Poles with Temperature Control**: Develop ski poles with heated or cooled handles that can be adjusted to a comfortable temperature. This would be especially useful for skiers who ski in cold or warm conditions, as it would allow them to maintain a comfortable grip on the poles. The temperature control could be achieved through a small battery-powered heating or cooling system.",
    "**Ski Poles with Integrated Camera**: Design ski poles with a small, high-definition camera that can be used to capture photos and videos of the ski experience. The camera could be mounted on the pole and have a wide-angle lens, allowing skiers to capture stunning scenery and action shots. The camera could also be used to record ski runs and share them on social media. "
