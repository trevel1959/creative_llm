    "Solar-powered cars: Develop cars that are powered by solar panels installed on their roofs or sides. The car would convert sunlight into electricity to power its engine. This would require significant advances in battery technology to store the energy generated by the solar panels for use during night or cloudy days.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, emitting only water vapor as waste. Cars equipped with hydrogen fuel cells could be refueled at filling stations, eliminating the need for gasoline or diesel. However, this technology is still in its early stages and requires large-scale infrastructure development.",
    "Electric bikes and scooters: Electric bikes and scooters have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their low cost and environmental benefits. These vehicles can be charged using standard electrical outlets, making them a practical alternative to traditional gas-powered engines.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are produced from organic matter such as plants and algae. They can be used to power vehicles, providing a renewable source of energy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. However, biofuel production can also have negative impacts on land use and food security.",
    "Pedal-powered vehicles: Pedal-powered vehicles such as bicycles and tricycles offer a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. While they may not be suitable for long-distance travel, they could be an excellent option for short trips around town or for commuting to work. Additionally, pedal-powered vehicles could be integrated into public transportation systems, providing a more environmentally friendly option for urban commuters."
