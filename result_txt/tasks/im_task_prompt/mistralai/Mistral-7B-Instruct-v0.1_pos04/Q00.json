    "Pencil Case Organizer: Create a customizable pencil case organizer that allows users to easily organize their pencils and other writing tools. The organizer could have different compartments for different types of pencils (e.g. mechanical, wooden, colored), as well as a space for pens, erasers, and other accessories.",
    "Pencil Sharpener with Storage: Develop a pencil sharpener that not only sharpens pencils, but also includes a storage compartment for the sharpened shavings. This would eliminate the need for users to constantly search for a place to dispose of their pencil shavings, and could also help to reduce waste.",
    "Smart Pencil: Create a smart pencil that can track the amount of graphite used, as well as the length of the pencil. This would allow users to keep track of their writing supplies and ensure that they always have enough graphite to continue writing.",
    "Pencil Stylus: Develop a pencil stylus that can be used with digital devices such as tablets and smartphones. This would allow users to write and draw on their devices using a traditional pencil-like feel, without the need for a separate stylus.",
    "Pencil Charger: Create a pencil charger that can be used to charge pencils, as well as other electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. This would eliminate the need for users to carry multiple chargers, and could also help to reduce waste by allowing users to charge their pencils on the go."
