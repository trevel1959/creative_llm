    "**Eco-Friendly Reusable Pages**: Design a notebook with pages made from a special material that can be written on with erasable ink and wiped clean. This would allow users to write and rewrite without the need for paper waste. The cover could be made from sustainable materials, and the notebook could include a refillable ink cartridge to further reduce environmental impact.",
    "**Mood-Reflective Color Changing Pages**: Develop a notebook with pages that change color based on the user's mood, detected through a small sensor embedded in the cover. Users could select their mood on a companion app, and the pages would shift colors accordingly. This feature could encourage mindfulness and self-reflection, making the notebook not just a tool for writing but also a personal emotional journal.",
    "**Modular Notebook System**: Introduce a modular notebook design where users can add or remove sections based on their needs. Each section could be tailored for different purposes (e.g., sketching, journaling, project planning), and users could rearrange the order of sections. This would allow for a personalized notebook experience that adapts to changing priorities.",
    "**Integrated Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Create a notebook that pairs with an AR app, allowing users to scan their notes and see interactive elements related to their content. For example, a drawing could come to life in 3D, or notes on a specific topic could link to relevant online resources. This would enhance learning and engagement, making the notebook a bridge between physical and digital worlds.",
    "**Built-in Projector for Presentations**: Design a notebook with a small, built-in projector that can display the contents of the pages onto a wall or screen. This feature would be perfect for students or professionals who need to present their ideas quickly. The projector could connect to a smartphone or tablet for seamless integration with digital presentations."
