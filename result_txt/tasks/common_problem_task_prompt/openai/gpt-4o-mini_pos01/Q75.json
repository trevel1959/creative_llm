    "**Visitor Safety and Environmental Impact**: With increasing tourism, the risk of accidents and environmental degradation rises. Issues such as littering, wildlife encounters, and trail erosion can threaten both visitor safety and the park's natural beauty. Implementing strict guidelines for visitors, providing educational programs about responsible behavior, and establishing designated paths can mitigate these issues.",
    "**Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt the ecological balance within the park. These species may outcompete native flora and fauna, leading to declines in local populations. Park management could develop a monitoring system to identify invasive species early and implement eradication strategies, but this requires ongoing resources and community support.",
    "**Climate Change Effects**: National parks are not immune to the impacts of climate change, which can lead to altered weather patterns, increased wildfires, and shifts in wildlife habitats. Park management must adapt by developing climate resilience strategies, such as creating firebreaks, managing water resources, and restoring habitats, while also engaging in advocacy for broader climate action.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Many national parks face budget constraints, making it difficult to maintain facilities, staff, and conservation programs. This can lead to deteriorating infrastructure, inadequate staffing for visitor services, and compromised conservation efforts. To address this, park management could explore alternative funding sources, such as grants, partnerships with private organizations, and community fundraising initiatives.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Preservation**: Many national parks contain significant cultural and historical sites that require protection. However, balancing visitor access with preservation can be challenging. To address this, park managers could develop interpretive programs that educate visitors about the cultural significance of these sites while implementing restrictions on access to sensitive areas."
