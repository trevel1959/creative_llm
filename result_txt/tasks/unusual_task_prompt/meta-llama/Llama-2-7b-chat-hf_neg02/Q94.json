    "Blender-powered virtual wardrobe: Create a virtual wardrobe where users can upload their clothes and accessories, and use Blender to create a 3D virtual version of themselves. Users can then try on different outfits virtually, see how they look in different settings, and even create custom outfits from scratch.",
    "Blender-based interior design: Develop a Blender plugin that allows users to create 3D models of their home interiors. Users can import their home blueprints or take photos of their rooms, and then use Blender to create a 3D model of their space. They can then use the model to visualize furniture arrangements, color schemes, and other design elements.",
    "Blender-powered film and video production: Create a Blender-based platform for film and video production that allows users to create 3D animations, composites, and visual effects. The platform could include a library of pre-made assets, as well as tools for creating custom textures, lighting, and animations.",
    "Blender-based architecture visualization: Develop a Blender plugin that allows architects and designers to create 3D models of their buildings and structures. The plugin could include tools for creating custom textures, lighting, and materials, as well as a library of pre-made assets. Users could then use the 3D models to visualize their designs in different settings and present them to clients.",
    "Blender-powered virtual events: Create a Blender-based platform for hosting virtual events such as conferences, workshops, and trade shows. Users could create 3D models of the event space, import presentations and videos, and use Blender to create interactive 3D environments. Attendees could then navigate the virtual space, attend presentations, and interact with other attendees in real-time."
