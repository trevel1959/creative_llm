    "Ergonomic scissors: Design an updated version of traditional scissors to enhance ergonomics and user comfort. Incorporate features like non-slip handles, easy-open mechanisms, and adjustable blade angles to provide a better cutting experience.",
    "Magnetic storage scissors: Introduce magnetic storage compartments within the handles of the scissors, allowing users to quickly store small screws, nails, or other small parts during the cutting process without losing or misplacing them.",
    "Heat-resistant scissors: Add a heat resistance component to the scissors' blades that can withstand high temperatures. This would allow users to cut through materials like paper, fabric, or wood that have been previously exposed to hot temperatures, saving time and effort.",
    "Magnetic blade guards scissors: Develop a version of scissors that is fitted with magnetic blade guards that automatically close when not in use. This would help prevent injuries to children or accidental cuts when handling the scissors casually.",
    "Self-cleaning scissors: Incorporate a mechanism into the scissors that can clean the blades after each use. A small liquid reservoir could lubricate the blades, while the moving parts would wipe away any debris, ensuring a clean and sharp cutting edge."
