    "**Vertical Climbing Walls**: Skyscrapers could incorporate vertical climbing walls on the exterior. These walls would be equipped with safe handholds and harness systems, allowing people to scale the building like rock climbers. The walls could be designed with varying levels of difficulty, catering to both beginners and experienced climbers. Additionally, the walls could be illuminated at night, creating a stunning visual display.",
    "**Zip Line Network**: A zip line system could be installed from the top of the skyscraper to various points on the ground and neighboring buildings. After taking a staircase or a climbing wall to the roof, individuals could strap into a harness and zip line down to their destination. This would not only provide a thrilling descent but also a quick way to navigate the urban landscape.",
    "**Staircase Races**: Organize staircase races where individuals or teams compete to see who can reach the top of the skyscraper the fastest using the stairs. These events could become popular community gatherings, promoting fitness and camaraderie. Participants could receive training tips and gear, and the races could be streamed online, turning them into a spectator sport.",
    "**Portable Climbing Gear**: Develop a line of lightweight, portable climbing gear specifically designed for urban environments. This gear would include a compact harness, retractable climbing ropes, and specialized shoes for grip. Users could attach themselves to designated climbing routes on the building's exterior, making it possible to scale the skyscraper safely and efficiently.",
    "**Drone-Assisted Ascension**: Imagine a personal drone service that could assist individuals in reaching the top of a skyscraper. Users would strap into a harness that the drone could lift, safely transporting them to the roof. This could be particularly useful for those who need to transport equipment or supplies to upper floors. The drones would be equipped with safety features to ensure a smooth and secure flight."
