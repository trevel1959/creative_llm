    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that can connect to a smartphone app, providing real-time feedback on brushing technique, brushing time, and even tracking oral health. This toothbrush could also have built-in sensors to detect when the user is brushing too hard or not brushing for long enough, providing personalized recommendations for improvement.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Toothpaste: Create a toothbrush with a built-in toothpaste dispenser, eliminating the need for a separate toothpaste tube. This would not only save space and convenience but also reduce waste. The toothpaste could be made from a unique formula that is more effective at removing plaque and promoting good oral hygiene.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush with a glow-in-the-dark handle, making it easier for children to find and use in the dark. This toothbrush could also have a fun and colorful design, making it more appealing to kids.",
    "Personalized Toothbrush: Create a toothbrush with interchangeable heads that can be customized to fit the individual's mouth. This would ensure a more comfortable and effective brushing experience, as well as provide a more sustainable option as the heads can be replaced rather than thrown away.",
    "Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser: Develop a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in water flosser, providing a more thorough cleaning of the teeth and gums. This would eliminate the need for a separate water flosser, making it more convenient and space-saving. The toothbrush could also have different settings for different areas of the mouth, such as gentle for sensitive teeth and gums or more intense for harder-to-reach areas."
