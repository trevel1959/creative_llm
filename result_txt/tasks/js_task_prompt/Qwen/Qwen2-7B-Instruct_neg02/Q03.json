    "**Increased Productivity and Work Hours:** With no need for sleep, individuals could dedicate more time to work, learning, and leisure activities. This might lead to an increase in productivity across various industries, including tech, education, healthcare, and entertainment. People could potentially work 24/7, leading to shorter lunch breaks, longer working hours, and more flexible schedules.",
    "**Extended Lifespan:** The absence of sleep could potentially lead to longer lifespans, as people would have more time available for living and less time spent sleeping. This could result in significant changes in life expectancy statistics, retirement age policies, and healthcare planning.",
    "**Altered Social Interactions:** The concept of \"social hour\" might become obsolete, as people could be awake and active at all times. Nightlife might transform into a 24-hour affair, and social gatherings could occur during traditionally unoccupied periods, like early morning or late afternoon. Sleepless societies might also lead to new forms of social organization, such as online communities that operate around the clock.",
    "**Economic Shifts:** Industries related to sleep, such as bedding manufacturers, mattress retailers, and sleep clinics, would likely experience significant declines. On the other hand, industries focused on alertness enhancement, like caffeine and energy drinks, might see a surge in demand. There could also be an increased focus on productivity tools and technologies, like ergonomic furniture, noise-canceling headphones, and smart lighting systems designed to promote alertness.",
    "**Impact on Mental Health and Well-being:** While the elimination of sleep might initially seem like a benefit, it could have unintended consequences on mental health and well-being. Without the restorative effects of sleep, individuals might struggle with cognitive function, mood regulation, and overall health. This could lead to an increased need for mental health support services and the development of new strategies to maintain well-being in a sleepless society."
