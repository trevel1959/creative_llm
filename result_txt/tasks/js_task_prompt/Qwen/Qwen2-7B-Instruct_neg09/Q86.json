    "**The Celestial Sphere**: Imagine a massive, transparent dome structure, perhaps in the heart of an international city like Tokyo or New York. This landmark would be designed to mimic the night sky, complete with stars, constellations, and planets. The interior would be climate-controlled, allowing for year-round viewing without weather restrictions. The dome would rotate slowly, creating a sense of movement and immersion, as if one is truly in outer space.",
    "**The Time Capsule Tower**: This landmark would be a towering, cylindrical structure that serves as a physical embodiment of the passage of time. It would feature a large clock face at the base, counting down from the current year until it reaches zero. Inside, each floor would represent a decade, with exhibits and artifacts from that period, providing a unique timeline experience. Visitors could climb to the top, where they would find a capsule-like room filled with current-year technology, art, and personal belongings, symbolizing the present moment encapsulated in time.",
    "**The Infinite Library**: A floating, transparent library in the form of a giant book. The exterior would be a series of interconnected pages, while the interior would house a vast collection of books, scrolls, and digital archives covering all genres and subjects. This landmark would be self-sustaining, using advanced technologies for energy production and waste management. Visitors could explore the depths of human knowledge through guided tours, virtual reality experiences, or by physically browsing through the physical collections.",
    "**The Eco-Plex**: A self-sufficient, eco-friendly urban oasis, integrating cutting-edge green technologies and sustainable practices. It would include a mix of residential units, commercial spaces, and recreational areas, all powered by renewable energy sources and designed to minimize environmental impact. The design would emphasize natural elements like green roofs, vertical gardens, and water recycling systems. The Eco-Plex would serve as a model for sustainable living and inspire future developments around the world.",
    "**The Memory Museum**: This interactive museum would allow visitors to explore their personal memories, as well as those of society, in a futuristic, immersive environment. Using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, individuals could enter a \"memory chamber\" where their thoughts and emotions are translated into a visual and auditory experience. The museum would also feature exhibits showcasing collective memories from various cultures and historical events, offering insights into the human experience and fostering empathy and understanding among diverse populations."
