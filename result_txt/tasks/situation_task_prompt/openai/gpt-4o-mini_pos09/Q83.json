    "**Sleep Masks with Circadian Rhythm Technology**: These high-tech sleep masks would utilize sensors to monitor the wearer's body temperature, heart rate, and even brainwaves. When it detects that the wearer is ready to sleep, the mask would emit a gentle, warm light that mimics the fading sunlight, signaling the body that it’s time to wind down. It would also release calming scents like lavender or chamomile to promote relaxation, creating an ideal environment for sleep, no matter the hour.",
    "**Community Sleep Gardens**: In a world without night, community sleep gardens could emerge as tranquil outdoor spaces designed for napping and resting. These gardens would feature soft, shaded hammocks, gentle water features, and soundscapes of nature. Residents could visit these gardens during designated \"sleep hours,\" where the atmosphere is optimized for relaxation. The gardens would be equipped with canopies that simulate nightfall, allowing people to unwind in a serene setting.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Soundscapes**: An app that curates individualized soundscapes based on the user’s preferences and sleep patterns could become essential. Users would input their favorite sounds—like rustling leaves, gentle rain, or white noise—and the app would create a unique audio experience that promotes relaxation. The app could also integrate with smart home devices to dim lights and adjust temperature, creating a holistic sleep environment tailored to each person.",
    "**Floating Sleep Chambers**: Inspired by the concept of sensory deprivation, floating sleep chambers would allow individuals to float in a warm, buoyant solution while listening to calming music or guided meditations. These chambers would block out all external light and sound, creating a personal cocoon where one can drift into sleep. The experience would be designed to mimic the feeling of night-time, providing an oasis of tranquility in a 24-hour world.",
    "**Sleep-Enhancing Wearables**: Wearable technology, like smart bracelets or rings, could monitor biometric data and provide real-time feedback on sleep quality. These devices would vibrate gently when it’s optimal for the wearer to rest, even during the day. They could also release soothing vibrations or sounds to help the wearer relax and fall asleep quickly, ensuring that even in a perpetual daytime environment, restorative sleep is achievable."
