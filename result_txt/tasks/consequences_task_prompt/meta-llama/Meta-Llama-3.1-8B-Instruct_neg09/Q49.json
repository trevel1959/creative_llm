    "**Global Reset**: In a world where everyone's memory is erased, society would collapse. People would struggle to recall even the most basic skills, like how to speak, read, or perform simple tasks. Governments would be powerless to maintain order, and the rule of law would crumble. Chaos would ensue as people try to rediscover their identities and rebuild their lives. As the world descends into anarchy, a new system of governance would emerge, with individuals forming tribes and communities based on shared experiences and skills.",
    "**The Rise of Instinctual Behavior**: Without memories, humans would revert to their primal instincts. People would act on emotions and desires, leading to a surge in violence, aggression, and exploitation. In this world, the strong would prey on the weak, and the concept of empathy and compassion would be lost. However, as people adapt to their new reality, they might develop new forms of communication and social structures that prioritize instinctual needs over rational thought.",
    "**The Dawn of a New Language**: In a world without memories, language would need to be relearned from scratch. People would start communicating through simple, instinctual gestures and sounds, gradually developing a new language that is more primal and expressive. This new language would be a blend of vocalizations, body language, and environmental cues, allowing people to convey emotions and needs without relying on complex memories. As the language evolves, it would become a unique aspect of human culture, reflecting the primal nature of the species.",
    "**The Emergence of a New Form of Art**: With memories gone, people would be forced to express themselves through new forms of art that don't rely on nostalgia or personal experiences. Art would become a primal, instinctual expression of emotions, using raw materials like colors, textures, and sounds to convey feelings and ideas. This new art form would be a reflection of the human condition, unencumbered by the burdens of memory and history. As people create and respond to this art, they would develop a new appreciation for the beauty of the present moment.",
    "**The Rebirth of a Tribal Society**: In a world without memories, people would be forced to rely on their senses and instincts to survive. They would form tribes based on shared experiences, skills, and environmental adaptations, creating a new social hierarchy that prioritizes practical knowledge over cultural heritage. As these tribes grow and evolve, they would develop unique customs, traditions, and mythologies that are rooted in their primal experiences. This"
