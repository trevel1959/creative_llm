    "**Astronauts on Earth**: With half the Earth's gravity, astronauts could train for space missions more easily on Earth. The reduced gravity would make it easier to simulate zero-gravity environments, reducing risks and costs associated with space travel. This could lead to advancements in astronaut training methods and technologies.",
    "**Plant Growth and Agriculture**: Plants would grow faster due to less gravitational pull, potentially leading to increased agricultural productivity. However, this also means they might become too large or unwieldy, requiring new farming techniques and infrastructure. This could revolutionize agriculture, allowing for vertical farming and larger crop yields in smaller spaces.",
    "**Weather Patterns**: Reduced gravity could affect atmospheric circulation patterns. It might lead to changes in wind speeds and directions, potentially altering weather systems and climate models. This could have significant impacts on global weather patterns, affecting everything from precipitation rates to hurricane formation.",
    "**Earth's Rotation**: The Earth’s rotation could slow down due to a decrease in gravity. This could result in longer days and years, affecting ecosystems and human activities that are tied to daily and seasonal cycles. It would require adjustments in timekeeping and scheduling across the globe.",
    "**Geological Processes**: With less gravity, the Earth’s tectonic plates might move differently. This could lead to changes in geological formations, such as the creation of new mountain ranges or the alteration of fault lines. These changes could influence natural disasters like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, potentially impacting areas prone to these events."
