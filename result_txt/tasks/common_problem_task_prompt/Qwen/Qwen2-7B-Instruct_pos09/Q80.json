    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Invitations**: Instead of traditional paper invitations, opt for digital or recycled paper invitations. You can also include eco-friendly options like bamboo, recycled cotton, or wheat-based paper. Encourage guests to RSVP online to reduce paper waste. Additionally, you could create custom seed paper invitations that guests can plant after the event, promoting greenery and sustainability.",
    "**Sustainable Food Options**: Focus on a local and seasonal menu, reducing carbon footprint and supporting local farmers. Avoid meat-heavy dishes and offer vegetarian or vegan options to appeal to a wide range of dietary preferences. Serve food on compostable plates, utensils, and napkins made from materials like bamboo or sugarcane. Encourage a \"take-home\" system for leftovers and provide recycling bins for any non-compostable waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Decorations**: Use natural elements such as flowers, branches, and plants in decorations. Consider renting items instead of buying new ones, which can be reused by other events. Opt for reusable items like fabric tablecloths, glassware, and candles over disposable alternatives. For lighting, use solar-powered lights or LED candles that are energy-efficient.",
    "**Sustainable Transportation**: Encourage guests to carpool, use public transportation, or bike to the venue. Provide bike racks and encourage guests to ride bicycles. For those arriving by car, consider setting up a shuttle service to transport guests between the ceremony and reception sites. Offer incentives for environmentally conscious transportation choices, such as discounts at local businesses or entry into a raffle for sustainable prizes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Gifts**: Instead of traditional wedding gifts, request that guests donate to a charity that aligns with the couple's values. This could be a local environmental organization, a conservation project, or a global initiative focusing on sustainability. Alternatively, provide guests with eco-friendly gifts such as reusable water bottles, organic toiletries, or plants, which they can enjoy long after the wedding day. "
