    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of towers that can extract water from the air, even in arid regions. These towers would use condensation technology to collect and purify water vapor, providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water.",
    "**Solar Still Innovation**: Design a more efficient solar still that can be easily deployed in remote areas. This still would use a combination of solar radiation, evaporation, and condensation to purify water from contaminated sources. The still could be made from locally sourced materials, making it an accessible solution for communities in need.",
    "**Desalination using Bio-inspired Membranes**: Create a new type of membrane that mimics the properties of biological systems, allowing for efficient desalination of seawater. This membrane would be made from a biodegradable material and could be powered by renewable energy sources, making it an environmentally friendly solution for coastal communities.",
    "**Water Recycling using Microbial Fuel Cells**: Develop a system that uses microbial fuel cells to treat wastewater and produce clean drinking water. These cells would utilize microorganisms to break down organic matter, generating electricity while purifying the water. This approach could be used in urban areas to recycle wastewater and reduce the burden on municipal water treatment plants.",
    "**Fog Collection using Vertical Axis Wind Turbines**: Design a hybrid system that combines fog collection with wind energy generation. Vertical axis wind turbines would be integrated with a fog collection system, using the wind to drive the collection of water droplets from fog. This system would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water for coastal communities and could also generate electricity to power local infrastructure."
