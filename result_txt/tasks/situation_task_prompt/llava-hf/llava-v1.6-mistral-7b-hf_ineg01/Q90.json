    "Water Harvesting: Water harvesting involves collecting and storing water from various sources such as rainwater, snow, and dew. This can be done using techniques like rooftop harvesting, where water is collected from rooftops and stored in tanks, or groundwater recharge, where water is recharged into the groundwater aquifer.",
    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to produce fresh drinking water. This can be done using reverse osmosis, where seawater is forced through a semi-permeable membrane that filters out the salt and other impurities.",
    "Water Recycling: Water recycling involves reusing water that has been used and is now considered wastewater. This can be done through various methods such as wastewater treatment, where the water is treated to remove impurities and contaminants, or greywater recycling, where used water from showers, sinks, and washing machines is reused for flushing toilets or irrigating gardens.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a system that combines fish farming with hydroponics, where the fish waste provides nutrients for plant growth. The water from the fish tank is used to irrigate the plants, and the plants filter the water, making it clean and usable for the fish.",
    "Cloud Harvesting: Cloud harvesting involves using technologies like cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to increase the likelihood of clouds forming and releasing water. This can be done by spraying chemicals into the air that act as CCN, which can increase the number of water droplets in the clouds and cause them to release more water."
