    "**Ergonomic Handles**: Enhance the grip of the ski poles with ergonomic handles designed to reduce hand fatigue and provide better control during skiing. The handles could be made of a soft, comfortable material and have a textured surface for a better grip.",
    "**Adjustable Lengths**: Include a telescoping feature in the ski poles that allows for adjustable lengths to accommodate different body sizes and skiing styles. This would improve the fit and usability of the poles for a wider range of users.",
    "**Integrated Safety Features**: Integrate a small LED light on the bottom of the poles to improve visibility in low-light conditions or during night skiing. The poles could also have reflective materials to increase visibility on the slopes.",
    "**Weather Protection**: Develop a weather-resistant coating on the poles to protect against moisture, snow, and cold temperatures. This would enhance the durability and performance of the poles in various weather conditions.",
    "**Energy Harvesting**: Incorporate a small solar panel or kinetic energy harvesting technology into the ski poles to provide a sustainable power source for any integrated electronics or lighting features."
