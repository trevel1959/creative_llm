    "**Democracy by Algorithm**: This form of government would utilize AI algorithms to make decisions based on public opinion data gathered from social media, surveys, and other digital sources. The system would analyze sentiments, trends, and data patterns to predict outcomes and create policies that reflect the collective will of the people.",
    "**Eco-Consensus Government**: In this system, the primary goal is to ensure environmental sustainability. It would be structured around ecological principles, with representatives from various sectors like renewable energy, agriculture, and conservation. The government would operate on a consensus-based decision-making process, where all policies must align with long-term ecological goals and be supported by a majority in the assembly.",
    "**Time-Based Democracy**: This government structure divides its citizens into groups based on their age. Each group would have voting rights for a specific period, with younger individuals having shorter voting periods and older individuals having longer ones. This ensures that every generation has a say in decisions affecting them, while also allowing for continuity and wisdom in governance.",
    "**Virtual Reality Governance**: Citizens would participate in the government through virtual reality simulations, allowing them to experience the consequences of different policy decisions in real-time. This immersive approach aims to educate citizens about the impact of their choices and encourage responsible decision-making. Policies would be voted on within these simulations, and the outcomes would affect the virtual world and eventually spill over into the real world.",
    "**Universal Basic Income Democracy**: With the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI), citizens would receive a guaranteed minimum income regardless of employment status. This form of government would focus on ensuring economic stability and equality among its citizens. Decision-making would center around how best to allocate resources, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to maximize the well-being of the population as a whole."
