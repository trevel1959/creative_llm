    "Solar Powered Stained Glass Lamps: Create stained glass lamps that harness the power of the sun to light up a room at night. The stained glass panels would be designed to capture and reflect light from the sun during the day, storing it in a battery or capacitor. At night, the stored light could be released through the stained glass, providing a warm and ambient glow.",
    "Glowing Mushroom Lamps: Develop a species of mushroom that emits a soft, warm light when exposed to oxygen. These glowing mushrooms could be cultivated in a controlled environment and used as a sustainable and eco-friendly light source. The mushrooms could be arranged in a decorative pattern or used to create a canopy of light above a table or bed.",
    "Magnetic Lighting: Develop a lighting system that utilizes magnetic fields to create a soft, diffuse light. Magnets could be embedded in the walls or ceiling of a room, and a magnetic light source (such as a coil of wire or a magnetized crystal) could be placed near the area where light is needed. As the magnetic field changes, the light source would emit a soft glow, providing a unique and dynamic lighting effect.",
    "Bioluminescent Plant Lamps: Genetically engineer plants to produce a soft, blue-green light when exposed to oxygen. These bioluminescent plants could be arranged in a decorative planter or used to create a canopy of light above a table or bed. The plants would provide a natural and sustainable light source, and their gentle glow could be used to create a calming and relaxing atmosphere.",
    "Liquid Lighting: Develop a lighting system that utilizes liquid as the primary medium for lighting. The liquid could be contained in a clear, flexible tube or container, and could be manipulated using a series of valves and pumps to create a variety of lighting effects. The liquid could be colored or flavored to create a unique and dynamic lighting experience, and could be used to create a variety of different lighting moods and atmospheres."
