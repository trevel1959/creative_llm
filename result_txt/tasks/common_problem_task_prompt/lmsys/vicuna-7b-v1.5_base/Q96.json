    "Health and Safety: Another potential issue could be the safety of the food. Vegan food can be prone to contamination if proper hygiene and food safety protocols are not followed. The company may need to invest in extensive training programs for their staff to ensure they understand and follow proper food safety procedures.",
    "Competition: The vegan fast food market is relatively new and untested, so there may be limited competition. However, as the market grows, larger fast food chains may enter the market, posing a threat to the success of the new vegan chain.",
    "Menu Diversity: While there are many plant-based options available, it may be challenging to create a diverse menu that appeals to a wide range of customers. The company may need to invest in research and development to create unique and appealing dishes that will set them apart from competitors.",
    "Price: Fast food is often associated with low prices, but vegan options can be more expensive due to the cost of plant-based ingredients. The company may need to find a way to balance affordability with the quality of their ingredients to remain competitive.",
    "Marketing: Introducing a new fast food chain can be challenging, and the company may need to invest in marketing to build brand awareness and attract customers. However, marketing vegan food may be more challenging than marketing traditional fast food due to the cultural and societal stigmas associated with veganism."
