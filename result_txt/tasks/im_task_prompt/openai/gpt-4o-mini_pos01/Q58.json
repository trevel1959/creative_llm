    "**Eco-Friendly Drying Mode**: Develop a hair dryer that features an eco-friendly mode which uses lower power consumption while still providing effective drying. This mode could utilize a combination of infrared heating and ion technology to reduce energy usage by up to 50%. The dryer could also include a built-in timer that encourages users to dry their hair more efficiently, reducing unnecessary energy consumption.",
    "**Multi-Function Attachments**: Create a set of interchangeable attachments that serve multiple purposes. For example, a diffuser that can also be used as a volumizer or a brush attachment that can detangle hair while drying. This would eliminate the need for multiple tools and streamline the hair styling process, making it more convenient for users.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Design a hair dryer with advanced sound-dampening technology to minimize noise levels during operation. This could involve using specialized materials and acoustic engineering to create a quieter drying experience, making it more pleasant for users, especially in shared living spaces or during early mornings.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses heat and airflow to remove dust and hair buildup from the dryerâ€™s filter and vents. Users could activate this feature with the push of a button, ensuring optimal performance and extending the lifespan of the device without the hassle of manual cleaning.",
    "**Personalized Styling Profiles**: Allow users to create and save personalized styling profiles based on their hair type and desired results. The dryer could have a digital display where users can select their profile, and it would automatically adjust heat settings, airflow, and drying time accordingly. This feature would cater to different hair textures and styles, ensuring the best results every time."
