    "\"Energy 3.0\" - A new type of energy that is clean, sustainable, and virtually limitless. It is generated from the natural phenomenon of bioluminescence, which is the production of light by living organisms. This energy source is harnessed by placing bioluminescent organisms in a controlled environment, where they are stimulated to produce more light. The energy is then captured and converted into usable electricity. This energy source is eco-friendly, renewable, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our homes, cities, and industries. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "\"Energy X\" - A new type of energy that is generated through the manipulation of quantum particles. This energy source is harnessed by using specialized equipment to manipulate the behavior of quantum particles, which in turn generates electricity. This energy source is virtually limitless, clean, and sustainable. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our world and could be a game-changer in the field of energy production. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "\"Energy Z\" - A new type of energy that is generated through the use of kinetic energy. This energy source is harnessed by capturing the movement of objects, such as wind, water, and even human motion. The energy is then converted into usable electricity. This energy source is clean, sustainable, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our homes, cities, and industries. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "\"Energy Y\" - A new type of energy that is generated through the use of geothermal energy. This energy source is harnessed by tapping into the natural heat of the Earth's core. The energy is then converted into usable electricity. This energy source is clean, sustainable, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our homes, cities, and industries. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "\"Energy A\" - A new type of energy that is generated through the use of artificial intelligence. This energy source is harnessed by using advanced algorithms and machine learning to optimize energy production and consumption. The energy is then converted into usable electricity. This energy source is clean, sustainable, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we power our world. Confidence score: 0.5"
