    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Create a whisk with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different grip styles. This whisk would have a flexible handle that can change shape or size based on the user's preference, providing comfort for extended whisking sessions. It could also include a non-slip grip material that molds to the user's hand for added control.",
    "**Multi-Function Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: Develop a whisk that features interchangeable heads for various mixing tasks. Users could easily switch between a balloon whisk for aerating, a flat whisk for scraping, and a spiral whisk for thick mixtures. Each head would snap on and off easily, making it a versatile tool for all types of cooking and baking.",
    "**Whisk with Built-in Temperature Sensor**: Introduce a whisk that has a built-in temperature sensor to monitor the temperature of mixtures in real-time. This would be particularly useful for recipes that require specific temperature thresholds, such as making sauces or tempering chocolate. The whisk could provide visual or audible alerts when the mixture reaches the desired temperature, ensuring optimal results.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Whisk**: Design a whisk with a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to dislodge food particles from the wires. This whisk would have a small, rechargeable battery that powers the ultrasonic cleaning mechanism, allowing users to simply place it in a designated cleaning station. After a quick cycle, the whisk would be clean and ready for the next use, reducing the hassle of hand washing.",
    "**Whisk with Color-Coded Measurement Markings**: Create a whisk that has color-coded measurement markings along the handle. This would allow users to quickly gauge the volume of ingredients being mixed, especially when preparing batters or sauces. The colors could represent different measurements (e.g., tablespoons, cups) and be made from food-safe materials that are easy to clean."
