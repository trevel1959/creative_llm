    "**Cloud-Harvesting Solar Panels**: Develop a new type of solar panel that can harness energy from the diffuse light of cloudy skies. These panels would be designed to capture the scattered light and convert it into electricity, allowing people to generate power even on cloudy days.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Vapour Condensation**: Create a system that can condense water vapour from the air, even on cloudy days, to produce clean drinking water. This could be achieved through a network of condensers and filters that utilise the natural humidity in the air.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting**: Introduce genetically engineered bioluminescent plants or microorganisms that can absorb and convert the available light into a glowing effect. This could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional lighting sources.",
    "**Advanced LED Technology**: Develop ultra-efficient LED lights that can amplify and focus the limited sunlight available on cloudy days. These LEDs would be designed to work in conjunction with a network of mirrors or lenses to concentrate the light and increase its intensity.",
    "**Sky-Based Solar Concentrators**: Design a network of lightweight, aerodynamic solar concentrators that can be deployed in the upper atmosphere to focus and concentrate sunlight. These concentrators would be made of a lightweight, durable material and would be designed to work in conjunction with a system of mirrors or lenses to amplify the sunlight. [/INST] "
