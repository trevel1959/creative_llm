    "Artificial Light Clouds: Engineers could design and build large, cloud-like structures that use artificial light sources to mimic the effects of sunlight. These structures could be placed at high altitudes and use advanced materials and lighting technologies to create an artificial sun. The clouds would then disperse the light, creating a uniform and natural-looking sunlight on the ground.",
    "Cloud-Seeding Drones: A fleet of advanced drones could be used to seed the clouds with chemicals that promote the formation of cirrus clouds. These clouds would then reflect sunlight and create a brighter and more evenly distributed light source. The drones could be controlled remotely and could be programmed to adjust their altitude and position based on the location of the sky.",
    "Space-Based Solar Power Collectors: Similar to solar power satellites, space-based solar power collectors could be deployed to collect sunlight and beam it back to Earth. However, instead of using lasers or microwaves, these collectors could use a network of antennas to transmit the energy wirelessly. This would allow for a more efficient and cost-effective method of delivering sunlight to the planet's surface.",
    "Cloud-Modifying Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology could be used to create particles that can alter the properties of clouds. These particles could be designed to absorb sunlight and then release it in a controlled manner, creating a more even and consistent light source. The particles could be dispersed into the atmosphere using specialized aircraft or drones.",
    "Artificial Suns: A series of artificial suns could be built and deployed in space. These suns would use advanced nuclear reactors to generate a massive amount of energy, which would then be transmitted to Earth using advanced lasers or microwave beams. This would provide a constant and reliable source of sunlight, even when the sky is cloudy."
