    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Incorporate a self-cleaning mechanism using UV-C light or ozone technology to eliminate bacteria and odors from the laundry basket itself. This feature would ensure that the basket remains hygienic and odor-free, promoting a healthier laundry environment and prolonging the life of the basket.",
    "**Built-in Scale**: Design the laundry basket with a built-in scale that can weigh the contents as they are added. This feature would help users keep track of the laundry load and provide recommendations for the appropriate washing machine settings, thus optimizing water and energy usage.",
    "**Compartmentalized Design**: Create a laundry basket with multiple compartments that can be customized based on user needs. Each compartment could be designated for different family members, types of clothing (e.g., delicates, workout gear), or laundry stages (e.g., dirty, washed, folded). This organization would streamline the laundry process and reduce the time spent sorting.",
    "**Foldable and Portable**: Develop a collapsible laundry basket that can be easily folded for storage or transport. This would be especially useful for those living in small spaces or for college students who need to carry laundry to communal facilities. The basket could also feature handles for easy carrying and a lightweight design for added convenience.",
    "**Interactive App Integration**: Create an app that connects to the laundry basket via Bluetooth. The app could track laundry loads, send reminders for when to wash, and even provide tips on stain removal or fabric care. Users could also input their laundry preferences, and the app could suggest optimal washing times and settings based on the current weather conditions (e.g., suggesting air drying on sunny days)."
