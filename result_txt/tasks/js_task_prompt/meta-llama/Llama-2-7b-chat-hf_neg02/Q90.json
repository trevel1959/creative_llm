    "Enhanced Sensory Perception: Redesign the human body to have multiple sensory organs, such as retractable eyeballs that can rotate 360 degrees, allowing for panoramic vision and increased peripheral awareness. Add more sensitive sensory receptors to the skin, enabling the body to detect subtle changes in temperature, pressure, and vibrations. This would greatly enhance the human's ability to perceive their environment and respond to potential threats or opportunities.",
    "Bioluminescent Adaptation: Engineer the human body to produce bioluminescent organs that can emit light in various colors, allowing for enhanced visibility in low-light environments. This could be achieved through the development of specialized light-producing cells, such as photophores, that can be distributed throughout the body. This feature would be particularly useful for individuals who work in dark environments, such as search and rescue teams or nighttime athletes.",
    "Enhanced Resilience: Redesign the human body to be more resistant to environmental stresses, such as extreme temperatures, radiation, and toxic substances. This could involve developing specialized cells or tissues that can withstand these stresses, as well as adaptive mechanisms that can help the body recover from exposure to harmful substances. This would allow humans to survive in a wider range of environments and withstand hazardous conditions.",
    "Improved Mobility: Revolutionize the human skeletal system by integrating advanced joints and muscles that can adapt to different environments and activities. For example, the body could have adjustable limbs that can lengthen or shorten depending on the situation, allowing for greater dexterity and flexibility. Additionally, the body could have built-in propulsion systems, such as miniature jet engines or hover technology, that can enable humans to move quickly and efficiently in various environments.",
    "Enhanced Cognitive Abilities: Rewire the human brain to enhance cognitive functions, such as memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. This could involve developing new neural pathways and connections, as well as augmenting existing brain regions with advanced computing technology. For example, the brain could be equipped with a neural computer interface that can process vast amounts of information and provide real"
