    "**Portable Vision Projectors**: A wearable device that projects a high-resolution image onto a surface in front of the user, allowing them to see objects and text clearly. The projector could be powered by a small battery and would require a brief calibration period to adjust to the user's vision needs. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Haptic Feedback Technology**: A wearable device that uses tactile feedback to convey visual information to the user. For example, a device that vibrates or provides resistance when the user approaches an object, allowing them to navigate their surroundings through touch. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Smart Canes with Advanced Sensors**: A high-tech cane that incorporates advanced sensors to detect obstacles, stairs, and other hazards. The cane would provide real-time feedback to the user through vibrations, sounds, or voice commands, allowing them to navigate safely. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Virtual Reality Contact Lenses**: A non-invasive, wearable device that uses virtual reality technology to project a virtual image onto the user's retina. This would allow people with poor vision to see the world in a new way, with enhanced contrast and clarity. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Acoustic Navigation Systems**: A system that uses sound waves to convey visual information to the user. For example, a device that emits a series of beeps or tones to indicate the presence of objects or obstacles, allowing the user to navigate through their surroundings through sound. (Confidence score: 0.6)"
