    "**Plot Holes and Continuity Issues**: As the screenplay progresses, inconsistencies in the plot may arise, leading to confusion for the audience. For example, a character may have a change of heart that seems abrupt or unearned, or an event might contradict earlier scenes. To address this, the writer could implement a meticulous outline process, ensuring that every plot point logically follows from the last, and conduct thorough revisions to catch any discrepancies before finalizing the script.",
    "**Balancing Dialogue and Action**: Writers often grapple with the challenge of balancing dialogue and action in their screenplays. Excessive dialogue can lead to a slow-paced script, while too much action may undermine character development. A potential solution is to visualize key scenes and focus on \"showing\" rather than \"telling,\" allowing actions to convey emotions and motivations. Utilizing subtext in dialogue can also enhance the depth of conversations while keeping the pace engaging.",
    "**Finding a Unique Voice**: In a saturated market, it can be difficult for a writer to find a unique voice that sets their screenplay apart. This could lead to a script that feels derivative or uninspired. To cultivate originality, the writer might explore personal experiences, cultural influences, or unconventional storytelling methods (like non-linear narratives or unreliable narrators) to infuse their script with a fresh perspective.",
    "**Adapting to Feedback**: Receiving feedback from peers, producers, or directors can be a double-edged sword. While constructive criticism can improve the screenplay, it can also lead to confusion or a loss of the writer's original vision. To navigate this, the writer could establish clear criteria for what feedback to incorporate, focusing on themes and character integrity while remaining open to suggestions that enhance the story's impact.",
    "**Budget Constraints**: Writers often face the reality of budget constraints, which can limit the scope of their screenplay. A grand vision with elaborate settings or special effects may be unrealistic for a low-budget production. To address this, the writer can think creatively about how to convey their story using fewer locations or simpler effects, focusing on character-driven narratives that can thrive on dialogue and performance rather than spectacle."
