    "**Gardening and Urban Farming**: With the cessation of farming, traditional methods of agriculture would become non-viable. However, urban farming and gardening can provide a sustainable solution. By utilizing small spaces such as balconies, rooftops, or even windowsills, one can grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Starting with easy-to-grow plants like tomatoes, lettuce, and herbs can help build confidence and gradually expand to more complex systems. Additionally, community gardens can be established in neighborhoods, where people can share resources, knowledge, and space to cultivate food collectively.",
    "**Aquaponics and Hydroponics**: These innovative farming techniques use water to grow plants without soil. In aquaponics, fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, while the plants filter the water for the fish. Hydroponics involves growing plants in nutrient-rich solutions. Both methods require less land and water than traditional farming, making them ideal for resource-constrained situations. They can be set up indoors or outdoors, depending on available space and resources.",
    "**Foraging and Wild Food Gathering**: Learning to identify edible wild plants, fungi, and other natural resources can provide a significant portion of one's diet. Books, online courses, and local workshops can teach essential skills for foraging safely and sustainably. This approach not only offers a diverse range of foods but also promotes a deeper connection with nature and an understanding of local ecosystems.",
    "**Barter Systems and Community Trading**: Without a centralized agricultural system, barter systems can emerge, allowing communities to exchange goods and services directly. For example, someone skilled in carpentry might trade their services for fresh produce grown by another member of the community. This fosters strong social ties and ensures that everyone has access to necessary resources.",
    "**Sustainable Livestock Keeping**: While farming may cease, livestock can still play a role in providing food and other necessities. Small-scale livestock keeping, such as chickens, ducks, and rabbits, can offer eggs, meat, and manure for composting. Additionally, animals can contribute to pest control, help maintain soil health, and serve as a source of companionship and emotional support. It is crucial, however, to practice humane and sustainable animal husbandry to ensure the well-being of the animals and the environment."
