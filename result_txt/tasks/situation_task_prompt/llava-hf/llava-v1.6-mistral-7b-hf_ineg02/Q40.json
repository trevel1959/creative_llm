    "Human Power: Develop devices that can be powered by human energy, such as pedaling a stationary bike or using a hand-crank to generate electricity. This would not only provide a source of energy but also promote physical activity.",
    "Wind Power: Use wind turbines to generate electricity, which can be stored in batteries or used directly to power devices. This would require a windy location and a small turbine system.",
    "Kinetic Energy: Create devices that can convert the energy generated from walking or other forms of movement into electricity. For example, a backpack with a small turbine that spins when the wearer moves could generate enough power to charge a smartphone.",
    "Thermoelectric Power: Develop devices that can convert heat into electricity. This could involve using a thermoelectric generator, which could be placed in an oven, stove, or even a car engine to generate electricity.",
    "Geothermal Power: Utilize geothermal energy from the Earth's core to generate electricity. This would require drilling into the Earth to access the heat and convert it into electricity."
