    "**DIY Projector**: With a bit of ingenuity, you can turn a cardboard box into a simple projector for your smartphone. Cut a hole in one end for the lens (which can be made from a magnifying glass), and create a stand to hold your phone at the opposite end. By adjusting the distance from a wall, you can project videos or images onto a larger surface for a fun movie night.",
    "**Garden Planter**: Repurpose a cardboard box as a biodegradable planter. Line the inside with plastic to hold moisture, fill it with soil, and plant your favorite flowers or herbs. Over time, the cardboard will break down, enriching the soil while providing a temporary home for your plants.",
