    "The Law of Conservation of Energy: This law would state that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This would ensure that the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant, and that energy is always conserved in closed systems.",
    "The Law of Entropy: This law would state that the total entropy of a closed system always increases over time. Entropy is a measure of the amount of thermal energy unavailable to do work, so this law would ensure that the universe as a whole becomes more disordered and less able to perform work over time.",
    "The Law of Inverse Square Law: This law would state that the intensity of a signal or force decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from its source. This would ensure that the universe is a uniform and predictable place, with signals and forces following a consistent pattern of decay as they move away from their sources.",
    "The Law of Diminishing Returns: This law would state that as resources are used up, the rate of return on investment decreases. This would ensure that the universe is a sustainable place, with resources being used efficiently and not wasted.",
    "The Law of Compound Interest: This law would state that the interest earned on an investment compounds over time, leading to exponential growth. This would ensure that the universe is a dynamic and ever-changing place, with resources and knowledge accumulating over time and leading to rapid advancements."
