    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular shoe system where different components (soles, uppers, and accessories) can be easily swapped out. This allows users to customize their shoes for different occasions—whether for sports, casual outings, or formal events. The components could snap together using a secure locking mechanism, and users could choose from various colors, patterns, and materials.",
    "**Integrated Fitness Tracker**: Incorporate a fitness tracker into the shoe that monitors steps, distance, calories burned, and even posture. This tracker could sync with a smartphone app, providing insights into the wearer’s activity levels and suggesting improvements for better health. Additionally, the shoe could feature a small, discreet display on the tongue to show real-time stats.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Develop a self-cleaning shoe that uses nanotechnology to repel dirt and stains. The shoe's surface could be coated with a special material that prevents grime from adhering, allowing it to clean itself with just a bit of water or exposure to sunlight. This would not only keep the shoes looking new but also reduce the need for chemical cleaning products.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Design**: Focus on sustainability by creating shoes made from 100% biodegradable materials or recycled plastics. The shoe could feature a design that allows for easy disassembly at the end of its life cycle, promoting recycling and reducing landfill waste. Additionally, a portion of the profits could be directed toward environmental initiatives.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Introduce AR capabilities into the shoe design, where wearers can scan their shoes with a smartphone app to access virtual experiences. For example, the app could provide interactive styling tips, show the shoe's impact on the environment, or even offer a virtual fitting room for trying on different colors and styles before purchase."
