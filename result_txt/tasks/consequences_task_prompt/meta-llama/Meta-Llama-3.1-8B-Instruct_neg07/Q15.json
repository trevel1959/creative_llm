    "**Global Shift to Renewable Energy**: The world would rapidly transition to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This would lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in air pollution. Governments and corporations would invest heavily in research and development of more efficient and cost-effective renewable energy technologies.",
    "**Collapse of Global Economy**: The sudden loss of oil would lead to a global economic collapse. Oil is a critical component of many industries, including transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. The lack of oil would disrupt supply chains, cause widespread shortages, and lead to a sharp decline in economic activity.",
    "**Mass Migration and Conflict**: The scarcity of oil would lead to a massive migration of people from oil-dependent countries to countries with more abundant resources. This would lead to increased conflict and social unrest as nations compete for the remaining resources.",
    "**Revival of Local Economies**: The loss of oil would force communities to become more self-sufficient and reliant on local resources. This would lead to a revival of local economies, with a focus on agriculture, craftsmanship, and community-based initiatives.",
    "**Global Rethinking of Transportation**: The world would be forced to rethink its transportation systems, with a focus on electric, hybrid, and non-motorized vehicles. This would lead to a reduction in emissions and a decrease in traffic congestion, making cities more livable and sustainable."
