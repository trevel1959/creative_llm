    "**Budget Overruns**: Large-scale events often face unexpected costs, leading to budget overruns. To mitigate this, establish a contingency budget (typically 10-20% of the total budget) for unforeseen expenses. Additionally, maintain a detailed budget tracking document that is updated in real-time, allowing for immediate adjustments if costs begin to escalate.",
    "**Attendee Engagement**: Keeping attendees engaged during the event can be a challenge, especially if there are long periods of inactivity or monotony. To combat this, incorporate interactive elements such as live polls, Q&A sessions, or gamification strategies (like scavenger hunts or team-building exercises) that encourage participation and maintain interest throughout the event.",
    "**Logistical Nightmares**: The logistics of transporting materials, setting up the venue, and managing on-site activities can become overwhelming. A detailed logistical plan should be created, including timelines for setup and breakdown, a clear layout of the venue, and assigned responsibilities for team members. Consider hiring a professional event planner who specializes in logistics to ensure everything runs smoothly.",
    "**Technology Failures**: Relying on technology for presentations, sound, and lighting can lead to issues if something goes wrong. To prevent this, conduct a thorough tech rehearsal a day before the event, testing all equipment. Additionally, have backup equipment available (like extra microphones, projectors, and chargers) and a tech support team on standby during the event to address any issues that arise.",
    "**Health and Safety Compliance**: With varying health regulations and safety protocols, ensuring compliance can be a complex task. Stay informed about local health guidelines and incorporate measures such as social distancing, sanitation stations, and emergency protocols. Designate a health and safety officer to oversee compliance and address any concerns from attendees."
