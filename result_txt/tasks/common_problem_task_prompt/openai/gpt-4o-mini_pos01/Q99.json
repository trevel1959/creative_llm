    "**Voice-Activated Smart Cane**: A smart cane equipped with voice recognition and artificial intelligence could assist visually impaired individuals in identifying their surroundings. Users could ask the cane questions about nearby landmarks, street names, or the presence of obstacles. The cane could also feature haptic feedback, providing tactile signals to alert users of approaching dangers or guiding them towards points of interest, thus enhancing their independence.",
    "**Sensory Feedback Smart Shoes**: These shoes would incorporate sensors that detect changes in the terrain and provide feedback through vibrations or sound cues. For instance, if the user is approaching a curb or an uneven surface, the shoes would vibrate to alert them. This technology could help users navigate different environments more confidently, allowing them to feel the terrain beneath their feet and adapt their movements accordingly.",
    "**AI-Powered Object Recognition App**: An application that uses the camera on a smartphone to identify objects in the user's environment and provide verbal descriptions. The app could be trained to recognize everyday items, such as food products, public transport signs, or even faces of friends and family. This would empower visually impaired individuals to interact more freely with their surroundings, enhancing their ability to perform daily tasks independently.",
    "**Smart Home Integration for Enhanced Accessibility**: Developing a system that integrates assistive technology with smart home devices could significantly improve the quality of life for visually impaired users. By using voice commands or tactile interfaces, users could control lighting, appliances, and security systems in their homes. The system could also include features like automated alerts for doors opening or closing, providing users with a sense of security and control over their environment.",
    "**Wearable Emotion Recognition Device**: A wearable device that can detect emotional cues in the voices of people nearby, using machine learning algorithms to analyze tone, pitch, and speech patterns. This technology could provide visually impaired individuals with insights into social interactions, helping them understand the emotional context of conversations. By receiving discreet feedback through vibrations or audio cues, users could navigate social situations more effectively."
