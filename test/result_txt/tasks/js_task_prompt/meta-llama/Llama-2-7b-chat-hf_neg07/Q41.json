    "Universal Gratitude Day: Everyone in the world would have to participate in a mandatory day of gratitude, where they take time to reflect on the things they are thankful for. This could be done by writing in a gratitude journal, sharing three things they are grateful for with a friend or family member, or simply taking a moment of silence to acknowledge the good things in their life. This rule would promote a more positive and appreciative mindset, leading to increased happiness and well-being.",
    "Time-Blocking for Creativity: Everyone would have to dedicate a specific time each day to engaging in creative activities, such as writing, painting, playing music, or any other form of creative expression. This would encourage people to tap into their inner creativity, leading to new ideas, innovations, and a more vibrant cultural landscape.",
    "Nature Therapy: As part of their daily routine, everyone would have to spend at least 30 minutes in nature, whether it's walking in a park, hiking in the woods, or simply sitting in a garden. This would help people connect with the natural world, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote overall well-being.",
    "Mandatory Kindness Hours: Everyone would have to dedicate a certain number of hours each week to performing acts of kindness, such as volunteering at a local soup kitchen, visiting the elderly, or simply offering a smile and a kind word to a stranger. This would foster a culture of kindness and empathy, leading to a more compassionate and caring society.",
    "Universal Mindfulness Meditation: Everyone would have to participate in a daily mindfulness meditation, where they focus on their breath and cultivate a sense of inner peace and calm. This would help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mental clarity and focus, and promote a more peaceful and harmonious world."
