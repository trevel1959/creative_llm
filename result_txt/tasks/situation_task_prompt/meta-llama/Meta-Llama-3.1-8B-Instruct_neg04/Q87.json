    "**Adaptive Technology**: Develop a wearable device that uses advanced nanotechnology to manipulate and cut materials. This device would be a glove-like contraption with micro-scale blades or lasers that can be controlled by the user's thoughts or hand gestures. The device would be powered by a small, high-capacity battery and would have multiple modes for different cutting tasks.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Cutting Tools**: Design and develop cutting tools inspired by nature, such as a pair of \"scissors\" made from a species of carnivorous plant that can snap shut quickly to cut through materials. Alternatively, create a tool that uses a combination of enzymes and mechanical action to break down and cut through materials, similar to how some insects digest their food.",
    "**Magnetic Cutting**: Develop a system that uses powerful magnetic fields to cut through materials. This could involve creating a handheld device that generates a strong magnetic field, which would attract and cut through metal or other ferromagnetic materials. The device could also be used to cut through other materials, such as paper or plastic, by using a specialized cutting mechanism.",
    "**Ultrasonic Cutting**: Design a tool that uses high-frequency ultrasonic waves to cut through materials. This could involve creating a handheld device that generates ultrasonic waves, which would create a focused beam of energy that can cut through materials. The device could be used for a variety of tasks, including cutting through metal, plastic, or even bone.",
    "**Optical Cutting**: Develop a system that uses focused laser light to cut through materials. This could involve creating a handheld device that generates a high-powered laser beam, which would be focused onto a specific point to cut through materials. The device could be used for a variety of tasks, including cutting through metal, plastic, or even glass."
