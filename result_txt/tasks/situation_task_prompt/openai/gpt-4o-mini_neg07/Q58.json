    "**Natural Deterrent Gardens**: Create large urban and rural gardens specifically designed to deter pests through companion planting and the use of natural repellents. These gardens would feature plants that emit scents or chemicals that repel insects. For instance, marigolds could be planted alongside vegetables to deter aphids, while mint could repel ants. This would create a harmonious balance in ecosystems and provide a food source for humans.",
    "**Insect-Repelling Architecture**: Design buildings and public spaces with materials and layouts that naturally repel pests. For example, using specific coatings on walls that are slippery for insects or creating barriers that disrupt their movement could reduce pest populations in urban areas. Additionally, integrating screens and natural ventilation systems that filter out pests could help maintain a pest-free environment.",
    "**Smart Traps with AI**: Develop smart traps equipped with artificial intelligence that can identify and capture pests while allowing non-pest species to escape. These traps would use sensors to detect specific movements and species, enabling them to differentiate between harmful insects and beneficial ones. The captured pests could then be disposed of humanely or used in research.",
    "**Ecosystem Restoration Projects**: Focus on restoring natural ecosystems that can naturally balance pest populations. This could involve reintroducing native plants and promoting biodiversity to attract beneficial insects and predators that keep pest populations in check. For instance, planting flowering plants that attract ladybugs and lacewings can help control aphid populations naturally.",
    "**Educational Campaigns for Pest Awareness**: Launch community-based educational campaigns to inform the public about pest behavior, prevention strategies, and eco-friendly pest control methods. Workshops could teach people how to create their own natural repellents using common household items or how to maintain gardens that attract beneficial insects. This grassroots approach empowers individuals to manage pests sustainably."
