    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handles**: Create scissors with handles that can be adjusted to fit the user's hand size. This would involve a telescoping handle mechanism that allows users to slide the handles in or out for comfort. The ergonomic design would also include soft grip materials to reduce strain during prolonged use, making them ideal for both children and adults.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Design scissors that can transform into multiple tools. For instance, one side could feature a cutting blade, while the other could include a small screwdriver, bottle opener, and even a mini wrench. This would make them an all-in-one tool for various tasks, perfect for crafting, DIY projects, or even outdoor activities.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Innovate scissors with self-sharpening technology. The blades could be designed with a special mechanism that sharpens them every time they are opened and closed. This would ensure that the scissors maintain their cutting efficiency over time without the need for manual sharpening, making them low-maintenance and user-friendly.",
    "**Color-Coded Blade Options**: Introduce a line of scissors with interchangeable blades that are color-coded for different cutting tasks. For example, blue blades could be for paper, red for fabric, and green for plastic. This would help users easily identify the right blade for their needs, promoting better organization and efficiency in crafting or sewing projects.",
    "**Magnetic Base for Easy Storage**: Design scissors with a magnetic base that allows them to stick to metal surfaces or a specially designed magnetic holder. This would prevent them from being misplaced and make them easily accessible in a workshop or craft area. The holder could also have designated spots for other tools, keeping everything organized and within reach."
