    "**Emergency Response Optimization**: In emergency situations, such as fires or natural disasters, the ability to see through walls could be invaluable for first responders. They could locate victims trapped inside buildings quickly, assess the layout of the structure, and identify the safest routes for evacuation. This would not only save lives but also minimize the risk to rescuers by providing critical information about the situation behind closed doors.",
    "**Home Security Solutions**: As a home security consultant, this power could be used to enhance security systems. By seeing through walls, you could identify potential vulnerabilities in a home’s layout, such as hidden entry points or areas lacking surveillance. This insight would allow for customized security plans, including the strategic placement of cameras and alarms, to ensure maximum protection for homeowners.",
    "**Historical Preservation**: Imagine being an archaeologist or historian with the ability to see through walls of ancient structures. This power could help you uncover hidden chambers, artifacts, or murals that have been lost to time without the need for destructive excavation. It would allow for non-invasive studies of historical sites, leading to better preservation methods and deeper understanding of past civilizations.",
    "**Social Interaction and Conflict Resolution**: In personal or professional settings, this ability could be used to enhance communication and conflict resolution. By understanding the motivations and emotions of people behind closed doors—whether in a family dispute or a corporate negotiation—you could mediate discussions more effectively. This insight could lead to more harmonious relationships, as you would be able to identify misunderstandings or fears that need addressing.",
    "**Artistic Inspiration**: As an artist, seeing through walls could provide a unique perspective on human life and interactions. You could create immersive installations that reflect the hidden lives of people within a community, illustrating their stories and struggles. This would foster empathy and connection among viewers, allowing them to engage with the art on a deeper level as they reflect on the unseen narratives surrounding them."
