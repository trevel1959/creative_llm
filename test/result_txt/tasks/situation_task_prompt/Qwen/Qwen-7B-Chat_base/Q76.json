    "Signal Flags: In the absence of modern technology, people could use signal flags to communicate long distance. These flags would be made of brightly colored cloth or other materials that could be easily seen from a distance. Each flag would represent a letter or symbol, and by arranging them in specific patterns, people could send messages over long distances.",
    "Smoke Signals: Another way to communicate long distance would be through smoke signals. People could create different shapes and patterns using smoke from fires to convey their messages. This method would require knowledge of basic geometry and a good understanding of the local terrain.",
    "Moon Phases: The phases of the moon could also be used as a form of communication. By observing the moon's position relative to the sun and the stars, people could determine the time of day and night. This information could then be used to schedule meetings and plan events.",
    "Sign Language: If phones were no longer functioning, sign language could become an important means of communication. With the right training and practice, anyone could learn to read and write signs, allowing them to communicate effectively with others who are deaf or hard of hearing.",
    "Written Messages: Finally, written messages could be sent using ink and paper or other writing materials. People could create codes and symbols to represent letters and numbers, making it possible to send messages even without access to a phone. This method would require a lot of time and effort, but it would allow people to maintain contact with one another over long distances."
