    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Mower**: Design a lawn mower that operates entirely on solar energy, utilizing solar panels integrated into the mower's body. This would reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The mower could also have a battery backup for cloudy days, and users could monitor the battery level through a mobile app. Additionally, it could include a feature that collects rainwater for irrigation, providing a sustainable solution for lawn care.",
    "**Multi-Function Mower with Attachments**: Create a modular lawn mower that allows users to attach different tools for various tasks. For example, attachments could include a leaf blower, a hedge trimmer, or a garden tiller. This would transform the lawn mower into a versatile garden tool, reducing the need for multiple devices and saving storage space. The attachments could be easily swapped out, making it user-friendly for homeowners.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mower with Built-in Maintenance Alerts**: Innovate a self-cleaning feature that uses high-pressure water jets to remove grass clippings and debris from the mower's blades and undercarriage after each use. Additionally, the mower could be equipped with sensors that monitor blade sharpness, engine performance, and overall condition, sending alerts to the user when maintenance is needed, thus prolonging the mower's lifespan and ensuring optimal performance.",
    "**Quiet Operation Technology**: Develop a lawn mower that employs advanced sound-dampening technology to significantly reduce noise levels during operation. This would be especially beneficial for residential areas where noise complaints can arise. The mower could also feature a \"quiet mode\" for early morning or late evening mowing, allowing users to maintain their lawns without disturbing neighbors.",
    "**Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) User Manual**: Create an AR user manual that users can access through their smartphones or AR glasses. When they point their device at the mower, interactive tutorials and maintenance guides would pop up, demonstrating how to operate, troubleshoot, and maintain the mower. This immersive experience would make it easier for users to understand the mower's features and ensure proper care."
