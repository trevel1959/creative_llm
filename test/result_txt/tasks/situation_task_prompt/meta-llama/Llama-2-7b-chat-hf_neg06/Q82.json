    "Gestures and Body Language: In a world without language, people would rely heavily on non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. People could use exaggerated hand gestures to convey complex ideas or emotions, like waving goodbye or pointing to something. They could also use facial expressions, like smiling or frowning, to convey emotions like happiness or sadness. Body language, such as posture or tone of voice, could also be used to convey messages like confidence or submissiveness.",
    "Visual Art: Without language, people might turn to visual art as a means of communication. They could use drawings, paintings, or other forms of visual expression to convey ideas or tell stories. For example, a person could create a series of drawings to tell a story or convey a message, like a comic strip or a graphic novel. Visual art could also be used to communicate emotions or ideas in a more abstract way, like a painting or sculpture.",

They could use different melodies or rhythms to convey emotions or ideas, like a happy tune to indicate joy or a sad song to express sadness. Music could also be used to tell stories or convey messages in a more abstract way, like a song with lyrics that are open to interpretation.",
    "Dance: Dance has long been used as a means of non-verbal communication, and in a world without language, it could become even more important. People could use different dance moves or steps to convey emotions or ideas, like a graceful dance to indicate peacefulness or a energetic dance to express excitement. Dance could also be used to tell stories or convey messages in a more abstract way, like a choreographed routine with specific movements to represent different characters or events.",
