    "**Adjustable Fit System**: Design roller skates with an adjustable fit mechanism that allows users to customize the tightness and comfort level of the skates. This could involve a built-in air pump system that inflates or deflates air chambers within the boot, providing a personalized fit for different foot shapes and sizes. This would enhance comfort during long skating sessions and reduce the risk of blisters.",
    "**Interchangeable Wheels**: Create a roller skate design that allows users to easily swap out wheels based on their skating environment. For instance, users could choose between softer wheels for indoor skating (which offer better grip) and harder wheels for outdoor skating (which provide speed). A simple mechanism for changing wheels could make this process quick and user-friendly.",
    "**Integrated LED Lights**: Incorporate customizable LED lights into the roller skates that can change colors and patterns based on the user's preference or mood. These lights could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to create light shows while skating. Additionally, the lights would enhance visibility in low-light conditions, increasing safety for night skaters.",
    "**Ergonomic Ankle Support**: Develop a roller skate with an innovative ankle support system that mimics the natural movement of the ankle while providing stability. This could involve a flexible yet supportive structure made from advanced materials that allow for greater freedom of movement without sacrificing safety. Such a design would help prevent injuries while promoting better skating techniques.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create roller skates using sustainable and recycled materials, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. This could include using plant-based plastics for the boot, recycled rubber for the wheels, and organic cotton for the lining. A marketing campaign could emphasize the ecological benefits, making these skates a responsible choice for outdoor enthusiasts."
