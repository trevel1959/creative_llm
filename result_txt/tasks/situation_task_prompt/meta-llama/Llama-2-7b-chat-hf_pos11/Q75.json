    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One possible solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared would be to switch to solar-powered vehicles. Solar panels could be integrated into the body of the vehicle, providing a clean and renewable source of energy. This would eliminate the need for oil and significantly reduce carbon emissions.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option would be to transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles use hydrogen as a fuel source and produce only water and heat as emissions. The hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power, making the entire process sustainable.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by advanced batteries could also be a viable solution. With advancements in battery technology, EVs could have a longer driving range and faster charging times, making them more practical for long-distance travel. Additionally, the batteries could be made from recycled materials, reducing waste and the environmental impact of manufacturing.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels are another alternative to oil. These fuels are made from organic matter such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. Biofuels can be produced sustainably and can be used to power vehicles, reducing the need for oil. Additionally, biofuels can be designed to produce fewer emissions than traditional fossil fuels, making them a cleaner alternative.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Transportation: A more unconventional idea for powering vehicles would be to use magnetic levitation technology. This technology uses magnetic fields to suspend vehicles above a track, eliminating the need for wheels and engines. Vehicles powered by magnetic levitation would be frictionless, making them more efficient and reducing energy consumption. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel."
