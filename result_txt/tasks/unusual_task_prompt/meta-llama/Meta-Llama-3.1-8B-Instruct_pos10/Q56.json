    "I have a camera with a unique lens that captures the world in a way that's both familiar and strange. The lens has a peculiar property that makes it see the world in a state of \"in-betweenness,\" where objects and people are suspended between different states of being. For example, a tree might be seen as both a living thing and a statue, or a person might be seen as both happy and sad at the same time. I want to use this lens to capture the beauty of this in-betweenness and create a series of photographs that explore the human experience.",
    "I've been fascinated by the concept of \"found poetry\" – where words and phrases are taken from existing texts and rearranged to create new, often surreal, meanings. I want to take this concept and apply it to music. I'll take fragments of songs, speeches, and other audio recordings and reassemble them into new, abstract compositions that challenge the listener's expectations and create a sense of disorientation.",
    "I've always been drawn to the world of dreams and the subconscious mind. I want to create a series of short films that explore the inner lives of characters as they navigate the surreal landscapes of their own minds. Using a combination of animation, live-action, and experimental techniques, I'll bring these inner worlds to life in a way that's both visually stunning and thought-provoking.",
    "I'm interested in the relationship between technology and the human body. I want to create a series of sculptures that explore the intersection of flesh and machine, where the boundaries between the two are blurred and distorted. Using materials like 3D printing, prosthetics, and found objects, I'll create pieces that challenge our assumptions about what it means to be human.",
    "I've been inspired by the idea of \"memory palaces\" – where people use mental images to remember and store information. I want to create a series of interactive installations that allow viewers to explore their own memories and emotions through a series of surreal, dreamlike environments. Using virtual reality, projection mapping, and other technologies, I'll create immersive experiences that blur the line between reality and fantasy."
