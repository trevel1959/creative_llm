    "Resistance to Change: Many people resist new changes, and a new government policy is no exception. This resistance can arise from various perspectives, including political, social, or economic interests. Efforts should be made to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process, ensure transparency, and address concerns in a timely manner to minimize resistance and maximize acceptance and compliance.",
    "Technical Challenges: The implementation of a new policy may involve the use of technology or digital systems, such as online registration or data collection. Technical issues, such as cybersecurity threats or system glitches, can quickly disrupt the process. Ensuring the security of digital systems and regular updates and maintenance can help mitigate these challenges.",
    "Compliance Issues: When a new policy is introduced, many people may not be aware of it or may not know how to comply. This can result in non-compliance, fines, or legal issues. Providing clear information and creating awareness campaigns can help address these issues by educating the public about the new policy and its requirements.",
    "Resource Allocation: The implementation of a new policy requires resources, including financial resources, personnel, and infrastructure. These resources must be allocated efficiently and strategically to maximize the effectiveness of the new policy and minimize delays or unnecessary expenses.",
    "Timing and Deadline Problems: The success of a government policy often depends on efficient timing and deadlines. Delays or inadequate deadlines can lead to the policy becoming outdated or ineffective or facing legal challenges. Setting realistic timelines and deadlines and monitoring progress closely can help address these challenges."
