    "**Surfboard-Shaped Solar Panels**: Design a surfboard that doubles as a solar panel, harnessing the sun's energy to power electronic devices. The surfboard's surface could be covered with thin-film solar cells, allowing it to generate electricity while in use. This innovative design could provide a sustainable solution for surfers and beachgoers alike.",
    "**Intelligent Surfboard**: Develop a smart surfboard that incorporates sensors, GPS, and AI-powered analytics to provide real-time feedback on the surfer's performance. The board could track speed, distance, and wave height, offering personalized coaching and suggestions for improvement. This technology could revolutionize the way surfers learn and train.",
    "**Surfboard-Shaped Water Purification System**: Design a surfboard that incorporates a built-in water purification system, allowing surfers to collect and purify seawater while in the ocean. This system could use advanced filtration technologies, such as graphene or nanofiltration, to remove impurities and contaminants, providing clean drinking water for surfers and beachgoers.",
    "**Surfboard with Integrated Storage**: Create a surfboard that features a hidden compartment or storage space, perfect for storing small items like snacks, sunscreen, or a first-aid kit. This design could also include a waterproof Bluetooth speaker or a small LED light, enhancing the overall surfing experience.",
    "**Surfboard-Shaped Floating Laboratory**: Develop a surfboard that doubles as a floating laboratory, allowing scientists to conduct research on ocean currents, marine life, and water quality. The board could be equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment, providing valuable data and insights into the ocean's ecosystem."
