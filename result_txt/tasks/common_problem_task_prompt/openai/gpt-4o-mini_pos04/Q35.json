    "**Visitor Safety and Engagement**: Ensuring the safety of visitors while providing an engaging experience is crucial. Problems can occur if visitors disregard safety guidelines, leading to accidents or injuries. To mitigate this, zoos can introduce interactive educational programs that inform visitors about animal behavior and safety, alongside clearly marked barriers and signs. Additionally, employing trained staff to monitor visitor interactions can enhance safety and engagement.",
    "**Conservation and Breeding Programs**: Zoos often play a role in species conservation, but challenges can arise in maintaining genetic diversity within breeding programs. Inbreeding can occur if there is a limited gene pool. To combat this, zoos can collaborate with other institutions globally to share genetic material and knowledge, and participate in global conservation efforts, thereby creating a more sustainable approach to breeding endangered species.",
    "**Funding and Financial Sustainability**: Running a zoo can be financially challenging, especially if visitor numbers decline. Problems may arise from fluctuating economic conditions or unexpected expenses, such as animal care or facility maintenance. To ensure financial sustainability, zoos can diversify their revenue streams through membership programs, special events, and educational workshops. Establishing partnerships with local businesses for sponsorships can also provide additional funding.",
    "**Public Perception and Ethical Considerations**: As society's views on animal captivity evolve, zoos may face criticism regarding ethical practices. Problems can arise from negative public perception, leading to decreased attendance and funding. To address this, zoos can increase transparency by sharing their conservation efforts and educational initiatives with the public. Hosting open forums for community feedback can also foster a positive relationship with the community and enhance public trust.",
    "**Environmental Impact and Sustainability**: Zoos can have a significant environmental footprint through energy consumption, waste production, and habitat destruction. Problems may arise from unsustainable practices that harm local ecosystems. To counter this, zoos can adopt green practices such as solar energy use, water conservation systems, and recycling programs. Engaging in habitat restoration projects in the surrounding area can also enhance the zoo's commitment to environmental sustainability."
