    "**Global Communication Collapse**: With all electronic devices shutting down, global communication networks would grind to a halt. No phone calls, no emails, no text messages, no social media, and no internet. People would be unable to contact each other, leading to widespread panic and chaos. Governments, emergency services, and critical infrastructure would struggle to respond to the crisis, exacerbating the situation. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Economic Free Fall**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would cripple the global economy. Financial transactions, stock markets, and banking systems would come to a standstill. Trade and commerce would be severely disrupted, leading to a rapid decline in economic activity. The lack of access to essential services like ATMs, credit card machines, and online payment systems would further exacerbate the crisis. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Critical Infrastructure Collapse**: Modern society relies heavily on electronic devices to manage and control critical infrastructure such as power grids, water treatment plants, and transportation systems. Without functioning devices, these systems would fail, leading to widespread power outages, water shortages, and transportation disruptions. This would have a devastating impact on public health, safety, and well-being. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Social Unrest and Disorder**: The sudden loss of electronic devices would lead to a breakdown in social order. Without access to information, communication, and entertainment, people would become restless and agitated. Riots, looting, and civil unrest would become more likely as people seek to cope with the sudden loss of their digital lives. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Environmental Consequences**: The sudden shutdown of electronic devices would have unintended environmental consequences. Without functioning devices, power plants would shut down, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, this would also lead to a loss of critical infrastructure, including water treatment plants and waste management systems, which would have devastating environmental consequences.
