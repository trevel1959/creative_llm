    "**Color-Changing Post-it Notes**: Develop Post-it Notes that change color based on temperature or light exposure. For instance, when a note is left in sunlight, it could change from yellow to a bright orange. This feature could serve as a visual cue for reminders, indicating how long a task has been on the note or if it needs immediate attention.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Seed-Embedded Notes**: Create Post-it Notes made from biodegradable paper embedded with seeds. Once the notes are no longer needed, users can plant them in soil, where they will decompose and grow into flowers or herbs. This not only reduces waste but also encourages users to think about sustainability and gardening.",
    "**Mood Indicator Post-it Notes**: Design Post-it Notes that feature a small, built-in mood indicator (like a smiley face or color gradient) that can be changed by pressing a button. This could allow users to express their feelings or urgency about a task visually, helping others understand the context of the note at a glance.",
    "**Interactive Sticky Notes**: Create Post-it Notes that have a writable surface on both sides, allowing for more information to be conveyed. Additionally, the notes could feature a small flap that can be folded over to hide or reveal messages, enabling users to keep their notes private or share them selectively.",
    "**Magnetic Post-it Notes**: Introduce a line of Post-it Notes with a magnetic backing that allows them to stick to any metal surface, such as a fridge or filing cabinet. This would provide more versatility in where users can place their reminders, making it easier to see important notes while cooking or working."
