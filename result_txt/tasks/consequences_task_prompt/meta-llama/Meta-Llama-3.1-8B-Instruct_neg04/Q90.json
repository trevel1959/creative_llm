    "**Global Economic Boom**: The sudden elimination of all world debt would lead to a massive influx of liquidity into the global economy. With debt no longer weighing them down, governments and individuals would have more resources to invest in growth initiatives, leading to a surge in economic activity. This, in turn, would create new job opportunities, stimulate innovation, and increase consumer spending, resulting in a global economic boom.",
    "**Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: The erasure of debt would give countries with previously significant debt burdens a significant advantage. Countries like Greece, Argentina, and Venezuela, which have struggled with debt for decades, would suddenly find themselves with a clean slate. This could lead to a shift in global power dynamics, as these countries would be able to invest in their economies, military, and infrastructure, potentially challenging the dominance of traditional economic powers.",
    "**Rise of New Economic Players**: The elimination of debt would create opportunities for new economic players to emerge. With the traditional debt burden lifted, countries and individuals would be free to invest in new industries, technologies, and business models. This could lead to the rise of new economic powers, potentially challenging the status quo and creating new opportunities for growth and innovation.",
    "**Increased Global Cooperation**: The erasure of debt would create a sense of shared global prosperity, potentially leading to increased cooperation and collaboration among nations. With the weight of debt lifted, countries would be more likely to work together to address global challenges, such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. This could lead to a new era of global cooperation, with countries working together to achieve common goals.",
    "**Risk of Complacency**: The sudden elimination of debt could lead to a sense of complacency among governments and individuals. Without the pressure of debt repayment, there may be a lack of motivation to implement fiscal discipline, leading to a potential repeat of the same debt accumulation patterns that led to the initial debt crisis. This could result in a new era of debt accumulation, potentially worse than the previous one."
