    "**Ergonomic Design Challenge**: Create a new type of chair that focuses on ergonomics for long hours of sitting, such as in offices or homes. This could include features like adjustable backrest angles, lumbar support, customizable armrest heights, and seat depth adjustments. The design should prioritize comfort and posture correction, potentially incorporating advanced materials like memory foam, adjustable air cushions, or smart textiles that can adapt to the user's body shape.",
    "**Sustainable Material Chair**: Develop a chair made entirely from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics, reclaimed wood, bamboo, or even biodegradable composites. This would not only reduce environmental impact but also offer a unique aesthetic appeal. The chair could be designed to be modular, allowing parts to be easily replaced or recycled at the end of its lifecycle, encouraging circular economy practices.",
    "**Interactive Smart Chair**: Integrate technology into the chair to create an interactive experience. For example, the chair could be equipped with sensors that track user posture, sending alerts when they slouch or lean incorrectly. It might also have built-in speakers or vibration motors for gentle reminders or to play calming music or sounds. Additionally, it could connect to fitness apps or personal devices to monitor activity levels, making it a part of a comprehensive health management system.",
    "**Portable Foldable Camping Chair**: Design a lightweight, foldable chair that is ideal for camping, hiking, or outdoor events. The chair should be compact for easy transportation and robust enough to withstand outdoor conditions. Incorporate features like quick-release mechanisms, waterproof materials, and possibly built-in sunshade or bug netting. This product would be perfect for adventurers who need reliable seating options while exploring nature.",
    "**Reclining Massage Chair**: Create a chair that combines relaxation with therapeutic benefits. The chair could recline to various positions, offering comfortable lounging while also having built-in massage functionalities. Users could select from different massage modes and intensities using a touchpad or voice control. Additional features might include heating elements for warmth, ambient lighting, and noise-cancelling headphones to enhance the relaxation experience. This chair would be ideal for spas, home theaters, or any space where users seek stress relief and comfort."
