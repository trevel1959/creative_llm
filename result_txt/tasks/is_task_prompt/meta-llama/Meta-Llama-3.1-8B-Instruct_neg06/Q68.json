    "In the heart of a dense, mystical forest, there lived a spider named Aurum. Unlike any other spider, Aurum possessed a unique gift – the ability to spin golden webs that shone like the sun. These webs not only served as a protective barrier but also emitted a gentle hum that resonated with the forest's ancient magic.",
    "Aurum's webs became a beacon for lost travelers, guiding them through the treacherous paths of the forest. As they navigated through the golden threads, they discovered hidden clearings, secret waterfalls, and ancient ruins, each holding secrets of the forest's mysterious past.",
    "However, a dark force began to threaten the forest, seeking to extinguish the golden light and silence the hum. Aurum, determined to protect its home, embarked on a perilous quest to gather a group of allies – a wise old owl, a mischievous fox, and a gentle unicorn. Together, they battled against the darkness, using the spider's golden webs as a powerful tool in their fight.",
    "As the battle raged on, Aurum's webs began to change. They no longer just shone with a soft, golden light but now pulsed with an intense, fiery energy. The spider's magic had evolved, and its webs became a conduit for the forest's collective power.",
    "In the end, the darkness was vanquished, and the forest was saved. Aurum's golden webs continued to shine, a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The spider's story became a legend, inspiring generations to come, and its webs remained a testament to the power of determination and unity. [/INST] Assistant: 2.
