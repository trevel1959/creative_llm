    "Sleeping Bag with a Built-in Oxygen Mask: Create a sleeping bag with a built-in oxygen mask to help campers breathe easily and comfortably in high-altitude or low-oxygen environments. The mask would be designed to filter the air and provide a consistent supply of oxygen, ensuring that campers can get a good night's sleep even in challenging conditions.",
    "Smart Sleeping Bag with Climate Control: Develop a sleeping bag with built-in climate control technology, allowing campers to adjust the temperature and humidity levels to their preferences. This could be achieved through the use of small fans, heaters, or other climate control devices integrated into the sleeping bag. This would ensure that campers stay comfortable and warm, even in extreme weather conditions.",
    "Inflatable Sleeping Bag: Design an inflatable sleeping bag that can be easily inflated and deflated as needed. This would provide campers with a lightweight and compact sleeping solution that can be easily transported and stored. The inflatable design would also provide extra insulation and comfort, making it ideal for camping in cold or unpredictable weather conditions.",
    "Sleeping Bag with Integrated Entertainment: Create a sleeping bag with built-in speakers, a built-in reading light, or even a small screen for watching movies or TV shows. This would provide campers with a convenient and enjoyable way to relax and unwind after a long day of hiking or exploring. The built-in entertainment features would also help to create a cozy and comfortable sleeping environment, making it easier for campers to fall asleep and stay asleep.",
    "Solar-Powered Sleeping Bag: Design a sleeping bag with built-in solar panels that can be used to charge electronic devices, such as smartphones, cameras, or portable chargers. This would provide campers with a convenient and sustainable way to keep their devices charged, even when they are far from civilization. The solar-powered sleeping bag would also help to reduce the environmental impact of camping, as it would not require any external power sources."
