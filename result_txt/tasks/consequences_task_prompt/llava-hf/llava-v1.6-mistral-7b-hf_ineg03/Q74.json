    "Environmental Impact: A single city would require a massive amount of energy and resources to sustain itself. This would put a strain on the planet's natural resources and lead to increased pollution, deforestation, and waste production.",
    "Infrastructure Strain: A single city would require a complex and interconnected infrastructure to support its population. This would include transportation systems, utilities, and waste management systems, all of which would be under immense pressure, potentially leading to frequent breakdowns and disruptions.",
    "Loss of Cultural Diversity: With a single city, the unique cultures and traditions of different regions and countries would be lost, as they would be absorbed into a single, homogenous urban environment. This could lead to a loss of cultural identity and a diminished sense of community.",
    "Health Issues: The high density of people in a single city would make it difficult to maintain public health standards, potentially leading to the spread of diseases and a higher risk of pandemics.",
    "Political Challenges: A single city would require a highly centralized government to manage its affairs, which could lead to corruption and a lack of accountability. Additionally, with such a large population, it would be difficult to ensure that all citizens have equal access to political representation and decision-making processes."
