    "**Adaptive Ventilation Technology**: Develop a helmet with adjustable ventilation that opens or closes based on the rider's speed and temperature. For instance, when riding fast, the vents could open wider to allow more airflow, keeping the rider cool. Conversely, when riding slowly or in cooler conditions, the vents could close to retain heat.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Incorporate a retractable visor with augmented reality (AR) capabilities. This visor could display navigation directions, speed, distance traveled, and even hazard alerts directly in the rider's line of sight, allowing them to stay focused on the road without needing to check their phone.",
    "**Customizable Fit System**: Create a helmet with an advanced, customizable fit system that uses a combination of inflatable padding and memory foam. Riders could adjust the internal fit via a small pump mechanism, ensuring maximum comfort and safety. This would accommodate various head shapes and sizes more effectively than traditional sizing options.",
    "**Integrated Lighting and Signaling**: Design a helmet that includes built-in LED lights and turn signal indicators on the back and sides. Riders could activate these lights through a handlebar-mounted remote or via a smartphone app, enhancing visibility during night rides and improving safety at intersections.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Design**: Develop a helmet using biodegradable or recycled materials, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, a modular design could allow users to replace only damaged parts instead of the entire helmet, reducing waste and promoting sustainability."
