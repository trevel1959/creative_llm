    "**Impact on Local Economy**: While tourism can boost the local economy, it can also lead to a rise in prices for goods and services, making it more expensive for both tourists and local residents. This can result in a decrease in the quality of life for residents and may discourage tourists from visiting.",
    "**Safety and Security Concerns**: As the number of tourists increases, the city may face safety and security concerns, such as pickpocketing, traffic accidents, and an increase in crime. This can create a negative perception of the city and deter visitors.",
    "**Increased Competition**: As the city's tourism industry grows, it may become more competitive, leading to a decrease in the number of small, local businesses. This can result in a homogenization of the city's tourism offerings and a loss of cultural diversity."
