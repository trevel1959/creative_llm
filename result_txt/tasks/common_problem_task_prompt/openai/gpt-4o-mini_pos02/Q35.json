    "**Public Safety Hazards**: Zoos often have large animals that can pose safety risks to both visitors and staff. Incidents can occur if proper barriers are not maintained or if safety protocols are ignored. To mitigate this, the zoo could invest in advanced safety technology, such as surveillance systems and automatic locking mechanisms for enclosures, along with regular training for staff on emergency response procedures.",
    "**Financial Sustainability**: Running a zoo can be costly, and financial instability may arise from fluctuating visitor numbers, especially during off-peak seasons. To combat this, the zoo could diversify its revenue streams by offering unique experiences, such as behind-the-scenes tours, educational programs, or seasonal events, thus attracting different audiences year-round.",
    "**Conservation and Breeding Programs**: Many zoos are involved in conservation efforts, but challenges may arise in successfully breeding endangered species or maintaining genetic diversity. A potential solution is to collaborate with other zoos and conservation organizations to create a global breeding program that shares genetic material and knowledge, thereby enhancing the chances of species recovery.",
    "**Visitor Experience and Engagement**: Ensuring that visitors have an enjoyable and educational experience can be challenging, especially if they feel the exhibits are outdated or poorly maintained. To enhance visitor engagement, the zoo could incorporate interactive technology, such as augmented reality experiences or mobile apps that provide educational content and games related to the animals.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: High turnover rates and insufficient training can lead to operational inefficiencies and decreased animal care standards. To address this, the zoo could implement a comprehensive training program that includes mentorship opportunities, ongoing education in animal care and welfare, and competitive benefits to attract and retain skilled staff."
