    "In a bustling city, an invisible elephant roamed freely, causing chaos yet bringing joy. People would hear its trumpets and feel the ground tremble, but they never saw it. Children laughed as they chased the sounds, believing it was a game. One day, a lonely girl named Mia sat on a park bench, feeling invisible herself. The elephant, sensing her sadness, nudged her gently, causing a cascade of colorful flowers to bloom around her. For the first time, Mia felt seen. The invisible elephant became her friend, reminding everyone that sometimes the most beautiful things are felt, not seen. ",
