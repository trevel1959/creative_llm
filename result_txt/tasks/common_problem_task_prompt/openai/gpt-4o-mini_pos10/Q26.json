    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Mount Everest can be extremely unpredictable. Sudden storms can lead to whiteouts, dropping temperatures, and increased wind speeds, which can trap climbers or lead to frostbite and hypothermia. Climbers must stay informed about weather forecasts and be prepared to turn back if conditions worsen.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: During peak climbing seasons, the number of climbers attempting to summit can lead to overcrowding, particularly at critical points like the Hillary Step. This can result in dangerous delays, as climbers may be stuck waiting in line for hours at high altitudes, increasing the risk of exhaustion and exposure to the elements.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: The harsh environment can take a toll on climbing gear. Equipment such as ropes, harnesses, and oxygen tanks can fail due to extreme cold or wear and tear. Climbers must ensure their gear is of high quality, regularly inspected, and suited for the conditions they will face.",
    "**Physical Exhaustion**: Climbing Everest is physically demanding, and climbers can suffer from extreme fatigue, dehydration, and malnutrition. Without proper training and preparation, climbers may underestimate the physical toll of the ascent, leading to impaired judgment and increased risk of accidents.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increasing number of climbers has led to significant environmental concerns, including waste management issues and the degradation of the mountain's ecosystem. Climbers must adhere to Leave No Trace principles and participate in efforts to clean up waste left behind by previous expeditions."
