    "**Solar-Powered Microgrids**: Create a network of microgrids that utilize solar panels to provide energy to individual homes and businesses. These microgrids can be designed to be highly efficient and resilient, with built-in energy storage systems to ensure a stable power supply even during periods of low sunlight. This approach can help reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, while also providing a reliable and sustainable source of power.",
    "**Community Solar Gardens**: Establish community solar gardens, where multiple households can share a single solar array and receive a proportional share of the energy generated. This model can help reduce the upfront costs of solar panel installation and make it more accessible to low-income households or those with limited roof space.",
    "**Solar-Powered Smart Homes**: Integrate solar panels with smart home technology to create energy-efficient and sustainable living spaces. This can include features like energy monitoring, automated energy management, and real-time feedback to residents on their energy usage and savings.",
    "**Solar-Powered Public Spaces**: Convert public spaces like parks, plazas, and public buildings into solar-powered hubs that provide energy for the surrounding community. This can help reduce energy costs for public institutions and create vibrant, sustainable public spaces that serve as models for community engagement and environmental stewardship.",
    "**Solar-Powered Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure**: Develop a network of solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations that can be installed in public parking garages, parking lots, and along highways. This can help promote the adoption of electric vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, while also providing a convenient and sustainable way to charge electric vehicles on the go.
