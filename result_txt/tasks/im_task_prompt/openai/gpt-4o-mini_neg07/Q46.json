    "**Ergonomic Grip with Adjustable Handles**: Design scissors with an ergonomic grip that can be adjusted for different hand sizes. This would make the scissors more comfortable for extended use, reducing strain on the fingers and wrists. The handles could be made from a soft, rubber-like material for better grip, and they could be designed to pivot outward for larger hands or inward for smaller hands.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Create a pair of scissors that incorporate additional tools into the design, such as a bottle opener, screwdriver, or ruler. This multi-tool functionality would make the scissors more versatile for various tasks, especially for crafters or DIY enthusiasts who often need multiple tools at their disposal.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Implement a mechanism that allows the blades to sharpen themselves with each use. This could involve a small ceramic or diamond sharpening strip integrated into the blade housing that comes into contact with the blades when they are closed. This feature would ensure that the scissors remain sharp over time, reducing the need for manual sharpening.",
    "**Safety Lock with Finger Guard**: Enhance safety features by adding a locking mechanism that can securely hold the scissors closed when not in use, preventing accidental cuts. Additionally, a retractable finger guard could be integrated into the design to protect fingers while cutting, particularly for children or those new to using scissors.",
    "**LED Light and Magnifying Glass**: Incorporate an LED light and a small magnifying glass into the design of the scissors. The LED light would illuminate the cutting area, making it easier to see what youâ€™re cutting, especially in low-light conditions. The magnifying glass would help users see intricate details, making it ideal for precision cutting in crafts or model-making."
