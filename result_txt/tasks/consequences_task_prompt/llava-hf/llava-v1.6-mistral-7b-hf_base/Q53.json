    "Fewer pollution-related deaths: With less plastic waste in the environment, there would be a reduction in pollution-related deaths. People who are exposed to polluted air and water due to improperly disposed plastic would be at a lower risk of respiratory diseases or poisoning.",
    "Slowing down climate change: One of the ways plastic contributes to climate change is through the release of greenhouse gases during its production and disposal. If it biodegraded faster, the production of new plastic would be reduced, resulting in fewer greenhouse gases being released.",
    "Reduced deforestation: The production of paper often requires large amounts of trees, which could lead to deforestation. If we could create biodegradable plastics that are just as strong and recyclable as paper, we could significantly reduce the demand for paper and, consequently, deforestation.",
    "Improved soil health: Biodegradable plastic could promote healthy soil by breaking down and enriching the soil with nutrients, similar to when organic matter decomposes.",
    "Reduced plastic waste in landfills: Biodegradable plastic could help reduce the amount of waste in landfills, as it would break down naturally without the need for special disposal processes."
