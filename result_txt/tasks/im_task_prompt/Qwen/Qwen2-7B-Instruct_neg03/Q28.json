    "**Bike-to-Walk Conversion System**: Design a helmet that can be easily converted into a walking accessory. It would have built-in retractable walking poles attached to the sides for support, and a detachable visor for sun protection. This idea targets urban commuters who might occasionally walk or need additional support during their bike ride.",
    "**Ergonomic Posture Corrector**: Create a bicycle helmet with adjustable airbags and sensors that can monitor and correct the rider's posture in real-time. This would be especially beneficial for long-distance cyclists or those who spend hours on their bikes, potentially reducing the risk of back and neck pain.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lighting**: Integrate solar panels into the helmet's design to power LED lights. The helmet could automatically turn on when it detects low light conditions or darkness, ensuring the cyclist is visible to others. This is an eco-friendly solution that enhances safety.",
    "**Interactive Safety Warning System**: Develop a helmet that connects to a smartphone app. If the cyclist falls or experiences a sudden change in their motion (detected by sensors in the helmet), the app sends an alert to pre-registered contacts. This system also includes GPS tracking, so if the cyclist doesn't return as expected, help can be quickly dispatched.",
    "**Hybrid Cooling and Heating System**: Design a helmet that has both cooling fans and heating elements. This would provide comfort during both hot and cold weather rides. In hot conditions, the fans can cool down the head while the helmet's breathable design ensures airflow. In colder conditions, the heating elements can keep the cyclist warm and comfortable, preventing hypothermia risks during chilly rides. "
