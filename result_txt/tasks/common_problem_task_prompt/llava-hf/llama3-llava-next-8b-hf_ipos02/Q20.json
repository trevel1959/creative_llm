    "Lack of Human Control: Self-driving cars do not have the ability to react to unexpected situations or emergencies in the same way a human driver can. This lack of control could lead to accidents or dangerous situations.",
    "Infrastructure: Self-driving cars require specific infrastructure, such as dedicated lanes and charging stations, to function properly. The lack of this infrastructure could limit the use of self-driving cars.",
    "Privacy and Data Security: Self-driving cars collect a vast amount of data, including location information, vehicle performance data, and personal information. This data could be used for targeted advertising or could fall into the wrong hands, leading to privacy and security concerns.",
    "Ethical Considerations: Self-driving cars raise ethical questions about who is responsible for accidents and how to handle liability. It is unclear how to assign blame when an accident occurs between a self-driving car and a human-driven car.",
    "Driverless Cars and Job Loss: Self-driving cars have the potential to replace human drivers, leading to job loss in the transportation industry."
