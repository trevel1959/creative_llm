These portable devices are designed with a compact design and easy-to-use interface for taking notes and organizing information without relying on paper.",

    "Video Conferencing Tools: To record information in the context of meetings and conferences, utilize video conferencing tools like Zoom, Skype, or Microsoft Teams that now offer the option to record and share meetings. This way, you can quickly access the recorded material later and share it with attendees or non-attendees who may have missed the meeting."
