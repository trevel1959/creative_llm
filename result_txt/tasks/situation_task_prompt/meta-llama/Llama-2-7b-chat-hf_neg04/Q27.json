    "Build a greenhouse: One creative solution to regulate indoor temperature without heaters or air conditioners is to build a greenhouse. A greenhouse uses natural processes like solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and convection to maintain a stable and comfortable temperature. By constructing a greenhouse with large windows and transparent materials, you can harness the sun's energy to warm up the interior during cold days and cool it down during hot days. Additionally, plants within the greenhouse can help purify the air and provide shade, further regulating the temperature.",
    "Use phase-change materials: Another option is to utilize phase-change materials (PCMs) to regulate indoor temperature. PCMs are materials that can absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa. By incorporating PCMs into building materials or using them as insulation, you can maintain a consistent temperature inside the building without relying on heaters or air conditioners. For example, you can use PCM-infused walls to absorb heat during the day and release it at night, providing a stable temperature.",
    "Implement passive ventilation: Passive ventilation is a simple yet effective way to regulate indoor temperature without using mechanical systems. By designing buildings with strategic openings and ventilation channels, you can allow natural airflow to enter and exit the building, maintaining a comfortable temperature. This approach can be particularly effective in areas with mild climates, as it allows for the natural temperature fluctuations to be utilized for ventilation.",
    "Develop a thermal mass system: Thermal mass is a material that can absorb and release heat energy, helping to regulate indoor temperature. By incorporating thermal mass into building design, you can create a passive cooling system that can maintain a consistent temperature. For example, you can use thermal mass walls that absorb heat during the day and release it at night, providing a stable temperature.",
    "Use evaporative cooling: Evaporative cooling is a natural cooling method that can be used to regulate indoor temperature without relying on mechanical systems. By using a combination of water and a porous material, such as a sponge or a cloth, you can create a cooling system that absorbs heat from the air and releases it as water vapor. This"
