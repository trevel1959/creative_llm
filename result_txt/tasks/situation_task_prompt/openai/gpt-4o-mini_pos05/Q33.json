    "**Biological Clocks**: Utilize the human body's natural rhythms to keep track of time. For instance, people could rely on their internal circadian rhythms, which dictate sleep-wake cycles, to create a daily schedule. Engaging in activities such as eating, exercising, and socializing at regular intervals can help establish a routine based on natural biological cues, such as hunger and energy levels.",
    "**Sound Signals**: Implement a community-based timekeeping system using sound. Different sounds, such as bells, chimes, or horns, can be designated to signal specific times of the day. For example, a bell might ring at dawn to signify the start of the day, while another sound could indicate lunchtime or evening. This auditory method could foster a sense of community as people gather to listen for the time signals.",
    "**Seasonal Calendars**: Create a calendar based on natural seasonal changes. By observing the changing seasons, people can track the passage of time in relation to agricultural cycles, animal behaviors, and natural phenomena. For instance, the blooming of certain flowers or the migration of birds could serve as markers for specific times of the year, helping communities organize their activities accordingly.",
    "**Physical Activity Routines**: Establish time intervals based on physical activities. Communities could create schedules that align with common daily tasks or rituals. For example, people might agree to meet for communal meals at certain intervals (e.g., after three rounds of a specific physical activity) or use the duration of a popular local game to mark the passage of time.",
    "**Environmental Changes**: Use environmental cues to measure time. For instance, changes in temperature, humidity, or the behavior of local wildlife can provide indicators of time passing. Observing when certain animals become active or when specific plants begin to bloom can help people align their activities with the natural world, fostering a deeper connection to their environment."
