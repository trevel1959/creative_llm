Participants could learn and practice these skills in a safe environment before embarking on their real-life journey.",
    "**Sustainable Ocean Exploration:** Develop a project that combines sailing across the Atlantic with scientific research and environmental conservation. For instance, the team could focus on collecting water samples, studying marine life, or monitoring ocean pollution levels. This project would not only contribute to scientific knowledge but also raise awareness about ocean health.",

Each team member could bring their unique cultural background and expertise, contributing to a diverse learning experience. This could involve workshops, presentations, and collaborative projects aimed at fostering understanding and unity among different cultures.",
    "**Digital Documentation and Storytelling:** Utilize advanced technology, such as drones and 360-degree cameras, to document the entire journey in a visually captivating way.
