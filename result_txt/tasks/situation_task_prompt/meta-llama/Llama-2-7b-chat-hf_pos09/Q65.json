    "Use mirrors to reflect natural light: One creative solution to light up a room without lamps or lighting fixtures is to use mirrors to reflect natural light. Place mirrors opposite windows or in areas where sunlight enters the room. This will reflect the light and illuminate the entire space, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere.",
    "Utilize glow-in-the-dark paint: Another innovative idea is to use glow-in-the-dark paint on walls, ceilings, or furniture. This paint absorbs light during the day and emits a soft glow at night, providing ample lighting without any additional sources. This eco-friendly solution is perfect for a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution.",
    "Install LED candles: LED candles are a modern and energy-efficient alternative to traditional candles. They provide a soft, warm glow and can be placed anywhere without the risk of fire or smoke. These candles can be plugged into electrical outlets, providing a convenient and safe lighting solution.",
    "Create a light garden: For a more creative and artistic solution, consider creating a light garden. This involves planting plants or flowers with bioluminescent properties, such as glowing mushrooms or luminous plants. These plants will emit a soft, natural light, illuminating the room without the need for any additional lighting sources.",
    "Harness the power of the sun: If the room receives adequate sunlight during the day, consider using solar-powered lights. These lights are designed to harness the power of the sun and convert it into electricity, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution. They can be placed in windows or on rooftops, providing ample lighting without any additional sources."
