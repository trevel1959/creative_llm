    "**Self-Checkout Integration**: Incorporate a self-checkout feature directly into the shopping cart.

This would reduce wait times at traditional checkout lines and streamline the purchasing process, allowing for a more efficient shopping experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a shopping cart made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Additionally, the cart could feature solar-powered LED lights for visibility in low-light conditions, making it not only eco-friendly but also safer and more practical for evening shopping.",
    "**Interactive Shopping List Display**: Install a touchscreen display on the shopping cart that allows users to input their shopping list and check off items as they find them. The display could also suggest recipes based on selected ingredients or offer promotional discounts on items within the store, enhancing customer engagement and encouraging impulse purchases.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Handle**: Design a shopping cart with an adjustable handle that can change height to accommodate users of different statures, making it more comfortable for everyone. The handle could also feature grips with different textures for better handling, and the cart could be equipped with a built-in cushion for added comfort during long shopping trips.",
    "**Built-in Child Seat and Entertainment System**: Create a shopping cart with a secure, foldable child seat that includes a small entertainment system. This system could have a screen with kid-friendly content, games, or educational videos, keeping children occupied while parents shop. This feature would help parents focus on their shopping while ensuring their child is safe and entertained."
