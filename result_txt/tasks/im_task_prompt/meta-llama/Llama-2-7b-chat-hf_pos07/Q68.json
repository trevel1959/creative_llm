    "Intelligent Calculator: Create a calculator that can not only perform basic arithmetic operations but also provide intelligent suggestions and recommendations based on the user's input. For instance, if a user is trying to calculate a loan amount, the calculator could suggest the best interest rate or repayment plan based on the user's credit score and financial history.",
    "Virtual Calculator: Develop a virtual calculator that can be accessed through a smartwatch or other wearable device. This calculator would allow users to perform calculations on the go, without the need for a physical device. It could also include features such as voice-to-text input, gesture recognition, and integration with other smart devices.",
    "Augmented Reality Calculator: Create an augmented reality calculator that overlays digital calculations onto the real world. Users could hold up their smartphone or tablet to a whiteboard or chalkboard and see the calculations appear in real-time. This would make it easier to collaborate with others and visualize complex calculations.",
    "AI-Powered Calculator: Develop an AI-powered calculator that can learn a user's calculator habits and preferences over time. It could then provide personalized recommendations and shortcuts based on the user's behavior, such as suggesting alternative calculations or providing quicker ways to perform common operations.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface Calculator: Create a calculator that can read brain signals and perform calculations directly from the user's thoughts. This would allow users with disabilities or injuries to perform calculations without the need for physical input. The calculator could use EEG sensors or other brain-computer interface technology to detect brain activity and translate it into calculations."
