    "**Built-in Scanner and Payment System**: Equip shopping carts with a built-in scanner that allows customers to scan items as they shop. This could connect to a mobile app or the store's system, allowing for real-time tracking of the total cost. Once the shopping is complete, customers could simply pay through the cartâ€™s interface, eliminating the need for checkout lines.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Handles**: Redesign shopping carts with adjustable handles that can be modified for height and grip comfort. This would cater to a wider range of users, including children and those with physical disabilities. Additionally, the cart could feature a lightweight frame and larger wheels for easier maneuverability.",
    "**Integrated Shopping List Holder**: Create a dedicated compartment on the shopping cart for holding a digital or physical shopping list. This could be a small tablet-like device that syncs with the store's inventory system, allowing users to check off items as they shop. It could also suggest recipes based on the items in the cart or alert users if they are missing ingredients.",
    "**Child-Friendly Seating and Entertainment**: Add a secure, comfortable seat for children with built-in entertainment options like a small screen with educational games or stories. This would keep children occupied while parents shop, making the experience more enjoyable for both parties. The seat could also have safety harnesses and storage for toys or snacks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cart Materials**: Innovate shopping carts made from sustainable, biodegradable materials or recycled plastics. The design could include features that promote environmental awareness, such as a built-in recycling bin for packaging waste or a section for reusable bags. Additionally, each cart could have a QR code that links to the store's sustainability initiatives."
