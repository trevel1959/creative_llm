    "**Eternal Consequences**: With the ability to stop aging, humanity would be faced with unprecedented population growth. This would put a strain on resources, infrastructure, and the environment. Governments would need to reevaluate their policies on population control, resource allocation, and urban planning. The concept of retirement, social security, and pension plans would become obsolete. People would continue to work and contribute to society indefinitely, leading to a potential workforce crisis. On the other hand, this could also lead to a surge in scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and cultural achievements, as the accumulation of knowledge and experience would continue to grow exponentially.",

Scientists would focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of aging, leading to breakthroughs in disease prevention, treatment, and cure. However, this would also raise concerns about the ethics of immortality, as individuals might be able to manipulate their bodies to achieve an unnatural state of youth and vitality. This could lead to a new class of \"superhumans\" with significant social and economic advantages.",
