    "**Weather for Agriculture**: Use your power to control the weather to ensure optimal conditions for farming. You could create perfect growing seasons in regions that are normally too harsh or too mild, leading to an increase in food production. This could also involve creating custom climates for different types of crops, allowing for year-round farming in diverse locations.",
    "**Disaster Mitigation**: Control the weather to prevent natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires. For example, you could divert paths of hurricanes, increase rainfall in drought-stricken areas, or reduce the intensity of wildfires by controlling the wind direction and speed.",
    "**Climate Engineering**: Use your ability to manipulate the climate to help mitigate the effects of global warming. You might cool down regions that are overheating, or adjust the distribution of heat around the world to more evenly distribute temperature zones, potentially alleviating the effects of climate change on various ecosystems.",
    "**Climatic Tourism**: Create a variety of climate-controlled environments across different regions, each offering unique climatic experiences. This could include areas where it's always winter, others where it's perpetually summer, or places with constant spring-like conditions. This would allow people to experience different climates without the need to travel far.",
    "**Weather-Driven Entertainment**: Design large-scale events that rely on specific weather conditions. For instance, create concerts or festivals that require rain to occur, or organize sports events that only happen during a snowstorm. This could revolutionize entertainment, making it a function of the weather, and could potentially attract large crowds seeking out these unique experiences. "
