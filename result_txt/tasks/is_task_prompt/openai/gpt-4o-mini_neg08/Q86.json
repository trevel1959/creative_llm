    "Once in a vibrant jungle, there lived an elephant named Elara who had a peculiar condition: she forgot everything she learned the moment she turned around. One day, she decided to embark on a journey to find her memories. Along the way, she met a wise old tortoise who taught her the importance of writing things down. With newfound determination, Elara began to sketch her adventures in the mud with her trunk. Each time she returned to her favorite spots, the drawings reminded her of the joy she experienced. Though she still forgot, she learned that memories could be captured in many ways.",
