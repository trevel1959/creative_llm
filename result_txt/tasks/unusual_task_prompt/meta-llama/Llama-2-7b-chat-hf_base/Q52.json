    "Smart Matchbox: Create a matchbox that uses AI to recognize the user's hand movements and adjust the size and position of the matches accordingly. This would make it easier to strike the matches and reduce the chances of burns. The AI could also detect the user's mood and adjust the lighting accordingly, creating a more personalized experience.",
    "Matchbox with Built-In Lighter: Design a matchbox with a built-in lighter that uses a small LED light to illuminate the area around the matches, making it easier to strike them. This would be especially useful in dark environments or for people with vision impairments.",
    "Shape-Shifting Matchbox: Create a matchbox that can change its shape and size depending on the user's needs. For example, the box could expand to hold more matches when needed, or contract to make it easier to carry. This would be a convenient and space-saving solution for people who use matches frequently.",
    "Interactive Matchbox: Design a matchbox with interactive elements, such as buttons or sensors, that allow the user to control the lighting of the matches. For example, the user could press a button to adjust the brightness of the light or change the color of the flame. This would add an extra layer of functionality to the matchbox and make it more engaging to use.",
    "Sustainable Matchbox: Create a matchbox made from sustainable materials, such as recycled cardboard or bioplastics. This would reduce the environmental impact of the matchbox and promote sustainability. Additionally, the matchbox could be designed with a compostable or biodegradable match head, making it a more eco-friendly option for outdoor use."
