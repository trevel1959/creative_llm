    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Design the laundry basket with a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes UV-C light to disinfect and eliminate odors from the basket. This would ensure that the basket remains hygienic and free from bacteria, especially in households with pets or children.",
    "**Integrated Scale and App Connection**: Incorporate a digital scale at the bottom of the laundry basket that weighs the clothes as they are added. This feature could connect to a mobile app, providing users with information on the total weight of laundry, estimated washing machine settings, and reminders for when to do laundry based on usage patterns.",
    "**Foldable and Portable Design**: Create a foldable laundry basket that can be easily collapsed for storage or transportation. This would be particularly useful for college students or those living in small apartments, allowing them to carry laundry to communal washing areas without the bulk of a traditional basket.",
    "**Multi-Functional Compartments**: Design the basket with multiple compartments that can be customized for various laundry needs. For instance, one section could be for delicates, another for regular clothes, and a third for items that need special care, such as dry-clean-only garments. This would help users manage their laundry more effectively.",
    "**Built-in Dryer Functionality**: Innovate a laundry basket that includes a built-in drying mechanism, such as a gentle heating element or a fan, that can dry small items like socks or undergarments. This would allow users to quickly dry essentials without needing to run a full laundry cycle."
