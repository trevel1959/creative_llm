    "**DIY Stencil Maker**: The tip of a pen can be used to create custom stencils for arts and crafts. By dipping the pen tip in paint or ink and then rolling it on a piece of cardboard or plastic, you can create unique patterns and designs. This method is particularly useful for scrapbooking, card making, or creating wall art.",
    "**Portable Phone Stand**: By removing the clip from a pen and bending it into a stand shape, you can create a simple and portable phone holder. This allows you to prop your phone up for hands-free viewing of videos or video calls, making it a great accessory for travel or office use.",
    "**Emergency Lock Pick**: In a pinch, a pen can serve as an improvised lock pick. By carefully removing the ink cartridge and using the metal tip, you can manipulate the locking mechanism of a simple door lock. This should only be done in emergencies and with permission, but it highlights the versatility of everyday objects.",
    "**Unique Musical Instrument**: A pen can be transformed into a makeshift flute or wind instrument. By covering one end and blowing into the hollow tube while covering different holes along the length of the pen, you can create various notes and melodies. This is a fun and creative way to explore music-making without needing a traditional instrument.",
    "**Stylus for Touch Screens**: If you find yourself in need of a stylus for your tablet or smartphone, a pen can easily be adapted for this purpose. By wrapping a small piece of conductive material (like aluminum foil) around the tip of the pen, you can create a DIY stylus that allows for precise touch input on screens."
