    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Develop and distribute solar-powered lanterns that can provide a reliable source of light during the day. These lanterns could be equipped with rechargeable batteries and LED bulbs, making them an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution.",
    "Smart Windows: Invent a special type of window glass that can harness the sun's energy during the day and release it at night, providing a consistent and controlled source of light. This technology could be integrated into buildings and homes, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Genetically engineer plants to produce a soft, diffused light during the day. This could be achieved by introducing genes that enhance the plant's chlorophyll content, allowing it to absorb more light and emit a gentle glow. These light-emitting plants could be used to illuminate gardens, parks, and other outdoor spaces.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a network of cloud-based lighting systems that can be controlled and managed remotely. These systems could use a combination of LED lights and drones to create a flexible and scalable lighting solution that can be deployed in various locations.",
    "Bio-Luminescent Clothing: Design clothing that incorporates bio-luminescent materials, allowing the wearer to emit a soft, ambient light. This technology could be used for both practical and fashionable purposes, providing a sustainable and stylish lighting solution for everyday use."
