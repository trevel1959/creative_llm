    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Equip televisions with AR capabilities that allow viewers to project additional content into their living space. For example, while watching a nature documentary, users could see 3D models of animals or ecosystems in their room. This feature could enhance educational content, making learning more immersive and engaging.",
    "**Adaptive Viewing Environment**: Develop a system where the television can adjust the room's lighting and sound based on the content being viewed. For instance, if a horror movie is playing, the lights could dim and the sound could be adjusted to create a more intense atmosphere. This could be achieved through smart home integration, allowing the TV to communicate with smart bulbs and speakers.",
    "**Personalized Content Recommendations**: Utilize advanced algorithms to analyze viewers' preferences and moods in real-time. The television could suggest content based on the time of day, the viewer's emotional state (using facial recognition technology), or even the weather outside. For example, on a rainy day, it might recommend cozy comedies or feel-good movies.",
    "**Social Viewing Experience**: Create a built-in social feature that allows viewers to watch shows and movies with friends or family remotely. This could include synchronized playback, a chat function, and the ability to share reactions through emojis or video snippets. This feature would enhance the social aspect of watching television, especially for those separated by distance.",
    "**Health Monitoring and Recommendations**: Integrate health-tracking technology that monitors viewers' posture, screen time, and eye strain. The television could provide recommendations for breaks, stretching exercises, or even suggest more active viewing experiences (like dance shows or workout videos) if it detects prolonged sedentary behavior."
