    "Carrier Pigeons: In the absence of phones, people could use carrier pigeons to send messages over long distances. Trained pigeons could be used to carry letters or small notes attached to their legs, which could be received at a designated location. This method would be a slower and more labor-intensive way of communication, but it would provide an alternative to phone calls.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to send messages over long distances. Homing pigeons are trained to return to their home location, and they could be used to carry messages attached to their legs. This method would be faster than traditional carrier pigeons, as homing pigeons are trained to return to their home location quickly.",
    "Mirror Signaling: In the absence of phones, people could use mirrors to signal messages to each other over long distances. By positioning mirrors at strategic locations, messages could be reflected and received at a different location. This method would require a clear line of sight between the mirrors and would be more effective in open areas with minimal obstructions.",
    "Drum Messages: In ancient times, drum messages were used to communicate over long distances. People could use drums to send messages by tapping out a rhythm that represents a message. This method would be slower than modern communication methods but could be an effective way to communicate in areas where there is no other means of communication.",
    "Smoke Signals: In the absence of phones, people could use smoke signals to communicate over long distances. By burning different types of wood or other materials, messages could be conveyed through smoke signals. This method would be slower than modern communication methods but could be an effective way to communicate in areas where there is no other means of communication."
