    "**Eco-Friendly Shower Head**: Design the shower head to be more energy-efficient by reducing water consumption. This could be achieved through a combination of water-saving technology, such as a pressure-sensing system that uses less water when the user doesn't need a strong spray, and an option to turn off the water when lathering up.",
    "**Multi-Functional Shower Head**: Add additional functions to the shower head, such as a built-in handheld shower head, a water-massage feature, or a built-in speaker for playing music or news during the shower. This would provide a more versatile and enjoyable showering experience.",
    "**Aromatherapy Shower Head**: Integrate an aromatherapy system into the shower head, allowing the user to choose from a variety of scents and release them into the water to create a relaxing and rejuvenating atmosphere during the shower.",
    "**Customizable Shower Head**: Offer the option to customize the shower head's design and color, allowing users to personalize their showering experience. This could include interchangeable parts or a color-changing feature.",
    "**Heated Shower Head**: Incorporate heating elements into the shower head to provide a more comfortable showering experience, especially during colder months. The user could control the temperature of the water through a dial or a digital display."
