    "**Self-Rotating Whisk**: Create a self-rotating whisk that automatically spins at adjustable speeds. This would allow for hands-free mixing, freeing up the user's hands to add ingredients or perform other tasks simultaneously. The whisk could have a rechargeable battery and a timer function, so users can set it to mix for a specific duration without worrying about over-mixing.",
    "**Whisk with Interchangeable Heads**: Develop a whisk with interchangeable heads that can easily switch between balloon, flat, and spiral designs. This would allow users to choose the best whisk shape for their specific mixing task, whether it's whipping egg whites, folding in delicate ingredients, or mixing batter. The handle could have a locking mechanism to ensure the heads stay securely in place during use.",
    "**Whisk with a Built-in Measuring Cup**: Innovate a whisk that incorporates a measuring cup into its design. The handle could feature a transparent measuring cup that allows users to pour in liquids while whisking. This design would help streamline the cooking process, making it easier to add ingredients in precise amounts without needing to grab an additional measuring cup.",
    "**Ergonomic Whisk with Vibration Feedback**: Design an ergonomic whisk that fits comfortably in the hand and includes vibration feedback to indicate when the desired consistency has been achieved. For instance, the whisk could vibrate gently when the user has mixed long enough for a specific recipe, ensuring perfect results without the guesswork.",
    "**Color-Changing Whisk**: Create a whisk made from heat-sensitive materials that change color based on the temperature of the mixture being whisked. This would provide a visual cue to users, helping them avoid overheating ingredients like chocolate or butter. For example, the whisk could turn from blue to red as it detects temperatures above a certain threshold, alerting the user to take action."
