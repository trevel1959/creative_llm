    "Floating Islands: Create a series of interconnected floating islands that mimic the structure of coral reefs. Each island would be covered in a variety of plants, including mangroves, seagrasses, and marine flowers, providing a habitat for a diverse range of marine life. The islands would be connected by a network of bridges and walkways, allowing visitors to explore the habitat without disturbing the delicate ecosystem.",
    "Underwater Forest: Design an underwater forest with towering trees that stretch towards the surface, providing a home for a variety of marine animals, including fish, dolphins, and even sea turtles. The forest would be surrounded by a network of underwater caves and tunnels, allowing visitors to explore the habitat from multiple angles.",
    "Ocean Canyon: Create a massive canyon system that runs through the ocean, complete with towering cliffs, deep valleys, and hidden caves. The canyon would be home to a wide variety of marine life, including sharks, rays, and sea turtles. Visitors could explore the canyon through a network of underwater tunnels and observation decks, providing a unique perspective on the ocean's vastness and diversity.",
    "Aquatic City: Design an underwater city that is fully integrated with its surroundings, providing a habitat for a wide variety of marine life. The city would be made up of interconnected domes and buildings, each one designed to mimic the shape and color of the surrounding coral reefs. Visitors could explore the city through a network of underwater tunnels and observation decks, and even interact with the marine life through specialized viewing windows.",
    "Biodome: Create a massive biodome that encloses a vast array of ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and even a simulated Amazon rainforest. The biodome would be home to a wide variety of marine life, including fish, dolphins, and even penguins. Visitors could explore the biodome through a network of underwater tunnels and observation decks, and even interact with the marine life through specialized viewing windows."
