    "**Personal Hoverboard with Magnetic Levitation**: Imagine a hoverboard that uses magnetic levitation technology, allowing it to glide above the ground without friction. This would make travel smoother and faster. The hoverboard could feature smart navigation capabilities, using GPS to help users find the best routes and avoid obstacles. It could also have customizable speed settings, making it suitable for both leisurely rides and quicker commutes.",
    "**Community-Powered Pedal-Powered Trikes**: Create a network of pedal-powered trikes available for communal use in urban areas. These trikes would be designed for two or more passengers and could be rented via an app. Users would pedal to their destination, promoting fitness and reducing emissions. The trikes could have built-in cargo space for carrying items, making them practical for errands or shopping trips.",
    "**Portable Folding Electric Bike**: Introduce a lightweight, portable folding electric bike that can easily fit into a backpack or be carried on public transport. This bike would have a compact design without sacrificing performance, allowing users to navigate city streets with ease. With a powerful battery, it could assist with pedaling on inclines or long distances, making it a versatile option for those who need to switch between biking and other modes of transport.",
    "**Smart Walking Shoes with Navigation**: Design smart walking shoes equipped with GPS and haptic feedback technology. These shoes would guide wearers through vibrations, indicating turns or directions, making it easier to navigate without constantly checking a phone. They could also feature a built-in fitness tracker, encouraging users to walk more while providing data on distance traveled and calories burned.",
    "**Urban Cable Car System**: Envision an aerial cable car system in urban areas that connects key neighborhoods and transit hubs. This system would provide a unique way to travel above traffic, reducing congestion on the streets. Passengers could enjoy scenic views while commuting, and the cable cars could be powered by renewable energy sources. The system could be integrated with existing public transportation, allowing for seamless transfers."
