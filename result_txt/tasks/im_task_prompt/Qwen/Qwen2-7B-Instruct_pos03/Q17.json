    "**Self-Cleaning Washing Machine:** This model is designed with self-cleaning features that reduce the need for manual cleaning after each use. The machine has a built-in ultrasonic cleaner that uses sound waves to remove detergent residues, dirt, and bacteria from the drum. Additionally, there's a smart air circulation system that dries out the drum, preventing mold and mildew growth. This not only extends the lifespan of the washing machine but also enhances its hygienic standards.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Washing Machine with Solar Integration:** This idea combines traditional washing machine functionality with renewable energy sources. The washing machine includes solar panels on its top or sides that can harness sunlight during the day. The energy generated is used to power the machine, reducing reliance on the grid and lowering electricity bills. Moreover, the solar integration can also power a small LED light inside the drum, providing illumination when the door is open at night.",
    "**Wearable Washing Machine with Body Temperature Control:** This wearable device integrates washing functionality into clothing, allowing users to clean their garments on the go without needing a washing machine. It utilizes micro-washing technology, such as sonic vibrations, to clean fabrics gently and efficiently. The device can also monitor body temperature, adjust water temperature accordingly, and even incorporate a deodorizing function to freshen clothes throughout the day.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Washing Machine with Upcycled Materials:** This washing machine is made entirely from upcycled materials, promoting sustainability and reducing waste. The outer casing might be constructed from reclaimed wood or recycled plastic bottles, while the internal components could include recycled metal parts. The machine operates on a closed-loop water recycling system, where used water is treated and reused within the machine, minimizing water consumption. Additionally, it can be designed to accept fabric scraps for recycling, turning them into cleaning agents or other useful products."
