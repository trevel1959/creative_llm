    "**Aquatic-Desert Hybrid Habitat**: This innovative habitat would combine the unique environments of an underwater setting and a desert. It could be designed to mimic the natural conditions of the Great Barrier Reef, but also include features like cacti, sand dunes, and rock formations. Aquatic life such as fish, sea turtles, and marine mammals would live in the water portions while reptiles, insects, and small mammals could inhabit the land. Water would flow through the habitat, creating a natural cycle of water movement and evaporation, which would also help regulate temperature and humidity. Plants like mangroves and seagrasses could provide shade and shelter for the animals.",
    "**Ice-Covered Rainforest**: Inspired by the cold climates of the Arctic and the lush vegetation of tropical rainforests, this habitat would create a unique environment where polar bears and other Arctic animals could coexist with monkeys, parrots, and other tropical creatures. The habitat would feature large ice structures, artificial lakes, and dense vegetation. The use of solar panels would provide energy for maintaining a stable climate, ensuring that the tropical plants can thrive even in freezing temperatures. This would also allow for a diverse range of diets, including plant-based foods and fish caught in the artificial lakes.",
    "**Subterranean Desert**: Designed to resemble a vast underground cave system, this habitat would cater to animals adapted to living in darkness, such as bats, spiders, and certain species of snakes. The space would be divided into various sections, each representing different levels of light exposure and temperature. For example, some areas might simulate the warmth and humidity of a cave entrance, while others could mimic the cooler, darker depths. Water would be provided through a series of underground streams and pools, and plants adapted to low-light conditions would decorate the environment.",
    "**Sky-Dwelling Rainforest**: This habitat would be built high up in the treetops, creating a vertical ecosystem where birds, insects, and other creatures that thrive in forest canopies could flourish. It would consist of interconnected platforms and walkways that mimic the structure of a dense forest. The design would include various levels, each offering different types of habitats suitable for different species, from the dense lower canopy to the more open branches at higher elevations. Wind turbines and solar panels would power the habitat, while rainwater collected from the roof would be used for watering the plants and maintaining the ecosystem's balance.",
