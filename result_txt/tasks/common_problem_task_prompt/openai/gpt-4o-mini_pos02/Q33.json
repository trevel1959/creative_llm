    "**Food Availability**: Finding food can be a significant challenge. The island may have limited flora and fauna. Foraging for edible plants, fruits, and nuts, as well as fishing or trapping small animals, would be essential. Creating a small garden using seeds found in fruits or scavenging for edible insects could also help supplement the diet.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: Exposure to the elements can lead to hypothermia or heatstroke. Building a shelter from natural materials like palm fronds, driftwood, or rocks can provide protection. The shelter should be located away from potential hazards, such as falling branches or flooding from tides, and should be designed to retain warmth or keep cool depending on the climate.",
    "**Health Risks and Injuries**: Without medical supplies, even minor injuries can become serious. Itâ€™s crucial to learn basic first aid techniques and utilize natural remedies from plants on the island. Creating a first aid kit from materials found on the island, such as using aloe vera for burns or certain leaves for wound dressing, can help manage health risks.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: A major concern is the inability to signal for help. Constructing large SOS signs using rocks or logs on the beach can attract the attention of passing ships or planes. Additionally, creating smoke signals by burning green vegetation or making a fire during the day can help increase visibility.",
    "**Mental Health and Loneliness**: The psychological toll of isolation can be severe. To combat loneliness, creating a daily routine can provide structure and purpose. Engaging in creative activities, such as building sculptures from sand or driftwood, or keeping a journal of thoughts and experiences can help maintain mental well-being."
