    "**Aurora Capsule**: The spaceship is designed as a modular, inflatable structure that can be easily transported and deployed in space. The capsule is shaped like a giant, shimmering aurora borealis, with a translucent, glowing exterior that reflects the colors of the aurora. The interior is equipped with advanced life support systems, a state-of-the-art navigation system, and a unique, rotating section that simulates gravity through centrifugal force. The capsule is propelled by a high-efficiency, ion-based propulsion system that allows for fast and efficient travel through space.",
    "**Nebula Navigator**: The spaceship is designed to resemble a stylized, celestial nebula, with a series of interconnected, spherical modules that can be easily connected and disconnected as needed. Each module is equipped with a unique, adaptive technology that allows it to adjust its shape and function to suit the specific needs of the mission. The spaceship is propelled by a cutting-edge, fusion-based propulsion system that generates immense energy and allows for incredible speeds.",
    "**Galactic Ark**: The spaceship is designed as a massive, generation ship that can carry thousands of passengers and crew on a centuries-long journey to a distant star system. The ship is shaped like a giant, sailing vessel, with a series of interconnected, rotating sections that provide artificial gravity through centrifugal force. The ship is equipped with advanced life support systems, a state-of-the-art navigation system, and a unique, self-sustaining ecosystem that can recycle resources and maintain a healthy environment for the passengers and crew.",
    "**Stellar Explorer**: The spaceship is designed as a highly advanced, robotic vessel that can explore the far reaches of the galaxy with incredible precision and accuracy. The ship is shaped like a giant, insect-like creature, with a series of articulated, manipulator arms that can collect and analyze samples from distant planets and celestial bodies. The ship is propelled by a high-efficiency, solar-based propulsion system that allows it to travel vast distances without the need for fuel.",
    "**Cosmic Cathedral**: The spaceship is designed as a massive, celestial cathedral that can serve as a hub for intergalactic travel and exploration. The ship is shaped like a giant, crystalline structure, with a series of interconnected, rotating sections that provide artificial gravity through centrifugal force. The ship is equipped with advanced life support systems, a state-of-the-art navigation system, and a unique, holographic display system that can project stunning, immersive experiences for passengers and crew.
