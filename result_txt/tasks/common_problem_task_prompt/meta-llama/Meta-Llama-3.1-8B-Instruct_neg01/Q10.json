    "**Eco-Friendly Modular Home**: Design a modular home made from recycled shipping containers, repurposed materials, and sustainable building practices. Each module can be customized to fit individual needs, with features like green roofs, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems. The home can be assembled on-site, minimizing waste and environmental impact.",
    "**Smart Home with Biophilic Design**: Create a futuristic home that incorporates biophilic design principles, such as large windows, living walls, and natural materials. The home would be equipped with smart technology, including voice-controlled lighting, temperature, and security systems. The biophilic design would not only improve air quality but also reduce stress and improve mental well-being.",
    "**Sustainable Community Hub**: Design a community center that serves as a hub for sustainable living, featuring a rooftop garden, community kitchen, and educational spaces. The building would be constructed using locally sourced, sustainable materials, and would incorporate energy-efficient systems, such as solar panels and a green roof. The community hub would host workshops, events, and classes on sustainable living, promoting education and community engagement.",
    "**Modular Tiny Home Village**: Develop a village of modular tiny homes, each with its own unique design and features. The homes would be constructed using sustainable materials, with features like composting toilets, rainwater harvesting systems, and solar panels. The village would be designed to promote community interaction, with shared spaces, gardens, and community events.",
    "**Net-Zero Energy Home**: Design a home that produces as much energy as it consumes, using cutting-edge technology and sustainable materials. The home would feature solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems, as well as energy-efficient appliances and insulation. The home would be designed to minimize waste, with features like a greywater system and composting bin. The goal would be to create a net-zero energy home that not only reduces the owner's carbon footprint but also serves as a model for sustainable living.
