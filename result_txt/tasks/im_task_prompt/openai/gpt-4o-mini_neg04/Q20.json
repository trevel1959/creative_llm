    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning function that uses a combination of steam and specialized cleaning pods. After a brewing cycle, the coffee maker would automatically initiate a cleaning process that sanitizes the internal components, removing coffee oils and residues without requiring manual intervention. This would ensure better tasting coffee and prolong the life of the machine.",
    "**Coffee Bean Grinder Integration**: Design a coffee maker that includes a built-in grinder with adjustable grind settings. This feature would allow users to grind fresh beans just before brewing, ensuring maximum flavor and aroma. The grinder could also be programmed to dispense the exact amount of coffee grounds needed for the selected brew size, minimizing waste and enhancing convenience.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a modular coffee maker where users can swap out components based on their brewing preferences. For example, users could choose different brewing methods (drip, French press, pour-over) by attaching various brewing modules. This design would allow coffee enthusiasts to experiment with different styles and flavors without needing multiple machines.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Efficiency**: Develop a coffee maker made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and biodegradable components. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient features, such as an automatic shut-off after a certain period of inactivity and a low-energy brewing mode. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the overall carbon footprint of coffee consumption.",
    "**Flavor Infuser**: Add a flavor infusion chamber that allows users to add herbs, spices, or flavoring syrups directly into the brewing process. This chamber could be adjustable, allowing users to control the intensity of the flavor infusion. For instance, adding cinnamon sticks or vanilla pods would create unique and personalized coffee blends, making each cup a special experience."
