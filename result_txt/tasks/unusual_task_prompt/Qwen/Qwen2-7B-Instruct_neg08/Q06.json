    "**Create a 'Jealousy Journal'**: This journal can be used to track your feelings of jealousy when you hear about others' accomplishments. It's not about suppressing these feelings but acknowledging them and understanding what triggers them. You could write down why you feel jealous, how it makes you feel, and any lessons or motivations you derive from it. This can help you understand yourself better and perhaps find ways to motivate yourself without feeling jealous.",
    "**Set a 'Compliment Jar' Challenge**: This is a positive way to deal with envy. Whenever you hear about someone's success, write a compliment about that person on a piece of paper and put it in a jar. Over time, this will fill up with compliments and affirmations that can boost your self-esteem. Additionally, you can occasionally read out some of these compliments when you're feeling down, focusing on the positive aspects of other people's achievements rather than your own inadequacies.",
    "**Mindfulness Meditation for Envy**: Envy can often stem from an imbalance between what we think we deserve and what we see others getting. Mindfulness meditation can help you recognize and acknowledge these thoughts without judgment. Try focusing on breathing deeply while observing your thoughts about others' successes. The goal is not to eliminate the thoughts, but to understand them and move past them without getting caught in negative emotions.",
    "**'Comparison Trap' Workshop**: Organize a workshop where you and your friends discuss common feelings of envy and learn strategies to overcome it. Share personal experiences, read relevant articles, and engage in discussions about the impact of comparison on mental health. This can be a supportive environment where everyone learns together, helping each other develop healthier perspectives on success and accomplishment.",
    "**'Envy Flip' Project**: Pick a skill or area you admire in others and decide to dedicate time to improving that same area in yourself. For example, if you're envious of someone's ability to write compelling stories, start writing regularly yourself. This project turns envy into a positive force by giving you something constructive to do instead of dwelling on what you lack. It also promotes self-improvement and can lead to a sense of accomplishment when you see progress in your chosen area."
