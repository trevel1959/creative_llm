This not only promotes sustainability but also aligns with the growing consumer trend towards ethical and environmentally conscious spending.",
    "**Health Tracking and Wellness Integration**: Integrate health tracking features into the wallet app, allowing users to monitor their physical activity, nutrition, and sleep patterns.
