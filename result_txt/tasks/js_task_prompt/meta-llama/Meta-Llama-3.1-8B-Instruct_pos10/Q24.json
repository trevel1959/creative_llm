    "**Sustainable Energy Harvesting Infrastructure**: The city would have an integrated network of piezoelectric roads, solar panels, and wind turbines to generate clean energy. The piezoelectric roads would harness kinetic energy from vehicles and pedestrian traffic, converting it into electricity. This would reduce the city's reliance on fossil fuels and minimize carbon emissions.",
    "**Smart Water Management System**: The city would feature an advanced water management system that collects, treats, and reuses rainwater and greywater. This would minimize water waste and ensure a consistent supply of clean water for drinking, irrigation, and other non-potable uses. The system would also include sensors and monitoring equipment to detect leaks and optimize water distribution.",
    "**Vertical Farming and Urban Agriculture**: The city would incorporate vertical farming and urban agriculture to provide fresh produce to its residents. This would involve large-scale hydroponic and aeroponic systems, as well as rooftop gardens and community plots. The city would also have a network of green spaces and parks to maintain air quality and provide recreational areas.",
    "**Autonomous Public Transportation System**: The city would have a fully autonomous public transportation system, including self-driving buses, trams, and taxis. This would reduce traffic congestion, minimize emissions, and increase mobility for residents. The system would also be integrated with the city's energy harvesting infrastructure to optimize energy efficiency.",
    "**Holistic Waste Management and Recycling**: The city would have a comprehensive waste management system that prioritizes recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy conversion. This would involve advanced sorting facilities, recycling centers, and composting facilities. The city would also have a network of community recycling programs and education initiatives to promote sustainable practices among residents."
