    "**Interactive 3D Holographic Display**: Instead of a traditional flat screen, create a television that projects 3D holograms into the room. This would allow viewers to experience their favorite shows and movies in a more immersive way. Imagine watching a nature documentary with animals appearing to walk around your living room or a concert where the band seems to be performing right in front of you.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Smart TV**: Design a television made from sustainable materials that features energy-efficient technology. It could have a built-in solar panel for charging, use recycled plastics for its casing, and come with a “green mode” that optimizes energy consumption based on viewing habits. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Sensory Experience**: Integrate sensory elements such as scent, temperature, and even tactile feedback into the viewing experience. For example, while watching a cooking show, the TV could release scents of the dishes being prepared, or while watching a scene set in a snowy landscape, it could cool the room slightly to mimic the temperature.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Equip televisions with AR capabilities that allow viewers to interact with the content in real-time. For instance, while watching a sports game, viewers could see live statistics, player bios, and interactive replays overlaid in their living room, enhancing engagement and understanding of the game.",
    "**Customizable User Interface**: Create a television that allows users to fully customize their interface according to their preferences. This could include adjustable screen layouts, personalized themes, and the ability to create profiles for different family members, each with their own viewing recommendations, apps, and settings."
