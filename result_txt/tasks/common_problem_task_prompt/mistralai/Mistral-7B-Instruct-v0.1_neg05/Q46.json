    "Introducing a smart and integrated transportation system: Develop an advanced digital platform that connects all modes of public transportation in a city, allowing commuters to plan their journeys seamlessly and in real-time. This platform could also provide real-time updates on delays or disruptions, reducing frustration and increasing reliability.",
    "Implementing a bike-sharing program: Create a city-wide bike-sharing program that allows commuters to rent bikes from various stations located throughout the city. This would not only provide an affordable and eco-friendly transportation option but also promote a healthy lifestyle and reduce traffic congestion.",
    "Building a network of electric buses: Invest in a fleet of electric buses that would replace traditional diesel buses. This would reduce air pollution and noise pollution, creating a cleaner and healthier environment for the city's residents.",
    "Implementing a demand-responsive pricing model: Introduce a pricing model that adjusts the cost of public transportation based on demand. This would encourage more people to use public transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and promote sustainable transportation options.",
    "Creating a dedicated public transportation lane: Dedicate a lane on the city's major roads for public transportation vehicles. This would reduce travel time for commuters and improve the reliability of public transportation, encouraging more people to use it."
