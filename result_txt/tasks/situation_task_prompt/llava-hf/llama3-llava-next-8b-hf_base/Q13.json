    "Traditional mail and snail mail could become a main means of communication. People would send letters and postcards instead of sending text and other messages. This would be a more thoughtful and personal way of communication, which can strengthen relationships. ",
    "Use alternative means of communication such as video or voice calls. While video and voice calls would not be as convenient as texting and instant messaging, they would provide an effective way to stay connected with friends and family. Video calls could be done through devices with webcams, and voice calls could be made through landline phones or payphones. ",
    "Using messenger apps on computers or tablets. Many current messenger apps can run on computers and tablets, providing options for communication through these devices. Users would need a way to charge their devices and have internet access, but overall it could be an accessible solution for communication. ",
    "Use traditional methods such as letters, phonebooks, or neighborhood flyers. In the absence of modern communication devices, people might have to rely on old-fashioned methods to connect with their friends and family. People could include their address, phone number, email or even create a bulletin board for messages in the neighborhood. ",
    "Utilize social organizations or networks for communication. Local churches, community centers, or social clubs could become a central hub for people to stay connected. Members can join groups based on shared interests and use them as a means of communication for news and updates. "
