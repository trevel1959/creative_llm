    "**Gesture-Recognizing Mouse**: This innovative mouse would incorporate advanced sensors that can detect hand gestures and movements in addition to traditional button inputs. Users could navigate their computers by waving their hands, making the interface more interactive and less dependent on direct touch. For instance, swiping left or right could scroll through pages, and a double-tap gesture could select text.",
    "**Intuitive Wheel-Free Mouse**: A mouse without a scroll wheel that uses touch-sensitive surfaces instead. Users could move the cursor with one hand while using the other to touch the surface to zoom in or out, switch applications, or perform other functions. This design would cater to users who find scroll wheels awkward or distracting, offering a cleaner, more ergonomic experience.",
    "**Smart Mouse with Voice Control**: Combining voice recognition technology with traditional mouse functionality, this mouse allows users to control their computer with spoken commands. For example, users could say \"scroll down\" or \"open new tab\" to interact with their device without needing to physically move the mouse or press buttons. This would be particularly useful for users with motor disabilities or those who want to minimize physical interaction.",
    "**Health Tracking Mouse**: This mouse would integrate health monitoring features such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and stress detection. It would wirelessly transmit data to a connected smartphone or wearable device, allowing users to monitor their physical state while working at their computer. The mouse could also adjust its sensitivity based on the user's energy level, providing a personalized and adaptive user experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality Mouse**: Using AR technology, this mouse would project virtual interfaces onto the user's desk or in their field of vision. Users could interact with these virtual elements as if they were tangible objects, enhancing productivity and engagement. For example, users could manipulate virtual files or software tools directly, reducing the need for physical clicks and improving efficiency."
