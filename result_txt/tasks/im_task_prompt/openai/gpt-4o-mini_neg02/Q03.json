    "**Multi-Function Oven**: Redesign the microwave to incorporate multiple cooking methods in one appliance, such as convection baking, air frying, and steaming. This would allow users to not only reheat leftovers but also bake, crisp, and steam food, all in a single unit. The user interface could include preset functions for each cooking method, making it versatile and convenient.",
    "**Built-in Food Scanner**: Equip the microwave with a built-in scanner that can analyze the food's weight and composition. This feature would help determine the best cooking time and power level automatically. It could also track nutritional information and offer suggestions for healthier alternatives based on the scanned food items.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Create a microwave that uses sustainable materials and energy-efficient technology. This could include solar-powered options or microwaves that utilize induction heating, which is more energy-efficient than traditional methods. The design could also focus on minimizing plastic components and using recyclable materials.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam and high heat to sanitize the interior of the microwave. Users could activate this feature after cooking, and the microwave would clean itself without the need for harsh chemicals. A built-in odor neutralizer could also help eliminate any lingering smells from previous meals.",
    "**Customizable Interior**: Design a microwave with adjustable shelves and compartments that can be rearranged to accommodate various dish sizes and shapes. This would enhance the appliance's versatility, allowing users to cook larger items or multiple dishes simultaneously without worrying about space constraints."
