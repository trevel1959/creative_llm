    "Lack of resources: Implementing a new government policy often requires additional resources, such as funding, personnel, and infrastructure. If these resources are not available, the implementation of the policy may be delayed or hindered.",
    "Political opposition: Another potential problem is political opposition from different parties or factions within the government. This opposition can lead to delays in the implementation of the policy or even its abandonment altogether.",
    "Inadequate public awareness and education: A new government policy may require significant changes to existing practices or behaviors. However, if the public is not adequately informed or educated about the policy, they may not comply with it, leading to confusion and frustration.",
    "Lack of stakeholder engagement: Engaging with stakeholders, such as businesses, community leaders, and civil society organizations, is crucial when implementing a new government policy. If stakeholders are not involved in the process, they may resist the policy or not comply with it.",
    "Legal challenges: New government policies may face legal challenges, such as court cases or regulatory hurdles, which can delay or even prevent the implementation of the policy."
