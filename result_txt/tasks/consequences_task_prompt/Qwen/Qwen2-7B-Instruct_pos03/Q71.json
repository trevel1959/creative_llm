    "**Economic Shifts**: If immortality was discovered, it would fundamentally alter global economies. Without aging, traditional retirement systems would become obsolete, forcing societies to rethink pension plans, healthcare, and work-life balance. Industries like healthcare and longevity research could boom, while others such as consumer goods and luxury services might see a downturn due to reduced demand from those not expecting to die.",
    "**Psychological Impact on Society**: The concept of time would lose its meaning in a world where death is no longer a universal experience. This could lead to profound psychological impacts. For example, individuals might struggle with existential questions about purpose and legacy since death's role as a catalyst for reflection and achievement would fade away. Societal norms around milestones (like marriage, parenthood, or career advancements) might evolve or be redefined, potentially leading to new forms of community and identity formation.",
    "**Social Dynamics and Relationships**: In an immortal society, long-term relationships could become more complex. Partnerships that once were seen as lifelong commitments might now stretch across centuries, requiring entirely new approaches to intimacy, communication, and conflict resolution. Moreover, the concept of family trees would change, potentially creating new dynamics in inheritance, lineage, and social hierarchies.",
    "**Cultural and Religious Changes**: The discovery of immortality would likely lead to significant shifts in cultural practices and religious beliefs. Traditional views of heaven and hell, life after death, and moral judgments might be reevaluated. New forms of spirituality could emerge, focusing on personal growth, wisdom accumulation, or ethical living over a prolonged period. Cultures might also redefine concepts of heroism, legacy, and the value of individual contributions.",
    "**Environmental and Resource Management**: An immortal population would place unprecedented demands on resources and the environment. Conservation efforts might become even more critical as the need for sustainable practices ensures resources are available for future generations. There could be increased focus on technological solutions to manage waste, harness renewable energy, and create self-sustaining environments. This might also drive innovation in space exploration and colonization, as humanity seeks to expand beyond Earth to ensure survival in the face of resource depletion."
