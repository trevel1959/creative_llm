    "**Blockchain-based Access Control System**: Utilize blockchain technology to create an immutable, decentralized access control system. This system would maintain a secure, distributed ledger of all user credentials and permissions. The advantage here is that any unauthorized access attempts or changes in access rights would be immediately visible across the network, allowing for quick response and mitigation. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) because it leverages a proven, innovative technology with strong security properties.",
    "**Machine Learning-driven Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms to monitor network traffic patterns and detect anomalies indicative of potential cyber threats. This system could learn from historical data to identify normal operational behaviors and flag deviations as suspicious activities. The confidence score for this idea is medium-high (0.85), as while machine learning shows great promise in cybersecurity, its effectiveness can vary based on the quality of training data and the sophistication of the attacks.",
    "**Multi-factor Authentication with Biometrics**: Integrate multi-factor authentication methods, such as biometric verification, into the login process. This could include fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice analysis, which adds an additional layer of security by requiring multiple forms of identification. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) due to the increasing popularity and reliability of biometric technologies in enhancing security measures.",
    "**Phishing Resistance Training Program**: Develop a comprehensive program aimed at educating employees about phishing tactics and how to avoid falling victim to them. This could involve regular training sessions, interactive simulations, and gamification elements to engage employees effectively. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) since employee education is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, especially considering the rise of social engineering attacks.",
    "**Zero Trust Network Architecture**: Adopt a zero trust network architecture, which assumes that all network traffic is potentially malicious until proven otherwise. This approach involves continuously verifying the identity and legitimacy of users and devices accessing the network. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) because it aligns well with modern cybersecurity trends and can significantly enhance the security posture of an organization. "
