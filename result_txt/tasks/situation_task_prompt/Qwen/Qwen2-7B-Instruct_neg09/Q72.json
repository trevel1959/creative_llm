    "**Underwater Retreats**: Imagine a luxurious underwater hotel or resort that allows guests to experience the beauty of the ocean while still enjoying the comforts of a traditional vacation spot. The design could include large windows for breathtaking views, and amenities like underwater restaurants, bars, and recreational facilities. Guests could also participate in activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling, and marine conservation efforts.",
    "**Sky Villas**: In the event of beach disappearance, people might find solace in high-altitude living spaces. Sky villas could be constructed on the tops of mountains or tall buildings, offering panoramic views of valleys, forests, or cityscapes. These villas could incorporate green roofs, hydroponic gardens, and renewable energy sources to create an eco-friendly retreat. Additionally, they could feature large outdoor terraces with seating areas, infinity pools, and observatories for stargazing.",
    "**Desert Oasis**: If beaches were no longer an option, one could seek refuge in a lush oasis within a desert environment. This could involve creating a self-sustainable ecosystem with water harvesting systems, vertical farming, and a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational activities. The oasis could include botanical gardens, walking trails, swimming pools, and even artificial beaches made from sand imported from other regions.",
    "**Ice Hotels and Resorts**: For those who prefer colder climates, ice hotels and resorts offer a unique and serene experience. These structures are built entirely from ice and snow, often using recycled materials. They can include guest rooms, dining areas, and even ice sculptures and art galleries. Guests could participate in activities like ice skating, snowshoeing, and dog sledding, and the hotels often have a limited stay due to the fragility of the ice structures.",
    "**Virtual Reality Beaches**: In the digital age, it's possible to create immersive virtual reality environments that simulate the experience of being at a beautiful beach. These VR experiences could include realistic soundscapes, interactive elements (like building sandcastles), and even social features allowing users to interact with friends and family remotely. High-end VR setups could provide a highly realistic and engaging experience, making it feel like you're actually at the beach, even if it doesn't physically exist."
