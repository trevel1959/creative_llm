    "Energy Ball: The new type of energy would be a small, spherical ball that can be carried around like a mobile phone. When needed, the user can press a button on the ball to release a burst of energy, which can be used to power electronic devices, light up a room, or even power a car for a short distance. The ball can be charged using a solar panel or a wall outlet.",
    "Energy Paint: The new type of energy would be a special paint that can be applied to surfaces. Once applied, the paint would generate a small amount of energy that can be used to power small devices or provide a small amount of light. The paint would be made of a combination of nanotechnology and bioluminescence, making it safe and environmentally friendly.",
    "Energy Bubble: The new type of energy would be a transparent bubble that can be used to power small devices or provide a small amount of light. The bubble would be filled with a gas that generates a small amount of energy when heated, which can be used to power the device or light up the room. The bubble can be charged using a solar panel or a wall outlet.",
    "Energy Belt: The new type of energy would be a flexible belt that can be worn around the waist. The belt would have a small panel on the back that can be used to charge electronic devices or power small appliances. The belt would be made of a combination of solar panels and a special type of battery that can store energy for long periods of time.",
    "Energy Shoes: The new type of energy would be a pair of shoes that have small panels on the soles. When the user walks, the panels generate a small amount of energy that can be used to power electronic devices or provide a small amount of light. The shoes would be made of a combination of solar panels and a special type of battery that can store energy for long periods of time."
