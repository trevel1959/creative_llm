    "**Smart Water Bottle with Integrated Air Quality Monitor**: Design a water bottle with a built-in air quality monitor that tracks pollutants and allergens in the air. The bottle would have a small sensor that detects particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This data would be transmitted to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing them to monitor their surroundings and receive alerts when the air quality is poor. The bottle would also have a color-changing LED that indicates the air quality, providing a visual cue for users to take action.",
    "**Edible Water Bottle Made from Plant-Based Materials**: Create a water bottle made from edible, plant-based materials that are compostable and biodegradable. The bottle would be made from a combination of plant-based bioplastics and natural fibers, such as cornstarch, sugarcane, or potato starch. This innovative material would not only reduce plastic waste but also provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for consumers. The bottle would be designed to be fully compostable, reducing the environmental impact of single-use plastics.",
    "**Smart Water Bottle with Built-in UV Water Purification**: Design a water bottle with a built-in UV water purification system that uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. The bottle would have a small UV light source that is activated when the user opens the bottle, ensuring that the water is purified and safe to drink. This feature would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, or individuals who rely on questionable water sources.",
    "**Water Bottle with Integrated Plant Growth System**: Create a water bottle that doubles as a mini indoor garden. The bottle would have a built-in planter and a hydroponic system that allows users to grow their favorite herbs or microgreens. The bottle would have a self-watering system that ensures the plants receive the right amount of moisture, and the bottle would be designed to maximize plant growth and minimize maintenance.",
    "**Smart Water Bottle with Personalized Hydration Tracking**: Design a water bottle that tracks the user's hydration levels and provides personalized recommendations for optimal hydration. The bottle would have a built-in sensor that monitors the user's water intake and sends data to a companion app, which would provide insights on the user's hydration status, recommend daily water intake goals, and offer personalized tips for staying hydrated. The bottle would also have a gamification feature that rewards users for meeting their hydration goals. [/"
