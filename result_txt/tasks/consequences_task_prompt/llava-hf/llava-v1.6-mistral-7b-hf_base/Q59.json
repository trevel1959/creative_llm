    "Overworked Employers: Employers might struggle to adapt to a workforce filled with highly intelligent individuals. They might struggle to manage or assign tasks to individuals based on their skills, and this could lead to an increase in job insecurity and dissatisfaction.",
    "Overwhelming Information Overload: The sheer volume of information and ideas generated by a society of geniuses could lead to information overload, making it difficult for individuals to sift through and find relevant information. This could result in decreased productivity and increased stress levels.",
    "Inequality: Even with widespread intelligence, there would still be disparities in wealth and access to resources. Those who are already wealthy and well-connected would have an even greater advantage, leading to a widening wealth gap.",
    "Loneliness and Isolation: While everyone would be intelligent on paper, emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills would still be essential for maintaining healthy relationships. In a world of geniuses, those who lack strong social skills may struggle to form meaningful connections with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.",
    "Decreased Creative Innovation: While intelligence alone does not guarantee creativity, a society of geniuses could lead to a homogenization of ideas and a stifling of innovation. Without differing perspectives and opinions, progress and discovery could come to a halt."
