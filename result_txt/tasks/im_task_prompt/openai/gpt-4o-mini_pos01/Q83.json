    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Redesign shopping carts using biodegradable and recycled materials. This initiative would not only reduce plastic waste but also promote sustainability. Additionally, carts could be made from materials that can decompose or be recycled after their lifespan, minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular shopping cart that can be easily reconfigured based on the shopping needs. For example, it could transform from a standard cart to a basket or a trolley with adjustable compartments. This would cater to different shopping scenarios, such as quick trips or large grocery hauls.",
    "**Automated Navigation System**: Incorporate an automated navigation system using sensors and cameras that can guide the cart through the store. The cart could help users find items on their shopping list by providing directions and even avoiding crowded areas, enhancing the shopping experience.",
    "**Personalized Shopping Assistant**: Develop a cart that connects to a mobile app, allowing users to create shopping lists, receive personalized deals, and track their spending. The cart could also remember past purchases and suggest similar items or alternatives, helping users make informed decisions.",
    "**Built-in Child Seat and Entertainment System**: Redesign the cart to include a safe, foldable child seat with an entertainment system. The seat would allow parents to securely place their children while shopping, and the entertainment system could feature educational games or videos to keep kids engaged, making the shopping experience more enjoyable for families."
