    "Solar-Powered Flashlight: Create a flashlight that harnesses the power of the sun to provide light, eliminating the need for batteries or charging. The flashlight could have a built-in solar panel that captures sunlight during the day and stores it in a rechargeable battery, which can be used to power the flashlight at night. This innovative design not only reduces waste and environmental impact but also provides a reliable and sustainable source of light.",
    "Smart Flashlight with Augmented Reality Capabilities: Develop a flashlight that incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to project digital information onto surfaces or objects in their surroundings. This could include virtual guides, wayfinding information, or even interactive games. The flashlight could use a combination of sensors and projectors to create an immersive AR experience, enhancing the user's environment and providing a unique and engaging way to interact with their surroundings.",
    "Portable Flashlight with Built-In Power Bank: Design a flashlight that not only provides light but also serves as a portable power bank, allowing users to charge their devices on the go. The flashlight could have a built-in rechargeable battery and USB ports, allowing users to charge their phones, tablets, or other devices while in the dark. This would be particularly useful for campers, hikers, or travelers who need to stay connected and powered up during their adventures.",
    "Bike Light with Built-In Safety Features: Create a flashlight designed specifically for cyclists, with built-in safety features to increase visibility and reduce the risk of accidents. The flashlight could have a bright LED light that is visible from all angles, as well as a built-in sensor that detects oncoming traffic and adjusts the light's beam accordingly. Additionally, the flashlight could have a reflective strip that provides extra visibility when the cyclist is moving at high speeds.",
    "Waterproof Flashlight for Underwater Exploration: Design a flashlight that is specifically designed for underwater exploration, allowing divers and snorkelers to illuminate their surroundings without worrying about the device malfunctioning in the water. The flashlight could be made with waterproof materials and have a specialized l"
