    "Virtual Carpet Cleaning Service: Create a virtual carpet cleaning service that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to virtually clean carpets. Customers can use a smartphone app to scan their carpet, and the app will superimpose a virtual cleaning process on top of the real-world carpet. The app will then provide a virtual demonstration of the cleaning process, complete with step-by-step instructions and a virtual cleaning team that will guide the customer through the process.",
    "Carpet-based VR Experiences: Develop a VR experience that utilizes the carpet as a platform for immersive storytelling. The carpet would be designed with different textures, colors, and patterns that would come to life in the VR environment. Users would be able to walk on the carpet and interact with the virtual environment, creating a more immersive and engaging experience.",
    "Smart Carpet Sensors: Create a line of smart carpet sensors that can detect and monitor various factors such as foot traffic, temperature, and humidity. These sensors would provide real-time data to a smartphone app, which could then use this information to adjust the carpet's cleaning schedule, temperature, and humidity levels for optimal cleanliness and comfort.",
    "Carpet-based Exercise Equipment: Design a carpet that incorporates exercise equipment, such as resistance bands, into its design. Users could exercise while walking or running on the carpet, providing a fun and engaging workout experience. The carpet could also include sensors that track the user's progress and provide feedback on their workout.",
    "Interactive Carpet Games: Create a line of interactive carpet games that use the carpet as a platform for gaming. The games could include puzzles, mazes, and other interactive challenges that users could solve by walking on the carpet.
