    "Pollination and seed dispersal would be impacted: Many plants rely on insects to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds. Without insects, these plants would have a harder time reproducing and spreading their seeds, which could lead to a decline in plant diversity.",
    "Ecosystems would be out of balance: Insects play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Without them, ecosystems would be thrown out of balance, which could lead to a decline in biodiversity and potentially even collapse.",
    "Agricultural practices would be severely impacted: Insects are often used as natural pest control in agriculture. Without them, farmers would have to rely on chemical pesticides, which could have negative environmental and health impacts.",
    "The loss of natural pest control could lead to a rise in pest populations: Without insects to control them, pest populations could explode, leading to increased crop damage and the need for more aggressive pest control measures.",
    "The impact on human health could be significant: Insects are responsible for the transmission of many diseases, including malaria and dengue. Without them, the risk of these diseases could decrease, leading to improved public health."
