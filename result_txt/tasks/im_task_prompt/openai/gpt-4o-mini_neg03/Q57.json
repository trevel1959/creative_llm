    "**Integrated Gesture Control**: Enhance the functionality of the mouse by integrating gesture control capabilities. Users could perform specific hand movements above the mouse to execute commands, such as swiping to scroll or pinching to zoom. This would provide a more intuitive interaction method and reduce the need for excessive clicking, making navigation smoother and more fluid.",
    "**Multi-Device Switching**: Develop a mouse that can seamlessly switch between multiple devices with the push of a button. This could be particularly useful for users who work across different computers, tablets, and smartphones. The mouse could have built-in Bluetooth and USB connectivity, allowing users to toggle between devices without the hassle of reconnecting each time.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Features**: Implement haptic feedback in the mouse to provide tactile responses during use. For example, when a user clicks on a link or hovers over an interactive element, the mouse could provide a slight vibration or resistance, simulating the sensation of a physical button press. This could enhance the user experience, making interactions feel more engaging and responsive.",
    "**Customizable LED Lighting**: Create a mouse with customizable RGB LED lighting that allows users to personalize their setup. Users could choose colors, patterns, and effects that match their workspace or mood. Additionally, the lighting could change based on notifications or system alerts, providing visual cues that keep users informed without interrupting their workflow.",
    "**Built-in Health Monitoring**: Introduce a mouse that tracks the user's hand movements and posture to promote healthier usage habits. The mouse could feature sensors that detect repetitive strain or awkward wrist angles and provide real-time feedback via a connected app. It could also remind users to take breaks or perform hand exercises, encouraging a healthier approach to computer work."
