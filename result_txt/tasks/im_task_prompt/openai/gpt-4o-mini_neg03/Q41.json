    "**Adjustable Deck Width**: Design a skateboard with an adjustable deck that can change width based on the rider's preference or riding style. By using a simple mechanism that expands or contracts the board, riders could choose a wider deck for stability while cruising or a narrower one for tricks. This feature would cater to both beginners and advanced skaters, providing a customizable experience that adapts to various skill levels.",
    "**Built-in LED Lights**: Equip the skateboard with customizable LED lights along the underside and wheels. Riders could choose different colors and patterns through an app, enhancing visibility during night rides and allowing for creative expression. The lights could also flash or change based on speed, providing a fun visual cue for both the rider and spectators.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Create a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This skateboard would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote a message of sustainability within the skating community. Additionally, the production process could be designed to minimize waste and carbon footprint, making it a more responsible choice for riders.",
    "**Integrated Safety Gear**: Develop a skateboard that includes integrated safety gear, such as knee and elbow pads that can be attached or detached from the board itself. These pads could be designed to blend seamlessly with the skateboardâ€™s aesthetic, providing convenience for riders who may forget or dislike wearing traditional safety gear. This would encourage safer riding practices, especially among beginners.",
    "**Self-Stabilizing Technology**: Implement gyroscopic sensors and self-stabilizing technology to create a skateboard that can balance itself. This would help beginners learn to ride without the fear of falling and could also assist more experienced riders in performing tricks. The technology could be powered by rechargeable batteries, and the skateboard could feature an app that tracks learning progress and offers tips for improvement."
