    "**Economic Shifts**: The healthcare industry would undergo a massive transformation. With the elimination of diseases, hospitals might see a decline in patient numbers, leading to job losses in healthcare. Conversely, there could be a surge in industries focused on wellness, preventative care, and longevity, shifting economic resources and creating new markets around mental health, lifestyle optimization, and personalized medicine.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Genetic Engineering**: If all diseases were cured, society might turn its focus to genetic enhancements and modifications. This could lead to ethical dilemmas surrounding the “perfect” human being, with potential discrimination against those who choose not to enhance their genetics. The concept of natural selection might evolve, as people could choose traits for their children, leading to societal divides based on genetic modifications.",
    "**Cultural Identity Changes**: Many cultures have traditions and practices rooted in dealing with illness, healing, and care for the sick. The complete eradication of diseases could lead to a loss of these cultural identities and practices. Societies may need to redefine what it means to care for one another, leading to a potential cultural void and a search for new forms of community bonding and support.",
    "**Shift in Psychological Health**: The removal of physical diseases might lead to an increased focus on mental health issues. As people live longer and healthier lives, the pressures of existential crises, identity, and purpose may become more pronounced. Society might see a rise in mental health disorders, requiring new approaches to therapy and support systems to help individuals cope with the challenges of a prolonged life.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With a growing population living longer, the demand for resources would escalate, potentially leading to environmental degradation. Increased agricultural output to feed the population could result in deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and higher carbon emissions. Society would need to innovate in sustainable practices to balance human needs with environmental conservation."
