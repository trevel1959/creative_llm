    "**Hyperloop Integration**: Implement Hyperloop technology in the city's public transportation system, connecting major hubs and suburbs at high speeds, reducing travel time, and increasing efficiency. This could involve constructing Hyperloop tubes alongside existing roads or even using existing rail infrastructure. This would not only revolutionize the way people travel but also create a sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation network.",
    "**Smart Bus System**: Develop a smart bus system that utilizes AI-powered navigation, real-time traffic updates, and dynamic route optimization. This would enable buses to adapt to changing traffic conditions, reducing congestion and travel times. Additionally, passengers could use a mobile app to track bus locations, plan their routes, and even hail a bus when needed.",
    "**Elevated Pedestrian Walkways**: Construct elevated walkways above existing roads, providing a safe and efficient way for pedestrians to navigate the city. These walkways could be designed with green roofs, incorporating vegetation and public art, making them visually appealing and environmentally friendly. This would not only reduce pedestrian-vehicle conflicts but also create a unique urban experience.",
    "**Autonomous Vehicle-Sharing**: Introduce a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) service that uses self-driving cars to transport passengers within the city. This would reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, decreasing congestion and emissions. AVs could be summoned through a mobile app, and passengers could track their journey in real-time.",
    "**Underground Tunnels**: Build a network of underground tunnels for public transportation, reducing the need for surface-level infrastructure and minimizing visual impact on the cityscape. These tunnels could be designed with advanced ventilation systems, ensuring a comfortable and healthy environment for passengers. This would also enable the city to reclaim surface-level space for parks, green spaces, or other community uses. [/INST] "
