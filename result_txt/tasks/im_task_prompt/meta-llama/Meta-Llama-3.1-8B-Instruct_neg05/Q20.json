    "**Smart Coffee Maker with Mood-Sensing Technology**: Design a coffee maker that can detect the user's emotions through a built-in emotional intelligence system. Using facial recognition and voice analysis, the coffee maker can adjust the brew strength, flavor, and even the coffee beans used to create a customized cup of coffee that matches the user's mood. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the coffee maker can brew a stronger, more energizing coffee. If the user is feeling relaxed, it can brew a smoother, more calming coffee.",
    "**Coffee-Infused Artisanal Creations**: Develop a line of artisanal coffee-based products that combine the richness of coffee with the creativity of art. These products could include coffee-glazed chocolates, coffee-infused jams, coffee-based sauces for ice cream or pancakes, and even coffee-scented candles. Each product would be carefully crafted to highlight the unique flavors and aromas of specialty coffee beans.",
    "**Coffee-Maker-In-A-Box**: Create a compact, portable coffee maker that can be easily taken on-the-go.

    "**Coffee-Based Wellness Products**: Develop a line of wellness products that harness the benefits of coffee for a healthier lifestyle. These products could include coffee-based skincare products, coffee-infused supplements, and even coffee-based probiotics. Each product would be carefully formulated to take advantage of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of coffee.",
    "**Coffee-Maker-Phone Hybrid**: Design a coffee maker that doubles as a smartphone dock. This device would allow users to charge their phone while brewing a fresh cup of coffee.
