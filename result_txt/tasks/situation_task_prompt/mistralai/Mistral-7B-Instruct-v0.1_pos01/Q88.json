    "I would travel by foot: If all roads become impassable, the only way to travel would be on foot. This means that I would need to find alternative routes to my destination that do not involve roads. This could be challenging, but it would also be an opportunity to explore new areas and discover hidden gems.",
    "I would travel by bike: Another option would be to travel by bike. Bikes can navigate through most obstacles and can be a great way to get around. It would be important to find bike paths or routes that are safe and accessible.",
    "I would travel by boat: If the roads are impassable, it may be possible to travel by boat. This would require finding a body of water that leads to the destination, but it could be a fun and unique way to travel.",
    "I would travel by helicopter: If the roads are impassable, a helicopter could be a great way to travel. This would require finding a helicopter that is available and accessible, but it would be a fast and efficient way to get around.",
