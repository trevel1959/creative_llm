    "Alternative Water Sources: Water is the only element that puts out fire. Therefore, if there is no available supply of water, you can always depend on alternative water sources such as rainwater cisterns, water barrels, or even snow banks for emergencies.",
    "Cover with Wet Fabric: A wet cloth can be used to cover the fire until firemen arrive. Use a wet cloth and drape it over the fire to smother it.",
    "Use Sand or Soil: Pouring sand or soil on the fire can help in suffocating it. Sand or soil acts as an insulator which prevents oxygen from spreading the fire.",
    "Use Baking Soda: Baking soda can be an effective fire extinguisher. It is a substance that does not require water. It prevents the spread of fire and stops the flames from burning.",
    "Use Water-Based Aerosols: Most homes have water-based aerosols such as fire extinguishers, firefighting sprays, etc. These aerosols can be effective in putting out small fires."
