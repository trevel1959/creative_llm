    "**Data Management Challenges**: Collecting and analyzing data from a large-scale experiment can be overwhelming. Without a robust data management system, researchers may struggle with data entry errors, loss of data, or difficulties in data retrieval. This could result in inaccurate conclusions or wasted resources as scientists attempt to replicate or verify findings.",
    "**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: If the experiment involves human subjects, recruiting enough participants can be challenging. Additionally, maintaining participant engagement throughout the study is crucial. High dropout rates can skew results and necessitate additional recruitment efforts, which can be time-consuming and costly.",
    "**Interdisciplinary Communication Gaps**: Large-scale experiments often involve teams from various disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, engineering). Miscommunication between these groups can lead to misunderstandings about methodologies or objectives, resulting in inconsistent practices or erroneous conclusions. Establishing clear communication channels and regular interdisciplinary meetings can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Concerns**: Conducting large-scale experiments, especially those involving human or animal subjects, requires adherence to strict regulatory guidelines. Failure to comply can lead to legal repercussions, funding loss, or even the halting of the experiment. Ethical concerns must also be addressed to ensure that participants' rights and welfare are protected, which can complicate the experimental design.",
    "**Environmental and External Factors**: Large-scale experiments can be influenced by environmental conditions, such as weather or geographical factors. For instance, if an experiment is conducted outdoors, unexpected weather changes could disrupt the data collection process. Additionally, external factors such as political or economic changes can impact funding or collaboration efforts."
