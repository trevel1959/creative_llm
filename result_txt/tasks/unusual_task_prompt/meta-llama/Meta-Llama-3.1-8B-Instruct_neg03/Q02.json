    "**Virtual Reality Hand Transplant**: Develop a VR system that allows patients to experience the sensation of having a new hand. The system would consist of a haptic feedback glove, a VR headset, and a brain-computer interface (BCI) that reads the patient's neural signals. As the patient moves their virtual hand, the BCI would translate their brain activity into corresponding hand movements, allowing them to \"feel\" the sensations of grasping, manipulating objects, and even experiencing tactile feedback.",
    "**Synthetic Sense Organs**: Design and develop synthetic sense organs that can be implanted or attached to the body, allowing individuals to perceive and interact with their environment in new and innovative ways. For example, a synthetic sense organ that detects changes in air pressure could allow individuals to \"feel\" changes in weather patterns or detect subtle vibrations in their surroundings.",
    "**Neural Interface Prosthetics**: Create prosthetic limbs that are controlled by neural signals, allowing individuals to control their prosthetics with their thoughts. This technology would involve developing advanced BCI systems that can read and interpret neural activity, and then translate those signals into corresponding movements of the prosthetic limb.",
    "**Biohybrid Robotics**: Develop robots that integrate living tissues and biological systems with mechanical components, creating hybrid systems that can interact with and adapt to their environment in novel ways. For example, a biohybrid robot that incorporates muscle tissue and neural interfaces could be used for search and rescue operations or environmental monitoring.",
    "**Cognitive Prosthetics**: Design prosthetic devices that not only restore physical function but also enhance cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, or decision-making. This could involve developing brain-computer interfaces that can read and write neural signals, allowing individuals to access and manipulate their own memories or even enhance their cognitive abilities through training and practice.
