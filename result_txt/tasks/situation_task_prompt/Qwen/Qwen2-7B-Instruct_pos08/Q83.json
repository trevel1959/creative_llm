    "**Daytime Sleep Scheduling**: Since we would have continuous daylight, people might adjust their sleep patterns to accommodate this change. One idea is to adopt a polyphasic sleep schedule, where one sleeps in multiple short periods throughout the day rather than a single long period at night. This could lead to increased productivity during the day since people would not need to sleep as much.",
    "**Innovative Lighting Solutions**: To mimic the darkness of night, new lighting technologies could be developed that emit a low-intensity, soothing light, similar to moonlight or the glow from a fire. These lights could be used in bedrooms or personal spaces to encourage sleep. Additionally, smart homes could automatically adjust these lights based on the time of day and the user's circadian rhythm.",
    "**Daytime Sleep Enhancers**: The lack of darkness could disrupt the natural sleep cycle. Therefore, scientists might develop new sleep aids or supplements that help individuals maintain their sleep quality during the day. These could include substances that regulate melatonin production, adaptogenic herbs, or wearable devices that monitor sleep patterns and provide personalized recommendations for sleep improvement.",
    "**Reinventing Sleepwear**: With continuous daylight, traditional sleepwear might become obsolete. People could opt for comfortable, lightweight clothing that allows for a range of body positions without feeling constricted. Special fabrics might also be developed that block blue light from electronic devices, helping to reduce exposure and improve sleep quality.",
    "**Cultural Shift in Work Hours**: The absence of night-time could significantly impact work schedules. Employers might consider implementing flexible working hours, allowing employees to work during their most productive times, which could vary from person to person. This shift could lead to a more balanced lifestyle, reducing the need for sleep during typical night-time hours and potentially increasing overall happiness and productivity. "
