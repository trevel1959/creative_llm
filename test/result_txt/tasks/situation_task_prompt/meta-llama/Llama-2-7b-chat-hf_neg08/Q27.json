    "Thermal blankets and hot water bottles: One creative solution would be to use thermal blankets and hot water bottles to regulate indoor temperature. These blankets are designed to retain heat and keep individuals warm, providing an effective way to maintain a comfortable temperature in the absence of heaters and air conditioners. Additionally, hot water bottles can be filled with warm water and placed in areas where people are congregating to provide a soothing and cozy heat source.",
    "Greenhouse-inspired design: Another creative solution would be to design buildings with a greenhouse-inspired layout. By incorporating large windows and transparent roofs, buildings can utilize natural sunlight to heat up during the day and retain the heat at night. This approach would not only regulate the temperature but also provide a natural and sustainable way to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.",
    "Body heat exchange: In a situation where heaters and air conditioners are unavailable, body heat exchange could be a viable solution. By creating a network of people with excess body heat, those who are cold can receive warmth from others. This could be achieved through a simple system of hand-holding, hugging, or even more creative methods such as a \"warmth exchange\" station where people can go to receive or give warmth.",
    "Insulation and passive design: A more practical and low-tech solution would be to focus on improving insulation and passive design elements in buildings. By sealing gaps and cracks in walls, windows, and doors, buildings can become more energy-efficient and retain heat better. Additionally, passive design elements such as large overhangs, awnings, and shading devices can help reduce heat gain during the day and retain heat at night.",
    "Solar-powered heating and cooling: In a long-term solution, investing in solar-powered heating and cooling systems could provide a sustainable and reliable alternative to traditional heating and cooling methods. By harnessing the power of the sun, these systems can provide a consistent and renewable source of energy for heating and cooling, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions."
