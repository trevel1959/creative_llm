    "**Eco-Friendly Insect Decoys**: Design realistic insect decoys that mimic the appearance and pheromones of pests. These decoys could be strategically placed around homes and gardens to lure insects away from human habitation. By using non-toxic materials and pheromone-based attractants, we could create a sustainable pest management solution that keeps unwanted insects at bay.",
    "**Smart Insect Traps**: Create intelligent traps equipped with sensors and cameras that identify and capture specific pest species. These traps could use machine learning algorithms to distinguish between beneficial insects and pests, ensuring that only unwanted species are caught. The data collected could also help in monitoring pest populations and understanding their behavior, leading to more effective control methods.",
    "**Insect-Friendly Predator Robots**: Design small, robotic predators that mimic the hunting behaviors of natural insectivores, like birds or amphibians. These robots could patrol gardens and homes, using sound and movement to scare away pests. Equipped with sensors, they could also provide real-time feedback on pest activity, allowing for targeted pest management strategies.",
    "**Fermentation-Based Pest Deterrents**: Utilize fermentation processes to create natural repellents from food waste. By fermenting specific plant materials, we could produce substances that emit odors repellent to insects. These eco-friendly deterrents could be sprayed in gardens and around homes, providing a sustainable way to manage pest populations without chemicals.",
    "**Soundwave Pest Deterrents**: Develop devices that emit soundwaves at frequencies that are unpleasant to certain pests but inaudible to humans and pets. These devices could be placed in gardens and homes to create a sonic barrier that discourages pests from entering. This method would be non-invasive and could be powered by renewable energy sources, making it an environmentally friendly option."
