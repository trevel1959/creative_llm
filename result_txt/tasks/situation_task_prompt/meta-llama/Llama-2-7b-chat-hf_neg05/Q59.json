    "Build a Sun-Harvesting Dome: Create a large, translucent dome that covers a designated area, allowing sunlight to pass through while trapping it inside. The dome could be made of a specialized plastic or polymer material that is impermeable to clouds and rain. By positioning the dome at a slight angle, the sunlight can be funneled into the interior, providing a consistent and controlled source of light.",
    "Solar Panel Awnings: Design and install retractable awnings made of photovoltaic panels that can be extended during sunny periods to capture and convert sunlight into electricity. These awnings could be mounted on buildings, homes, or even entire cities, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy. The excess energy could be stored in batteries or fed back into the grid.",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Develop skyscrapers or towers with specially designed roofs that can pierce through the clouds, allowing sunlight to reach the interior. These towers could be equipped with advanced solar panels or mirrors that focus sunlight onto a central collector, providing a concentrated and reliable source of energy.",
    "Artificial Sunlight Lamps: Create advanced lighting systems that mimic the properties of natural sunlight. These lamps could use a combination of LEDs, mirrors, and reflective coatings to simulate the full spectrum of sunlight, including UV and infrared radiation. By using these lamps, people could enjoy natural lighting without the need for direct sunlight, reducing the risk of skin cancer and other health problems associated with prolonged exposure to UV radiation.",
    "Cloud-Busting Drones: Develop small, autonomous drones that can fly into clouds and disperse specialized particles that reflect sunlight back towards the ground. These particles could be made of a lightweight, reflective material that is safe for the environment and can be easily dispersed in the atmosphere. By strategically placing these drones in cloudy areas, they could create artificial sunlight pockets, providing a reliable source of energy without the need for expensive infrastructure."
