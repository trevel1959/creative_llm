    "Sustainable Fashion: Instead of relying on cosmetic products, I would focus on sustainable fashion and minimalism. By investing in high-quality, timeless pieces that fit well, I would reduce the need for frequent replacements and the associated consumption of new products.",

    "Personalized Routine: I would develop a personalized grooming routine that focuses on my unique skin type, hair texture, and body shape. This would involve understanding my natural features and creating a routine that enhances them.",
    "Alternative Beauty Tools: I would experiment with alternative beauty tools, such as facial rollers, micro-needling devices, and handheld massagers, to achieve similar results without relying on cosmetic products.",
    "Collaborative Beauty: I would collaborate with friends and family members to create a communal grooming space where we could share tips, techniques, and resources. This would foster a sense of community and shared knowledge."
