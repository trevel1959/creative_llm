    "Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience that simulates the sensation of having a rubber hand. Users could wear a VR headset and gloves that mimic the sensation of having a rubber hand. As they reach out to touch virtual objects, the VR system could use haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of touching a rubber hand instead.",
    "Interactive Art Installation: Design an interactive art installation that allows visitors to immerse themselves in a room filled with rubber hands of varying sizes and colors. As visitors reach out to touch the hands, they could trigger sounds, lights, or even scents that create a surreal and immersive experience.",

    "Sensory Deprivation Tank: Develop a sensory deprivation tank that simulates the sensation of having a rubber hand.
