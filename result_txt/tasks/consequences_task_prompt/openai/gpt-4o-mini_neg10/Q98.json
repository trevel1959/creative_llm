    "**Ethical Dilemmas and Social Strain**: The ability to resurrect individuals could lead to significant ethical and moral dilemmas. Society would have to grapple with questions like who gets to come back and why, and what the implications are for those who have passed on.

Furthermore, the resurrected individuals may struggle to reintegrate into a world that has moved on, leading to psychological challenges and social isolation.",

    "**Revival of Lost Knowledge**: Many individuals who have passed away held vast amounts of knowledge that died with them.

This revival of knowledge could help address modern challenges such as climate change, health crises, and cultural preservation.",
