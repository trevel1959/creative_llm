    "**Haptic Feedback Suit**: Develop a wearable suit that uses artificial haptic feedback to simulate sensations like touch, temperature, and vibrations. This would allow you to perceive your surroundings and react to potential hazards, even without feeling physical sensations.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Design an AR interface that overlays digital information onto your field of vision, providing real-time data about your environment, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. This would enable you to make informed decisions about your safety and avoid potential dangers.",
    "**Environmental Sensing Network**: Create a network of sensors that monitor and report on your surroundings, providing you with critical information about potential hazards like toxic gases, extreme temperatures, or unstable structures. This would allow you to make informed decisions about your safety and take necessary precautions.",
    "**Autonomous Assistive Robot**: Develop an autonomous robot that accompanies you and provides real-time feedback on your surroundings, using sensors and cameras to detect potential hazards and alert you to take action. This would provide an added layer of protection and support in situations where you might not be able to feel physical sensations.",
    "**Neural Interface**: Design a neural interface that allows you to control prosthetic limbs or other devices with your thoughts, enabling you to interact with your environment in a more intuitive and responsive way. This would provide an alternative means of communication and control, even if you're unable to feel physical sensations. [/INST] "
