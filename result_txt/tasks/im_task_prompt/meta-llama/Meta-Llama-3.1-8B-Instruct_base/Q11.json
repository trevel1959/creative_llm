    "**Smart Hydration Buddy**: Design a water bottle with a built-in sensor that tracks the user's water intake and sends reminders to drink more throughout the day. The bottle could also monitor the water's temperature and quality, providing real-time feedback to ensure the user is drinking safe and refreshing water.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refill System**: Create a water bottle with a built-in refill station that uses a proprietary cartridge system. Users can purchase refill cartridges made from recycled materials, reducing plastic waste and the need for single-use water bottles. The system could also include a rewards program for frequent refills.",
    "**Personalized Hydration Coach**: Develop a water bottle with a built-in AI-powered coach that provides personalized hydration recommendations based on the user's activity level, climate, and individual needs. The coach could offer tailored advice on when to drink more or less water, as well as provide tracking and analysis of the user's progress.",
    "**Collaborative Water Sharing**: Design a water bottle with a social feature that allows users to share their water intake with friends and family. Users can compete in hydration challenges, share tips and advice, and even send virtual \"water bottles\" to encourage others to drink more. The system could also include a community leaderboard to foster friendly competition.",
    "**Edible Water Bottle**: Create a water bottle made from a plant-based, edible material that can be consumed along with the water. The bottle would be made from a natural, biodegradable material that dissolves in water, eliminating the need for single-use plastics and reducing waste. The edible bottle could also be infused with nutrients or flavors, adding an extra layer of functionality. [/INST] "
