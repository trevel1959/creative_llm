    "**Water Filtration with Shells**: Collect various shells and create a rudimentary water filtration system. By layering sand, charcoal (from any driftwood you can burn), and gravel within larger shells or hollowed-out rocks, you can filter seawater or rainwater to remove larger impurities. This could be enhanced by creating a simple solar still with plastic or leaves to further purify water, ensuring you have access to drinking water.",
    "**Signal Fire with a Twist**: Instead of a standard signal fire, create a smoke signal system using different materials to produce colored smoke. Gather green leaves, rubber, or plastic debris (if available) to generate colored smoke. This not only signals for help but can also be a creative way to convey messages if you see passing ships or planes. For example, white smoke could mean distress, while colored smoke could represent a message of hope or a specific need.",
    "**Shellfish Farm**: If the island is near a rocky shore, consider starting a shellfish farm. Use rocks and driftwood to create a simple enclosure in shallow water to trap and cultivate clams, mussels, or oysters. This sustainable food source would provide a steady supply of protein while allowing you to explore other food options without depleting local resources.",
    "**Tide Timekeeper**: Use the tides as your timekeeping system. Build a simple tidal clock using two stones and a piece of driftwood. As the tide comes in and out, you can use the water level to mark time. This helps you plan activities like fishing, foraging, or resting, as certain times of the day may be more advantageous for each.",
    "**Natural Shelter with Ventilation**: Construct a shelter that utilizes natural materials while ensuring proper ventilation. Instead of a traditional lean-to, create a dome-like structure using palm fronds and branches, which allows for airflow while providing protection from the elements. Incorporate a raised platform made from driftwood to keep you off the ground and dry, which can also help with insulation against the cool night air."
