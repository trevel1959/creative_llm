    "Utilize passive solar design: Design your home or building to maximize natural light and heat. For example, larger windows on south-facing walls can absorb sunlight during the winter, while thermal mass materials like concrete or brick can store heat during the day and release it at night.",
    "Greenhouses: Convert your home into a greenhouse by adding a transparent or translucent roof and walls. This will allow sunlight to enter during the day and warm the interior, while trapping heat inside at night.",
    "Phase-change materials: Use phase-change materials like paraffin wax or salt hydrates to store heat energy. These materials can absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid or vice versa, allowing for efficient temperature regulation.",
    "Thermal flywheel: Develop a thermal flywheel that stores energy in the form of heat. The flywheel can be made of a thermally conductive material and can be spun at high speeds, generating kinetic energy that can be converted into heat energy when needed.",
    "Evaporative cooling: Create a cooling system that utilizes evaporation to lower the temperature. This can be achieved through the use of wet towels or cloths, which can be placed in front of fans or windows to cool the air through evaporation. Alternatively, a misting system can be used to spray a fine mist of water into the air, which will also cool through evaporation."
