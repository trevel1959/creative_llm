    "**Multi-Function Mower with Attachments**: Design a modular lawn mower that can switch between different attachments for various tasks. For example, users could easily attach a leaf blower, mulcher, or even a dethatcher. This would make the mower a versatile tool for lawn care, eliminating the need for multiple machines and saving storage space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Charging**: Develop a fully electric lawn mower that features solar panels on its body for charging. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint but also provide a sustainable way to keep the mower charged during sunny days. The mower could have a battery life indicator and energy usage statistics to encourage eco-friendly practices.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mower with Integrated Water System**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses a built-in water system to wash the mower's blades and underside after each use. This would prevent grass buildup, enhance cutting efficiency, and reduce maintenance time. Users could set the cleaning cycle through a timer or remotely via an app.",
    "**Sound-Reducing Technology**: Introduce sound-dampening materials and designs to create a quieter mowing experience. This could involve using acoustic insulation within the mower's casing and redesigning the blade assembly to minimize noise. A quieter mower would be more neighborhood-friendly and reduce stress for users.",
    "**Robotic Mower with Remote Monitoring**: Create a robotic lawn mower that can be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to monitor and manage mowing sessions from anywhere. The app could include features such as scheduling, real-time tracking, and remote adjustments. Additionally, it could send alerts for maintenance needs, such as sharpening blades or checking battery levels."
