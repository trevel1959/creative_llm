    "The Planets Would Fly: If Earth's gravity were halved, the planets in our solar system would no longer be held in orbit around the sun. Instead, they would fly off into space. This could potentially cause a catastrophic chain reaction, as the planets collide with each other or with asteroids and comets.",
    "The Oceans Would Drain: The Earth's gravity is what keeps the water in the oceans from draining away into space. If the gravity were halved, the water would start to drain away, causing the oceans to shrink and potentially leading to a global flood.",
    "The Atmosphere Would Dissipate: The Earth's gravity is also what holds the atmosphere in place. If the gravity were halved, the atmosphere would start to dissipate, causing the air we breathe to disappear.",
    "The Weather Would Change: The Earth's gravity is also what causes the weather patterns we experience. If the gravity were halved, the weather patterns would change dramatically, potentially leading to extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes.",
    "The Moon Would Fly Off: The Earth's gravity is what keeps the moon in orbit around the planet. If the gravity were halved, the moon would fly off into space, potentially causing chaos in the solar system."
