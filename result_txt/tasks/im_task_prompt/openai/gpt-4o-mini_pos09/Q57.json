    "**Integrated Touchpad Surface**: Combine the traditional mouse with a touchpad on its surface. Users could switch between mouse and touchpad functionality with a simple gesture, allowing for more intuitive navigation and multitasking. This would be particularly useful for graphic designers and digital artists who often require both precision and fluidity in their movements.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop a mouse that incorporates AR technology to project a virtual interface onto the user's workspace. This would allow users to interact with digital elements in 3D space, enhancing productivity and creativity. For instance, a user could manipulate 3D models or create visual presentations directly from their desk.",
    "**Smart Gesture Recognition**: Equip the mouse with advanced sensors that recognize specific hand gestures to perform actions. For example, a swipe of the hand could switch between applications, or a circular motion could zoom in and out of documents. This feature would streamline workflows and provide a more dynamic user experience, especially for multitaskers.",
    "**Customizable LED Feedback**: Implement customizable LED lights on the mouse that provide real-time feedback based on user actions. For instance, the color of the lights could change to indicate battery levels, sensitivity settings, or even notifications from connected applications. Users could personalize the color schemes and patterns, making their mouse a unique extension of their personality.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Built-in Massage**: Create a mouse that not only promotes ergonomic use but also features a built-in massage function. This could involve gentle vibrations or pressure points that activate during long sessions, helping to alleviate tension in the hand and wrist. This feature would be particularly appealing to those with repetitive strain injuries or discomfort from extended computer use."
