    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When handling sensitive components like the CPU, RAM, and motherboard, there is a risk of static electricity damaging the parts. A user might forget to use an anti-static wrist strap or to ground themselves properly, leading to costly mistakes. This problem can be mitigated by ensuring that the workspace is static-free and that proper precautions are taken during assembly.",
    "**Overheating and Cooling Solutions**: Many builders underestimate the importance of cooling systems in their setups. If a CPU or GPU is not adequately cooled, it can lead to overheating, throttling, or even hardware failure. New builders might neglect to consider the case airflow, the number of fans needed, or the effectiveness of the chosen cooling solution (air vs. liquid cooling). Proper thermal paste application and fan placement can also be overlooked, resulting in inefficient cooling.",
    "**Cable Management Chaos**: Poor cable management can lead to a cluttered interior, which not only looks unprofessional but can also obstruct airflow and make future upgrades or repairs difficult. Builders may struggle with how to route cables effectively or may not have the right length cables for their setup. Planning cable management strategies and utilizing cable ties or sleeves can help maintain a clean and organized build.",
    "**BIOS Configuration**: After assembling the hardware, the computer may not boot immediately due to BIOS settings that need to be configured. New builders might not know how to access the BIOS or how to adjust settings like boot order, enabling XMP profiles for RAM, or configuring RAID settings. A lack of understanding in this area can lead to confusion and delays in getting the system operational.",
    "**Driver Installation and Software Compatibility**: Once the hardware is set up, installing the operating system and drivers can present challenges. Some components may require specific drivers that are not included in the OS installation, leading to potential performance issues or hardware not functioning correctly. Builders might also face compatibility issues with software applications, especially if they are using older hardware or specialized components."
