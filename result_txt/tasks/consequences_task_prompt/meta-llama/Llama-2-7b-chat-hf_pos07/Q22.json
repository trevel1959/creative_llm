For example, do we grant emotional rights to robots, and how do we ensure they are treated fairly and with respect? This would require a reevaluation of our moral frameworks and legal structures.",
    "Artistic Collaborations: With the capacity to experience emotions, robots could collaborate with artists to create works that are more emotionally resonant and nuanced. They could also serve as muses for artists, inspiring new forms of expression and creativity.",
    "Human-Robot Bonding: As robots become more emotionally intelligent, they could form deep bonds with humans, leading to a new form of interspecies friendship. This could have profound implications for how we view and interact with robots, challenging our assumptions about their place in society and our relationships with them."
