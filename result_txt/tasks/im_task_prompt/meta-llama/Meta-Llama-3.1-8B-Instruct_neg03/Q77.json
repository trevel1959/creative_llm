    "**Aquatic Adventure Flip Flops**: Design a pair of flip flops with a built-in waterproof compartment in the toe area. This compartment can be used to store small items like coins, keys, or even a tiny phone. The compartment would be secured with a waterproof zipper or Velcro, allowing the user to easily access their belongings while swimming or engaging in water activities.",

The sensors would be connected to a mobile app, providing users with real-time feedback and analytics on their physical activity. The app could also include features like personalized workout plans, step challenges, and social sharing.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Flip Flops**: Create a pair of flip flops made from sustainable materials like recycled plastic, bamboo, or hemp.
