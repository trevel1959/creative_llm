    "**Incorporate Smart Detergent Dispenser**: Design a system within the washing machine that automatically dispenses detergent based on the load size and fabric type. By integrating sensors and algorithms, the machine could measure the correct amount of detergent needed, reducing waste and ensuring effective cleaning. This feature could be controlled via an app or voice command, providing convenience and minimizing the need for manual measurement.",
    "**Add Real-Time Feedback and Alerts**: Implement a feature that provides real-time feedback during the wash cycle, such as water temperature, cycle progress, and any potential issues. Users could receive notifications on their smartphones or the machine itself, alerting them to any abnormalities or suggesting preventive measures. This proactive approach could help prevent overloading the machine or leaving clothes in for too long, potentially damaging them or wasting resources.",
    "**Create a Voice-Activated Interface**: Enhance the user experience by incorporating voice recognition technology into the washing machine. Users could control the machine using natural language commands, such as \"start wash,\" \"add more detergent,\" or \"extend rinse time.\" This hands-free operation would be particularly useful for individuals with disabilities or those who are busy multitasking.",
    "**Develop a Sensor-Based Wearable Alert System**: Introduce a wearable device that pairs with the washing machine and alerts the user when the load is complete or when there are any issues during the wash cycle. This could be especially helpful for busy households where multiple people share the same appliance, ensuring everyone knows when they can retrieve their clean laundry without missing it.",
    "**Integrate a Smart Storage System**: Incorporate a built-in storage compartment within the washing machine where users can store detergent pods, fabric softener sheets, and other laundry essentials. This feature would eliminate the need for extra storage space around the home and streamline the laundry process, making it more convenient and efficient."
