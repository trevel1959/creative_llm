    "Virtual Reality Submarine Tour: Create a virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the deep sea as if they were on a real submarine. The VR tour can include interactive elements such as touching and examining sea creatures, navigating through shipwrecks, and witnessing underwater volcanic eruptions.",
    "Ocean Cleanup Device: Design a device that can collect and remove plastic and other pollutants from the ocean. The device can be deployed from a submarine and use a combination of filters and nets to capture the debris. The collected waste can then be transported to a recycling facility for processing.",
    "Underwater Gardening: Develop a system that allows for the growth of plants and crops underwater. This can involve creating specialized hydroponic or aquaponic systems that use nutrient-rich water from the ocean to feed the plants. The underwater garden can provide a sustainable source of food and also help to purify the water.",
    "Artificial Reef Habitat: Create an artificial reef habitat that attracts a variety of marine life. The habitat can be designed to mimic the structure and complexity of a natural reef, providing a haven for fish and other sea creatures to live and thrive. The artificial reef can also help to restore damaged or degraded ecosystems.",
    "Sonic Ocean Exploration: Develop a sonic exploration device that uses sound waves to map and explore the ocean. The device can use a combination of echolocation and sonar technology to create detailed images of the ocean floor and its inhabitants. The sonic exploration device can also be used to detect and monitor underwater volcanic activity, tsunamis, and other ocean phenomena."
