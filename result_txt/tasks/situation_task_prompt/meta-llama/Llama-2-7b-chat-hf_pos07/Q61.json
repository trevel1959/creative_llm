    "Create a Bee-Friendly Environment: To pollinate plants without flowers, create a bee-friendly environment by planting flowers that are rich in nectar and pollen, which are essential for bees' survival. This could include herbs like lavender, rosemary, and thyme, as well as fruit trees like apple, pear, and cherry. These plants will attract bees and provide them with the necessary nutrients for pollination.",
    "Use Artificial Pollinators: Develop and use artificial pollinators, such as small, remote-controlled drones or robots, to transfer pollen between plants. These devices could be designed to mimic the behavior of bees, attracting and pollinating plants in a way that is both efficient and effective.",
    "Harness the Power of Wind: Take advantage of wind as a natural pollinator by planting wind-pollinated plants, such as grasses, wheat, and rice. These plants produce lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds that can travel long distances, ensuring effective pollination.",
    "Utilize Insects Other Than Bees: Explore the use of other insects, such as butterflies, moths, and flies, as pollinators. These insects are often overlooked but can be just as effective as bees in pollination. For example, butterflies are known to transfer pollen between plants as they feed on nectar.",
    "Develop Pollination Technology: Create advanced pollination technology, such as pollination drones, that can be used to transfer pollen between plants. These drones could be equipped with sensors and navigation systems, allowing them to target specific plants and transfer pollen with precision. This technology could be particularly useful in large-scale agriculture, where pollination is a critical factor in crop production."
