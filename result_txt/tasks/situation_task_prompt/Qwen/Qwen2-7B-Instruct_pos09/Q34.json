    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: Build a sophisticated rainwater harvesting system that captures rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces. The collected water can be stored in tanks for later use. This system could include filters to ensure the water is clean and suitable for plant watering.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Pumps**: If you have access to solar energy, install solar-powered water pumps. These pumps can draw water from nearby sources like wells, rivers, or even ponds and pump it into your garden. This ensures a constant supply of water without relying on rain.",
    "**Aquaponics Setup**: Create an aquaponics system where fish waste provides nutrients for your plants while the plants filter the water for the fish. This closed-loop system allows you to grow plants year-round without needing rainwater. You could even use rainwater to start seeds indoors before transferring them to the aquaponics setup.",
    "**Rainwater-Recycling Container Garden**: Use large containers with a series of smaller pots placed inside to create a rainwater recycling system. Rainwater can collect at the bottom of each container, which then irrigates the smaller pots above. This method requires minimal effort but ensures continuous water supply for your plants.",
    "**Portable Water Tank and Irrigation System**: Set up a portable water tank that can be filled during rainy seasons or when you have access to water. Pair this with an efficient irrigation system (such as drip irrigation) to deliver water directly to the roots of your plants. This setup allows for precise watering and reduces water wastage. Additionally, you can transport the tank as needed to ensure every part of your garden receives adequate moisture."
