    "Oxygen Supply: At such depths, there is a lack of oxygen, making it difficult to breathe. The crew must have an adequate supply of oxygen to breathe, and the supply must be replenished regularly. This can be a logistical challenge, as it requires careful planning and management.",
    "Water Temperature: The temperature at the bottom of the ocean can be very cold, which can cause equipment to malfunction or become damaged. The crew must be equipped with appropriate clothing and gear to protect them from the cold.",
    "Communication Challenges: Communication with the surface can be difficult due to the water's natural barrier, making it difficult to receive and transmit signals. The crew must have reliable communication equipment to stay in contact with the surface and receive updates on mission progress.",
    "Currents and Tides: Ocean currents and tides can make navigation difficult and pose a risk to the crew. The crew must be aware of these factors and adjust their course accordingly to avoid being swept away or stranded.",
    "Marine Life: The ocean is home to a diverse range of marine life, some of which can be dangerous. The crew must be aware of potential risks, such as jellyfish stings or encounters with sharks, and take appropriate precautions."
