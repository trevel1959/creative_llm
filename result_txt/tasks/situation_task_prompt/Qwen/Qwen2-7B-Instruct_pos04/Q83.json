    "**Sleeping in Daylight-Optimized Rooms**: In a world without night-time, one could create rooms specifically designed to simulate darkness during the day. These rooms would be equipped with advanced lighting technology that filters out blue light, mimicking the darkness of night. This would help regulate the body's circadian rhythm, ensuring adequate sleep.",
    "**Adjustable Sleep Cycles**: Since there are no longer distinct periods of light and dark, individuals might adjust their sleep patterns accordingly. They could sleep for shorter periods throughout the day or adopt a continuous sleep pattern. Specialized beds and pillows would be designed to optimize comfort and sleep quality during these times.",
    "**Daytime Sleep Gear**: People could wear special glasses or masks that block out all forms of artificial light during their sleep period, even during the daytime. This would ensure that they can sleep comfortably and effectively, regardless of the surrounding environment.",
    "**Sunlight Mimicking Lights**: Instead of complete darkness, rooms could have lights that mimic the natural sunlight of the evening hours. This would create a calming atmosphere conducive to sleep while still being exposed to light. The light could gradually change color and intensity as 'night' approaches, preparing the body for sleep.",
    "**Sleep Scheduling Software**: A sophisticated software application could manage an individual's sleep schedule based on their activity levels, light exposure, and personal preferences. It would calculate optimal sleep periods, taking into account the absence of night-time, and provide personalized recommendations for when to sleep and wake up. This software could also adapt over time, learning from the user's habits and adjusting the sleep schedule accordingly."
