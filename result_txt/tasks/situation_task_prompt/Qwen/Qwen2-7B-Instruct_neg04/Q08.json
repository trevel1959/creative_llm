    "**Solar Distillation System**: Create a solar-powered distillation system. The idea involves setting up large, clear plastic sheets in direct sunlight to collect water vapor from the air. The vapor then condenses back into liquid water when it cools, providing a source of fresh water. This method doesn't require any electricity, only sunlight, which is available almost everywhere.",
    "**Water Filtration through Plants**: Develop a system that uses plants known for their ability to purify water like water hyacinth or willow trees. These plants can absorb contaminants from the water as they grow, making the water safe for consumption after the plants have been harvested and the water passed through them.",
    "**Nano-filtration Water Purification**: Use nanotechnology to create a filter that removes impurities from water on a molecular level. This could involve creating a membrane coated with nanostructures that selectively allow water molecules to pass through while trapping contaminants.",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting and Treatment**: Set up an extensive rainwater harvesting system to collect and store rainwater, which can then be treated for drinking purposes. Treatments might include sedimentation, sand filtration, and chemical disinfection. The harvested water can be stored in large tanks and distributed via gravity-fed systems.",
    "**Biological Filtration using Microbes**: Engineer a system where bacteria, algae, and other microorganisms are used to clean water. These organisms can consume pollutants, convert them into less harmful substances, and even produce oxygen. The water would need to be kept in a controlled environment with sufficient nutrients to support these microorganisms."
