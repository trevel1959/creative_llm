    "**Self-Cleaning Filter System**: Develop a vacuum cleaner with a built-in self-cleaning filter system. This would use a combination of air pulses and vibrations to dislodge trapped dirt and debris from the filter, allowing it to maintain optimal suction power without requiring frequent manual cleaning or replacement of filters. This feature would also reduce the overall maintenance time for users.",
    "**Augmented Reality Navigation**: Create a vacuum cleaner equipped with augmented reality (AR) capabilities that can map the home environment in real-time. Using a companion app, users could visualize the cleaning path, identify missed spots, and receive tips on how to maintain their floors. The vacuum could also display areas that require more frequent cleaning, based on user habits and environmental data.",
    "**Modular Attachments**: Design a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable, modular attachments that cater to specific cleaning needs. For example, a pet hair attachment with specialized bristles, a delicate surface attachment for electronics, or a narrow crevice tool for tight spaces. This would allow users to customize their vacuum for different cleaning tasks, enhancing versatility and efficiency.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solution Dispenser**: Incorporate a built-in dispenser for eco-friendly cleaning solutions that can be used in conjunction with vacuuming. This feature would allow users to spray a biodegradable solution on carpets or upholstery before vacuuming, ensuring deeper cleaning while being gentle on the environment. The dispenser could be refillable and adjustable for different cleaning strengths.",
    "**Voice Assistant Integration**: Equip the vacuum cleaner with voice assistant technology, allowing users to control it hands-free. Users could start, stop, schedule cleanings, or even adjust settings using voice commands. This would enhance convenience, especially for those with mobility challenges or busy lifestyles, making it easier to maintain a clean home without interrupting daily activities."
