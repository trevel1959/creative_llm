    "**Smart Hanger with Built-in Lighting**: Design a clothes hanger that features an integrated LED light system. This would be particularly useful in walk-in closets or smaller spaces where overhead lighting may not provide enough illumination. The lights can be activated by a simple touch sensor or voice command. The hangers could also be color-coded or equipped with small screens to display information like the garment's care instructions or even the weather outside.",
    "**Multi-functional Hanger with Hidden Storage**: Create a clothes hanger that includes additional storage space within its structure. For instance, it could have a small drawer or shelf on the backside of the hanger to store small items such as accessories, undergarments, or even toiletries. This is especially helpful for individuals living in compact spaces or those who wish to minimize clutter.",
    "**Adjustable Height Hanger**: Develop a hanger with adjustable arms that allow users to easily adjust the height without needing tools. This would be beneficial for both children and adults, ensuring that clothing is hung at a comfortable level for everyone in the household. Additionally, the hanger could come with built-in hooks or clips for hanging bags, scarves, or belts.",
    "**Smart Hanger with Temperature Control**: Integrate a small heating element into the hanger that can be controlled via a mobile app or a simple remote control. This feature would help keep garments warm during colder months, preventing them from becoming damp or cold. The temperature could be adjusted according to the userâ€™s preferences or the weather conditions outside.",
    "**Eco-friendly Hanger with Reusable Packaging**: Produce a clothes hanger made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or biodegradable composites. The hangers could be sold with reusable packaging that doubles as a storage solution or gift box, reducing waste and promoting eco-consciousness. Furthermore, these hangers could be designed with a unique pattern or design that can be personalized, making them a stylish addition to any wardrobe or closet."
