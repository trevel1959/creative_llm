    "A keyboard with a built-in music synthesizer: This keyboard would have a unique feature that allows users to create and play their own music using the keys. The keyboard would have a series of sensors that detect the pressure and speed at which the keys are pressed, and these sensors would translate the input into different musical notes and rhythms. Users could create their own melodies and songs, and even save and play them back later.",
    "A keyboard with a holographic display: This keyboard would have a holographic display built into each key, allowing users to see the letters and symbols they are typing in 3D. This would make typing more intuitive and accurate, as users could see the letters and symbols from any angle. The holographic display could also be customized to display different characters or symbols depending on the user's preferences.",
    "A keyboard with a built-in AI assistant: This keyboard would have a built-in AI assistant that could help users with spelling, grammar, and other language-related tasks. The AI assistant could suggest corrections to spelling and grammar mistakes, and even provide suggestions for alternative words or phrases. This could be especially useful for users who are not native English speakers or who struggle with language-related tasks.",
    "A keyboard with a built-in projector: This keyboard would have a built-in projector that could project the keys onto a nearby surface, allowing users to type without having to physically see the keys. This could be useful for users who have difficulty seeing the keys on a traditional keyboard, such as those with vision impairments. The projected keys could be adjusted in size and brightness to suit the user's needs.",
    "A keyboard with a built-in gaming controller: This keyboard would have a built-in gaming controller that could be used to control games on a computer or gaming console. The controller could have a series of buttons and joysticks that could be used to control different aspects of a game, such as movement, attacks, or special abilities. This could be especially useful for gamers who prefer to use a keyboard and mouse for gaming, but want the added control and precision of a gaming controller."
