    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or steam to clean the juicer’s components after use. This would eliminate the hassle of disassembling and scrubbing each part. Users would simply add water and a cleaning solution, press a button, and the juicer would clean itself, making the juicing process much more convenient and encouraging regular use.",
    "**Modular Juicer Design**: Create a modular juicer that allows users to customize the juicing experience. Different attachments could be available for various types of fruits and vegetables, such as a citrus juicer, a leafy greens attachment, or a nut milk maker. Users could easily swap out parts depending on what they want to juice, making it versatile and suitable for a wider range of ingredients.",
    "**Built-in Nutrient Extractor**: Design a juicer that not only extracts juice but also separates and preserves the nutrients from the pulp. This could involve a dual-chamber system where the juice is extracted in one chamber while the pulp is processed in another to extract additional nutrients, enzymes, and fibers. The extracted nutrients could then be stored in a separate container for later use in smoothies or as dietary supplements.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Source**: Create a juicer made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, incorporate solar panels or a hand-crank mechanism for energy generation, making the juicer eco-friendly and suitable for outdoor use. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and those who enjoy juicing while camping or on-the-go.",
    "**Flavor Infusion Chamber**: Introduce a flavor infusion chamber within the juicer that allows users to add herbs, spices, or even essential oils to their juice while it’s being extracted. This chamber would infuse the juice with additional flavors, providing unique taste profiles and health benefits. For example, adding ginger for a spicy kick or mint for a refreshing twist could enhance the juicing experience."
