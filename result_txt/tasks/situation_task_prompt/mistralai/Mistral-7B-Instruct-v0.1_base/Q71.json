    "Create raised garden beds: Instead of digging into the ground, you can build raised garden beds on top of the hard soil. This will provide a deeper layer of soil for your plants to grow in, and you can fill it with a mixture of topsoil, compost, and other nutrients.",
    "Use container gardening: Another option is to use containers to grow your plants. You can fill pots, pans, or even old teacups with soil and plant your favorite vegetables, fruits, and herbs. This way, you can easily move the containers around if the soil becomes too hard in one spot.",
    "Use a hydroponic system: A hydroponic system is a method of growing plants without soil. You can use a hydroponic kit or build your own system using a water source, a nutrient solution, and a growing medium like perlite or coconut coir. This method is ideal for plants that don't require a lot of soil, like lettuce, herbs, and some vegetables.",
    "Use a vertical garden: If you don't have enough space on the ground, you can use a vertical garden to grow your plants. You can build a vertical garden using a wooden frame, metal bars, or even a repurposed pallet. You can fill the frames with soil and plant your favorite vegetables, fruits, and herbs.",
    "Use a soil-less mix: Some plants can grow in a soil-less mix that includes peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. You can buy a pre-made mix or make your own. This mix provides the necessary nutrients and drainage for your plants to grow, and you don't need to dig into the ground."
