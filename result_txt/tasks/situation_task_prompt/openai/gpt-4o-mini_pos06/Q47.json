    "**Scalp Sunscreen Tattoos**: Develop temporary tattoos infused with sunscreen that can be applied directly to the scalp. These tattoos would not only provide a barrier against UV rays but also be designed with fun patterns or messages. They could last for several days and would be waterproof, allowing for swimming and outdoor activities without the need for frequent reapplication.",
    "**Smart UV Monitoring Headband**: Create a headband equipped with UV sensors that monitor the sun's intensity. When UV levels reach a certain threshold, the headband could vibrate or send a notification to a connected smartphone, reminding the wearer to seek shade or apply sunscreen. The headband could also be designed with a stylish look, making it a fashionable accessory.",
    "**Portable Scalp Shade Umbrella**: Design a small, portable umbrella that can be easily attached to a backpack or belt loop. This mini-umbrella could be opened quickly when sitting outdoors and provide a personal shaded area for the head. It could feature UV-blocking fabric and come in various sizes and designs, making it practical for beach outings or outdoor events.",
    "**Cooling and Protective Scalp Gel**: Formulate a unique gel that not only provides sun protection but also cools the scalp. This gel could contain natural ingredients like aloe vera and menthol, which would soothe the skin while providing SPF protection. The gel could be marketed in a spray bottle for easy application and could be scented for a refreshing experience.",
    "**Interactive Scalp Scarf**: Create a multifunctional scarf designed specifically for bald individuals. This scarf could be worn in various styles, providing both sun protection and a fashionable accessory. It could be made from lightweight, breathable fabric that offers UV protection, and could even have built-in pockets for storing small items like sunscreen or lip balm."
