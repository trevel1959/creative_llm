    "The \"Skyway\": A levitating, automated monorail system that travels through the sky using magnetic technology. It would be powered by clean, renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. The Skyway would be designed to transport large numbers of people quickly and efficiently, with stations located at major cities and transportation hubs.",
    "The \"Hoverpod\": A small, personal hovercraft that can be controlled using a smartphone or tablet. It would be equipped with a range of safety features, such as collision avoidance and automatic landing systems. The Hoverpod would be designed for short-distance travel, with a maximum speed of 50 mph.",
    "The \"Hyperloop\": A high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum technology to propel passengers through a series of tubes. The Hyperloop would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 700 mph, making it ideal for long-distance travel between major cities. It would be powered by clean, renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power.",
    "The \"Flying Car\": A small, electric-powered car that can take off and land vertically. It would be designed for short-distance travel, with a maximum speed of 100 mph. The Flying Car would be equipped with a range of safety features, such as automatic landing systems and collision avoidance.",
    "The \"Maglev Train\": A high-speed train that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel passengers through the air. It would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 300 mph, making it ideal for long-distance travel between major cities. The Maglev Train would be powered by clean, renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power."
