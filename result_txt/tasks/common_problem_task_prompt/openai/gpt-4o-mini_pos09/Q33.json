    "**Food Sources**: Finding enough food to sustain oneself can be challenging. There may be limited vegetation, lack of edible fruits, or absence of wildlife for hunting. Problems could arise from malnutrition or starvation. A creative solution would be to learn about foraging techniques, identify edible plants, and set traps for small animals or fish using natural materials found on the island.",
    "**Shelter Construction**: The need for shelter from the elements is crucial for survival. Without proper shelter, exposure to rain, wind, or sun can lead to health issues like hypothermia or sunburn. To combat this, one could gather fallen branches, leaves, and palm fronds to build a sturdy, insulated shelter that can protect against harsh weather conditions.",
    "**Navigation and Orientation**: Being stranded can lead to disorientation and difficulty in determining oneâ€™s location or the direction of potential rescue. This could result in wandering away from a safe area or missing opportunities for rescue. A creative approach would involve using natural landmarks, the position of the sun, and stars for navigation, as well as creating a makeshift compass using a leaf and a needle.",
    "**Mental Health Challenges**: Isolation can take a toll on mental health, leading to feelings of loneliness, despair, or anxiety. The lack of social interaction and familiar comforts can exacerbate these feelings. To maintain mental well-being, one could establish a daily routine, practice mindfulness through meditation, and engage in self-talk or journaling on available materials to process thoughts and emotions.",
    "**Injury or Illness**: Injuries from falls, cuts, or encounters with wildlife can lead to infections or complications without proper medical care. Additionally, the stress of survival can weaken the immune system. A solution would be to learn about basic first aid using natural remedies from the environment, such as using certain plants for antiseptic properties or creating splints from sticks."
