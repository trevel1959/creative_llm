    "Customizable Smart Frame: Create a picture frame that can be customized to fit any size or shape of photo, and includes a built-in smart display that can rotate through various angles and lighting effects. Users can also connect their smartphones or tablets to the frame to display their favorite photos, or even use it as a mirror.",
    "Augmented Reality Frame: Develop a picture frame that utilizes augmented reality technology to bring the photo to life. When a user places a photo in the frame, the AR technology superimposes additional elements, such as 3D models, animations, or even video, onto the image. This creates a unique and interactive experience for the viewer.",
    "Personalized Memory Frame: Design a picture frame that can hold multiple photos and automatically creates a slideshow of memories based on the dates, locations, and events associated with each photo. The frame can also use facial recognition technology to identify the people in each photo and display their names or captions.",
    "Interactive Art Frame: Create a picture frame that doubles as an interactive art piece. The frame contains a built-in speaker and LED lights that react to the music or sounds playing in the room. When a user places a photo in the frame, the lights and sounds will synchronize with the image, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.",
    "Environmental Sensing Frame: Develop a picture frame that can detect and respond to the environment around it. For example, when a user places a photo in the frame and the room becomes too bright, the frame can adjust the lighting conditions to create a more comfortable viewing experience. Similarly, if the room becomes too hot or cold, the frame can adjust the temperature to create a more comfortable environment for the viewer."
