    "**Modular Skateboard Design**: Create a skateboard with a modular design that allows riders to easily swap out components, such as the deck, wheels, and trucks. This could enable customization based on personal style, riding style, or terrain. For example, a rider could switch to larger wheels for cruising or smaller wheels for tricks. This modularity would also allow for easy repairs and upgrades, promoting sustainability by reducing waste.",
    "**Self-Balancing Technology**: Incorporate gyroscopic stabilization technology into the skateboard to help beginners maintain balance while riding. This feature would use sensors to detect the rider's weight distribution and adjust the skateboard's position accordingly, making it easier for novices to learn how to ride without falling. This could also appeal to older riders or those with mobility challenges, making skateboarding more accessible.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable and biodegradable materials, such as bamboo, recycled plastics, or bio-composites. Not only would this help reduce the environmental impact of skateboarding, but it could also attract eco-conscious consumers. Additionally, the skateboard could be designed to decompose safely at the end of its life cycle, promoting a circular economy.",
    "**Interactive LED Lights**: Equip the skateboard with customizable LED lights that can change colors and patterns based on the rider's movements or music beats. This feature could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing riders to showcase their personality and creativity while skating at night. The lights could also serve as safety features, making the rider more visible to others in low-light conditions.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speakers**: Integrate high-quality Bluetooth speakers into the skateboard, allowing riders to listen to music or podcasts while they skate. The speakers could be designed to be weather-resistant and durable, ensuring they withstand the rigors of outdoor use. This feature would enhance the overall skateboarding experience, making it more enjoyable and engaging, especially for long rides or group outings."
