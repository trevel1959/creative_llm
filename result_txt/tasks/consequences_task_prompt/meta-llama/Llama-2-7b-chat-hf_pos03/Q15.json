    "Global Transition to Renewable Energy Sources: If the world were to run out of oil, it would be a catastrophic event with far-reaching implications. The first and most obvious implication would be a complete shift towards renewable energy sources. This would involve investing heavily in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy to power homes, industries, and transportation. This transition would not only reduce the world's reliance on oil but also significantly reduce carbon emissions, leading to a decrease in global warming and climate change.",
    "Electric Vehicles as the Primary Mode of Transportation: With the depletion of oil, the cost of gasoline would skyrocket, making it unaffordable for most people. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) would become the primary mode of transportation. EVs are already becoming more affordable and practical, and a global shortage of oil would accelerate their adoption. Governments would need to invest in building out charging infrastructure to support the transition. This would not only reduce the world's reliance on oil but also lead to a significant reduction in air pollution.",
    "Hyperloop Systems: A world without oil would require new and innovative transportation systems to connect cities and regions. Hyperloop systems, which use vacuum-sealed tubes to transport passengers at high speeds, could become a viable alternative to traditional rail and air travel. These systems would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, making them both efficient and environmentally friendly.",
    "Vertical Farming and Agricultural Innovation: With the scarcity of arable land and water, vertical farming and other innovative agricultural practices would become essential to feed the world's population. Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in indoor environments, using hydroponics, aeroponics, or other methods. This approach can increase crop yields while minimizing land use and water consumption. Other innovations, such as using algae as a source of protein or developing new, drought-resistant crop varieties, could also help address food security challenges.",
