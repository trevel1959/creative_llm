    "**Innovative Smart Light Bulb with Mood-Adjusting Capabilities**: This light bulb would be equipped with a built-in AI system that can recognize and adjust its color temperature and brightness based on the user's mood or activity. For example, it could automatically switch to warmer, more soothing colors for relaxation, or brighter, cooler tones for focus and productivity. The system would also learn from user preferences over time, adapting to provide the best lighting experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Light Bulb**: Design a light bulb made from natural, biodegradable materials such as bamboo or corn starch. This would significantly reduce the environmental impact of discarded bulbs. The bulb would also be designed to last longer than traditional bulbs, minimizing the frequency of replacements needed. Additionally, the packaging would be made from compostable materials to complete the eco-friendly cycle.",
    "**Interactive Light Bulb with Augmented Reality (AR) Features**: Combine a smart light bulb with AR technology. Users could project images or information onto any surface in their room using their smartphone. For instance, they could display a digital book, a virtual art gallery, or even an interactive game that uses the room itself as a canvas. The bulb would serve as the projector, and its color and brightness would adapt to optimize the viewing experience.",
    "**Scented Light Bulbs for Enhanced Sensory Experiences**: Develop a light bulb that incorporates small, scent-emitting capsules inside. These capsules could release fragrances that complement the light's color and mood. For example, a warm yellow light could be accompanied by a calming lavender scent, while a cool blue light might pair with a fresh, minty aroma. This would create a multi-sensory environment, enhancing relaxation, focus, or enjoyment during different activities.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Aid Light Bulb**: Create a light bulb that adapts to the user's sleep patterns. It would start emitting blue light during the day to boost energy and alertness, gradually switching to warmer hues as evening approaches to prepare the body for sleep. The bulb could also detect light exposure and adjust accordingly, ensuring the room is dark enough for restful sleep. Additionally, it might include a feature to slowly dim the light over time, helping users wind down before bedtime."
