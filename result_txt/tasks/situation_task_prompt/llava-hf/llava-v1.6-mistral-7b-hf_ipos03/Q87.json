    "**Bone Saw Survival**: In a more extreme scenario, a person could use a bone saw to cut through various materials. Although it's not the most precise tool, it could be used for cutting larger items like branches or thick materials.",
    "**Solar-Powered Cutting Tool**: In a scenario where technology is still available, a solar-powered cutting tool could be invented. It would use the energy from the sun to create an electric current, which could be used to power a small motor to cut through materials.",
    "**Laser Cutting**: If a person had access to a laser cutter, they could use it to cut through various materials with precision and ease. Although it might not be as common as scissors or knives, it would be a highly effective solution."
