    "**Solar Panel Umbrella**: Design a portable, compact solar panel umbrella that can be easily carried around. This umbrella would not only provide shade but also generate electricity to charge devices or power small appliances. The solar panels would be integrated into the umbrella's canopy, allowing for efficient energy harvesting even on cloudy days. The umbrella's structure would be designed to be sturdy and wind-resistant, ensuring it remains stable in various weather conditions.",
    "**Bioluminescent Plant Wall**: Develop a living wall system that incorporates bioluminescent plants, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria-infused plants. These plants would absorb light during the day and emit a soft, ethereal glow at night, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution. The living wall would not only purify the air but also create a mesmerizing display of natural light.",
    "**LED Fiber Optic Lanterns**: Create a series of LED fiber optic lanterns that can be suspended from buildings or trees. These lanterns would use thin, flexible fibers to transmit light from a central source, creating a beautiful, fiber-optic-like effect. The lanterns would be powered by a combination of solar panels and energy-harvesting technologies, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Paint**: Develop a special type of paint that absorbs light during the day and emits a soft glow at night. This paint could be applied to buildings, streets, or other surfaces, creating a network of glowing pathways and landmarks. The paint would be made from non-toxic, environmentally friendly materials and would be easy to apply and maintain.",
    "**Personal Light Generation**: Design a wearable device that generates light using advanced nanotechnology or piezoelectric materials. This device would convert kinetic energy from the wearer's movements into light, allowing them to generate their own illumination. The device would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery and would be adjustable to different light levels and colors, making it a versatile and innovative solution for personal lighting needs.
