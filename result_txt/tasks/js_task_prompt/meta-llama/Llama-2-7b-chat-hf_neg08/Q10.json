    "\"What if the Berlin Wall never fell?\": The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era of global politics.

Imagine a world where the division between communist and capitalist ideologies still existed, and the implications of such a change would be profound."
