    "**Bioluminescent Gardens**: Develop bioluminescent gardens using genetically modified plants that emit a soft, natural light. These gardens could be planted in public spaces and residential areas, providing a gentle illumination that not only beautifies the landscape but also serves as a light source during the day. This sustainable approach would create a unique aesthetic while offering a natural alternative to artificial lighting.",
    "**Light-Reflecting Materials**: Innovate new materials that can reflect and amplify existing light sources. These materials could be used in the construction of buildings, streets, and public spaces to maximize the amount of light available from artificial sources. By incorporating these reflective materials into architecture and urban design, the ambient light would be enhanced, creating a brighter environment even without the sun.",
    "**Community Light Sharing Programs**: Establish community light-sharing programs where households and businesses can share their lighting resources. For example, individuals could register their outdoor lighting systems (like solar lights, LED floodlights, etc.) on a shared platform. During the day, these lights could be programmed to operate at reduced levels and then collectively brighten when needed, creating a network of shared illumination that can be accessed by everyone in the community.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Light Apps**: Develop an augmented reality application that allows users to visualize and project light in their immediate environment using their devices. By utilizing advanced AR technology, users could create virtual light sources that overlay their surroundings, helping them navigate and brighten their day-to-day activities without relying solely on physical light sources.",
    "**Floating Light Drones**: Create a fleet of autonomous drones equipped with powerful LED lights that can hover and provide illumination. These drones would be programmed to follow specific routes or respond to areas that need more light. They could be deployed in urban centers or during events to ensure adequate lighting, while also being able to recharge their batteries using solar panels or wireless charging stations."
