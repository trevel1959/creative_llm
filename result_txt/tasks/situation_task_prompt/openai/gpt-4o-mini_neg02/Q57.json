    "**Sky Gardens**: High-rise buildings transformed into vertical farms and living spaces could be built in elevated areas. These structures would feature gardens on every level, capturing rainwater and utilizing hydroponics to grow food. Residents could live in these buildings, surrounded by greenery, while minimizing their carbon footprint. The rooftops could be equipped with solar panels and wind turbines to harness renewable energy, creating a sustainable living environment above the rising waters.",
    "**Underwater Communities**: Envision living in submerged habitats designed for resilience against rising sea levels. These structures would be built with transparent materials to allow natural light and views of marine life. Each community would include living quarters, communal spaces, and research facilities to study oceanic ecosystems. The design would incorporate energy-generating systems from tidal and wave energy, ensuring a sustainable lifestyle beneath the waves.",
    "**Mountaintop Retreats**: As ocean levels rise, relocating to higher altitudes could become essential. Communities could be established on mountaintops, where residents live in eco-friendly cabins or lodges made from locally sourced materials. These retreats would focus on off-grid living, using solar power, wind energy, and rainwater harvesting systems. The community could also promote eco-tourism, allowing visitors to experience nature while supporting sustainable practices.",
    "**Rooftop Eco-Villages**: Urban areas could adapt by creating rooftop eco-villages on top of existing buildings. These villages would consist of modular homes, community gardens, and shared amenities, all designed to promote sustainable living. The rooftops would be equipped with green roofs to absorb rainwater, provide insulation, and grow food. This idea allows cities to maximize their space while reducing the impact of rising sea levels on urban populations.",
    "**Desert Oasis Cities**: With ocean levels rising, certain coastal cities may become uninhabitable, leading to the development of desert oasis cities. These cities would be designed to thrive in arid environments, utilizing advanced technology for water conservation, such as atmospheric water generators. The architecture would focus on natural cooling methods, incorporating shades, reflective materials, and wind tunnels. These cities would also harness solar energy, promoting a self-sufficient lifestyle while creating a vibrant community."
