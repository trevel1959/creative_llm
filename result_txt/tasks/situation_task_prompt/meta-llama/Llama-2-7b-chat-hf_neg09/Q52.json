    "Utilize natural resources: In a world without cooking equipment, meals could be prepared using natural resources like rocks, sticks, and leaves. For example, rocks could be used as a makeshift grill to cook meat or vegetables, while sticks could be used as skewers. Leaves could be used as plates or as a wrapping for food.",
    "Use body heat: In a survival situation, the body can be used as a heat source to cook food. By huddling near a fire or using one's body heat to warm up food, meals could be prepared using this method. This would require minimal equipment and could be an effective way to cook food in a pinch.",
    "Create a makeshift oven: If there were no cooking equipment available, a makeshift oven could be created using natural materials like clay, mud, or rocks. By shaping these materials into a crude oven and placing it in a sunny location, food could be cooked using the heat of the sun. This method would require some time and effort to construct, but it could be an effective way to cook food without equipment.",
    "Use a solar oven: A solar oven is a device that uses the sun's heat to cook food. While not a traditional oven, a solar oven could be used in place of one in a survival situation. These ovens are designed to trap sunlight and convert it into heat, allowing for efficient cooking without the need for electricity or fuel.",
    "Forage for wild edibles: In a world without cooking equipment, foraging for wild edibles could be a viable option for obtaining food. Wild plants like berries, mushrooms, and herbs could be used to create a meal, providing a source of sustenance without the need for cooking equipment. This method would require knowledge of which plants are safe to eat and how to prepare them, but it could be an effective way to obtain food in a survival situation."
