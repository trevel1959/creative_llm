    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Contact Lenses**: Imagine contact lenses that not only correct vision but also provide a virtual overlay of the world, allowing people to see in high definition and with perfect clarity. These AR contact lenses would use advanced technology to project images, text, and even video onto the user's field of vision, effectively blurring the lines between reality and virtual reality. They would be powered by tiny microchips and energy harvesting technology, ensuring a seamless user experience.",
    "**Personalized 3D-Printed Vision Correction**: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need a new way to correct their vision. A solution could be 3D-printed vision correction implants that are tailored to each individual's unique eye shape and prescription. These implants would be made from biocompatible materials and would be implanted in the eye, providing a permanent and accurate correction of vision. The 3D printing technology would allow for rapid production and customization of these implants, making them accessible to everyone.",
    "**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Vision Restoration**: In a world without glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to restore their vision. BCIs would read brain signals and translate them into visual information, effectively bypassing the need for physical vision correction. This technology would be achieved through the development of neural implants that can read and write neural signals, allowing people to see the world around them in stunning detail.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Built-in Cameras**: Although traditional contact lenses disappeared, a new type of smart contact lens with built-in cameras could become the norm. These lenses would have a high-resolution camera that captures images of the world around the user, which could then be projected onto a virtual display or transmitted to a device for further processing. This would allow people with poor vision to navigate their surroundings with ease, and even capture high-quality photos and videos.",
    "**Artificial Intelligence-Powered Vision Assistants**: In a world without glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered vision assistants to help them navigate their surroundings. These assistants would be small, wearable devices that use AI to recognize objects, people, and environments, providing real-time audio or haptic feedback to the user. They would be trained on vast amounts of data and would learn to adapt to the user's needs and preferences over time, making them an indispensable tool for people with poor"
