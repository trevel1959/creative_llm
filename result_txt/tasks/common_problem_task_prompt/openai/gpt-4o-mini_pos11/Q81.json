    "**Budget Management**: Organizing a film festival often involves various expenses, including venue rental, marketing, and guest accommodations. Unexpected costs can lead to budget overruns. To mitigate this, establish a detailed budget with contingencies for unforeseen expenses and seek sponsorships or partnerships to supplement funds.",
    "**Film Selection Process**: Curating a diverse and engaging lineup of films can be challenging. There may be difficulties in acquiring rights for screenings, or the selected films may not appeal to the target audience. To address this, consider forming a diverse selection committee and using surveys or social media polls to gauge audience preferences.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion**: Effectively promoting the festival to attract attendees is essential. Challenges may include limited reach, low engagement on social media, or competition from other events. To overcome this, develop a multi-channel marketing strategy that includes traditional media, online advertising, and partnerships with local businesses to maximize visibility.",
    "**Guest Management**: Inviting filmmakers, critics, and other special guests can enhance the festival experience, but coordinating their schedules and travel arrangements can be complicated. Potential issues include miscommunication or last-minute cancellations. To streamline this process, create a detailed itinerary for guests and maintain open lines of communication to address any concerns promptly.",
    "**Technical Difficulties During Screenings**: Film festivals rely heavily on technology for presentations. Problems such as equipment failure, incompatible formats, or poor internet connections can disrupt screenings. To prepare for this, conduct thorough technical rehearsals before the festival and have backup equipment and IT support on standby during events."
