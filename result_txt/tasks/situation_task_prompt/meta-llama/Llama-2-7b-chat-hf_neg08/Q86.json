    "Use water and sand: In a world without soap, people could use water and sand to clean themselves. Sand has natural abrasive properties that can help remove dirt and grime from the skin. People could use a bucket of water and a small amount of sand to create a makeshift shower or bath.",
    "Create a soap-like substance from plants: Some plants, such as aloe vera, have natural cleansing properties that could be used as a substitute for soap. People could harvest the leaves or stems of these plants, mix them with water, and use the resulting mixture to clean their skin.",
    "Use animal fats and oils: In a world without soap, people could use animal fats and oils to clean themselves. These fats and oils have natural emulsifying properties that could help remove dirt and grime from the skin. People could melt the fats and oils and mix them with water to create a makeshift soap.",
    "Use clay and ash: Clay and ash have natural cleansing properties that could be used as a substitute for soap. People could mix clay and ash with water to create a paste that they could use to clean their skin. The clay and ash would help to absorb dirt and grime, while the water would help to rinse it away.",
    "Create a communal cleaning station: In a world without soap, people could come together to create a communal cleaning station. This could be a designated area where people could go to clean themselves, using the methods mentioned above or other creative solutions. This would allow people to work together to keep themselves clean and hygienic, despite the lack of soap."
