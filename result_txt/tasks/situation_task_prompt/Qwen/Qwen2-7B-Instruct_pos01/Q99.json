    "**Incorporating Textures**: Each object can be given unique textures that are not present in other items. For example, a book might have a rougher texture than a smooth plastic toy. This can help differentiate between various objects based on their tactile feel.",
    "**Distinctive Shapes**: Objects could have distinctive shapes that are easily recognizable. For instance, a ball is spherical, while a cube or a cylinder has flat surfaces. This can help in identifying objects by their geometrical forms.",
    "**Imbuing with Smell**: Each object could have a specific smell that is unique to it. For example, a banana might have a sweet, fruity aroma, whereas a pencil could have a slightly woodsy scent. This olfactory cue can help distinguish between items.",
    "**Using Sound**: Objects could make unique sounds when touched or moved. For instance, a bell would ring, while a wooden block might produce a dull thud. The auditory difference would allow one to identify objects through sound.",
    "**Varying Sizes**: Objects of similar materials but different sizes can still be differentiated by their size. A small button might be easier to recognize compared to a larger object like a bowl or a plate."
