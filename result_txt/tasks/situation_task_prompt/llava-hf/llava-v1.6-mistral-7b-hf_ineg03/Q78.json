    "Social Play: Children would focus more on social interactions and playing with each other, fostering cooperation, communication, and problem-solving skills. They could invent new games that require teamwork and collaboration, such as \"Follow the Leader\" or \"Simon Says\" without the need for props.",
    "Outdoor Exploration: Without toys, children might spend more time outdoors, exploring nature and their environment. They could create their own playgrounds using the natural resources available to them, such as trees, rocks, and water. This would encourage them to be more physically active and develop a greater appreciation for the outdoors.",
    "DIY Crafts: Children could engage in more DIY crafts, using materials they can find around the house to create their own toys or games. They could make puppets from socks, paper airplanes from paper, or cardboard fortresses from boxes. This would help develop their fine motor skills and creativity.",
    "Educational Activities: Parents and teachers could incorporate more educational activities into playtime, such as building model cities or creating dioramas. These activities would not only be entertaining but also help children develop important skills like spatial awareness, critical thinking, and planning.",
    "Coding and Technology: As technology becomes more accessible, children could learn to code and develop their own games or apps, turning their imagination into digital play. This would not only be a fun way to engage in play but also teach valuable skills like computer programming and digital literacy."
