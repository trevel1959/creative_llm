    "Skateboards: For those who enjoy a more active transportation method, a skateboard is a great option. It is portable and easy to use, and it offers a good workout while getting to your destination.",
    "Bicycle alternatives: If all bicycles disappeared, there are other non-motorized modes of transportation, such as kickbikes, scooters, roller skates, or a hippopotamus, depending on your sense of humor. However, these are not practical options for long-distance commutes.",
    "Public transportation: If you live in an area with a well-developed public transportation system, you could rely on buses, trains, or subways to get around. However, this option is limited to urban areas and may not be an option in rural or suburban areas.",
    "Walking: Walking is always an option, and it is free, healthy, and environmentally friendly. However, walking long distances can be time-consuming and tiring.",
    "Motorcycle or moped: A motorcycle or moped is a motorized option that can be faster than walking or cycling. It is also fuel-efficient, especially for short to medium distance commutes. However, it may not be practical for long-distance travel and requires a motorcycle or moped license."
