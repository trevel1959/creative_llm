    "Augmented Reality Glasses: Create a pair of glasses with an augmented reality (AR) interface that enhances your daily experiences. With these glasses, you could overlay digital information and visuals onto the real world, making everyday tasks more engaging and interactive. For example, when you're cooking, the glasses could display step-by-step instructions, or when you're walking down the street, they could show you historical facts about the buildings and landmarks around you.",
    "Smart Glasses with AI Assistant: Develop a pair of glasses with an integrated AI assistant that can help you with your daily tasks and answer any questions you may have. The AI could be activated by voice commands or gestures, and could provide information on everything from weather forecasts to traffic updates to personalized recommendations for restaurants and events.",
    "Virtual Reality Gaming Glasses: Create a pair of glasses that allow you to play immersive virtual reality games without the need for a separate VR headset. The glasses could use advanced display technology to create a 360-degree virtual environment, and could be controlled using hand gestures or voice commands.",
    "Smart Glasses with Brain-Computer Interface: Develop a pair of glasses with a brain-computer interface that allows you to control devices with your thoughts. The glasses could use electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to detect electrical activity in your brain, and could be used to control everything from smartphones to smart homes.",
    "Glasses with Personalized Lighting: Create a pair of glasses with built-in lighting that adjusts to your mood and environment. The glasses could use sensors to detect changes in light levels and color temperature, and could adjust the lighting accordingly. For example, if you're feeling stressed, the glasses could emit a warm, calming light, while if you're feeling energized, they could emit a cool, stimulating light."
