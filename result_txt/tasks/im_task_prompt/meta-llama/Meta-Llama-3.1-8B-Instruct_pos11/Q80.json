In this realm, individuals can enter each other's dreams, influencing and shaping the subconscious experiences of others.

However, as the years pass, the inhabitants of the Last Refuge begin to question the true nature of their existence and the motives of those who created this underground sanctuary.

However, as the rich become increasingly detached from reality, the city begins to unravel, and the fabric of time itself starts to fray.
