    "A floating city: With the rise of sea levels, people could construct floating cities that are designed to withstand high water levels. These cities could be built on platforms or barges and equipped with advanced technology such as renewable energy sources and water purification systems. They could also have their own infrastructure, including roads, buildings, and parks.",
    "Underground habitats: Another option for those affected by rising sea levels is to build underground habitats. These habitats could be constructed in areas that are naturally below sea level, or they could be dug into the ground using advanced drilling techniques. The underground habitats could be equipped with everything needed for human habitation, including food, water, and air.",
    "Eco-tourism destinations: As sea levels rise, many coastal areas may become uninhabitable. However, some of these areas could be transformed into eco-tourism destinations. People could visit these destinations to see the effects of climate change firsthand, while also learning about sustainable living practices.",
    "Space colonies: In the event that the Earth becomes too uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, space colonization could become a viable option. Governments and private companies could invest in building space stations or other habitable structures that can support human life. These structures could be located in orbit around the Earth or even beyond our solar system.",
    "Virtual reality experiences: Finally, if rising sea levels make it impossible to live in certain areas, people could experience these changes through virtual reality technology. Virtual reality experiences could allow people to explore coastal areas that have been affected by climate change, giving them a sense of what it might be like to live in a world where sea levels have risen dramatically."
