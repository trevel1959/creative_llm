    "**Material Selection**: Choosing the right materials for the spaceship is crucial. The materials used in construction must be lightweight yet strong, capable of withstanding the stresses of launch, landing, and the rigors of space travel. Additionally, they must be able to withstand the extreme temperatures and radiation that can be encountered in space.",
    "**Energy Consumption**: Spaceships require a significant amount of energy to operate, especially for long-distance missions. The energy source must be reliable and sustainable, such as nuclear power or solar panels. The challenge lies in finding a balance between the energy requirements and the weight of the spacecraft.",
    "**Human Factors**: The design must take into account the needs and limitations of the astronauts who will be aboard the spaceship. This includes providing adequate living space, sanitation facilities, and provisions for exercise and mental well-being. The design must also consider the potential for long-term isolation and the psychological effects of confinement in a small, enclosed space.",
    "**Emergency Preparedness**: The spaceship must be equipped with emergency systems and procedures to handle unexpected situations, such as equipment failures, medical emergencies, or damage to the spacecraft. This includes redundant systems, emergency life support, and a plan for evacuation in case of a crash landing or other emergency.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: The design of a spaceship raises ethical questions, such as the potential for human experimentation, the treatment of animals used for testing, and the use of resources in the pursuit of space exploration. The design must be guided by ethical principles and consider the potential impact on society and the environment."
