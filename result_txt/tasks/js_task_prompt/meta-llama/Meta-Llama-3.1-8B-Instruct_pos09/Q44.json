    "The animal I'd like to create is called Luminaris, a fusion of the words light and wonder. It has a shimmering iridescent coat with the ability to generate and control light from specialized bioluminescent cells. The scales reflect colors based on its mood, environment, and social context, like a living version of an aurora borealis.",
    "Next is Terrawing, a powerful but agile air-breathing reptile from coastal areas. Its forelimbs are modified with wide, fan-shaped sails that create whirlwinds when flapping, using wind resistance for efficient flight and navigation through narrow air spaces.",
    "Lastly, I'll design a unique creature: Corallina. Its large, branching skeletal structure supports colorful organisms, serving as a miniature aquarium environment around its body, offering self-sustaining ecosystems wherever it roams. Its slow movement is facilitated by a mechanism combining fluid dynamics and mechanical parts to maintain buoyancy and flow. This enables it to glide seamlessly and feed with a unique combination of movement and food absorption. With this self-generated ecosystem, Corallina is an independent entity that could serve as an educational model and promote appreciation for biodiversity and ecosystem health.",
    "**Motion Control System: Flex and Glide** - Implementing an ability for controlled navigation and agile motion through various environmental challenges demonstrates an efficient approach to traversing an obstacle course.",
