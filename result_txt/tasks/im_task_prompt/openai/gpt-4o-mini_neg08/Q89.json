    "**Multi-Functional Waffle Iron**: Design a waffle iron that can also function as a grill and a panini press. With interchangeable plates, users can make waffles, grill sandwiches, and even cook other breakfast items like pancakes or eggs. This would cater to those with limited kitchen space, providing multiple cooking options in one appliance.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Waffle Iron**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses steam technology to clean the plates after use. This would eliminate the hassle of scrubbing off stuck batter and make the waffle-making experience much more enjoyable. Users could simply add water, press a button, and let the appliance do the work.",
    "**Customizable Waffle Shapes and Sizes**: Introduce a waffle iron that allows users to change the shape and size of their waffles by swapping out different plates or using a customizable mold. This could include fun shapes for kids, larger portions for adults, or even mini waffles for bite-sized treats. The versatility would encourage creativity in meal presentation.",
    "**Temperature Control and Cooking Time Settings**: Enhance the waffle iron with adjustable temperature settings and cooking time options, allowing users to experiment with different batter types and achieve their desired level of crispiness. A digital display could show the current temperature and timer, providing precise control over the cooking process.",
    "**Recipe and Ingredient Dispenser**: Integrate a built-in dispenser that measures and pours the batter directly into the waffle iron. Users could load the dispenser with their favorite waffle batter ingredients, and the appliance would automatically mix and dispense the correct amount, reducing mess and ensuring consistency in waffle size."
