    "Scissors with Built-in Cutting Boards: Create a pair of scissors with a built-in cutting board, making it easier to cut and organize materials without the need for a separate cutting board. The cutting board could be made of a durable, dishwasher-safe material and have measurements marked on it for easy measurement.",
    "Scissors with LED Light: Design a pair of scissors with an integrated LED light that illuminates the area where you are cutting, providing better visibility and safety, especially when working in low-light environments. The light could be powered by a rechargeable battery or solar power.",
    "Scissors with Built-in Ruler: Create a pair of scissors with a built-in ruler that can be easily viewed and used for measuring and cutting materials. The ruler could be marked with metric and imperial units for versatility.",
    "Scissors with Vibration Feature: Design a pair of scissors with a vibration feature that helps to cut through thick or tough materials more efficiently. The vibration could be adjustable, allowing users to customize the level of vibration to their preference.",
    "Scissors with a Detachable Handle: Create a pair of scissors with a detachable handle that can be swapped out with different handles for different tasks. For example, a handle with a larger grip could be used for heavy-duty cutting, while a smaller handle could be used for more precise work. The detachable handle could also make the scissors more comfortable to hold and use for extended periods of time."
