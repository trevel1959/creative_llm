    "Develop biological control methods: Develop biological control methods, such as using pheromones or genetically modified insects, to reduce the insect population without using harmful chemicals. This would help to preserve the environment and promote sustainable agriculture.",
    "Use insect-repellent plants: Plant insect-repellent plants, such as lavender, marigolds, and basil, around crops to deter insects from feeding on them. This would provide a natural barrier and reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Develop integrated pest management: Develop integrated pest management strategies that combine different methods, such as biological control, cultural practices, and chemical control, to reduce the need for harmful chemicals and promote sustainable agriculture.",
    "Use traps and barriers: Use traps and barriers, such as sticky traps and netting, to catch and deter insects from entering crops. This would help to reduce the damage caused by insects and promote sustainable agriculture.",
    "Promote crop rotation: Promote crop rotation to reduce the risk of insect infestations and promote soil health. This would help to reduce the need for chemical pesticides and promote sustainable agriculture."
