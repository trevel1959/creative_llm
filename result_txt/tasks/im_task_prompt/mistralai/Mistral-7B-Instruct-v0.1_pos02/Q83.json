    "Create a personalized shopping cart: Develop an algorithm that learns your preferences and shopping habits to create a personalized shopping cart for you. For example, if you tend to buy the same brands of products every time you shop, the algorithm could suggest new products from those brands or recommend products that are often purchased together.",
    "Virtual Try-On: Create a virtual try-on feature that allows you to see how clothes, makeup, and accessories would look on you before you make a purchase. This feature could be especially helpful for online shoppers who are unable to try on products before buying.",
    "Social Shopping: Integrate social media into the shopping cart experience by allowing users to share their shopping carts with friends and get feedback. Users could also see what products their friends are purchasing and add them to their own cart.",
    "Augmented Reality: Use augmented reality to enhance the shopping cart experience. For example, users could use their smartphone camera to see how furniture would look in their home before making a purchase.",
    "Price Matching: Implement a price matching feature that compares prices of the same product from different retailers and offers the lowest price. This feature could help users save money and make more informed purchasing decisions."
