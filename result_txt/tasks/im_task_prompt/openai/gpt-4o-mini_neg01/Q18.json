    "**Smart Windshield**: Develop a windshield that incorporates augmented reality (AR) to display real-time information. This could include navigation prompts, speed limits, weather updates, and even alerts for nearby hazards. The AR system could use a heads-up display (HUD) to project these details directly onto the windshield, allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road while still receiving essential information.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bio-Interior**: Create car interiors made from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, organic textiles, and bio-based composites. This would not only reduce the carbon footprint of car manufacturing but also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The interior could be designed to be modular, allowing for easy replacement and upgrades of components as materials improve or as consumer preferences change.",
    "**Personalized Climate Zones**: Introduce an advanced climate control system that creates personalized temperature zones for each passenger. Utilizing smart sensors and AI, the system could learn individual preferences over time, adjusting the temperature, humidity, and even air quality to ensure maximum comfort for every occupant. Passengers could also control their zones via a mobile app or voice commands.",
    "**AI-Powered Maintenance Alerts**: Equip cars with an AI system that monitors the vehicle's performance in real-time, providing proactive maintenance alerts. This system could analyze data from various sensors and predict when parts are likely to fail or need servicing. Notifications could be sent to the driverâ€™s smartphone, along with recommendations for nearby service centers, making car maintenance more efficient and reducing the risk of breakdowns.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate a health monitoring system that tracks vital signs such as heart rate and stress levels through sensors embedded in the seat and steering wheel. If the system detects concerning health metrics, it could alert the driver and suggest taking a break or even automatically navigate to the nearest hospital if necessary. This feature could be particularly beneficial for long-distance drivers or those with pre-existing health conditions."
