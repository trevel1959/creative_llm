    "Utilize raised beds: Since the ground is too hard to dig into, consider constructing raised beds using wooden or plastic frames with good drainage. This will provide a nutrient-rich environment for your plants to grow without the need for extensive digging.",
    "Hydroponics: Take advantage of the hard ground by exploring hydroponics, a method of growing plants in water rather than soil. This eliminates the need for soil and allows for optimal water retention and nutrient distribution.",
    "Vertical gardening: Build a vertical garden using trellises, arbors, or wall-mounted planters. This will make the most of the available space and allow you to grow a variety of plants, even in a small area.",
    "Geotextiles: Utilize geotextiles, such as landscape fabric or burlap, to create a barrier between the hard ground and your garden. This will help to retain moisture and prevent soil erosion, allowing your plants to thrive in the challenging conditions.",
    "Solar-powered irrigation: Harness the power of the sun to irrigate your garden using solar-powered pumps or drip irrigation systems. This will not only conserve water but also reduce your carbon footprint and make your garden more sustainable."
