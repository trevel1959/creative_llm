    "Piano-themed escape room:  Create an immersive escape room experience where participants are trapped in a room filled with pianos. They must solve puzzles and clues hidden within the instruments to escape before time runs out. Each piano could have a unique mechanism or sound effect that triggers a specific puzzle or clue. For example, a grand piano could have a hidden compartment under the lid that reveals a cryptic message when opened.",
    "Piano-powered augmented reality game:  Develop an AR game where players use a smartphone or tablet app to play a virtual piano on a digital surface. As they play, the game world around them changes based on the music they create. For example, notes played in a major key could summon colorful flowers, while minor notes could create a stormy weather effect. The game could also include multiplayer features, allowing players to collaborate on a virtual piano performance and affect the game world together.",
    "Piano-inspired fashion collection:  Create a clothing line inspired by the shape and sound of pianos. Design pieces that resemble the curves and lines of a piano, such as a dress with a ruffled skirt that mimics the keys, or a jacket with a pattern of interlocking keys on the fabric. Each piece in the collection could be named after a different piano key, and the models could wear headpieces or accessories that resemble piano pedals or keys.",
    "Piano-themed art installation:  Create an immersive art installation that transforms a large room into a grand piano. The walls, floor, and ceiling are covered in piano keys, creating a three-dimensional keyboard that surrounds the viewer. As visitors walk through the installation, they trigger sounds and lights that emanate from the \"piano,\" creating a dynamic and interactive experience. The installation could also include visual projections or holographic displays that create the illusion of a piano performance.",
    "Piano-powered storytelling device:  Develop a device that uses piano keys to tell a story. Each key could represent a different character, scene, or plot point in a story, and as the user presses the keys, the device could display a corresponding image or animation. The device could also include sensors that detect the user's emotional state, adjusting the story based on their mood"
