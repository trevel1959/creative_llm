    "**Temperature Control Feature**: Design a yoga mat with adjustable temperature settings. Using conductive materials and embedded heating elements, the mat can warm up to soothe muscles before practice or cool down to refresh after an intense session. This feature would cater to different preferences and help enhance relaxation during savasana or restorative poses.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Aromatherapy**: Create a yoga mat made from sustainable materials that incorporates microcapsules of essential oils. When pressure is applied during practice, the microcapsules release calming scents like lavender or eucalyptus, enhancing the yoga experience and promoting relaxation. This feature would appeal to eco-conscious consumers while also providing sensory benefits.",
    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Develop a modular yoga mat that allows users to customize the thickness, texture, and firmness according to their personal preferences. Users could easily attach or detach different sections of the mat to create a personalized practice space that suits their needs, whether they prefer a softer surface for restorative poses or a firmer one for balance work.",
    "**Interactive Guided Sessions**: Integrate a built-in audio system into the mat that connects to a companion app. The mat could provide guided sessions with voice instructions, background music, or nature sounds, creating an immersive yoga experience. Users could select different themes (e.g., calming beach sounds or invigorating forest ambiance) to enhance their practice and motivation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV-C light to sanitize the mat after each use. This technology would help eliminate bacteria and odors, ensuring that the mat remains hygienic without the need for frequent washing. This feature would be particularly appealing for yoga studios or practitioners who travel frequently."
