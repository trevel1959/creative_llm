    "Braille-to-Speech Gloves: Design a wearable device that converts Braille letters into spoken words, allowing visually impaired individuals to read and communicate more easily. The device could be a pair of gloves with small raised dots on the fingertips that correspond to different Braille letters. When the user touches their fingertips to a surface, the device would use sensors to detect the raised dots and convert them into spoken words using text-to-speech technology.",
    "Smart Cane with Object Recognition: Develop a smart cane that can recognize objects in the user's surroundings and provide audio or tactile feedback. The cane could use a combination of sensors, including ultrasonic, infrared, and RGB cameras, to detect objects and their distance from the user. The device could also include a vibration motor to provide tactile feedback or an audio speaker to announce the object's name or description.",
    "Virtual Reality Navigation for the Blind: Create a virtual reality (VR) system that allows visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings more easily. The VR system could use a headset with a built-in camera and sensors to detect the user's surroundings and provide a 3D audio-visual representation of the environment. The user could use voice commands or hand gestures to interact with the virtual environment and navigate to specific locations.",
    "AI-Powered Image Description: Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can describe images to visually impaired individuals. The algorithm could be trained on a large dataset of images and their corresponding descriptions, allowing it to recognize patterns and generate accurate descriptions for new images. The AI-powered image description could be provided through a mobile app or web service, allowing users to access detailed descriptions of images they encounter in their daily lives.",
    "Binaural Audio for Sound Localization: Create a binaural audio system that can help visually impaired individuals localize sounds more easily. The system could use a pair of headphones with advanced signal processing algorithms to create a 3D audio experience, allowing the user to pinpoint the source of sounds more accurately. This technology could be particularly useful for visually impaired individuals in noisy environments, as it could help them navigate and identify sounds"
