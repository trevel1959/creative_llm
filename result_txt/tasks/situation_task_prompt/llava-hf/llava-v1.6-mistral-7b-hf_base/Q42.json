    "Find food and water: Your next priority would be to find food and water. Look for fruits, vegetables, and other edible plants on the island and nearby shorelines. You can also explore the island for natural water sources like streams and springs or dig a hole to create a rainwater harvesting system.",
    "Signal for rescue: Your next goal should be to alert rescue teams of your location. You can use the island's vegetation to create a signal fire or a large SOS symbol on the beach. Additionally, try to use any electronic devices you have with you or mark the location on a map that can be seen from a distance.",
    "Make a fishing pond: The island may not have a natural water source, so you can create your own fishing pond to catch fish. Dig a hole in the sand and fill it with fresh water and saltwater to create a habitat for small fish. Additionally, use rocks, branches, and plants to make a simple fish trap.",
    "Create a solar oven: If you have nothing to eat or drink, make a solar oven using materials from the island. This will help you cook and purify the water you collect on the island.",
    "Make a raft: If you need to escape the island or move to a new location, make a raft using materials like driftwood and branches. The raft can be used to navigate around the island and reach nearby shores."
