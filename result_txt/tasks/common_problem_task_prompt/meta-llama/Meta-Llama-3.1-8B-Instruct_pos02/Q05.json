    "**Eco-Friendly Treehouse with Living Walls**: Design a treehouse that incorporates living walls, which are walls covered in plants and greenery. This not only provides a natural and calming environment but also helps to purify the air and create a unique ecosystem. The treehouse could be built using sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood, and feature a green roof to further reduce its carbon footprint.",
    "**Treehouse with a Hidden Entrance**: Create a treehouse with a hidden entrance that blends seamlessly into the surrounding environment. The entrance could be disguised as a natural feature, such as a hollowed-out tree trunk or a rocky outcropping. This would add an element of adventure and surprise to the treehouse experience.",
    "**Treehouse with a Vertical Garden**: Design a treehouse with a vertical garden that wraps around the exterior of the structure. This would provide a unique opportunity to grow a variety of plants and flowers, and could even include a small greenhouse or conservatory for starting seeds or propagating plants.",
    "**Treehouse with a Tree-Climbing Wall**: Incorporate a tree-climbing wall into the design of the treehouse, allowing users to climb up to the structure using natural rock formations or wooden holds. This would add an element of physical activity and adventure to the treehouse experience.",
    "**Treehouse with a Observatory Deck**: Create a treehouse with an observatory deck that offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The deck could be designed with a retractable roof or walls to allow for stargazing on clear nights, and could even include a telescope or binoculars for closer observation of the night sky."
