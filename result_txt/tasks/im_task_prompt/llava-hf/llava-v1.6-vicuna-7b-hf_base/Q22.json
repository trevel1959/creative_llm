    "Bike attachment: Design a magnetic mounting system to attach the flashlight to the top of a bike, allowing the rider to easily access it for hands-free illumination. This could help improve safety while riding in low-light conditions.",
    "Bike light system: Convert the flashlight into a bike light system that can be attached to the handlebars or front fork. This would provide better visibility for the rider and other cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents.",
    "Tactical flashlight: Design a tactical flashlight with multiple adjustable settings, including a high-intensity spotlight, low-light floodlight, and even a red-light setting for night vision. This would make the flashlight more versatile and useful in a range of situations.",
    "Waterproof case: Create a waterproof case that can be attached to the flashlight to protect it from water damage when not in use. This would be particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts or those who participate in water sports.",
    "Expandable handle: Design an expandable handle that can be attached to the flashlight, giving it the ability to extend to several feet in length. This would make it easier to reach high shelves, climb stairs, and perform other tasks that require extended reach."
