    "**Personalized Travel Journal**: Design a suitcase that includes a built-in diary or journal inside. This suitcase could have a removable divider which converts into a book. It could also come equipped with a stylus for digital note-taking, or perhaps a small tablet holder for those who prefer digital over traditional paper. The suitcase could feature sections for travel memories, daily entries, travel itinerary planning, photos, and souvenirs collected during trips.",
    "**Smart Suitcase with Augmented Reality Navigation**: Integrate an AR app that helps users navigate through unfamiliar airports. The suitcase could have a built-in camera that projects an AR map onto the suitcase's lid, showing the user their current location, their destination, and directions. It might also include real-time flight information and customs queue times.",
    "**Sustainable Suitcase Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a suitcase made entirely out of recycled materials like plastic bottles, old tires, or discarded fishing nets. The design could incorporate solar panels on the exterior to charge a built-in battery, powering LED lights, a small fan, or even a mini speaker for ambient sounds during travel. ",
    "**Health-Focused Suitcase with Built-in Fitness Tracking**: Incorporate a smart scale into the suitcase that tracks weight, BMI, and even heart rate when the user steps on it. This could be paired with a companion app that offers personalized workout plans, nutrition tips, and sleep quality analysis based on the userâ€™s daily routine and habits.",
    "**Multi-functional Suitcase with Expandable Dividers**: Design a suitcase that can expand and contract based on the user's needs. The dividers inside the suitcase can be adjusted according to the size of the items being packed. It could also come with an adjustable internal light to help locate items easily in dark spaces. This feature is particularly useful for those who often carry different types of gear for various activities (e.g., business travelers, photographers, sports enthusiasts)."
