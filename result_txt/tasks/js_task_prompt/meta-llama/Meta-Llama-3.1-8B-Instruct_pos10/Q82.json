    "**Luminbloom**: A plant that blooms only under the light of the full moon. Its petals would be made of a specialized, bioluminescent material that absorbs and stores energy during the day, releasing a soft, ethereal glow at night. The Luminbloom's leaves would be shaped like delicate, curved wings, allowing it to harness and redirect moonlight to maximize its glow. Its fragrance would be a heady mix of moonflower and jasmine, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths and fireflies.",
    "**Aeropex**: A plant that thrives in the upper atmosphere, where air is thin and temperatures are extreme. The Aeropex would have adapted to these conditions by developing a network of thin, membranous leaves that allow it to photosynthesize in the weak upper-atmospheric light. Its roots would be anchored to floating debris or cloud formations, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The Aeropex's flowers would be shaped like delicate, crystalline structures that refract and reflect sunlight, creating a dazzling display of colors in the upper atmosphere.",
    "**Echoflora**: A plant that can record and replay sounds from its environment. The Echoflora's leaves would be covered in microscopic, vibration-sensitive hairs that capture and store sound waves. When the plant is touched or disturbed, it would release a burst of stored sound, creating an eerie, ghostly echo. The Echoflora's roots would be connected to a network of underground fungal hyphae, allowing it to share and amplify sounds across a wide area. Its flowers would be shaped like delicate, trumpet-like structures that amplify and modify the stored sounds, creating a haunting, otherworldly music.",
    "**Nexarion**: A plant that can manipulate and redirect electromagnetic fields. The Nexarion's leaves would be covered in specialized, magnetically sensitive cells that allow it to detect and respond to changes in the electromagnetic environment. When exposed to strong magnetic fields, the Nexarion would release a burst of electromagnetic radiation, creating a localized distortion of the surrounding field. Its flowers would be shaped like intricate, geometric patterns that reflect and amplify the manipulated electromagnetic fields, creating a dazzling display of light and color.",
    "**Terraverde**: A plant that can manipulate and control the local water cycle. The Terraverde's roots would be connected to a network of underground water channels and aquifers, allowing it to absorb and store water from the surrounding environment. When the plant is"
