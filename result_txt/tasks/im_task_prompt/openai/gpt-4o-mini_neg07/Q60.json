    "**Multi-Texture Towel**: Design a towel with different textures on each side. One side could be ultra-absorbent and soft for drying off, while the other could feature a textured surface for gentle exfoliation. This would allow users to not only dry themselves but also enjoy a spa-like experience at home, promoting skin health and relaxation.",
    "**Built-in Pocket for Essentials**: Create a towel with a discreet, waterproof pocket that can securely hold small essentials like keys, a phone, or a credit card. This would be particularly useful for beachgoers or gym enthusiasts who want to keep their valuables safe and dry while enjoying their activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Towel**: Develop a towel made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that can decompose naturally after its lifecycle. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability. The towel could be marketed with a recycling program where users can send back old towels to be repurposed into new products.",
    "**Towel with Aromatherapy Infusion**: Incorporate microcapsules of essential oils into the fabric of the towel. When the towel is used, the friction releases the aroma, providing a calming or invigorating scent depending on the essential oil used. This would transform the drying experience into a sensory delight, enhancing relaxation and mood.",
    "**Towel with Integrated Drying Mechanism**: Design a towel that can be hung up and has a built-in mechanism to help it dry faster. This could include small fans or a moisture-absorbing material that promotes airflow, reducing the chances of mildew and odors while ensuring the towel is always fresh and ready for use."
