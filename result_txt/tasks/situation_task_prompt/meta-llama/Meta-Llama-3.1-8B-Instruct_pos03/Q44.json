    "**Solar-Powered Airship**: Design a solar-powered airship that can travel long distances, powered by a combination of solar panels and advanced aerodynamics. The airship would be equipped with comfortable seating, amenities, and safety features, making it a luxurious and eco-friendly mode of transportation. The airship could travel at a speed of around 50-60 km/h, covering distances of up to 500 km without the need for refueling.",
    "**Hyperloop Pods**: Develop a network of Hyperloop pods that can travel at incredible speeds of up to 1,200 km/h, reducing travel time to near-instantaneous. The pods would be vacuum-sealed and propelled by magnetic levitation, minimizing friction and energy consumption. The Hyperloop system would be powered by renewable energy sources, making it a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation.",
    "**Maglev Train**: Create a Maglev train system that uses magnetic levitation to propel trains at high speeds, eliminating the need for wheels and reducing friction. The Maglev train would be powered by advanced electric motors and would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 500 km/h. The train would be designed with comfort and safety in mind, featuring spacious seating and advanced safety features.",
    "**Electric Sky Pods**: Design a network of electric sky pods that can travel through the air, using advanced magnetic levitation and propulsion systems. The sky pods would be powered by renewable energy sources and would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 300 km/h. The pods would be equipped with comfortable seating and amenities, making them a convenient and enjoyable mode of transportation.",
    "**Advanced Pedal-Powered Bicycles**: Develop a new generation of pedal-powered bicycles that use advanced technology to enhance efficiency and comfort. The bicycles would be equipped with lightweight and durable frames, high-performance tires, and advanced pedal-assist systems. The bicycles would be designed for long-distance travel, featuring comfortable seating and amenities such as storage compartments and communication systems. The pedal-powered bicycles would be an eco-friendly and cost-effective mode of transportation, suitable for short to medium-distance travel. [/INST] "
