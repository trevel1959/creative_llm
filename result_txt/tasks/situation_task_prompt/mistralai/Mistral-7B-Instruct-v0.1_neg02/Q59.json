    "Utilize artificial lighting: If the sky were always cloudy, we would need to rely on artificial lighting to provide the necessary amount of sunlight. This could be achieved through the use of solar panels to generate electricity, which could then be used to power lighting systems.",
    "Create underground habitats: If the sky were always cloudy, we could create underground habitats where plants and animals could live. These habitats would be designed to mimic the natural light that plants need to grow, and would be powered by artificial lighting systems.",
    "Develop new farming techniques: If the sky were always cloudy, we would need to develop new farming techniques that do not rely on sunlight. This could include the use of hydroponic farming, which involves growing plants in a controlled environment with artificial lighting.",
    "Use geothermal energy: If the sky were always cloudy, we could use geothermal energy to power our homes and businesses. This energy is generated from the heat of the Earth's core, and can be harnessed through the use of geothermal power plants.",
    "Build space habitats: If the sky were always cloudy, we could build space habitats where humans and other organisms could live. These habitats would be designed to mimic the natural light that plants need to grow, and would be powered by artificial lighting systems."
