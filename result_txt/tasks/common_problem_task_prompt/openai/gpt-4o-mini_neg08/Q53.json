    "**Character Development Issues**: Characters may come across as flat or unrealistic if not developed properly. A potential solution is to create detailed character bios, including backstory, motivations, and arcs. Additionally, conducting character interviews or role-playing can help writers understand their characters better and make them more relatable to the audience.",
    "**Plot Holes**: As the screenplay progresses, inconsistencies in the plot may emerge, leading to confusion for the audience. To prevent this, screenwriters can create a detailed outline before writing the script. They should also consider using software that allows for easy tracking of plot points and character arcs, ensuring everything aligns cohesively throughout the story.",
    "**Time Management**: Screenwriting can be a time-consuming process, and many writers struggle to balance this with other responsibilities. To address this, setting clear deadlines for each stage of the screenplay can help maintain focus. Utilizing techniques like the Pomodoro Technique—working in focused bursts followed by short breaks—can also enhance productivity.",
    "**Feedback and Revisions**: Receiving constructive criticism can be challenging, especially if it conflicts with the writer's vision. Writers can mitigate this by seeking feedback from trusted peers or writing groups who understand the genre and audience. They should also remain open-minded and view revisions as opportunities for growth rather than personal attacks.",
    "**Formatting and Technical Challenges**: Screenplays have specific formatting requirements that can be difficult to master. To tackle this, writers can use screenplay writing software that automatically formats their work correctly, such as Final Draft or Celtx. Familiarizing themselves with industry standards through resources like \"The Screenwriter's Bible\" can also be beneficial."
