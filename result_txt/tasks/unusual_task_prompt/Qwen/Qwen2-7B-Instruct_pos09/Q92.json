    "**Smart Luggage Tag**: Develop a smart luggage tag that incorporates modern technology. This could include features like GPS tracking, which allows you to monitor the location of your luggage in real-time through an app on your phone. Additionally, it could have a panic button that sends an alert to your phone if the tag is separated from your luggage, or even a built-in lock for added security.",
    "**Luggage Tag Art Competition**: Organize an online contest where artists and designers create unique and innovative designs for luggage tags.

The winning designs can be mass-produced and sold, with proceeds going to a charity or environmental cause.",
    "**Luggage Tag Recycling Program**: Partner with airlines or travel companies to implement a program where customers can exchange their old or broken luggage tags for new ones.

    "**Luggage Tag Rental Service**: Offer a service where customers can rent high-quality, stylish luggage tags instead of purchasing them. This would appeal to budget-conscious travelers who want to ensure their belongings are easily identifiable without investing in expensive accessories.
