    "**Smart Wheel**: This wheel would be equipped with a touch-sensitive surface, allowing drivers to control various in-car functions with simple gestures. For example, a swipe from left to right could activate the GPS, while a circular motion could adjust the music volume. The wheel would also feature a built-in voice assistant, allowing drivers to communicate with the car's AI without taking their hands off the wheel.",
    "**Adaptive Steering**: This wheel would adjust its shape and size to fit the driver's preferences, providing optimal comfort and control. It could be adjusted for different driving styles, such as sporty or relaxed, and even accommodate drivers with disabilities. The wheel would use advanced sensors and AI to detect the driver's needs and adjust accordingly.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Wheel**: This wheel would provide a tactile experience for drivers, using subtle vibrations and resistance to simulate the sensation of driving on different road surfaces. For example, driving on a bumpy road would trigger a series of gentle bumps on the wheel, while driving on a smooth road would provide a smooth, consistent feel. This feature would enhance the driving experience and provide a more immersive connection to the road.",
    "**Mood-Sensing Wheel**: This wheel would be equipped with sensors that detect the driver's emotional state, using biometric data such as heart rate and skin conductance. The wheel would then adjust its color, texture, and even scent to match the driver's mood, creating a more personalized and calming driving experience. For example, if the driver is feeling stressed, the wheel might shift to a soothing blue color and release a calming aroma.",
    "**Augmented Reality Wheel**: This wheel would project a virtual display onto the driver's field of vision, providing a seamless and intuitive way to interact with the car's systems. The display could show vital information such as speed, navigation, and traffic updates, as well as provide a virtual \"dashboard\" for accessing various car functions. The wheel would use advanced AR technology to create a futuristic and engaging driving experience. [/INST] Assistant: Are you sure you want to submit the response? "
