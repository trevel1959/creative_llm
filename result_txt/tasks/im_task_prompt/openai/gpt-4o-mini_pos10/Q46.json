    "**Ergonomic Adjustable Handles**: Scissors could be designed with adjustable handles that adapt to the userâ€™s grip size and strength. By incorporating a mechanism that allows the user to customize the handle's width and angle, it would reduce strain during prolonged use, making it easier for individuals with arthritis or other hand conditions to use them comfortably.",
    "**Interchangeable Blades for Different Materials**: A pair of scissors with interchangeable blades would allow users to switch between different types of blades tailored for specific materials. For instance, one blade could be designed for fabric, another for paper, and yet another for thicker materials like cardboard or plastic. This versatility would make the scissors more functional for various crafting and DIY projects.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Mechanism**: Scissors could be enhanced with a self-sharpening feature that keeps the blades sharp with every use. This could involve a small, built-in sharpening tool that aligns and sharpens the blades when they are closed, ensuring that users always have a sharp edge without the need for manual sharpening.",
    "**Safety Scissors with Automatic Lock**: To enhance safety, especially for children, scissors could be designed with an automatic locking mechanism that only allows the blades to open when pressure is applied to the handles. Once pressure is released, the blades would automatically lock shut, preventing accidental cuts when not in use.",
    "**Multi-Functional Scissors with Integrated Tools**: These scissors could include additional tools like a ruler, a bottle opener, or a screwdriver built into the design. This would create a compact, all-in-one tool for crafters and DIY enthusiasts, making it easier to carry and reducing the need for multiple tools."
