    "Insufficient funding: Another potential problem is that there may not be enough funding available to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive solution to homelessness. This can limit the resources available for outreach, housing support, and other services that are critical to helping individuals and families get back on their feet.",
    "Resistance from local communities: Some residents of the city may be resistant to the idea of providing housing and support services for individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness. This can make it difficult to secure locations for housing and service providers, and can also lead to opposition to policies aimed at addressing homelessness.",
    "Lack of coordination among service providers: Different organizations and agencies may not be working together effectively to address homelessness, which can lead to duplication of services, confusion among clients, and a lack of efficient use of resources.",
    "Limited access to health and mental health services: Individuals and families experiencing homelessness may have limited access to health and mental health services, which can exacerbate existing health problems and make it more difficult to address the root causes of homelessness.",
    "Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many people still view homelessness as a personal failure or a criminal issue, rather than a societal problem that requires a comprehensive solution. This can lead to discrimination and stigma against individuals and families experiencing homelessness, which can make it harder for them to find stable housing and access support services."
