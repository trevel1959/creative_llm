    "**Hyperloop Integration**: Implement a Hyperloop system that connects the city to its surrounding suburbs and neighboring cities, reducing travel times and increasing efficiency. This would involve constructing vacuum-sealed tubes and launching capsules at high speeds, potentially reaching up to 700 mph. The Hyperloop system would be integrated with the existing public transportation network, allowing for seamless transfers and reducing congestion on traditional roads.",
    "**Smart Bike-Sharing**: Develop a smart bike-sharing system that utilizes AI-powered bike management and navigation. This would involve equipping bikes with GPS, sensors, and mobile apps that allow users to locate and reserve bikes, track their journey, and receive real-time traffic updates. The system would also incorporate electric assist and self-balancing technology to make cycling more accessible and enjoyable.",
    "**Autonomous Shuttles**: Introduce autonomous shuttles that operate on a fixed route, providing a reliable and efficient transportation option for short distances. These shuttles would be equipped with advanced sensors, GPS, and AI, allowing them to navigate through the city safely and efficiently. They would also be integrated with the existing public transportation network, enabling seamless transfers and reducing congestion.",
    "**Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) System**: Implement a PRT system that uses small, driverless vehicles to transport passengers along a network of guideways. This would involve constructing a network of elevated or underground guideways that connect key destinations, such as residential areas, commercial centers, and public transportation hubs. The PRT system would be highly efficient, reducing travel times and increasing capacity.",
    "**Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platform**: Develop a MaaS platform that integrates public, private, and shared transportation options into a single, user-friendly interface. This would involve partnering with private transportation companies, ride-hailing services, and public transportation providers to offer users a range of transportation options, including car-sharing, bike-sharing, and ride-hailing. The MaaS platform would use AI to optimize routes, reduce congestion, and provide users with real-time information and personalized recommendations. [/INST] [/INST] "
