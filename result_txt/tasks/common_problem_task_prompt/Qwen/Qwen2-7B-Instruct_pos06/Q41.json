    "**Incorporating Renewable Energy Sources**: The spaceship can utilize solar panels and fusion reactors to harness energy from both sunlight and stellar matter. This design ensures a sustainable power supply throughout its journey. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Advanced AI Crewmates**: The spaceship can have highly evolved AI systems that function as crewmates, assisting in navigation, maintenance, and even social interaction. This reduces the need for a large human crew, making the mission more efficient. **Confidence Score: 0.85**",
    "**Dynamic Structural Adaptation**: The spaceship's hull could adapt its shape based on environmental conditions (like gravity, atmospheric pressure) or mission needs. This flexibility allows it to optimize performance across various celestial bodies. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Integrated Space and Ground Support Systems**: The design includes a system that allows the spaceship to establish temporary bases on the surfaces of planets and moons, enabling long-term missions without constant return to Earth. **Confidence Score: 0.9**",
    "**Self-Replicating Life Support Modules**: The life support systems are designed with self-replicating components, ensuring that critical functions can continue indefinitely without external resupply. This is particularly useful for long-duration space missions. **Confidence Score: 0.9**"
