    "Climate Change Denial - Given the current political climate and the presence of climate change skeptics, the researchers may face opposition and doubt from various quarters. This skepticism can lead to a lack of support for the research project, making it harder to secure funding and attract talented scientists.",
    "Ethical Considerations - The use of animal subjects, remote human communities, or environmentally sensitive areas may raise ethical concerns. Researchers will need to obtain informed consent from stakeholders involved in their studies and ensure that no harm is done to living organisms or ecosystems.",
    "Data Quality Challenges - Collecting accurate and reliable data is essential in any scientific research. However, factors such as weather conditions, technological limitations, and human error can negatively impact data quality. Ensuring the integrity of the data and minimizing potential bias is crucial for a robust analysis.",
    "Collaboration and Interdisciplinary Issues - Collaboration among various disciplines, such as meteorology, ecology, and political science, may be challenging. Different fields have differing methodologies, which can create confusion and hinder progress. Effective communication and leadership are key to fostering collaboration and ensuring project success.",
    "Public Perception - The study's findings could provoke public controversy, leading to increased scrutiny of the research process. Researchers must plan for ways to effectively communicate their research findings to the public, addressing any potential misconceptions and maintaining the integrity of the project."
