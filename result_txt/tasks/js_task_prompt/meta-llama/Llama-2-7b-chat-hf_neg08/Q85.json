    "Enhanced Self-Awareness: Humans are notorious for their inability to recognize their own emotions and thought patterns. By granting humans the capacity to acknowledge and understand their emotions, they could better manage their feelings of jealousy. This change would allow individuals to identify the root cause of their envy and take constructive actions to address it, rather than letting it fester and consume them.",
    "Empathy Enhancement: Increase the capacity for empathy in humans to better understand and appreciate the efforts and achievements of others. By being able to see things from another person's perspective, individuals would be less likely to feel envious or resentful of others' successes. This shift in perspective would foster a more supportive and encouraging environment, where people could celebrate each other's accomplishments without feeling threatened.",
    "Temporal Perspective: Give humans the ability to see the bigger picture and understand that success and achievements are not solely dependent on any one person's efforts. This change would help individuals recognize that success is often the result of a combination of factors, including hard work, luck, and the efforts of others. By understanding this, they would be less likely to feel envious of others' accomplishments, as they would see the interconnectedness of all successes.",
    "Skill-Sharing: Introduce a mechanism that allows humans to share their skills and abilities with others. By being able to learn from and collaborate with others, individuals would feel less threatened by their accomplishments. This shift in mindset would foster a more cooperative and supportive environment, where people could learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Reframing Failure: Rewire humans' brains to view failure as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a source of shame or embarrassment. By reframing failure as a natural part of the learning process, individuals would be less likely to feel envious or resentful of others' successes. This shift in mindset would encourage people to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities to improve and develop new skills."
