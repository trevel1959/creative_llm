    "**Interactive Mailbox System**: Imagine a mailbox that doubles as an interactive information center for your neighborhood. It could be equipped with touch screens or QR codes that allow residents to access community news, local events, utility bill payments, and even request services like trash pickup or community clean-up. The mailbox would be designed to look modern and inviting, encouraging more engagement in the community.",
    "**Smart Mailbox with AI**: Develop a smart mailbox integrated with AI technology. This system could analyze the type of mail received and prioritize urgent messages (like bills or important letters) by automatically routing them to the user's phone or email. It could also learn from past behaviors to predict common mail types and prepare accordingly (e.g., sorting flyers or junk mail).",
    "**Recycling Hub Mailbox**: Transform mailboxes into recycling hubs where residents can easily dispose of recyclable materials. The mailbox could have compartments for different types of waste (paper, plastics, glass, etc.) and include educational materials on proper recycling practices. It could also offer incentives such as points or discounts at local stores for participating.",
    "**Community Library Mailbox**: Implement a library mailbox in each neighborhood, allowing residents to borrow and return books conveniently. This could be especially useful in areas without traditional libraries. The mailbox could integrate with online platforms for cataloging and reserving books, making it easy for people to access a wide range of literature right in their community.",
    "**Garden Mailbox**: Create a mailbox design that doubles as a small garden or planter box. People can plant flowers, herbs, or vegetables next to their mailbox, turning mundane mail delivery into a vibrant community asset. This idea could encourage green thumbs among neighbors, foster a sense of pride in personal space, and beautify streetscapes."
