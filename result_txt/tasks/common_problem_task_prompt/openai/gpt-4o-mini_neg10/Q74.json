    "**Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds, thunderstorms, or thick clouds, can delay or cancel a launch. Launch windows are often limited, so weather-related issues can create significant scheduling challenges. To address this, meteorological teams must continuously monitor weather patterns and have contingency plans in place.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite requires adherence to various international and national regulations, including those related to airspace usage, frequency allocations, and environmental impacts. Failing to comply can result in legal challenges or penalties. Engaging with regulatory bodies early in the planning process can help ensure compliance and smooth the approval process.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The costs associated with launching a satellite can escalate due to unforeseen challenges, such as design changes, additional testing, or delays. This can strain financial resources and affect the overall mission timeline. Establishing a robust budget with contingency funds and regular financial reviews can help manage costs effectively.",
    "**International Relations**: If the satellite has military or strategic implications, the launch could provoke concerns or tensions with other countries. This could lead to diplomatic fallout or even retaliation. Conducting thorough geopolitical analyses and maintaining open communication with international stakeholders can help mitigate these risks.",
    "**Launch Vehicle Reliability**: The reliability of the launch vehicle is crucial. Any issues with the rocket, such as structural weaknesses or propulsion failures, can jeopardize the mission. Rigorous quality assurance protocols and utilizing proven launch vehicles can help ensure a successful launch."
