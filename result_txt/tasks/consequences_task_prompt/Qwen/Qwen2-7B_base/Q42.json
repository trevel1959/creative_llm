    "Exploration: With no gravity to hold us down, humans could easily explore the cosmos, with potential to travel to and colonize distant planets.",
    "Architecture: The structures erected on the earth’s surface would be much different, with no need for columns or supports from underneath to hold up the roof.",
    "Sports: Gravity-free sports could be fun and exciting, like basketball in zero-gravity.",
    "Engineering: If we could turn off gravity, we’d be able to create new forms of engineering, such as a machine that could travel through gravity to places of interest.",
    "Communication: If gravity is made optional, then communication, which is currently impossible at a distance, would be possible."
