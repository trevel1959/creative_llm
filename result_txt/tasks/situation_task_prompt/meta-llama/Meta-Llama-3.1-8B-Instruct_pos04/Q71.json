    "**Hydroponic Garden**: Develop a system where plants grow in water rather than soil. This method allows for greater control over nutrient delivery and can thrive in a variety of environments, including hard or rocky ground. The plants would be suspended in a nutrient-rich solution, eliminating the need for digging.",
    "**Aeroponic Garden**: Similar to hydroponics, but instead of using a nutrient solution, the plants would be misted with a fine spray of nutrients. This method is even more efficient and can be used in areas with limited water resources. The plants would be suspended in the air, and the nutrient mist would be sprayed onto the roots.",
    "**Geodesic Dome Greenhouse**: Build a geodesic dome-shaped greenhouse that can be placed on top of hard or rocky ground. The dome would provide a controlled environment for the plants to grow, with a stable temperature, humidity, and light. The dome would be made of a transparent material, allowing sunlight to enter and providing a natural source of light for the plants.",
    "**Vertical Garden**: Design a vertical garden system that can be attached to a wall or a structure. This would allow for a high-density planting system, making the most of limited space. The plants would be grown in a series of interconnected modules, each with its own nutrient and water supply.",
    "**Floating Garden**: Create a floating garden system that can be placed on a body of water, such as a lake or a river. The garden would be supported by a series of floating modules, each with its own planting area. The plants would be grown in a nutrient-rich solution, and the modules would be designed to maximize sunlight and water exposure. This would allow for a unique and sustainable gardening experience.
