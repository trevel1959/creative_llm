    "Sunglasses with Anti-Glare Coating: Develop sunglasses with an anti-glare coating to reduce glare from the sun and improve visibility. This would be particularly useful for drivers and those who work outdoors, as it would minimize distractions and enhance their ability to see clearly.",
    "Sunglasses with Built-in LED Light: Incorporate an LED light within the frame of the sunglasses. This light could be used for various purposes, such as illuminating the path ahead in low-light conditions or signaling to other pedestrians and cyclists.",
    "Sunglasses with UV Protection: Develop sunglasses with advanced UV protection that extends beyond the standard UV index. This would ensure that the wearer's eyes are protected from harmful UV rays, reducing the risk of eye damage and skin damage.",
    "Sunglasses with Climate Control: Create sunglasses that can adjust to different climates. For example, they could have a button that activates a cooling mechanism in hot weather or a button that activates a heating mechanism in cold weather.",
    "Sunglasses with Integrated Sunscreen: Develop sunglasses with a built-in sunscreen layer that provides long-lasting protection from the sun. This would be particularly useful for those who spend a lot of time outdoors and are concerned about sun exposure."
