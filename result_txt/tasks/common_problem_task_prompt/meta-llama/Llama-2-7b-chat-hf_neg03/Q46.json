    "Floating Transportation Pods: Create a network of floating transportation pods that can travel along designated routes in the city's waterways. These pods would be equipped with comfortable seating, air conditioning, and Wi-Fi, providing a unique and convenient mode of transportation for commuters. The pods could be powered by electricity or solar energy, reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation system.",
    "Hyperloop-Inspired Trains: Inspired by the hyperloop concept, design a high-speed train system that can travel at speeds of up to 700 km/h. The train would use magnetic levitation technology to reduce friction and increase speed, reducing travel time between destinations. The train could also be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to minimize its carbon footprint.",
    "Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Taxis: Develop a fleet of VTOL taxis that can take off and land vertically, eliminating the need for a runway. These taxis would be electric or hybrid-electric, reducing emissions and noise pollution. The VTOL technology would allow for quick and efficient transportation between urban areas, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.",
    "Autonomous Underwater Buses: Design an autonomous underwater bus that can travel along designated routes in the city's waterways. The bus would be powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells, reducing emissions and noise pollution. The bus could also be equipped with advanced sensors and navigation systems, allowing it to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from other vessels.",
    "Personal Air Vehicles: Develop personal air vehicles that can be used for short-distance transportation within the city. These vehicles would be electric or hybrid-electric, reducing emissions and noise pollution. The personal air vehicles could be designed to carry one or two passengers and would be equipped with advanced safety features, such as collision avoidance systems and emergency parachutes."
