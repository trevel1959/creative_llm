    "**Increased Global Cooperation**: The absence of debt would reduce tensions between nations, as the pressure to repay loans would be alleviated.

Confidence score: 0.8",
    "**Rise of New Global Power Dynamics**: The erasure of debt would create a power vacuum, as countries that were previously dependent on debt to maintain their influence would lose their leverage. New players, such as emerging economies or non-state actors, could rise to prominence, challenging the existing global order. Confidence score: 0.7",
    "**Increased Inequality**: The elimination of debt would primarily benefit governments and corporations, which would be able to redirect their resources towards profit and growth. However, the benefits might not trickle down to the general population, leading to increased income inequality, as the wealthy would accumulate more wealth and power. Confidence score: 0.6",
    "**Global Monetary System Overhaul**: The erasure of debt would require a fundamental overhaul of the global monetary system, as the current system is built on the assumption of debt and interest payments. This could lead to a new era of monetary policy, potentially featuring alternative currencies, digital currencies, or a post-monetary economy. Confidence score: 0.8"
