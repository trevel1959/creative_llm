    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush:** Develop a toothbrush that utilizes ultrasonic vibrations and specialized toothpaste to whiten teeth more effectively than traditional methods. The toothbrush would be designed with advanced bristles that can break down stains on teeth, allowing for a brighter smile without the need for professional treatments. ",
    "**Oral Care System:** Create an integrated oral care system consisting of a toothbrush, mouthwash, and dental floss that work together to improve overall oral health. Each product would contain unique ingredients specifically designed to address different aspects of oral hygiene, such as reducing plaque, fighting bacteria, or freshening breath.",
    "**Customized Oral Health Tracker:** Design a toothbrush that integrates with smartphone apps to track brushing habits, duration, and technique. The toothbrush could provide personalized feedback and recommendations to help users improve their brushing habits, ensuring they are cleaning all areas of their mouth effectively. This could also include reminders to change toothbrush heads or schedule dental check-ups.",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with AI:** Develop a smart toothbrush equipped with artificial intelligence that learns your brushing patterns over time and adjusts its performance accordingly. The AI could detect areas of your mouth that need more attention, suggest modifications to your brushing technique, or even recommend specific toothpaste based on your oral health needs.",
    "**Hybrid Toothbrush and Water Flosser:** Combine the functions of a toothbrush and water flosser into one device. This hybrid toothbrush would use both bristles and water jets to clean teeth and gums effectively. The water flossing feature would help remove food particles and plaque from tight spaces between teeth and along the gumline, while the toothbrush would ensure a thorough cleaning of the teeth surfaces. This would offer a more comprehensive approach to oral hygiene in a single tool."
