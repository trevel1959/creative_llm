    "Smart Tape Calculator: This calculator will have a built-in tape that can display and store calculations. Users can use the tape to see their calculations as they are performing them, making it easier to understand complex math problems. The tape can also be used to store calculations for later reference, making it easier to track progress and revisit previous calculations.",
    "Holographic Calculator: This calculator will project a 3D hologram of the numbers and calculations, allowing users to see their calculations from different angles and perspectives. The holographic display can also be used to demonstrate mathematical concepts, such as the concept of pi or the structure of a 3D shape.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Calculator: This calculator will use advanced brain-computer interface technology to allow users to perform calculations using only their thoughts. Users can wear an EEG cap or other BCI device that reads brain signals and translates them into mathematical calculations. This can be especially useful for people with disabilities or injuries that make it difficult to use a traditional calculator.",
    "Augmented Reality Calculator: This calculator will use augmented reality technology to display calculations in a virtual environment. Users can see their calculations overlaid on real-world objects or environments, making it easier to visualize and understand mathematical concepts. The AR display can also be used to demonstrate mathematical concepts, such as the relationship between numbers and shapes.",
    "Quantum Calculator: This calculator will use quantum computing technology to perform calculations that are beyond the capabilities of traditional computers. Quantum computers can perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, making them ideal for complex mathematical problems. The Quantum Calculator can be used to solve complex problems in physics, chemistry, and other fields, and can also be used to demonstrate the principles of quantum mechanics."
