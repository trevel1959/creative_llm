    "**Thermal Insulated Lunch Box Design**: Create a custom thermos designed specifically as a portable lunch box. This can include features like a detachable divider for separating cold and hot foods, a built-in utensil holder, and possibly even compartments for storing ice packs or hot water bottles. The thermos could be made of durable, food-grade materials that are both lightweight and easy to clean. ",
    "**Portable Thermos Coffee Maker**: Develop a compact coffee maker that utilizes the thermos itself as its primary container. It would have a heating element inside which allows for brewing coffee directly within the thermos. This device would be perfect for camping trips or for those who want a quick cup of coffee on-the-go without needing access to traditional kitchen appliances.",
    "**Smart Thermos Integration**: Combine a thermos with smart technology to create a smart thermos that can monitor the temperature of its contents in real-time. This could alert users via their smartphone if the temperature drops below a safe level or if it's too hot, preventing food or drink from spoiling or causing burns. ",
    "**Thermally Regulating Water Bottle**: Design a water bottle that automatically adjusts its insulation based on the temperature of the water. If the water is hot, it would increase its insulation to keep the heat in; if the water is cold, it would reduce its insulation to prevent freezing. This innovative thermos would ensure that the user always has perfectly chilled or heated water available.",
    "**Thermos-based Home Brewing System**: Create a home brewing system that uses a thermos as the primary fermentation vessel. This system could include a temperature-controlled environment within the thermos, ensuring that the ideal temperature for fermentation is maintained throughout the process. This would be particularly useful for beer or wine enthusiasts looking to brew their own drinks at home with minimal equipment."
