    "Hanging Artwork: Properly hanging artwork is essential for a professional exhibition. The curator may need to figure out the best way to hang and secure the artwork without causing damage to the walls or the artwork itself. In this situation, the curator may want to hire a professional art installer to ensure the artwork is hung securely and with minimal risk of damage.",
    "Lighting: Lighting is critical for an art exhibition, as it can enhance the visual appeal of the artwork. There may not be sufficient lighting in the venue, or the light source may be positioned incorrectly. The curator may need to add supplemental lighting or move the existing light sources to create a well-lit space that highlights the artwork's colors and details.",
    "Temperature and Humidity Control: Controlling temperature and humidity in the exhibition space is crucial to protect the artwork. Extreme temperatures and high humidity levels can cause damage to delicate materials, such as paper and paint. The curator may need to invest in temperature and humidity control systems, including air conditioning, heating, and humidification, to maintain an optimal environment for the artwork.",
    "Security: Ensuring the security of the artwork during the exhibition is a primary concern. The curator may need to hire security personnel to monitor the exhibition space and prevent any theft or damage. Additionally, the curator should consider implementing security measures, such as surveillance cameras and alarms, to deter potential thieves and secure the artwork.",
    "Marketing and Promotion: Promoting the exhibition and attracting a large audience can be a challenge for some curators. The curator may need to develop a comprehensive marketing and promotion strategy, including social media, email marketing, press releases, and printed materials, to garner interest in the exhibition and encourage attendance."
