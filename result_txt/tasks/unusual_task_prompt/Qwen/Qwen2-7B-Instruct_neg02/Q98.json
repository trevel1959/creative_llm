    "**Smart Power Strip with Automated Charging:** Develop a smart power strip that incorporates sensors and software to automatically adjust charging speed for devices based on their power requirements. It could have built-in timers, energy-efficient modes, and even a mobile app for remote control and monitoring of charging status.",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Power Strip:** Create a compact, portable power strip that utilizes solar panels for charging. This device would be ideal for outdoor activities or emergency situations where access to electricity is limited. It can also charge multiple devices simultaneously and comes equipped with USB ports for convenient use.",
    "**Automated Device-Cleaning Power Strip:** Design a power strip with integrated brushes or microfiber cloths that clean dust and grime from device chargers when a device is connected. This would not only help maintain cleanliness but also improve charging efficiency by removing any obstructions from the charging ports.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip:** Integrate wireless charging capabilities into a power strip, allowing users to charge compatible devices without needing to plug them in. This could feature multiple wireless charging pads, each with adjustable height settings for different devices, and a modern, minimalist design to complement any space.",
    "**Energy Management Power Strip with Eco-Mode:** Implement an energy management system within a power strip that monitors usage and adjusts power output accordingly. In eco-mode, it would reduce power consumption by limiting the current to devices during off-peak hours, which can help save energy and reduce costs. Additionally, it could provide insights through an app about energy usage patterns and savings achieved."
