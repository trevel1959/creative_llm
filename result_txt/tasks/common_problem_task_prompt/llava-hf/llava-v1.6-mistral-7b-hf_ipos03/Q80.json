    "Food and Beverage: Providing a meal for guests can be another challenge. Caterers may use non-sustainable food sources or produce waste. The couple could opt for a caterer that uses locally sourced, organic ingredients, reduces food waste by using a buffet-style service, or minimizes single-use plastics and packaging.",
    "Guest Transportation: Guests may travel to the wedding from various locations, which can contribute to carbon emissions. Encouraging guests to use eco-friendly transportation options, such as public transportation, carpooling, or biking, can help reduce the carbon footprint of the event.",
    "Invitations: Traditional paper invitations can have a significant environmental impact due to the paper, ink, and energy used in their production. The couple could opt for digital invitations or recycled paper invitations to reduce the environmental impact.",
    "Wedding Gifts: Gifts often have a significant environmental impact, as they are often produced in factories with high energy consumption and waste production. The couple could encourage guests to give eco-friendly gifts, such as experiences, plants, or products made from sustainable materials.",
    "Waste Management: During the wedding, there will be waste generated from the event, such as food packaging, decorations, and paper products.
