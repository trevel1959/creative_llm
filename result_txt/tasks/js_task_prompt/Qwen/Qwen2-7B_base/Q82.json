    "Super-Powerful Medicines: The new species could be engineered to produce and store medicinal compounds that can cure or prevent certain diseases. Perhaps their leaves and roots could contain unique chemicals that could prove effective against the effects of aging, or perhaps they could help cure things like Alzheimer's, cancer, or other degenerative diseases.",
    "Superb Tolerance: This plant could be engineered to thrive in nearly any environment, even inhospitable ones. Perhaps they could grow in the depths of the ocean, in the scorching deserts of the Sahara, or in the frigid Arctic. This would make them an invaluable source of food, water, and shelter for any species that could adapt and thrive around them.",
    "Superb Efficiency: This plant could be engineered to grow and produce food at a much faster rate than any currently known agricultural crop. Perhaps this species could be engineered to grow to massive sizes, or perhaps it could produce food crops at exponential rate, allowing them to grow in massive orchards that could provide food for a city.",
    "Superb Beauty: This plant could be engineered to have extraordinary natural beauty. Perhaps their leaves could be fluorescent, or perhaps their flowers could bloom in the dark. They could also be engineered to release pleasant fragrances, drawing pollinators or humans to them.",
    "Superb Sustainability: This plant could be engineered to be a completely sustainable solution to the problem of resource management. Perhaps they could absorb and recycle pollutants in the environment, or perhaps they could help regulate climate change."
