    "**Smart Trash Can**: Develop a smart trash can that uses sensors to detect when it's full and sends an alert to the user's smartphone when it needs emptying. The smart trash can could also integrate with waste collection services, allowing users to schedule pick-ups or monitor their recycling and waste usage. This idea promotes responsible waste management and encourages recycling.",
    "**Interactive Trash Can Game**: Create a trash can that doubles as a game console. Players toss items into the can, and each correct toss rewards them with points or access to mini-games. This concept combines physical activity with gaming, making waste disposal an engaging experience for children and adults alike.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bags**: Design trash bags made from biodegradable materials like cornstarch or other plant-based substances. These bags would decompose in landfills much faster than traditional plastic bags, significantly reducing environmental impact. Additionally, they could come in various colors or patterns to add a fun twist to mundane tasks.",
    "**Trash Can Recycling Station**: Build a multi-functional trash can that includes compartments for different types of recyclables (paper, plastics, glass, etc.). The can could also have a built-in screen displaying information about recycling practices, upcoming recycling events, and local recycling facilities. This idea aims to educate users about proper recycling methods and encourage more people to participate in recycling programs.",
    "**Composting Trash Can**: Introduce a composting trash can that breaks down organic waste into nutrient-rich soil. Users can place food scraps, yard waste, and other biodegradable materials inside, and the can would process these items using natural processes. The end result is compost that can be used for gardening or landscaping, promoting sustainable living and reducing landfill waste."
