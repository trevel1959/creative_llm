    "**Smart Wheelchair with Augmented Reality**: This innovative wheelchair would be integrated with augmented reality (AR) technology. Users would wear AR glasses that overlay navigational aids and information about their surroundings. The wheelchair would be equipped with smart sensors that map out the environment, allowing users to see the best paths to take, avoid obstacles, and even interact with their surroundings through the AR interface. This would not only enhance mobility but also provide an engaging way to explore the world.",
    "**Personal Mobility Drone**: A compact drone designed for personal transportation could allow individuals to travel short distances without needing to stand. The drone would have a secure seating area and would be controlled via a mobile app. Users could summon the drone to their location, and it would navigate to pre-set destinations autonomously. This idea could revolutionize mobility for those unable to walk, offering a fun and futuristic way to get around urban environments.",
    "**Crawling Exoskeleton Suit**: A specially designed exoskeleton suit that allows users to crawl with ease and comfort. The suit would have a lightweight frame and flexible joints that mimic human movement, enabling users to move on all fours. It would be equipped with soft padding for comfort and have adjustable settings for speed and terrain adaptation. This would not only facilitate mobility but also provide a unique way to experience the environment from a different perspective.",
    "**Rolling Bed**: A modified bed on wheels that can be controlled remotely or through an app. This concept would allow individuals to stay comfortable while moving around their home or community. The rolling bed would have a built-in system to navigate through doorways and around furniture, with safety features like automatic braking and obstacle detection. Users could customize their experience by adjusting the bedâ€™s height and angle for optimal comfort while they move from room to room.",
    "**Adaptive Robotic Pet**: A robotic pet designed to assist with mobility, this concept combines companionship with practical help. The robotic pet would follow the user around, offering support by carrying small items or providing stability when needed. It could be programmed to respond to voice commands, and its playful nature would help reduce feelings of isolation while also encouraging movement and interaction in a fun way."
