    "**Inflatable Personal Watercraft**: Design an inflatable, spherical watercraft that can be propelled by a combination of solar-powered electric motors and human-powered pedaling. The inflatable material would provide buoyancy, while the motors would provide speed and maneuverability. The pedaling system would allow for a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to travel long distances. The watercraft could be equipped with a navigation system, communication devices, and a life raft for emergency situations.",
    "**Underwater Glider**: Develop an underwater glider that uses a combination of buoyancy and wing-like designs to travel long distances through the water. The glider would be propelled by the movement of the ocean currents and would be equipped with a navigation system, communication devices, and a life raft. The glider could be designed to carry passengers or cargo and would be an efficient way to travel across large bodies of water.",
    "**Seafloor Tunnel**: Design a network of pressurized tunnels that crisscross the seafloor, allowing for safe and efficient travel across large bodies of water. The tunnels would be equipped with life support systems, navigation systems, and communication devices. The tunnels could be built using advanced materials and would provide a unique and thrilling way to explore the ocean floor.",
    "**Ocean-Powered Sailboat**: Develop a sailboat that harnesses the power of ocean currents and wind to propel it across the water. The sailboat would be designed with a unique sail system that can adapt to changing wind and current conditions. The sailboat could be equipped with a navigation system, communication devices, and a life raft. The sailboat would be an environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel across large bodies of water.",
    "**Submersible Airship**: Design a submersible airship that can travel through the water and then rise to the surface to sail through the air. The airship would be equipped with a propulsion system that uses a combination of electric motors and solar panels to generate lift and propulsion. The airship could be designed to carry passengers or cargo and would provide a unique and thrilling way to travel across large bodies of water and into the air. [/INST] "
