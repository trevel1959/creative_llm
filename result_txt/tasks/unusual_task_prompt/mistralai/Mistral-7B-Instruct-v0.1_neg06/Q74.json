    "\"Wheelie Wonderful\": This idea is to create a smart steering wheel that uses augmented reality to provide real-time feedback on the driver's performance. The wheel would use sensors to track the driver's steering angle, speed, and acceleration, and then use that data to provide personalized feedback to the driver. For example, if the driver is drifting too much, the wheel could display a message saying \"Wheelie Wonderfuldetroit\" to encourage the driver to straighten out.",
    "\"The Smart Wheel\": This idea is to create a steering wheel that is equipped with advanced technology to make driving safer and more efficient. The wheel would have sensors that detect when the driver is tired or distracted, and would alert the driver to take a break or pay attention to the road. The wheel could also have a built-in GPS system that suggests the most efficient route to the driver's destination, and would adjust the driver's speed and direction accordingly.",
    "\"The Wheel of Fortune\": This idea is to create a steering wheel that is designed to make driving more fun and engaging. The wheel would have a touch screen interface that displays a virtual game, such as a racing game or a puzzle game. The driver would control the game using the wheel, and would earn points and rewards for completing challenges. The game could also be integrated with other systems in the car, such as the music system or the climate control system, to create a more immersive experience.",
    "\"The Wheel of Wisdom\": This idea is to create a steering wheel that is designed to help drivers learn and improve their driving skills. The wheel would have a touch screen interface that displays educational content, such as videos or articles, on safe driving practices. The driver could also use the wheel to access a virtual driving simulator, where they could practice driving in different scenarios and receive feedback on their performance.",
    "\"The Wheel of the Future\": This idea is to create a steering wheel that is designed to work seamlessly with other advanced technologies in the car, such as self-driving systems or voice-controlled interfaces. The wheel would have a touch screen interface that allows the driver to control the car's self-driving mode, or to access voice-controlled commands for tasks such as adjusting the music or the climate control. The wheel could also have sensors that detect when the driver is stressed"
