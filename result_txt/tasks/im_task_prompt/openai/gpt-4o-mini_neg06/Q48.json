    "**Smart Key Sensitivity Adjustment**: Develop a piano with adjustable key sensitivity settings that can be modified through a digital interface. This feature would allow players to customize the resistance of the keys based on their playing style or preference. For instance, beginners might prefer lighter keys for ease of play, while advanced players might want a heavier touch for more expressive playing.",
    "**Built-in Composition Assistant**: Incorporate a smart composition assistant within the piano that can analyze a player’s style and suggest chord progressions, melodies, or harmonies. Using machine learning algorithms, the assistant would adapt to the user's preferences over time, helping them compose original pieces or improve their improvisation skills by providing real-time suggestions as they play.",
    "**Mood Lighting System**: Design a piano with an integrated mood lighting system that changes colors based on the music being played. This could enhance the emotional experience of playing and performing. For example, playing a soft ballad could trigger calming blue hues, while a lively upbeat piece could result in vibrant reds and yellows, creating a visually immersive atmosphere.",
    "**Portable Modular Design**: Create a piano with a modular design that allows it to be easily disassembled and reassembled for transport. This would cater to musicians who travel frequently, enabling them to carry their instrument without the bulk. Each module could be connected wirelessly, allowing for easy setup and breakdown, while still maintaining a full-sized keyboard experience.",
    "**Integrated Wellness Features**: Introduce wellness features such as a built-in metronome that not only keeps time but also suggests breaks and stretches based on the user’s playing duration. The piano could also offer guided breathing exercises or mindfulness prompts during breaks to promote mental well-being and prevent fatigue during long practice sessions."
