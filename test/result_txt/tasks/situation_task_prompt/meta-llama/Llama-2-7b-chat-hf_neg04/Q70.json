    "The Sun Clock: One creative solution to the absence of watches and clocks is to use the sun as a natural timekeeper. People could use the position of the sun in the sky to gauge the time. For example, when the sun is directly overhead, it's noon. This method would require some practice to get used to, but it would allow individuals to develop a more natural and intuitive sense of time.",
    "Time Stones: Another idea is to use small, color-coded stones to mark the passing of time. Each stone could represent a specific time interval, such as 15-minute increments. People could carry these stones with them and use them to keep track of time throughout the day. This method would require some organization and memory, but it could be a fun and creative way to keep track of time.",
    "Time Bands: A more sophisticated solution is to use bracelets or bands with different colored segments to represent different time intervals. For example, a band with five segments, each representing a 30-minute interval, could be used to keep track of time. This method would require some mental math to calculate the current time, but it would be a more precise and elegant solution than using stones.",
    "Nature's Rhythms: Another creative solution is to use the natural rhythms of the environment to keep track of time. For example, people could use the chirping of birds, the flow of a nearby river, or the movement of the tides to gauge the passing of time. This method would require some attention to nature and an understanding of the natural rhythms in the area, but it could be a peaceful and meditative way to keep track of time.",
    "Community Timekeeping: In a community setting, people could work together to create a shared timekeeping system. This could involve using a large, communal clock or a series of smaller clocks that are synchronized to a central timekeeping device. This method would require some coordination and communication, but it would allow individuals to rely on each other for timekeeping and create a sense of community and cooperation."
