    "**Atmospheric Water Harvester**: Develop a device that can extract water from the air, even at low humidity levels. This device would use a combination of heat and condensation to collect water droplets, which would then be stored in a reservoir for plant watering. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Solar-Powered Fog Collector**: Design a system that captures and condenses fog using a network of solar-heated pipes or mesh surfaces. This would allow for efficient collection of water from foggy environments, even in areas with low rainfall. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Grey Water Recycling System**: Implement a closed-loop system that collects, treats, and reuses grey water (wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines) for plant irrigation. This would significantly reduce water waste and minimize the demand on potable water supplies. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Bio-Inspired Water Collection**: Develop a system that mimics the way plants collect water from the air, using a combination of waxy coatings, surface tension, and capillary action. This could involve creating a mesh or fabric that collects and channels water droplets to a central collection point. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Geothermal Water Source**: Explore the use of geothermal energy to heat water from underground sources, which could then be used for plant irrigation. This would provide a reliable and consistent water supply, even in areas with low rainfall. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
