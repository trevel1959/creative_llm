    "\"Mow-bility\": A lawn mower that can transform into a mobility scooter for seniors or people with disabilities. It has a removable seat that can be replaced with a mower deck, and a battery-powered motor that propels the scooter. This would provide an independent and convenient way for seniors to take care of their lawn while also providing them with a means of transportation.",
    "\"Smart Mower\": A lawn mower that uses sensors and artificial intelligence to optimize the mowing process. It can detect the height of the grass and adjust the cutting height accordingly, avoiding cutting the grass too short or too long. It can also map out the lawn and plan the most efficient mowing pattern, reducing the time and effort required.",
    "\"Robo-Mower\": A lawn mower that uses robotic technology to mow the lawn autonomously. It has GPS navigation and obstacle detection sensors, allowing it to navigate the lawn without human intervention. It can be programmed to mow at specific times and can be controlled through a smartphone app.",
    "\"Eco-Mower\": A lawn mower that uses renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to operate. It has solar panels or wind turbines that generate electricity to power the motor, reducing the carbon footprint of lawn care. This would provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered lawn mowers.",
    "\"Mower-Bed\": A lawn mower that doubles as a garden bed. It has a built-in irrigation system and fertilizer dispenser, allowing for easy and convenient gardening. The mower blades can be adjusted to different heights, providing a variety of planting options. This would provide an all-in-one solution for lawn care and gardening."
