    "**Aerostat Ferry**: Design a fleet of high-altitude aerostats (non-rigid airships) that can carry people and cargo across the river. These airships would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, wind-resistant designs, and comfortable passenger cabins. The aerostats would float above the river, allowing passengers to travel safely while taking in breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Water-Walking Platform**: Develop a network of water-walking platforms that use advanced hydrophobic materials and AI-powered stabilization systems to traverse the river. These platforms would be able to adjust to changing water levels, currents, and other environmental factors, ensuring a smooth and stable ride for passengers. The platforms could be designed to accommodate various types of transportation, from pedestrians to vehicles. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**River-Surfing Rafts**: Create a series of specially designed rafts that can ride the river's currents like surfboards. These rafts would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, comfortable seating, and safety features such as impact-absorbing materials and emergency beacons. Passengers would be able to ride the river's waves, enjoying the thrill of river-surfing while being safely guided across the water. (Confidence score: 0.7)",
    "**Submersible Tunnel**: Design and deploy a network of submersible tunnels that can transport people and cargo beneath the river's surface. These tunnels would be equipped with advanced life support systems, navigation, and communication equipment, allowing passengers to travel comfortably and safely through the underwater environment. The tunnels could be used for both short and long-distance travel. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Gravity-Defying Maglev**: Develop a maglev transportation system that uses advanced magnetic levitation technology to transport people and cargo across the river at high speeds. The system would consist of a series of elevated tracks that span the river, with maglev vehicles gliding above the water using magnetic forces. This system would provide a fast, efficient, and safe way to cross the river. (Confidence score: 0.8) [/INST] "
