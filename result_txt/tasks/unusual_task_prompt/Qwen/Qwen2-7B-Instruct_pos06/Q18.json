    "**Innovative Umbrella Design for Rainfall Management**: Develop an umbrella that can control the amount of water absorbed by the canopy based on the rainfall intensity. The system would use sensors and microcontrollers to adjust the size and shape of the canopy in real-time. This could significantly reduce the water volume collected on the ground, potentially aiding in flood prevention. **Confidence Score:** 0.95",
    "**Umbrella as a Smart Weather Station**: Create an umbrella equipped with various sensors (temperature, humidity, wind speed) to provide real-time weather data directly from the user's location. The data could be shared through a smartphone app or a dedicated dashboard, helping users make informed decisions about their daily activities. **Confidence Score:** 0.93",
