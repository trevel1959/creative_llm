    "**Themed Retro Hotel:** Create a hotel that is themed around a specific era (such as the 1920s, 1960s, or 1980s). Each room will be decorated in the style of that period, complete with vintage furniture, artwork, and music. The hotel staff would dress according to the era, providing a fully immersive experience for guests. Offer themed packages such as \"Gatsby's Great Gatsby\" or \"Hippie Dream Trip\" to attract visitors.",
    "**Artisanal Cottage Hotel:** Build a hotel that incorporates various artisan workshops into its design and services. Rooms would be housed within small cottages scattered throughout the property. Guests could participate in daily workshops led by local artisans, such as pottery making, woodworking, glassblowing, or textile arts. Meals would feature locally-sourced ingredients and be prepared by an in-house chef who also teaches cooking classes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Adventure Retreat:** Design a hotel that prioritizes sustainability and environmental conservation. This boutique hotel would be powered entirely by renewable energy sources, use eco-friendly building materials, and employ practices that minimize waste and carbon footprint. Activities would include guided hikes, bird watching, sustainable farming tours, and nature-based wellness programs like yoga and meditation in natural settings.",
    "**Historical Reenactment Hotel:** Transform the hotel into a living museum, offering guests the opportunity to step back in time. Each room would represent a different historical event, complete with authentic artifacts, costumes, and actors portraying significant figures from that era. Guests could choose to \"live\" during the chosen period, participating in historical reenactments, attending themed dinners, and engaging in educational activities related to that time.",
    "**Multisensory Sensory Experience Hotel:** Develop a hotel where each room stimulates multiple senses simultaneously. For example, rooms could incorporate scented candles, soothing aromatherapy oils, ambient soundscapes, and interactive visual displays. Guests could also enjoy special sensory dining experiences, such as a meal designed to evoke specific emotions through taste, sight, and sound. Offer workshops and guided sessions focused on enhancing individual senses and promoting relaxation."
