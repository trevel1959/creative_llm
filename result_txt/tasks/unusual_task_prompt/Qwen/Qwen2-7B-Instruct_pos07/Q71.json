    "**Teapot as a Waterfall Sculpture**: Design a teapot sculpture that resembles a waterfall, using transparent glass or ceramic. The water flows from the spout into a basin, creating an artistic display of liquid cascading down the sides of the teapot. This piece could be displayed on a table or countertop, adding a unique touch to any kitchen decor.",
    "**Teapot as a Personalized Art Gift**: Create a personalized teapot where each teapot is uniquely decorated based on the recipient's interests or hobbies. For instance, a tea lover might receive a teapot adorned with floral patterns, while a music enthusiast could get one with sheet music designs. Each teapot can also have a custom engraving, such as a favorite quote or name, making it a thoughtful gift.",
    "**Teapot as a Sustainable Cooking Utensil**: Develop a line of teapots made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled plastic, or biodegradable ceramics. These teapots could come with interchangeable parts, allowing users to switch out the infuser for other cooking tools like a strainer or saucepan lid. This innovative approach promotes sustainability and versatility in kitchen use.",
    "**Teapot as a Multi-functional Decorative Item**: Design a teapot that serves both functional and decorative purposes. It could feature removable components, such as a detachable handle or lid, which transform it into a vase or a planter when not in use for brewing tea. The teapot could also have a built-in humidifier function, releasing moisture into the air when heated, making it useful in dry environments.",
    "**Teapot as an Interactive Educational Tool**: Create a series of educational teapots that teach children about different cultures, tea types, and brewing techniques. Each teapot could come with a booklet or online guide detailing the history, ingredients, and cultural significance of various teas. This interactive learning experience would make teaching kids about world cultures and healthy habits engaging and fun."
