    "**Multi-Zone Cooking Technology**: Develop a microwave with multiple cooking zones that can operate independently. For example, one side could be set to defrost while the other side cooks, allowing users to prepare different types of food simultaneously without the risk of overcooking or undercooking. This could be especially useful for families preparing multiple meals at once.",
    "**Built-In Air Fryer**: Combine the functionalities of a microwave and an air fryer into one appliance. This hybrid microwave could allow users to quickly heat or defrost food while also offering the option to crisp or brown food without the need for additional oil. This would save counter space and provide healthier cooking options.",
    "**Steam Infusion Feature**: Introduce a steam infusion feature that allows users to add moisture to their food while microwaving. By including a removable water reservoir, users can choose to steam vegetables, fish, or rice, enhancing flavor and retaining nutrients. This would also reduce the risk of food drying out during the cooking process.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and heat to sanitize the microwave interior. Users could activate this function with the press of a button, and after a set time, the microwave would automatically clean itself, eliminating the need for harsh chemicals and making maintenance much easier.",
    "**Customizable Interior Lighting**: Design a microwave with customizable LED interior lighting that can change colors based on cooking modes or user preferences. For instance, a blue light could indicate that the microwave is in defrost mode, while a green light could signify that itâ€™s in cooking mode. This not only adds a modern aesthetic but also provides visual cues to users."
