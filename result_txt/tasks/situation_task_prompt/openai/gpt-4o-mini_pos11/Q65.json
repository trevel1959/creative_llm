    "**Solar-Powered Glow Stones**: These stones would be embedded in the floor or walls of a room. During the day, they would absorb sunlight through a special coating and, at night, they would release that energy as a gentle glow. Different stones could emit different colors, allowing for a customizable light scheme. This eco-friendly option would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, creating a natural, ambient light source that mimics the stars.",
    "**Smart Fireflies**: Utilizing small, programmable drones designed to mimic fireflies, these tiny devices could flutter around the room, emitting soft, warm light. Users could control their flight patterns and brightness through a smartphone app, allowing for dynamic lighting effects. This idea combines technology with nature, creating an enchanting atmosphere reminiscent of a summer evening outdoors.",
    "**Reflective Furniture**: Design furniture with reflective surfaces that can bounce light around the room. For example, a coffee table with mirrored edges or a bookcase with glass shelves could capture and amplify any available light sources, like moonlight or street lamps outside. This would create a unique play of light and shadow, making the room feel more open and illuminated without the need for traditional lighting fixtures.",
    "**Mood-Setting Aromatic Candles**: Beyond just providing light, these candles would be infused with essential oils that release calming scents as they burn. Each candle could be designed to emit a different hue of light, creating a multi-sensory experience. The flickering flame would provide a cozy glow while the aroma helps to relax the mind and body, making it an ideal solution for creating a peaceful atmosphere at night.",
    "**Light-Emitting Textiles**: Develop fabrics that incorporate fiber optics or LED threads, allowing them to glow softly when activated. These textiles could be used for curtains, cushions, or wall hangings. For instance, a curtain made of light-emitting fabric could create a stunning backdrop that illuminates the room in a soft, diffused light, providing both privacy and ambiance."
