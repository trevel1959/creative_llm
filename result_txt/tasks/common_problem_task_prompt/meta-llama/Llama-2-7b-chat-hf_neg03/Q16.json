    "Hiking the Appalachian Trail with a twist: Instead of hiking the traditional route, create a scavenger hunt-style challenge where participants have to find and collect items along the trail that correspond to clues. The items could be anything from a specific type of leaf to a certain type of rock, and the final prize is a hidden treasure at the end of the trail.",
    "Appalachian Trail-themed escape room: Create an immersive escape room experience that takes participants through the entire length of the Appalachian Trail. Participants have to solve puzzles and challenges related to the trail, such as figuring out how to navigate through the mountains, finding shelter from the elements, and avoiding wildlife. The final challenge is to escape the room before time runs out.",
