    "**Innovative Food Fortification**: Develop a system to fortify staple foods such as grains, sugars, or oils with essential vitamins and minerals that are typically found in fruits and vegetables. This could involve creating supplements that are absorbed efficiently by the body when consumed alongside these staples. For example, adding vitamin C to fortified rice could help improve iron absorption.",
    "**Microbial Cultivation**: Cultivate microorganisms that produce essential nutrients like vitamins, amino acids, and minerals. This could be done through fermentation processes or bioreactors, potentially using non-traditional substrates like algae or bacteria that can grow rapidly and efficiently. These could then be used as supplements or added directly to food products.",
    "**Genetically Modified Plants**: Develop genetically modified plants that are designed to produce high levels of essential vitamins and minerals, even if they are not naturally abundant in fruits and vegetables. For instance, creating potatoes that produce high levels of vitamin A or calcium could provide a significant nutritional boost.",
    "**Nutritional Supplements and Powders**: Create a comprehensive line of powders and capsules that contain all essential vitamins and minerals needed for a balanced diet. These could be customized for different age groups, lifestyles, or specific health needs. They could be mixed into drinks, smoothies, or sprinkled on foods to ensure adequate intake.",
    "**Virtual Nutrition Coaching**: Offer personalized nutrition plans based on individual deficiencies and dietary preferences. Using AI algorithms and genetic data, the system could suggest foods rich in missing nutrients or recommend specific supplements. This could be accessed through an app or online platform, providing tailored advice to users."
