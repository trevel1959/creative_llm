    "In a quaint little village, there lived a parrot named Pico who, unlike his feathered friends, couldn’t repeat a single word. While others dazzled their owners with clever phrases, Pico only squawked and chirped. One day, a lonely child named Lily discovered Pico in a pet shop. Instead of being disappointed, she saw his uniqueness. They formed an unbreakable bond, communicating through laughter and gestures. Pico became her confidant, sharing her secrets without words. One evening, Lily whispered her dreams to the stars, and Pico, inspired, let out a beautiful melody that resonated with her heart, proving that words aren’t everything.",
