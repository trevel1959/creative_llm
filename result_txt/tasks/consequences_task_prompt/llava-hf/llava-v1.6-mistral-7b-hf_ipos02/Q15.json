    "**Energy Transition**: A rapid transition to renewable energy sources would be necessary. This would involve a massive investment in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power plants, as well as the development of infrastructure to support these new energy sources. The transition would be challenging, but it could lead to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly world.",
    "**Global Environmental Impact**: Without oil, the environmental impact of transportation and industry would be significantly reduced. This could lead to cleaner air and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier planet. However, the transition to renewable energy would need to be carefully managed to avoid the unintended consequences of rapid change.",
    "**Resource Scarcity**: The loss of oil would lead to a shortage of resources needed for the production of various goods. This would affect everything from plastics and chemicals to fertilizers and synthetic fibers. Governments and industries would need to find alternative sources of these materials or develop new processes to reduce their reliance on oil-based products.",
    "**Infrastructure Overhaul**: The absence of oil would require a reevaluation of infrastructure. New forms of transportation, such as electric trains and buses, would need to be developed and implemented. This would involve significant investment in public transportation systems and the development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.",
    "**Technological Innovation**: The end of oil would spur technological innovation in the fields of energy storage, energy efficiency, and alternative energy sources. Scientists and engineers would focus on creating new technologies that can replace oil in various applications, leading to advancements in energy technology."
