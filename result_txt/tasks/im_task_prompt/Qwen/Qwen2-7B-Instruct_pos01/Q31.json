    "**360-degree Virtual Reality Experience**: Create a camera that captures 360-degree images or videos. This could be used for virtual tours of historical sites, underwater exploration, or even virtual reality concerts and events. The camera would be mounted on a rig that allows it to rotate 360 degrees around its axis, capturing panoramic views from all angles. This idea has a high confidence score because it combines modern technology (virtual reality) with creative content possibilities.",
    "**Smart Lens Camera**: Design a camera lens that can adapt its properties based on the lighting conditions and subject being photographed. For example, the lens could adjust its aperture size, ISO, and focus automatically to optimize image quality in any environment. This innovation would greatly simplify photography for amateur and professional photographers alike. The confidence score is moderate due to the complexity of the technology involved.",
    "**Augmented Reality Makeup Application**: Develop a camera that uses augmented reality to apply makeup virtually onto a person's face. This could allow users to see how different makeup products would look without physically applying them. It would revolutionize the beauty industry by offering personalized makeup application experiences and reducing waste. The confidence score is high as it addresses a practical problem and leverages existing AR technology.",
    "**Autonomous Drone Camera System**: Create a drone equipped with a high-quality camera that can autonomously capture aerial footage of landscapes, sports events, or wildlife. The drone would use advanced AI algorithms to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and stabilize the camera for smooth video. This concept is highly innovative and has a high confidence score due to its potential impact on media production and environmental monitoring.",
    "**Interactive Portrait Photography**: Develop a camera system that allows users to interact with the portrait they are taking. For instance, the camera could add digital elements to the photo in real-time, such as changing backgrounds, adding virtual props, or even animating the subject. This could make portrait photography more engaging and fun, appealing to social media influencers and everyday photographers. The confidence score is moderate since it involves user interaction but has significant creative potential."
