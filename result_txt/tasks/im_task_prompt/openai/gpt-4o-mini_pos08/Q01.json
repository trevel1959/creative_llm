    "**Biometric Feedback Integration**: Incorporate advanced biometric sensors that not only track heart rate and activity levels but also measure stress levels, hydration, and even blood oxygen saturation. The watch could then provide personalized health recommendations based on real-time data, such as reminders to hydrate, take breaks, or practice mindfulness, promoting overall well-being.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging**: Enhance the wristwatch with solar panels integrated into the watch face or strap. This would allow the watch to charge itself using sunlight, reducing the need for battery replacements and making it more eco-friendly. The watch could also include a low-power mode that activates when sunlight is detected, extending battery life even further.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Display**: Develop a wristwatch with a small, foldable AR display that projects information onto a surface, such as a wrist or a nearby wall. Users could access notifications, messages, and even navigation prompts in an interactive format. This would create a more immersive experience and allow for hands-free operation, making it ideal for multitasking.",
    "**Adaptive Strap Technology**: Design a smart strap that adapts to the user’s wrist size and comfort preferences. The strap could use a combination of flexible materials and smart technology to adjust its fit automatically throughout the day, providing optimal comfort whether the user is exercising, working, or relaxing.",
    "**Personalized AI Assistant**: Integrate an AI assistant that learns the user’s habits and preferences over time. This assistant could offer personalized reminders, schedule management, and even health tracking suggestions. The watch could communicate with other smart devices in the home, acting as a central hub for managing daily tasks and routines."
