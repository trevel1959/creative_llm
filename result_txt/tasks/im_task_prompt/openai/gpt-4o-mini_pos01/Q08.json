    "**Adaptive Temperature Zones**: Design the refrigerator with adaptive temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For instance, a section for fruits and vegetables could maintain a slightly higher humidity level, while meat and dairy sections could be kept colder. Users could customize these zones via an app, allowing for optimal preservation of different food types.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Generator**: Equip the refrigerator with a built-in recipe generator that analyzes the contents and suggests recipes based on available ingredients. By integrating with smart home assistants, users could ask for meal ideas based on what they have on hand, making meal planning easier and reducing food waste.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Develop a refrigerator that utilizes eco-friendly cooling technologies, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration, which are more energy-efficient and have a lower environmental impact than traditional compressor-based systems. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to reducing overall energy consumption.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Create a refrigerator with a self-cleaning interior feature using UV-C light technology. This would help eliminate bacteria and odors without the need for harsh chemicals, making it easier for users to maintain a clean and hygienic environment for their food storage.",
    "**Customizable Exterior Panels**: Introduce customizable exterior panels that allow users to change the look of their refrigerator according to their kitchen decor or personal style.
