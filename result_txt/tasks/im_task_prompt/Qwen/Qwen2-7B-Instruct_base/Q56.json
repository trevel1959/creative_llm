    "**Music-Playing Bicycle Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that can play a tune when it is rung. The bell could be integrated with a small speaker and a microcontroller that plays music from an MP3 file or even live streaming audio. The user can choose from various songs or tones to customize their ride experience. This idea can add a fun element to biking, especially for kids and adults who enjoy music.",
    "**Emergency Signal Bicycle Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that can emit an emergency signal, such as a high-pitched alarm or a specific sound pattern that alerts others of potential danger. This could be particularly useful in urban areas where visibility might be low or when a cyclist needs to quickly warn pedestrians or other vehicles of an impending collision.",
    "**GPS-Linked Bicycle Bell**: Develop a smart bicycle bell that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The app can provide real-time information about the location of the rider, which can be shared with friends or family members for safety purposes. In case of an accident, the app can automatically alert pre-defined contacts with the location of the accident, ensuring timely help arrives.",
    "**Interactive Bicycle Bell**: Create a bicycle bell that incorporates sensors to detect the speed and incline of the terrain. The bell can change its pitch or tone based on these conditions. For example, a faster speed might result in a higher pitch, indicating urgency, while a steeper incline could trigger a more melodious sound, providing a unique auditory feedback system for cyclists.",
    "**Biometric Bicycle Bell**: Integrate health monitoring features into a bicycle bell, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels. The bell can monitor the rider's vitals and, if certain thresholds are breached (indicating potential health issues), it can automatically ring to alert the rider to slow down or seek medical assistance. This could be particularly beneficial for individuals who cycle long distances or engage in high-intensity workouts. "
