    "Create a new type of insect that is beneficial to humans: One idea could be to genetically engineer insects that can help humans in various ways, such as pollinating crops or cleaning up pollution. These insects could be designed to be non-threatening to humans and to only interact with certain types of plants or materials.",
    "Develop new methods for pest control: Another idea could be to develop new methods for controlling pests without relying on traditional pesticides. This could include using natural predators, creating traps that mimic the behavior of pests, or developing chemicals that are safe for humans but deadly to pests.",
    "Create artificial ecosystems: If all animals were gone, it would be important to find ways to create artificial ecosystems that could support life. One idea could be to create habitats that mimic natural environments, complete with plants, water sources, and other features that are essential for supporting life.",
    "Explore alternative food sources: With all animals gone, it would be necessary to explore alternative food sources. One idea could be to cultivate plants that are high in protein and other nutrients, or to develop new technologies that allow humans to extract nutrients from non-food sources.",
    "Implement strict conservation measures: Finally, if all animals were gone, it would be important to implement strict conservation measures to prevent similar situations from happening in the future. This could include protecting endangered species, reducing habitat destruction, and promoting sustainable practices in agriculture and industry."
