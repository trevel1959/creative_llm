    "**Communication Barriers**: Traditional radio waves cannot travel through water, especially at great depths, leading to communication challenges between the submersible and the surface team. A solution could involve using acoustic communication systems that convert data into sound waves, allowing for real-time updates and data transfer. Moreover, the team could deploy a network of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can relay information back to the surface, ensuring continuous communication.",
    "**Limited Power Supply**: Operating in the deep ocean requires a reliable power source for extended missions. The team could explore renewable energy options, such as utilizing ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) or tidal energy converters that could provide continuous power to the submersible. Additionally, incorporating advanced battery technologies, such as lithium-sulfur or solid-state batteries, could enhance energy storage and extend mission durations.",
    "**Navigational Challenges**: Navigating the dark and featureless environment of the deep ocean can be incredibly difficult. To overcome this, the team could develop advanced sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) to create detailed maps of the ocean floor in real-time. These systems could use machine learning algorithms to identify and avoid obstacles, improving safety and efficiency during exploration.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Deep-sea missions can disturb delicate ecosystems and marine life. To minimize environmental impact, the team could implement strict protocols for minimizing disturbances, such as using non-invasive sampling techniques and ensuring that any waste generated during the mission is properly managed. Additionally, the team could partner with marine biologists to study the ecosystems being explored and create guidelines for sustainable exploration practices.",
    "**Crew Safety and Health**: The physical and psychological well-being of the crew is paramount during extended missions. To ensure crew safety, the team could design a comprehensive health monitoring system that tracks vital signs and stress levels in real-time. Moreover, creating a comfortable living environment within the submersible, with provisions for exercise, relaxation, and mental health support, would help maintain morale and overall health during long-duration missions."
