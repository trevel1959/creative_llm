    "**Eco-Friendly Replaceable Brush Heads**: Develop brush heads made from biodegradable materials or with a modular design that allows users to replace only the bristle section instead of the entire head. This approach would reduce plastic waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. A subscription service could also be offered, sending new brush heads directly to users on a regular schedule.",
    "**Integrated UV Sanitizer**: Incorporate a UV light sanitizing feature within the toothbrush holder or charging base. This would automatically sanitize the brush head after each use, eliminating bacteria and ensuring that the toothbrush remains hygienic. Users would appreciate the added layer of cleanliness, especially in households with multiple toothbrushes.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience for Kids**: Create an electric toothbrush specifically designed for children that incorporates gamification elements. The toothbrush could connect to a mobile app where kids can earn points or rewards for proper brushing techniques and duration. The app could feature fun characters and challenges that make brushing enjoyable, helping to instill good oral hygiene habits from a young age.",
    "**Customizable Brushing Modes**: Design an electric toothbrush with customizable brushing modes that can be tailored to individual needs. Users could select modes for sensitive teeth, gum care, whitening, or even a massage mode for gums. This would allow users to personalize their oral care routine and cater to specific dental concerns.",
    "**Voice-Activated Toothbrush**: Develop a voice-activated electric toothbrush that can respond to simple commands, such as “start brushing” or “stop.” It could also provide auditory instructions for proper brushing techniques, making it easier for users to focus on their technique without needing to check their phones or mirrors. This would be particularly useful for visually impaired users or those who prefer hands-free operation."
