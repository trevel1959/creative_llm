    "**Air Traffic Chaos**: With every human able to fly, air traffic control systems would be overwhelmed. The sheer number of flyers would lead to congestion, delays, and potential accidents. Governments would need to establish new regulations, infrastructure, and protocols to manage the skies. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Environmental Impact**: As humans take to the skies, they would inadvertently contribute to air pollution, noise pollution, and disturbance of natural habitats. This could lead to a decline in air quality, noise pollution complaints, and damage to ecosystems. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Social Stratification**: The ability to fly would likely become a status symbol, with the wealthy and privileged having access to better, more advanced flying technology. This could exacerbate social inequalities, as those who cannot afford to fly would be left behind. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Psychological Effects**: Humans would need to adapt to a new reality where they are constantly exposed to the thrill and freedom of flight. This could lead to a rise in thrill-seeking behaviors, increased stress levels, and a decrease in attention span. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Global Economic Shifts**: The ability to fly would revolutionize global trade, commerce, and tourism. New industries would emerge, and existing ones would need to adapt to the changing landscape. This could lead to significant economic growth, but also increased competition and potential job displacement. (Confidence: 0.9)"
