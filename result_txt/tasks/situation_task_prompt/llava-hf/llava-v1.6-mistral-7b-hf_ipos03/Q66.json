    "**Modular Eco-Houses**: If natural materials are no longer available, architects could design modular eco-houses made from sustainable and recycled materials. These houses could be prefabricated off-site and then transported to the construction site, where they would be assembled. This approach would minimize waste and the environmental impact of construction.",
    "**Earthbag Houses**: Earthbag houses are a type of low-cost, eco-friendly housing that can be made using locally available materials like sandbags, mud, and straw. In a world without natural materials, these houses could be constructed using recycled materials like old tires, plastic bottles, or metal containers. The walls would be made by filling these bags with soil, mud, or other available materials, and then compacting them to create a strong and durable wall.",
    "**Insulated Geodesic Domes**: Geodesic domes are a type of housing that uses a unique, dome-like structure to provide insulation and protection from the elements. In a world without natural materials, these domes could be constructed using recycled materials like metal sheets, plastic sheeting, or even old car parts. The dome shape allows for efficient use of space and provides excellent insulation, making it an ideal solution for housing.",
    "**Hydroponic Gardens**: In a world without natural materials, vertical gardens could be used to grow food and provide natural insulation. These gardens would be built using recycled materials like old shipping containers, metal frames, or even old buses. The walls of these gardens would be filled with hydroponic systems, which would allow for the growth of plants without soil.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Container Homes**: Container homes are a type of housing that uses shipping containers as the primary building material. In a world without natural materials, these homes could be constructed using recycled shipping containers, which would be modified to include windows, doors, and insulation. The containers would be stacked on top of each other to create multi-level homes, which would maximize space and reduce waste."
