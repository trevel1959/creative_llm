    "**Eco-Friendly Space Exploration**: Develop a spacecraft that utilizes renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or advanced nuclear reactors, to power its propulsion systems. The spacecraft could also be designed to harness and utilize resources found in space, such as water and minerals, to reduce its reliance on Earth-based supplies. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of space exploration but also enable longer and more sustainable missions.",
    "**Artificial Gravity through Rotating Sections**: Create a spacecraft with rotating sections that generate artificial gravity through centrifugal force. This would allow for longer-term spaceflight without the need for artificial gravity through other means, such as rotating wheels or gravitational simulators. The rotating sections could also be used to create stable and comfortable living quarters for astronauts.",
    "**In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) for Life Support**: Develop a system that utilizes resources found in space to create life support systems, such as air, water, and food, for long-duration space missions. This could include extracting water from lunar or Martian regolith, or using Martian atmospheric gases to produce oxygen and nitrogen.",
    "**3D Printing in Space**: Develop a 3D printing technology that can be used in space to create tools, spare parts, and other essential items. This would enable astronauts to repair and maintain their spacecraft and equipment without relying on resupply missions from Earth. The 3D printing technology could also be used to create habitats and other infrastructure for long-term space missions.",
    "**Closed-Loop Life Support Systems**: Design a closed-loop life support system that recycles and reuses resources, such as air, water, and waste, to minimize the need for resupply missions and reduce the environmental impact of space exploration. This could include systems for air recycling, water purification, and waste management."
