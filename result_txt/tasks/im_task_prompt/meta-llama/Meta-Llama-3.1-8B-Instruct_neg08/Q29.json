The app could also include features like task reminders, progress tracking, and rewards for completing tasks.",
    "**The Task Jar**: Create a physical or digital \"task jar\" where users can submit their completed tasks.

    "**Task Party**: Host virtual or in-person \"task parties\" where users can gather to work on their tasks together.
