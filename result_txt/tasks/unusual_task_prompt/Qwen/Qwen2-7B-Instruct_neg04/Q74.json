    "**Innovative Wheelchair Design**: Imagine a wheelchair that incorporates a steering wheel similar to those found in cars. This design could offer more control and maneuverability for users, particularly those who have full upper body mobility but limited leg function. The steering wheel would be connected to the wheelchair's drive system through a series of gears or motors, allowing the user to navigate the chair with precision and ease. Additionally, incorporating modern technologies like GPS navigation, voice commands, and intuitive controls could enhance the user experience significantly.",
    "**Interactive Fitness Wheel**: Create a fitness machine that combines the traditional treadmill with a steering wheel. Users can control their speed and direction by turning the wheel, making cardio workouts more engaging and dynamic. This could also include virtual reality components where the user \"drives\" through different environments, simulating outdoor runs or scenic routes. This innovative approach not only makes exercise more enjoyable but also provides a unique form of cardiovascular training.",
    "**Portable Wheelchair Control System**: Develop a portable device that allows users to control their wheelchair using gestures, similar to how one might steer a car. The device could be attached to a smartphone or tablet and use advanced motion sensors to interpret hand movements. The user could then direct the wheelchair's movement with simple gestures, such as swiping left or right to change directions or pressing down to accelerate. This system would make it easier for individuals with limited mobility to operate their wheelchairs independently.",
    "**Augmented Reality Guided Wheelchair Navigation**: Integrate an augmented reality (AR) system into the steering wheel of a wheelchair. The AR display would overlay real-time navigation instructions, maps, and obstacles directly onto the userâ€™s field of vision. This would provide a hands-free, intuitive way for users to navigate unfamiliar environments, such as crowded public spaces or complex indoor layouts. The system could also include features like predictive path planning and dynamic route adjustments based on real-time data.",
    "**Emergency Response Wheelchair**: Design a specialized wheelchair with a steering wheel that incorporates emergency response capabilities. This could include a quick-release mechanism to detach the chair from standard tracks or pathways, allowing the user to easily transfer to other modes of transportation like ambulances or helicopters. The steering wheel could also be equipped with additional buttons or switches to control onboard medical equipment or alert emergency services in case of an accident or medical emergency. This innovation aims to improve safety and independence for individuals who require immediate medical attention while in motion."
