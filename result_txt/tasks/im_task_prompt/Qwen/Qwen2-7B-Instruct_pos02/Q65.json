    "**Innovative Temperature Control**: Create an electric kettle that has a smart feature which allows users to select specific temperature settings for different types of tea or coffee. The kettle can also be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to set these preferences in advance and have their water ready at the desired temperature when they want it. This idea could be particularly appealing to busy professionals who appreciate a personalized and efficient brewing experience.",
    "**Sustainable Heating Element**: Develop an electric kettle made from eco-friendly materials, powered by renewable energy sources such as solar panels. The kettle could be designed to heat up only when sunlight is available, reducing its carbon footprint significantly. It could also include a rechargeable battery for use on cloudy days, further enhancing its sustainability appeal.",
    "**Smart Water Filtration System**: Integrate a built-in water filtration system into the electric kettle. This would ensure that the water is not only heated but also purified, making it safer and healthier to drink. The filter could be designed to automatically indicate when it needs to be replaced, ensuring continuous water quality.",
    "**Voice-Activated Assistant Integration**: Incorporate a voice-activated assistant like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant into the electric kettle. Users can simply ask the kettle to heat water to their preferred temperature, start brewing their tea or coffee, or even set reminders for when their water is ready. This feature would cater to tech-savvy consumers who prefer hands-free operation and integration with their smart home devices.",
    "**Portable Electric Kettle with Solar Charger**: Design a compact, portable electric kettle that includes a solar panel on its lid. This makes it perfect for camping trips, outdoor events, or emergency preparedness kits. The kettle can charge using solar energy, eliminating the need for a power outlet, and it can still be used to boil water quickly, even in remote locations."
