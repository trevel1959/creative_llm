    "Virtual Reality Experience: With the disappearance of movies and theatres, we could create a virtual reality experience that allows people to immerse themselves in a cinematic world. This could be done by setting up virtual reality booths in public spaces where people can put on a headset and experience a movie or a live theatre performance. The virtual reality experience could be designed to simulate the feeling of being in a movie theatre, with the added bonus of being able to interact with the virtual environment.",
    "Pop-up Cinema: We could create a pop-up cinema experience that brings the movie theatre experience to people in unexpected places. This could be done by setting up screens in public spaces like parks, streets, or rooftops and showing movies under the stars. The experience could be enhanced by adding food trucks, live music, and other interactive elements.",
    "Movie Screening in Unusual Locations: We could screen movies in unusual locations like abandoned buildings, old warehouses, or even on boats. These locations could be transformed into a cinematic experience by adding lighting, sound, and seating. This would provide a unique and immersive experience for moviegoers.",
    "Interactive Movie Experience: We could create an interactive movie experience where the audience can influence the storyline of the movie. This could be done by setting up interactive screens where the audience can vote on different plot points or make decisions that affect the outcome of the movie. This would make the moviegoing experience more engaging and interactive.",
    "Live Theatre Experience: We could create a live theatre experience that brings the energy and excitement of a live theatre performance to people. This could be done by setting up a stage in a public space and performing live theatre shows. The experience could be enhanced by adding interactive elements like audience participation or immersive sets. This would provide a unique and memorable experience for theatre-goers."
