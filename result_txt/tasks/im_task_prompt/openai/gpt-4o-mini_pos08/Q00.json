    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: Develop a pencil with an adjustable grip that can be tailored to the user's hand size and writing style. This pencil could feature a soft, moldable material that conforms to the user's fingers, reducing strain during extended writing sessions. It could also include a built-in fidget mechanism to help with focus and anxiety.",
    "**Color-Changing Graphite**: Create a pencil with a special graphite core that changes color based on the pressure applied while writing. This feature would not only provide visual feedback to the writer about their writing pressure but could also add an artistic element to sketches and notes, making them more engaging and interactive.",
    "**Refillable Multi-Lead Pencil**: Design a pencil that can hold multiple leads of different colors or hardness levels. Users could easily switch between leads by rotating a dial on the pencil body, allowing for a seamless transition between sketching, writing, and shading without needing multiple pencils. This would be particularly useful for artists and students who require versatility in their tools.",
    "**Built-in Sharpener and Eraser**: Innovate a pencil that has a compact, built-in sharpener and eraser. The sharpener could be located at the end of the pencil, allowing users to sharpen it without needing an external tool. The eraser could be retractable, keeping it clean and protected when not in use. This all-in-one design would enhance convenience and reduce the need for extra accessories.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Pencil with Seed Capsules**: Create a pencil made from sustainable materials that contains seed capsules within its body. Once the pencil is too short to use, users can plant it in the soil, and the seeds will germinate, growing into plants or herbs. This eco-friendly approach would encourage sustainability and promote environmental awareness while providing a second life to the pencil."
