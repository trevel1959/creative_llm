    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One potential solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil suddenly disappeared is to switch to solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles would use photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which would then power an electric motor. This would eliminate the need for fossil fuels and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option for powering vehicles without oil is to use hydrogen fuel cells. These cells convert hydrogen into electricity, which can then be used to power an electric motor. Hydrogen can be produced through various means, such as splitting water molecules using solar energy or capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into hydrogen.",
    "Bio-Ethanol: Bio-ethanol is a renewable fuel that can be produced from biomass sources such as corn, sugarcane, or switchgrass. This fuel can be blended with gasoline to power vehicles, reducing the need for fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Electric Bikes and Scooters: Another creative solution to power vehicles without oil is to promote the use of electric bikes and scooters. These vehicles are already becoming increasingly popular in many parts of the world, particularly in urban areas. They are an environmentally friendly mode of transportation that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.",
    "Advanced Nuclear Power: Another option for powering vehicles without oil is to use advanced nuclear power. This involves using advanced reactor designs that can produce electricity with minimal waste and radiation. This electricity can then be used to power electric vehicles, eliminating the need for fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
