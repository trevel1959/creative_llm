    "Food scarcity: Deserted islands typically do not have a variety of edible plants or animals, making it difficult to find enough food to sustain oneself. Survivors would have to rely on their stored food supplies, which may not be enough to last indefinitely.",
    "Lack of shelter: With no natural cover or structures, survivors would have to build their own shelter from scratch, which can be challenging and time-consuming. Building a shelter also requires the right materials, such as wood or fabric, which may not be readily available on the island.",
    "Navigation difficulties: Without any landmarks or reference points, survivors may have difficulty navigating the island and finding their way back to civilization. This could lead to disorientation and potentially dangerous situations.",
    "Limited communication: There may be no cell phone service or other means of communication on the island, making it difficult to call for help or communicate with others. Survivors would have to rely on other means of communication, such as smoke signals or morse code.",
    "Health hazards: Deserted islands can be home to various health hazards, such as insects, snakes, or even the remains of dead animals. Survivors would have to be aware of these hazards and take necessary precautions to avoid injury or infection."
