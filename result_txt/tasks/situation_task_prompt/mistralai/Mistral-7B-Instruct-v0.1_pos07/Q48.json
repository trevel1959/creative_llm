    "Use a natural alarm: If there were no birds, you could use the natural sounds of nature to wake you up in the morning. For example, you could set up a device that plays the sound of a babbling brook or a chorus of crickets.",
    "Use a sound machine: If you don't like the natural sounds of nature, you could use a sound machine that plays a variety of sounds to wake you up. You could choose from different alarm clock sounds, nature sounds, or even music.",
    "Use a light box: If you have trouble waking up in the morning, you could use a light box to simulate the natural light of the sun. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to wake up in the morning.",
    "Use a voice recorder: If you have a voice recorder, you could record yourself saying a motivational quote or a positive affirmation to wake you up in the morning. This can help you start your day off on the right foot.",
    "Use a smart home device: If you have a smart home device, you could use it to set up a routine that wakes you up in the morning. For example, you could set up a smart thermostat to raise the temperature in your room, or a smart light to turn on. This can help you feel more alert and awake in the morning."
