    "**Information Overload**: With the ability to recall every piece of information they've ever read, humans would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data. Their minds would be flooded with trivial facts, historical events, and fictional stories, making it difficult to focus on anything else. They might struggle to filter out irrelevant information, leading to mental fatigue and decreased productivity.",
    "**Loss of Imagination**: If humans could remember everything they read, they might lose the ability to imagine and create new ideas. With the weight of all that knowledge, they might feel like they've already read it all, and their minds would be less inclined to explore new possibilities. This could stifle innovation and artistic expression.",
    "**Memory Contamination**: If humans could remember everything they read, their memories might become contaminated with misinformation, biases, and inaccuracies. They might recall fictional stories as fact, or remember events that never occurred. This could lead to the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in institutions.",
    "**Social Consequences**: With the ability to recall every piece of information they've ever read, humans might become overly reliant on others for validation and verification. They might constantly seek external confirmation, leading to social anxiety, dependence on others, and decreased self-confidence.",
    "**Existential Crisis**: If humans could remember everything they read, they might develop a profound sense of existential dread. They would be aware of the entirety of human knowledge, including the darker aspects of history, the fragility of life, and the inevitability of death. This could lead to a crisis of purpose, as they struggle to find meaning in a world where they've seen it all before."
