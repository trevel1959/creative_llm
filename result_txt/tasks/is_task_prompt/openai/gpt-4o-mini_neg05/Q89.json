    "Once upon a time in the enchanted land of Misty Meadows, there lived a dragon named Sniffles. Unlike other dragons, Sniffles had an uncontrollable sneeze that echoed through the valleys. Whenever he sneezed, colorful clouds of glitter and sparkles erupted, causing flowers to bloom instantly and rainbows to form in the sky. ",
    "The villagers initially feared him, but soon discovered his sneezes brought good fortune. They embraced Sniffles, turning his sneezes into a festival where everyone danced under the shimmering lights. With each sneeze, Sniffles found joy in his uniqueness, proving that even the quirkiest traits can bring happiness to the world.",
