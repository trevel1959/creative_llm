    "**Modular Key System**: Create a piano with interchangeable keys that can change size or resistance based on the player’s skill level or specific exercises. For beginners, the keys could be wider and softer, making it easier to press down. For advanced players, the keys could become narrower and firmer, allowing for more nuanced playing techniques.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Visuals**: Implement AR technology that projects visual guides above the piano keys when viewed through a smartphone or AR glasses. This could show finger placements, chord diagrams, or even a virtual instructor demonstrating techniques, enhancing the learning experience and making practice more engaging.",
    "**Built-in Composition Assistant**: Design a piano with a built-in AI composition assistant that can help users create music. By analyzing the player’s style and preferences, it could suggest chord progressions, melodies, or harmonies. Users could experiment with these suggestions, making the creative process more collaborative and accessible.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate by constructing pianos from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This not only reduces the environmental impact of piano production but can also lead to unique acoustic properties. The design could be aesthetically pleasing while promoting eco-consciousness among musicians.",
    "**Sound Customization Features**: Introduce a digital interface that allows players to customize the sound of their piano. This could include adjusting the timbre, adding effects like reverb or delay, or even changing the piano's tuning system. This feature would cater to a wider range of musical styles and preferences, allowing for greater creative expression."
