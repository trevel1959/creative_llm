    "Electric Vehicles: With the disappearance of oil, the world would have to rely on alternative sources of energy to power vehicles. Electric vehicles (EVs) would become the primary mode of transportation, as they produce zero emissions and are powered by renewable energy sources. Governments and automakers would invest heavily in developing EVs, expanding charging infrastructure, and providing incentives for consumers to switch to them.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Another option for powering vehicles without oil would be hydrogen fuel cells. These fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water as a byproduct. They have the potential to be a clean and efficient source of power for vehicles, but they currently face several challenges, including the lack of infrastructure and the high cost of production.",
    "Battery-Powered Vehicles: Battery-powered vehicles (BEVs) are another alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. They use rechargeable batteries to store energy, which can be used to power an electric motor. While they are not as efficient as EVs, they are still a viable option for short-range commuting and can be charged at home or at public charging stations.",
    "Solar-Powered Vehicles: Solar-powered vehicles use solar panels to generate electricity, which can be used to power an electric motor. They are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be a clean and sustainable source of power for vehicles. Governments and automakers would need to invest heavily in developing and deploying this technology.",
    "Nuclear-Powered Vehicles: Nuclear-powered vehicles use nuclear reactors to generate electricity, which can be used to power an electric motor. While they are not as clean as other alternatives, they have the potential to be a reliable and efficient source of power for vehicles. However, they face several challenges, including the risk of accidents and the high cost of production."
