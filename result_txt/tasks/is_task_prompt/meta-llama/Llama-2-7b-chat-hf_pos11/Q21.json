    "Snail-Powered Vehicles: Create a line of snail-powered vehicles that use the slimy trail of the snail to generate energy. These vehicles could be electric cars, buses, or even motorcycles. The slimy trail would act as a natural lubricant, reducing friction and improving fuel efficiency. The vehicles could be designed to mimic the shell of the snail, with the slimy trail running along the bottom of the vehicle, providing a smooth and efficient ride.",
    "Snail-Inspired Exoskeleton Suits: Develop exoskeleton suits inspired by the structure of snail shells. These suits would provide wearers with enhanced strength and protection, while also allowing for greater flexibility and mobility. The suits could be made from a lightweight, flexible material that mimics the structure of snail shells, providing a durable and comfortable fit.",
    "Snail-Shaped Satellites: Design and launch snail-shaped satellites that can navigate through space using their slimy trail as a propulsion system. These satellites could be used for a variety of purposes, including Earth observation, communication, and navigation. The snail-shaped design would allow the satellites to maneuver through space more efficiently, while also providing a unique and eye-catching appearance.",
    "Snail-Inspired Building Materials: Develop building materials inspired by the structure of snail shells. These materials could be used to create stronger, more durable buildings that are resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. The materials could be made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, mimicking the layers of the snail shell for added strength and protection.",
    "Snail-Powered Generators: Create generators that use the movement of snails to generate electricity. These generators could be used in areas where traditional power sources are not available, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy. The generators could be designed to harness the energy produced by the snails as they move, converting it into electricity that can be used to power homes, businesses, and communities."
