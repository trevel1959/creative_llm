    "Utilize natural fragrances: If all perfumes disappeared, we could create pleasant scents by utilizing natural fragrances found in nature. This could include scents from flowers, herbs, spices, and other natural sources. We could also explore the use of essential oils to create unique and pleasant scents.",
    "Incorporate edible ingredients: Another way to create pleasant scents would be to incorporate edible ingredients into our fragrances. This could include scents from fruits, vegetables, and other foods. For example, we could create a fragrance that smells like freshly baked cookies or a fruit salad.",
    "Use electronic devices: We could also create pleasant scents using electronic devices such as diffusers or sprayers. These devices could be programmed to release scents at specific times or in specific locations, creating a customized scent experience.",
    "Create a scent garden: We could create a scent garden by planting fragrant plants and flowers. This would provide a natural and sustainable way to create pleasant scents. We could also experiment with different types of plants and flowers to create unique and pleasant fragrances.",
    "Experiment with new materials: Finally, we could experiment with new materials to create pleasant scents. This could include using natural materials such as wood, stone, or clay to create scents. We could also explore the use of synthetic materials to create unique and long-lasting scents."
