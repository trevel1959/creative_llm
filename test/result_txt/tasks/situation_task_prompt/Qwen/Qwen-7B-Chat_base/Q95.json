    "Create a DIY Pillow Tower: You can create a pillow tower by stacking several pillows on top of each other. This will provide you with a comfortable place to rest your head and neck while sleeping. To make it more comfortable, you can use soft and fluffy pillows that are supportive enough to hold your head in place.",
    "Use a Pillow as a Headrest: If you don't have any pillows at home, you can use a hard surface like a book or a wooden block as a makeshift headrest. However, this may not be very comfortable for long periods of time. Alternatively, you can use a rolled-up towel or blanket as a substitute for a pillow.",
    "Sleep on Your Back: Sleeping on your back is one of the best positions for your spine health. However, if all pillows disappear, you might find it difficult to maintain this position. In such cases, you can try sleeping on a flat surface like a yoga mat or a floor. Just make sure that you have some cushioning underneath your body to prevent discomfort.",
    "Use a Comfortable Pillow Case: Even if you don't have any pillows, you can still rest your head comfortably by using a comfortable pillow case. Choose a pillow case made from soft and breathable fabric that feels good against your skin. This will help keep your head cool and comfortable during sleep.",
    "Create a Pillow Using a T-Shirt: If you have access to a sewing machine, you can create a makeshift pillow using an old t-shirt. Cut out the armholes and sew them together to form a square-shaped pillow. Fill it with shredded paper or cotton balls to add some padding. This pillow is lightweight and easy to carry around, making it perfect for camping or traveling."
