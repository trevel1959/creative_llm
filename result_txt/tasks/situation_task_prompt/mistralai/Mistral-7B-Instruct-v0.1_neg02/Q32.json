    "Brush and floss regularly: Without dentists, people would have to rely on their own oral hygiene practices to maintain their teeth. Brushing and flossing regularly would be crucial in preventing cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues.",
    "Use natural remedies: Some people might turn to natural remedies to clean their teeth, such as using baking soda and water or oil pulling. These methods may not be as effective as professional teeth cleaning, but they could help maintain oral health in the absence of dentists.",
    "DIY teeth whitening: People could try to whiten their teeth using at-home whitening kits or natural ingredients like strawberries and baking soda. However, these methods may not be as effective as professional teeth whitening and could lead to uneven results.",
    "Use mouthwash: Mouthwash can help prevent cavities and gum disease, but it's not a substitute for professional teeth cleaning. People would need to be diligent about using mouthwash regularly and flossing to maintain good oral health.",
    "Visit the dentist less frequently: While it's not ideal, some people might choose to visit the dentist less frequently in the absence of regular check-ups and cleanings. This could lead to more severe oral health issues down the line, but it would be better than not visiting the dentist at all."
