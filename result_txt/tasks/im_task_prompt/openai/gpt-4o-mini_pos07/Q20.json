    "**Integrated Water Filtration System**:    Enhance the coffee maker with a built-in water filtration system that purifies tap water before brewing. This would ensure that every cup of coffee tastes its best by removing impurities and enhancing the flavor profile. The filtration system could be easily replaceable and equipped with an indicator that alerts users when it needs changing.",
    "**Personalized Coffee Pods**:    Develop a system that allows users to create their own coffee pods with custom blends. This could be achieved by providing a pod-making kit that includes various coffee grounds, flavorings (like vanilla or hazelnut), and even spices. Users could experiment with different combinations and store them in a dedicated pod drawer for easy access.",
    "**Temperature Control and Pre-Infusion Settings**:    Introduce advanced temperature control features that allow users to set the precise brewing temperature, as different coffee beans require different temperatures for optimal extraction. Additionally, a pre-infusion setting could allow for a bloom phase where hot water is introduced to the coffee grounds before full brewing, enhancing flavor extraction.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**:    Create a coffee maker made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bamboo. Additionally, incorporate energy-saving modes that turn off the machine after a set period of inactivity. Users could also have the option to use biodegradable coffee pods or even a reusable pod system that reduces waste.",
    "**Multi-Brew Functionality**:    Design a coffee maker that can brew different types of coffee simultaneously. For instance, it could have separate compartments for brewing espresso, drip coffee, and cold brew, allowing users to enjoy various styles without needing multiple machines. This would be perfect for households with different coffee preferences."
