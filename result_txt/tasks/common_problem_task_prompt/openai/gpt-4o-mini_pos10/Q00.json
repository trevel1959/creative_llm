    "**Overestimating Guest Capacity**: Parents may invite more guests than their space can comfortably accommodate, leading to overcrowding and discomfort. This can also affect the safety of the children, as there may not be enough adult supervision. To prevent this, it's crucial to assess the available space and set a reasonable guest limit based on that capacity, while also considering the number of adults who will be present.",
    "**Age-Inappropriate Activities**: Planning activities that are too advanced or too simplistic for the age group can lead to disinterest or frustration. For example, organizing a scavenger hunt that requires reading skills may leave some children feeling excluded. To address this, activities should be age-appropriate, ensuring they are engaging yet simple enough for all attendees to participate and enjoy.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions Ignored**: Children may have allergies or dietary restrictions that parents might overlook while planning the menu. For instance, a cake with nuts or snacks containing gluten could pose serious health risks for some kids. To avoid this issue, it's essential to communicate with parents beforehand about any allergies or dietary needs and provide a variety of food options that are safe for all children.",
    "**Weather Uncertainties**: If the party is planned outdoors, unexpected weather changes can disrupt the festivities. Rain or extreme heat can lead to a last-minute scramble to move everything indoors. To mitigate this risk, parents should have a backup plan in place, such as reserving an indoor space or having tents available, and checking the weather forecast leading up to the event.",
    "**Lack of Engagement**: If the party lacks structured activities or games, children may become restless and bored, leading to unruly behavior. For example, if the party consists solely of free play without any organized games, it may result in chaos. To keep children engaged, it’s important to plan a schedule that includes a variety of activities, such as games, crafts, and storytime, ensuring there’s something for everyone to enjoy."
