    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Develop a line of solar-powered lanterns that can be placed around the home or office to provide a soft, warm glow during the day. These lanterns can be charged during the day using solar panels and can provide light for several hours at night.",
    "Smart Light Bulbs: Create smart light bulbs that can adjust their brightness and color temperature based on the amount of natural light available in the room. These bulbs can be controlled using a smartphone app, ensuring that the lighting in the room is always optimized for the time of day.",
    "Daylight Harvesting: Develop a system that can harness the natural light from outside windows and redirect it inside the home or office. This can be achieved through the use of mirrors, lenses, or prisms that focus the light and direct it towards the desired area.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Breed and cultivate plants that have the ability to emit light, such as certain species of algae or mushrooms. These plants can be placed in areas where light is needed, providing a natural and sustainable source of illumination.",
    "Cloud-Based Lighting: Develop a cloud-based lighting system that can adjust the brightness and color of the sky based on the time of day and the amount of natural light available. This can be achieved through the use of advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence, ensuring that the lighting in the area is always optimized for the time of day."
