While some might argue it could lead to longer lifespans due to reduced stress on the body, others might worry about the long-term psychological effects of constant wakefulness.",
    "**Changes in Social Dynamics**: Sleep plays a crucial role in social bonding and relationship-building. If humans no longer needed to sleep, the dynamics of friendships, family interactions, and romantic relationships could change significantly.

This could boost sectors like hospitality and travel, but might also lead to increased competition and market saturation in certain industries.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: With more waking hours, people might engage in more outdoor activities, potentially leading to increased awareness and activism around environmental issues. However, the demand for resources and energy could rise sharply, resulting in greater environmental strain. This would necessitate a reevaluation of sustainable practices and conservation efforts."
