    "**3D Printing Integration**: Create a hybrid printer that can seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D printing. This printer would allow users to print both documents and physical objects using a single machine, enhancing versatility for home and office use. It could also feature a user-friendly interface that guides users through the different printing processes.",
    "**Smart Printing Assistant**: Introduce an AI-powered virtual assistant integrated into the printer. This assistant could help users optimize their printing settings based on the type of document or image, suggest paper types, and even alert users when they are running low on supplies. It could also provide tips on how to save ink and paper.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Printing**: Incorporate AR technology that allows users to visualize their prints before they actually print them. Users could use their smartphones or AR glasses to see how a document will look in their physical space, helping them make decisions about layout and design before wasting paper and ink.",
    "**Modular Printer Design**: Design a modular printer that allows users to upgrade or customize components easily. Users could add features like additional paper trays, different types of print heads for specialized printing (like fabric or photo quality), or enhanced connectivity options. This would extend the printer's lifespan and adapt it to changing user needs.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Integrate voice recognition technology that allows users to control the printer through voice commands. Users could print documents, check ink levels, or even schedule print jobs without needing to use a computer or mobile device. This would enhance accessibility and convenience, especially for those with disabilities."
