    "**Self-Cleaning Filters**:    Develop a vacuum cleaner with self-cleaning filters that utilize a small, built-in ultrasonic cleaning mechanism. This technology would periodically emit ultrasonic waves to dislodge dirt and debris from the filters, which would then be sucked back into the vacuumâ€™s dustbin. This feature would maintain optimal suction power without the hassle of manually cleaning or replacing filters.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Dust Disposal System**:    Create a vacuum cleaner that incorporates a composting feature for organic waste. The vacuum could have a separate compartment for biodegradable materials, allowing users to dispose of food scraps and other organic debris directly into a compost bin. This would promote eco-friendliness and reduce landfill waste, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cleaning Assistant**:    Integrate an augmented reality interface that provides users with visual guidance on cleaning tasks. By using AR glasses or a smartphone app, users could see highlighted areas that require attention, receive tips on optimal cleaning techniques, and even access maintenance reminders. This feature would make vacuuming more interactive and educational, especially for families with children learning about cleanliness.",
    "**Multi-Function Cleaning Attachments**:    Design a vacuum cleaner with interchangeable attachments that serve multiple functions. For example, an attachment could switch from a vacuum nozzle to a carpet rake or a pet grooming tool. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices, making the vacuum cleaner a versatile tool for various cleaning tasks, from vacuuming floors to grooming pets.",
    "**Noise-Cancellation Technology**:    Implement advanced noise-cancellation technology in the vacuum cleaner to significantly reduce operational noise. By using sound-dampening materials and acoustic engineering, the vacuum could operate quietly, making it more suitable for use during early mornings or late nights without disturbing household members or neighbors."
