    "Customizable Heating Elements: Replace traditional heating elements with customizable ones that allow users to adjust the heat output based on their preferences. This would cater to different toasting needs, from light to dark, and even include options for grilling.",
    "Multi-Functionality: Expand the toaster's capabilities by adding a griddle or grill on the top for toasting bread, bagels, or even cooking small items like paninis.",
    "Reusable Tray: Include a reusable tray with compartments for holding various ingredients, such as cheese, lettuce, and tomato. This would encourage more eco-friendly packaging and keep the sandwich-making process organized.",
    "Automated Sandwich Assembly: Integrate a robotic arm or similar mechanism that can assemble sandwiches with precision, saving time and effort. This feature would be especially useful for those with limited mobility or dexterity.",
    "Smart Display: Add a digital display that shows the progress of the sandwich being toasted, along with an estimated time of completion. This would allow users to plan their meal or snack times more efficiently."
