    "Artificial Vision Aids: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision would need alternative means to see. One possible solution could be the development of artificial vision aids, such as microchip-embedded contact lenses or brain-computer interfaces. These devices could bypass the eyes altogether and directly transmit visual information to the brain, providing a new means of perception for those with impaired vision.",
    "Enhanced Sensory Training: Another approach could be to enhance the remaining senses to compensate for the loss of vision. For example, people could undergo intensive training to improve their auditory sensitivity, allowing them to better navigate their surroundings through sound alone. Similarly, they could develop their sense of touch and spatial awareness to better navigate their environment.",
    "Advanced Prosthetics: Prosthetic limbs have come a long way in recent years, and it's possible that advanced vision-restoring prosthetics could be developed in response to the loss of glasses and contact lenses. These prosthetics could be equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms to mimic the function of human eyes, providing a new means of vision for those with impaired vision.",
    "Holographic Displays: With the disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, there could be a renewed focus on alternative display technologies. Holographic displays, for example, could provide a new means of viewing information, allowing people to see 3D images and text without the need for any physical device. This technology could be particularly useful for people with impaired vision, as it would provide a new way to consume and interact with visual information.",
    "Virtual Reality Therapy: Finally, virtual reality therapy could become a new means of coping with the loss of vision. By immersing themselves in a virtual environment, people with impaired vision could practice navigating and interacting with their surroundings in a controlled and safe environment. This therapy could help them develop new skills and strategies for coping with their impaired vision, and could potentially lead to improvements in their ability to navigate and interact with their surroundings in the real world."
