    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Develop a wearable, portable solar panel backpack that can harness energy from the sun and store it in a high-capacity battery. This backpack would not only provide light but also charge electronic devices, making it an essential tool for survival. The backpack's design could incorporate a retractable LED light strip, allowing users to adjust the light output according to their needs.",
    "**Luminescent Plant Garden**: Create a sustainable and eco-friendly solution by cultivating a specialized garden of luminescent plants. These plants would absorb and store energy during the day, emitting a soft, gentle glow at night. This bioluminescent garden could be integrated into a self-sustaining ecosystem, providing a natural source of light and a calming atmosphere.",
    "**Innovative Window Films**: Design a cutting-edge window film that can harness and amplify natural light. This film would be applied to windows, allowing it to capture and redirect sunlight, increasing the amount of light entering the room. The film could also be equipped with a smart sensor that adjusts its opacity to optimize light transmission based on the time of day and external light conditions.",
    "**LED-Embedded Furniture**: Develop a line of furniture with integrated LED lights that can be powered by a rechargeable battery or a small solar panel. This furniture would not only provide light but also serve as a stylish and functional piece for the home or office. The LED lights could be designed to change colors, patterns, or brightness levels, creating a unique ambiance.",
    "**Bioluminescent Paint**: Create a revolutionary paint that incorporates bioluminescent microorganisms, allowing it to absorb and emit light. This paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, providing a soft, ethereal glow. The paint could be designed to respond to environmental stimuli, such as temperature or humidity, creating a dynamic and interactive lighting experience."
