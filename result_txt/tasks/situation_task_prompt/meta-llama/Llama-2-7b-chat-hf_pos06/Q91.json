    "Wear protective gear: If I lost my ability to feel physical sensations, I would wear protective gear such as gloves, helmets, and pads to protect myself from injury. This would provide a physical barrier between my body and any potential harm, allowing me to move around safely without feeling any pain or discomfort. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use technology to monitor and detect injuries: I would invest in technology that can monitor and detect injuries, even if I can't feel them. For example, I could wear a smart suit that has sensors to detect changes in temperature, pressure, or movement, which could indicate an injury. I could also use a wearable device that can detect changes in my vital signs, such as heart rate or blood pressure, which could indicate an injury. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Train my brain to recognize potential dangers: Since I wouldn't be able to feel physical sensations, I would train my brain to recognize potential dangers through other means. For example, I could use my sense of sight and hearing to detect potential hazards, such as loud noises or sharp objects. I could also use my sense of smell to detect gas leaks or other dangers. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Use my sense of intuition: While I wouldn't be able to feel physical sensations, I could use my sense of intuition to detect potential dangers. For example, I could trust my gut instincts to avoid certain situations or people that feel \"off\" to me. I could also use my intuition to detect changes in my environment that could indicate an injury, such as a sudden change in temperature or lighting. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Seek support from others: If I lost my ability to feel physical sensations, I would seek support from others to help protect me from injury. For example, I could ask friends and family to keep an eye on me and help me avoid potential dangers. I could also seek the help of professionals, such as physical therapists or occupational therapists, to teach me new ways to move and interact with my environment safely. Confidence score: 0.8"
