    "Manufacturing and production: Once the vaccine is proven effective and safe, it needs to be mass-produced. A problem that can arise in this phase is the rapid and efficient manufacturing of the vaccine to meet the demand, which can be challenging, especially if the vaccine requires a specialized production process or complex supply chains.",
    "Distribution and logistics: After the vaccine is produced, it needs to be distributed to healthcare professionals and eventually to the general public. The problem that can arise here is the efficient and timely distribution of the vaccine, ensuring that healthcare professionals and the public receive the vaccine without any delays, which could lead to a further spread of the disease.",
    "Price and accessibility: The cost of developing a vaccine is often high, and the price of the vaccine can be a deterrent for certain groups, leading to a disparity in access to vaccinations. A potential problem in this situation is the challenge of striking a balance between maintaining affordability and ensuring that it remains cost-effective for both manufacturers and healthcare providers to distribute the vaccine across a wide geographic area.",
    "Global cooperation and availability: Developing a new vaccine requires global cooperation among countries and organizations to ensure that the vaccinations reach everyone who requires them. A problem that can arise is the unequal distribution of vaccines or a lack of cooperation among nations, leading to unequal access to the vaccine and potentially allowing the disease to continue spreading in underprivileged countries.",
    "Communication and public perception: A crucial factor in the success of a new vaccine is public perception and willingness to be vaccinated. A potential problem here is effective communication about the safety, efficacy, and necessity of the vaccine to prevent any misinformation or fear from misleading the public, ultimately affecting the uptake and success of the vaccination campaign."
