    "**Interchangeable Brush Heads**: Develop a paintbrush with a modular design where artists can easily swap out different brush heads (e.g., flat, round, filbert) without needing multiple brushes. Each head could have a magnetic or snap-on connection, allowing for quick changes between styles and techniques, enhancing versatility and reducing clutter in the artist's toolkit.",
    "**Color Dispensing System**: Create a paintbrush that incorporates a built-in color dispensing system. This brush would have a small reservoir that holds paint, allowing artists to squeeze a trigger on the handle to release paint directly onto the bristles. This innovation would eliminate the need for a separate palette, streamline the painting process, and minimize waste.",
    "**Smart Brush Technology**: Integrate smart technology into the paintbrush that connects to an app via Bluetooth. This app could track the amount of paint used, suggest color combinations based on the artist's palette, and provide tutorials for different techniques. Additionally, it could have pressure sensors that provide feedback on stroke pressure and style, helping artists improve their skills.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a paintbrush with a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves to remove paint residue from the bristles after use. The brush would have a small compartment that, when filled with water, activates the cleaning process. This would save artists time and effort in cleaning their brushes, allowing them to focus more on their art.",
    "**Multi-Material Bristles**: Create a paintbrush that uses a combination of bristle materials, such as synthetic and natural fibers, to achieve different effects. For example, the brush could have soft natural bristles for smooth blending on one side and stiffer synthetic bristles for bold strokes on the other. This dual functionality would provide artists with more creative options without needing multiple brushes."
