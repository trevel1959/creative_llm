    "In a quaint little village, there lived a group of mice who possessed an extraordinary giftâ€”the ability to sing. Each night, as the moon cast its silver glow, they would gather under the old oak tree. Their melodies, soft and sweet, enchanted all who heard them. One evening, a weary traveler stumbled upon their concert and was so moved that he decided to stay. He spread the word, and soon, the village was alive with visitors eager to hear the mice. Their fame grew, and the once quiet village transformed into a vibrant community, all thanks to the mice who could sing.",
