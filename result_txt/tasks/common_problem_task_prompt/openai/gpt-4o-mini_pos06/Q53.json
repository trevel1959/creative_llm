    "**Pacing Issues**: A screenplay that is either too fast-paced or too slow can lose audience engagement. If scenes rush through important plot points without allowing for character development or emotional impact, viewers may feel lost. Conversely, if the screenplay drags, it can lead to boredom. The writer should create a detailed outline to balance action and exposition, ensuring that each scene contributes meaningfully to the story's progression.",
    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay evolves, it’s easy for plot holes to develop—scenarios where the story logic fails or where character actions don’t align with established rules of the story world. Regularly revisiting earlier drafts and conducting thorough reviews can help identify and resolve these inconsistencies, ensuring a cohesive narrative that maintains audience suspension of disbelief.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Writing dialogue that feels natural and authentic to the characters and their environment can be challenging. If the dialogue sounds forced or unrealistic, it can detract from the overall impact of the film. The writer should consider the characters' backgrounds, experiences, and relationships when crafting dialogue, and might even conduct readings with actors to refine it further.",
    "**Genre Expectations**: The screenplay may inadvertently stray from the conventions of its intended genre, leading to confusion among audiences. For example, if a horror film has too many comedic elements, it could undermine the intended tension. The writer should familiarize themselves with genre tropes and expectations while also being innovative enough to surprise the audience, striking a balance that feels fresh yet familiar.",
    "**Feedback and Revisions**: Gathering feedback from trusted peers or industry professionals can be daunting, especially if it conflicts with the writer's vision. Fear of criticism may lead to defensiveness or an unwillingness to make necessary changes. The writer should cultivate a mindset that welcomes constructive criticism, viewing it as an opportunity for growth, and be prepared to revise their work multiple times to enhance the screenplay's quality."
