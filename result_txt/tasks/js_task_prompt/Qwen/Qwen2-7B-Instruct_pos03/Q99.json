    "**The Time Capsule of Generations**:    This tradition would involve creating a physical or digital time capsule that is opened at the same time by future generations. The capsule would contain items that represent current culture, technology, and society. It could include things like personal letters from each participant, technological gadgets from the current year, popular music albums, fashion trends, and more. The idea is to create a unique window into the past for future generations to understand their predecessors' lives and times.",

    "**The Memory Walkathon**:    In this tradition, individuals walk a designated route while listening to songs, poems, or stories that remind them of significant moments in their life.
