    "Personal Assistant: I would use my clones to take on various tasks and responsibilities, freeing up my time for more important and creative pursuits. I could delegate tasks such as managing my schedule, responding to emails, and completing administrative tasks. This would allow me to focus on my core strengths and passions, such as generating innovative ideas and creating art.",
    "Research Assistant: With multiple clones, I could conduct extensive research in various fields simultaneously. For instance, I could have one clone work on gathering data and information for a new project, while another clone works on analyzing and interpreting the data. This would allow me to gain a deeper understanding of a subject matter and produce more comprehensive and well-researched work.",
    "Creative Collaborator: I could use my clones as collaborators in creative projects. For example, I could have one clone work on writing a novel while another clone works on illustrating it. We could then come together to brainstorm and refine the ideas, producing a cohesive and engaging work of art.",
    "Event Planner: With multiple clones, I could plan and execute large-scale events such as conferences, festivals, or exhibitions. Each clone could be responsible for a different aspect of the event, such as logistics, marketing, or entertainment. This would allow me to handle the logistics of the event with ease, while also ensuring that every detail is taken care of.",
    "Personal Shopper: I could use my clones to shop for groceries, clothes, and other necessities. This would save me time and energy, allowing me to focus on more important things. Each clone could be responsible for a different category of items, ensuring that I always have a well-stocked pantry and wardrobe."
