    "**Integrated Smart Transportation System**: A comprehensive transportation network would include autonomous electric vehicles, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly pathways. Real-time data would optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and minimize carbon emissions. Public transport would be free and accessible, encouraging people to leave their cars behind and promoting a healthier lifestyle.",
    "**Renewable Energy Microgrids**: The city would be powered by localized renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems. Each neighborhood would have its own microgrid, allowing for energy independence and resilience against outages. Residents could sell excess energy back to the grid, incentivizing sustainable practices.",
    "**Community-Centric Design**: Neighborhoods would be designed around community interaction, with mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. Plazas, parks, and communal areas would be strategically placed to encourage social gatherings, local markets, and cultural events, fostering a strong sense of belonging and collaboration among residents.",
    "**Adaptive Architecture**: Buildings would be designed to adapt to climate change and natural disasters. This could include floating structures in flood-prone areas, movable walls for temperature control, and materials that can withstand extreme weather. The architecture would be not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, incorporating local art and cultural elements.",
    "**Digital Democracy Platforms**: The city would leverage technology to engage residents in governance and decision-making. A digital platform would allow citizens to propose ideas, vote on community projects, and provide feedback on local policies. This participatory approach would enhance transparency, accountability, and civic engagement, making residents feel more connected to their government."
