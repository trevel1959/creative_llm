Imagine a hero like Batman, but instead of relying on gadgets and technology, they could simply see in the dark and track down villains with ease.",
    "Nocturnal Exploration: With the ability to see in the dark, humans could explore new depths of the ocean, the jungle, or even space. They could discover hidden caves, ancient ruins, or other mysterious places that were previously inaccessible. This would open up a whole new realm of scientific exploration and discovery.",
    "Nighttime Agriculture: Farmers could use their newfound ability to see in the dark to plant and harvest crops more efficiently.

    "Nighttime Sports: Imagine playing sports like basketball, soccer, or tennis in complete darkness. The game would be transformed, with players relying on their other senses to navigate the field of play. It would create a new level of strategy and teamwork, as players would need to communicate and coordinate their movements in the dark.",
    "Nighttime Art: Artists could create entirely new forms of art using their ability to see in the dark. They could paint, draw, or sculpt in the dark, using the shadows and darkness as a medium.
