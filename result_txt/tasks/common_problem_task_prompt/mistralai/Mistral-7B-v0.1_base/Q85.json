    "One potential issue that might come up when writing a successful fantasy novel series is deciding which tone or mood to take. For example, you might want to write it comedy and have a strong sense of humour but then it would seem out of place in the series as a whole, or perhaps you are going to focus more on the horror aspect but the humour is present throughout the novels.",
    "Another possible complication could be the need to change the way you go about writing the story. If you have been using first person perspective, it might be better for readers if you switch to third person so they can better understand everything that happens.",
    "The fourth issue may be that you are working through writer’s block. You might need to spend some time brainstorming and thinking of more ideas without worrying too much about which ones are good. It might also help to write a short story or two in order to take the focus off your main project, which might be helpful if you are feeling burnt out before writing the third or fourth book in your series.",
    "The fifth problem could involve choosing between publishing digitally and going with traditional print books. There are advantages and disadvantages to both formats, so it’s worth considering both before making a decision.",
    "The sixth issue might be the amount of time you spend on researching for each novel in the series. It can be helpful to do a lot of background research in order to ensure accuracy, but sometimes it’s important just to get started and see how things unfold as you write."
