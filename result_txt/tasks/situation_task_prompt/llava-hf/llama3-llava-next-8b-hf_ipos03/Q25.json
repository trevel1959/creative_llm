    "Skybridges: Skybridges are enclosed walkways that connect adjacent buildings, allowing occupants to cross from one building to another without the need for an elevator. In a situation where all elevators stop working, occupants can use skybridges to access other buildings with functioning elevators.",
    "Portable stairs: Portable stairs can be brought to the roof or upper floors of a building to provide an alternative means of evacuation. These stairs can be easily assembled and disassembled, making them a practical solution in emergency situations.",
    "Aerial lifts: Aerial lifts, such as helicopters or aerial platforms, can be used to transport occupants from the roof of one building to another. This method is not as common as the others but could be used in extreme situations.",
    "Emergency response teams: In the event of an elevator malfunction, emergency response teams can be deployed to the affected building to assist with evacuation. These teams may include firefighters, paramedics, and other specialized personnel."
