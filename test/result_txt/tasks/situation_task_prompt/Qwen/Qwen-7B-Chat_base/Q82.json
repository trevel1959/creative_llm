    "Body Language: Although verbal communication is essential for humans, we use non-verbal cues like facial expressions, hand gestures, and body posture to convey our emotions and thoughts. In a world without language, people could rely on these cues to communicate with each other.",
    "Written Signatures: Written signatures have been used as a form of communication for centuries. People could sign their names or draw symbols that represent themselves or their thoughts.",
    "Music: Music is a universal language that transcends language barriers. People could create new forms of music or develop ways to translate existing songs into different languages.",
    "Art: Art is another way to communicate ideas and emotions. People could create visual art, sculptures, or paintings to express themselves.",
    "Animal Communication: Some animals communicate through sounds, body language, and scent. Humans could learn from them and develop new ways to communicate without words. For example, dogs bark to communicate with humans, and bees communicate through dance. Humans could try to mimic these behaviors to communicate with each other."
