    "Create a Natural Navigation System: Utilize the body's innate sense of direction by creating a system that leverages the body's internal compass and spatial awareness. This system could involve using the position of the sun, moon, stars, and landmarks to navigate. For example, people could use the position of the sun to determine direction during the day, and the position of the stars at night.",
    "Develop a Smell-Based Navigation System: Create a system that uses scent markers to guide people. This system could involve placing scent markers at regular intervals, such as every mile or kilometer, and using a unique scent for each marker. People could use their sense of smell to identify their location based on the scent they are currently experiencing.",
    "Create a Sound-Based Navigation System: Develop a system that uses sound to guide people. This system could involve creating a series of distinct sounds that are associated with different locations or landmarks. People could use their sense of hearing to identify their location based on the sounds they are currently hearing.",
    "Utilize the Power of Plants: Create a system that uses plants to guide people. This system could involve training plants to grow in a specific pattern or arrangement that could be used to navigate. For example, people could use the direction and distance between different plant species to determine their location.",
    "Develop a Gravity-Based Navigation System: Create a system that uses the Earth's gravitational forces to guide people. This system could involve creating a series of gravitational anomalies, such as areas where the gravitational force is stronger or weaker, that could be used to navigate. People could use their sense of gravity to determine their location based on the strength of the gravitational force they are experiencing."
