    "Glow-in-the-Dark Mouse Pad: Create a mouse pad that glows in the dark, perfect for late-night gaming sessions or for those who work in dimly lit spaces. The pad could be made of a special material that absorbs light and emits a soft, ambient glow, providing a unique and eye-catching experience for users.",
    "Customizable Mouse Pad: Design a mouse pad that allows users to customize the design and layout of the pad to suit their preferences.

    "Smart Mouse Pad: Create a mouse pad that integrates with other smart devices and apps, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. The pad could have built-in sensors that detect user input and send commands to the smart devices, allowing users to control their smart home devices or access information without leaving their desk. This would provide a convenient and hands-free way to control smart devices, making it easier to work or play from the comfort of their own home."
