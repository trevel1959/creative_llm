    "**Eco-Friendly Water Bottle that Doubles as a Mini-Garden**: Design a water bottle with a built-in, self-sustaining mini-garden. The bottle's design would feature a unique, spiral-shaped planting area that allows for a small herb or succulent garden to thrive. As the user drinks from the bottle, the water would be channeled to the plant, providing it with the necessary hydration. The bottle's lid would be designed with a small, detachable planter that can be used to transplant the plant into a larger container when it outgrows the bottle. This innovative design combines sustainability with a fun, interactive element, encouraging users to stay hydrated while also nurturing a small ecosystem.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses with Built-in Micro-LED Display**: Envision contact lenses with a built-in micro-LED display that can project information, such as text messages, emails, or even augmented reality experiences, directly onto the user's field of vision. The lenses would be powered by a small, wearable device that charges wirelessly through a smartphone case or a special wristband. This technology would revolutionize the way we interact with information, allowing users to receive notifications, access virtual assistants, or even control smart home devices with a simple glance.",
    "**Modular, Interlocking Furniture for a Sustainable Home**: Design a line of modular, interlocking furniture pieces that can be easily assembled and rearranged to create a wide range of configurations. Each piece would be made from sustainably sourced materials and would be designed to be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of its life cycle. The furniture would be designed to be highly adaptable, allowing users to easily change the layout of their space to suit their needs. This modular approach would reduce waste, promote creativity, and make it easier for people to create a home that reflects their personal style.",
    "**Personalized, 3D-Printed Prosthetic Limbs with Integrated AI**: Develop a system that uses 3D printing and AI to create customized, prosthetic limbs that are tailored to each individual's specific needs. The AI would analyze the user's movements, muscle structure, and other factors to create a prosthetic that is optimized for their unique abilities. The prosthetic would be designed to be highly adaptable, allowing users to easily adjust the settings to suit their changing needs. This technology would revolutionize the field of prosthetics, providing users with greater mobility, independence, and confidence.",
