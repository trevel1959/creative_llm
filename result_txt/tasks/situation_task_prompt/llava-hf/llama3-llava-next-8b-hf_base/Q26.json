    "Ask for directions: In the absence of maps and navigation systems, you could ask locals or fellow travelers for directions. People are generally willing to help others, and asking for directions can lead to valuable information about the area, including hidden gems or shortcuts.",
    "Use a compass: A compass is a simple navigation tool that uses the Earth's magnetic field to indicate the direction of the magnetic north. By aligning the compass with the Earth, you can determine your direction and use it to navigate.",
    "Use a map from memory: If you have a mental map of an area, you can use it to navigate. This can be particularly useful if you've spent time in the area before or have a good sense of spatial awareness.",
    "Use a smartphone app: While smartphones have GPS capabilities, many apps also have maps and navigation features that can be used without an internet connection. Some apps, like Google Maps, can be used offline, allowing you to download maps and access directions even when you don't have a connection.",
    "Use a paper map: While paper maps are less common in today's digital age, they are still available and can be used to navigate. You can find paper maps at many bookstores or online."
