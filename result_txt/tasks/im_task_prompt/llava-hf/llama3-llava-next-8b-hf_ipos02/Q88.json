    "**Ergonomic Handles**: Develop ergonomic handles that fit the natural curve of the hand, reducing fatigue and discomfort during long skiing sessions.",
    "**Lightweight Materials**: Use lightweight materials like carbon fiber or 3D-printed composites to reduce the overall weight of the ski poles, making them easier to carry and maneuver.",
    "**Integrated Navigation System**: Integrate a GPS or Bluetooth device into the poles that provides real-time navigation, route tracking, and communication with a companion or emergency services.",
    "**Safety Features**: Incorporate reflective materials or LED lights into the poles for increased visibility in low-light conditions or during nighttime skiing.",
    "**Variable Lengths**: Develop poles with variable lengths, allowing skiers to adjust the reach based on their height and skiing style. This would enhance comfort and control during turns."
