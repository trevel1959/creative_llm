    "**Mind-Controlled Computer Mouse**: Develop a device that uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to control a computer mouse. This would allow users to navigate their computer screens with their minds, eliminating the need for physical hand movements. The device would consist of a non-invasive BCI headset that detects brain activity, which is then translated into mouse movements and clicks.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Computer Mouse**: Create a computer mouse that can change its shape and size to adapt to different user preferences and environments. This could be achieved through a combination of advanced materials and robotics, allowing the mouse to morph into various forms, such as a compact travel mouse or a large ergonomic mouse.",
    "**Holographic Computer Mouse**: Design a computer mouse that projects a holographic interface, allowing users to interact with virtual objects and environments. This would enable users to navigate complex virtual spaces with ease, and could be particularly useful for applications such as virtual reality gaming, architectural design, and scientific visualization.",
    "**Biometric Computer Mouse**: Develop a computer mouse that incorporates biometric sensors to track user health and wellness metrics, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle activity. This would provide users with valuable insights into their physical and mental state, allowing them to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.",
    "**Self-Healing Computer Mouse**: Create a computer mouse that can repair itself automatically in the event of damage or wear and tear. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials and nanotechnology, allowing the mouse to detect and repair damaged components, such as the optical sensor or the scroll wheel. This would reduce electronic waste and extend the lifespan of the mouse. [/INST] "
