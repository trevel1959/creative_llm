    "**Wildlife Conflicts**: As human activity encroaches on natural habitats, conflicts between wildlife and visitors can escalate. This may include wildlife becoming habituated to human food, leading to dangerous encounters or aggressive behavior. Implementing educational programs about wildlife safety and providing secure food storage options can help mitigate these issues.",
    "**Resource Management**: National parks require careful management of natural resources, including water, vegetation, and wildlife populations. Overuse of resources, such as overfishing in lakes or excessive logging, can threaten the park's ecosystem. Developing sustainable practices, monitoring resource levels, and engaging in conservation efforts can help preserve these vital resources.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: National parks are often vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels. These changes can disrupt ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Parks can implement climate resilience strategies, such as habitat restoration projects, conservation of biodiversity, and public awareness campaigns about climate impacts.",
    "**Infrastructure Maintenance**: The park's infrastructure, including trails, restrooms, and visitor centers, requires regular maintenance to ensure safety and accessibility. Budget constraints can lead to deteriorating facilities, which can negatively impact visitor experience and safety. Prioritizing maintenance projects and seeking grants or partnerships for funding can help address these challenges.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Preservation**: Many national parks contain sites of cultural and historical significance to Indigenous peoples and other communities. Balancing visitor access with the preservation of these sites can be complex. Collaborating with local Indigenous groups to create respectful guidelines for site visitation and interpretation can help honor cultural heritage while educating visitors."
