    "Virtual Fitness Classes: We can arrange for virtual fitness classes to be conducted in the office during lunch breaks or after work hours. These classes can be led by certified fitness trainers and can include activities such as yoga, pilates, or HIIT workouts. This will provide employees with a convenient and accessible way to incorporate physical activity into their daily routine.",
    "Desk Exercises: We can provide employees with a list of desk exercises that they can do while sitting at their desks. These exercises can include stretches, leg raises, arm curls, and more. This will help employees to stay active even while they are sitting for long periods of time.",
    "Standing Workstations: We can provide employees with standing workstations, which will encourage them to stand and move around more. This will not only help them to stay active but also improve their posture and reduce the risk of developing health problems associated with sitting for long periods of time.",
    "Step Challenges: We can organize a step challenge, where employees can compete to see who can take the most steps in a week. This will encourage employees to move around more and will create a sense of friendly competition.",
