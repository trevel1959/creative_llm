    "**Odor Neutralizing Technology**: To tackle the unpleasant smells often associated with trash cans, a new design could incorporate an integrated odor-neutralizing system. This could involve a combination of activated charcoal filters and a small fan that circulates air, keeping the interior fresh. Additionally, users could insert natural scent pods (like lavender or citrus) that release pleasant aromas while neutralizing odors, making it more inviting for household use.",
    "**Compact and Collapsible Design**: For urban dwellers with limited space, a collapsible trash can that can be easily stored when not in use would be ideal. This trash can could be made from durable, lightweight materials and feature a foldable design that locks into place when expanded. It could also include a detachable liner for easy cleaning and a built-in handle for portability, making it perfect for picnics or outdoor activities.",
    "**Color-Coded Waste Management System**: To encourage proper waste separation, a trash can could be designed with multiple compartments, each color-coded for different types of waste (e.g., blue for recyclables, green for compost, and black for landfill). Each compartment could have its own lid and a clear labeling system, making it easy for users to dispose of their waste correctly. This design could also include a visual guide printed on the can to help educate users about what can go in each compartment.",
    "**Solar-Powered Compaction Feature**: A trash can that utilizes solar energy to compact waste would be a game-changer for both households and public spaces. This smart trash can would have a built-in solar panel that powers a compaction mechanism, reducing the volume of waste by up to 80%. This would mean fewer trips to empty the can and a more efficient use of space, particularly in busy areas like parks and festivals.",
    "**Interactive Feedback Display**: Imagine a trash can with a small touchscreen display that provides real-time feedback to users. It could track the amount of waste generated, offer tips on reducing waste, and even gamify the recycling process by allowing users to earn points for proper disposal. These points could be redeemed for discounts at local eco-friendly businesses, encouraging community participation in waste reduction efforts."
