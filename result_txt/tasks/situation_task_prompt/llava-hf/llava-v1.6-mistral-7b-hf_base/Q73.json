    "Shade Structures: Install more awnings, canopies, and overhangs in parks, plazas, and other public spaces to provide much-needed shade on hot days. These structures can also be used as creative spots for outdoor dining and performances.",
    "Shade Buses: Repurpose old buses into mobile shade vehicles, equipped with large umbrellas or expandable canopies that can be driven or parked in areas with a high demand for shade. These buses can be stationed at popular locations or move around to provide shade where it's needed most.",
    "Shade Gardens: Design and install specially-designed gardens that incorporate tall plants and foliage to create pockets of shade in urban areas. These gardens can be interspersed throughout city streets, providing residents with quick access to cooler, more shaded areas.",
    "Shade Art: Encourage artists to create shade art installations that incorporate a combination of sculpture and shade-providing materials, like canvas canopies or reflective mirrors. These installations can be placed in parks or other public spaces, turning the lack of trees into a creative opportunity.",
    "Solar-Shaded Buildings: Promote the development of green roofs and solar-powered cooling systems in buildings, which can help reduce the heat island effect in urban areas and provide a cooler environment for residents and visitors."
