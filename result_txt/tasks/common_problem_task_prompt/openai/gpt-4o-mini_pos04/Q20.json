    "**Cybersecurity Threats**: With self-driving cars being connected to the internet, they become potential targets for hackers. A cyberattack could result in unauthorized control of the vehicle, leading to theft, accidents, or even using the car as a weapon. This raises concerns about the security of personal data and the safety of passengers.",
    "**Legal Liability**: In the event of an accident involving a self-driving car, determining liability can be complex. Questions arise regarding whether the manufacturer, software developer, or the owner of the vehicle is responsible for damages. This ambiguity can lead to legal disputes and challenges in the insurance industry.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make split-second decisions that could harm either the passengers or pedestrians. For instance, if an accident is unavoidable, how should the car prioritize lives? These ethical dilemmas raise questions about programming morality into machines and the implications of such decisions.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: Despite advancements in technology, many people may still be skeptical about the safety and reliability of self-driving cars. Concerns about losing control over their driving experience, fear of technology failure, and potential accidents could hinder widespread adoption. Building public trust is crucial for the success of self-driving vehicles.",
    "**Infrastructure Challenges**: Self-driving cars may require specific infrastructure, such as smart traffic signals, dedicated lanes, or updated road signs, to operate effectively. In areas where such infrastructure is lacking, self-driving cars might struggle to navigate safely, leading to increased accidents or inefficiencies in traffic flow."
