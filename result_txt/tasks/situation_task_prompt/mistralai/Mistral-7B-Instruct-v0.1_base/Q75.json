    "Solar-powered vehicles: In a to where all the world's oil disappears, the sun would become the source of energy to power vehicles. This would require vehicles to be designed to harness solar energy, either through the use of solar panels on the roof of the vehicle or by integrating solar cells into the vehicle's body. The energy stored in the vehicle's battery could be used to power the electric motor, allowing the vehicle to move.",
    "Electric-powered vehicles: Another alternative to oil-powered vehicles would be electric-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be powered by rechargeable batteries, which could be charged using renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power. The batteries would store energy, which could be used to power the electric motor, allowing the vehicle to move.",
    "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could also be an alternative to oil-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen. The electricity generated could be used to power the electric motor, allowing the vehicle to move.",
    "Battery-powered vehicles: Battery-powered vehicles could also be an alternative to oil-powered vehicles. These vehicles would be powered by rechargeable batteries, which could be charged using renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power. The batteries would store energy, which could be used to power the electric motor, allowing the vehicle to move.",
    "Human-powered vehicles: In a world where oil has disappeared, human-powered vehicles could become a viable alternative. These vehicles would be powered by the energy of the human body, either through the use of pedals or by using a hand-cranked mechanism. The energy generated by the human body could be used to power the vehicle, allowing it to move."
