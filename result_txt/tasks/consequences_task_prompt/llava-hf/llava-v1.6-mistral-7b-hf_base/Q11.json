    "Atmospheric Effects: The presence of a second moon would likely cause atmospheric phenomena such as increased auroras, caused by increased solar wind interaction. Also, the second moon might cause tidal locking in certain parts of the Earth, leading to unpredictable climate changes and weather patterns.",
    "Effects on Satellites: The second moon could interfere with the functions of Earth's artificial satellites, such as communication and weather satellites, by obstructing or redirecting their signals or causing issues with their orbits.",
    "Light and Darkness: The second moon might have significant effects on the Earth's light cycle, causing days and nights to be longer or shorter as it affects the planet's axial tilt and the angle of incidence of sunlight.",
    "Magnetic Interference: The second moon could cause increased interference with Earth's magnetic field, disrupting power lines and other electrical systems.",
    "Rise of Ocean Levels: The additional gravitational force of a second moon might cause a slow but steady rise in ocean levels due to the gravitational effect of the extra mass on tides."
