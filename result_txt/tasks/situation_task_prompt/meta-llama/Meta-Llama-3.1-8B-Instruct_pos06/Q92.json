    "**Treehouses**: With the absence of beds, people would turn to nature for shelter. Treehouses, often used for recreational purposes, would become the primary sleeping solution. We could design and build more sustainable, eco-friendly treehouses that incorporate natural materials and minimal environmental impact. Imagine waking up to the sounds of birds chirping and the warmth of sunlight filtering through the leaves. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Inflatable Island Beds**: Inspired by inflatable rafts, we could develop inflatable island beds that provide a comfortable sleeping surface. These beds would be lightweight, easy to transport, and could be set up on any flat surface. They would be perfect for temporary or emergency situations, and could even be used for outdoor events or festivals. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Sleeping Pods in Public Spaces**: In the absence of beds, public spaces like parks, plazas, and streets would be transformed into sleeping areas. We could design sleeping pods that are easy to assemble and disassemble, providing a safe and comfortable place for people to rest. These pods could be equipped with basic amenities like lighting, temperature control, and even charging stations. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Underwater Sleeping Chambers**: Why not take sleeping to new depths? With the disappearance of beds, we could develop underwater sleeping chambers that allow people to rest while surrounded by marine life. These chambers would be designed to mimic the natural environment, providing a unique and immersive experience. (Confidence score: 0.92)",
    "**Sleeping Tents with Integrated Life Support Systems**: In a world without beds, people would need to adapt to new forms of shelter. Sleeping tents with integrated life support systems would provide a safe and self-sustaining environment. These tents would be equipped with air recycling, water purification, and even food production systems, making them a viable option for long-term sleeping arrangements. (Confidence score: 0.95)"
