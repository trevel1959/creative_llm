    "Build a solar-powered shelter: With access to sunlight, it's possible to build a shelter that uses solar panels to generate electricity for basic needs such as lighting and communication devices. This could be done by using materials found in nature, such as wood and leaves, to create a sturdy structure that can withstand extreme weather conditions.",
    "Create a rainwater harvesting system: Rainwater is a valuable resource when there is no access to electricity or running water. By building a simple system that captures rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces, it's possible to store and use this water for drinking, washing, and cooking.",
