    "I would erase the concept oflesslessness. This is a term that I made up that refers to the feeling of being stuck or unable to move forward in life. I created it because I believe that it is a common experience for many people, and I think it would be helpful to have aless word to describe it.",
    "I would erase the concept of perfectionism. While striving for excellence is a good thing, the constant pursuit of perfection can be stressful and unhealthy. I think it would be better for people to focus on doing their best and being kind to themselves when they don't meet their own high standards.",
    "I would erase the concept of shame. Shame is a negative emotion that can hold people back and prevent them from reaching their full potential. I think it would be better for people to focus on learning from their mistakes and moving forward, rather than dwelling on past failures.",
    "I would erase the concept of fear. Fear is a natural emotion, but it can also be paralyzing. I think it would be better for people to face their fears and take action, rather than letting them hold them back.",
    "I would erase the concept of procrastination. Procrastination can be a major hindrance to productivity and success. I think it would be better for people to develop the habit of taking action and getting things done, rather than constantly putting things off until the last minute."
