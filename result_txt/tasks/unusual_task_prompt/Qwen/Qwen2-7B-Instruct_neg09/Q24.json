    "**Personalized Toothbrush Design**: Create a unique toothbrush design where each toothbrush has a personalized message or design engraved on it. This can be customized based on the user's interests, such as a favorite animal, hobby, or quote. The toothbrush handle could also be designed to fit comfortably in the hand, offering an ergonomic grip. ",
    "**Smart Toothbrush with Health Monitoring**: Develop a smart toothbrush that tracks brushing habits and oral health data. It could provide real-time feedback on brushing duration, pressure applied, and missed areas. The device might sync this information with a smartphone app for more detailed analysis and personalized recommendations. Users could receive notifications about potential dental issues, helping them maintain good oral hygiene.",
    "**Teeth Whitening Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a built-in teeth whitening system. Perhaps the bristles are infused with gentle whitening agents, or thereâ€™s a small tray attached to the brush head that dispenses a gel or paste for teeth whitening during brushing. This innovation would save time and effort compared to traditional teeth whitening methods like strips or gels.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Oral Care App**: Integrate a toothbrush with a touch screen display that shows animated instructions on how to brush effectively, covering all parts of the mouth. The toothbrush could have built-in sensors to track brushing patterns and provide feedback on technique. Users could also access dental care tips, news, and other information related to oral health directly from the toothbrush.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Rechargeable Handle**: Develop a toothbrush made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. Its rechargeable handle could extend battery life significantly, reducing the need for frequent replacements and contributing to environmental sustainability. The toothbrush might also come with a wireless charging dock, making it easy to charge and store at home or while traveling."
