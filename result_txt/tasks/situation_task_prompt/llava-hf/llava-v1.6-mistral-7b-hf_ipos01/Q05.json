    "**Underground Lighting**: An underground light system could be installed, using electricity from a power grid or a battery backup system. This would involve digging trenches and laying down wires or cables to connect the light fixtures to the power source.",
    "**Hydroelectric Power**: Hydroelectric power could be harnessed from nearby rivers or waterfalls to generate electricity, which could then be used to power lights. This would require building a hydroelectric power plant and installing turbines to convert the energy of the water into electricity.",
    "**Nuclear Power**: A nuclear power plant could be built to generate electricity, which could then be used to power lights. This would require mining uranium, constructing a nuclear reactor, and installing turbines to convert the heat produced by the reactor into electricity.",
    "**Geothermal Power**: Geothermal power could be harnessed from the earth's core to generate electricity, which could then be used to power lights. This would require drilling deep into the earth to access the heat and installing turbines to convert the heat into electricity.",
    "**Bio-luminescent Plants**: In a more futuristic scenario, bio-luminescent plants could be genetically modified or cultivated to produce light naturally. These plants could be grown in large quantities and used to light up streets and buildings."
