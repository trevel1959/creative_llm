    "Sun-Harvesting Drones: Develop autonomous drones that can fly in cloudy skies and collect sunlight using specialized solar panels. These drones could be deployed in areas with persistent cloud cover, such as coastal regions or mountainous areas, to provide a steady supply of sunlight. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Design skyscrapers or towers with transparent, UV-transparent glass panels that allow sunlight to pass through, even in cloudy conditions. These towers could be built in urban areas where sunlight is scarce, providing a natural and sustainable source of lighting. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Fog-Harvesting Nets: Develop a specialized netting material that can absorb and store fog moisture, which could then be converted into liquid water for use in various applications, including irrigation and drinking water. This technology could be particularly useful in coastal areas with high fog levels. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Solar-Powered Clouds: Develop a new type of cloud that can store and release solar energy, similar to a battery. These clouds could be engineered to release the stored energy in the form of light or heat, providing a sustainable and renewable source of energy even in cloudy conditions. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Mirror-Based Reflection: Create a network of mirrors that can reflect sunlight from nearby clear areas into cloudy regions. This technology could be used to illuminate buildings, streets, or other areas where sunlight is scarce, providing a reliable and sustainable source of lighting. Confidence Score: 0.8"
