    "Glow-in-the-Dark Shade: Create a lampshade that emits a soft, ethereal glow when illuminated. This can be achieved through the use of special phosphorescent materials or by incorporating tiny LED lights into the shade's design. The glow-in-the-dark feature adds a whimsical touch to the lamp and can create a mesmerizing effect when the light is turned off.",
    "Shape-Shifting Shade: Design a lampshade that changes shape in response to changes in light levels. For example, when the room is dark, the shade could expand to cover more of the lamp, and when the room is bright, it could contract to reveal more of the lamp's base. This would create a dynamic and ever-changing visual effect, adding an element of surprise to the lamp's appearance.",
    "Multi-Functional Shade: Create a lampshade that serves multiple purposes. For example, the shade could have a built-in fan that blows air upwards to cool the lamp, or it could have a built-in USB port for charging electronic devices. This would make the lamp more practical and functional, while also adding a touch of innovation to its design.",
    "Interactive Shade: Design a lampshade that responds to sound. For example, when music is played, the shade could pulse or change color in time with the beat. This would create a unique and immersive experience for the user, blending light and sound in a way that enhances the overall ambiance of the room.",
    "Scented Shade: Create a lampshade that releases a fragrance when the light is turned on. This could be achieved through the use of small, hidden containers filled with scented oil or through the use of special materials that release a fragrance when heated. The scented shade would add a sensory element to the lamp, making it more inviting and relaxing to use."
