    "**Gravitational Singularity** : In this universe, gravity is not a force, but a property of matter itself. Every object has a gravitational \"signature\" that influences the behavior of nearby objects. The signature is determined by the object's mass, density, and composition. This means that objects with similar signatures would attract each other, while those with vastly different signatures would repel. The gravitational singularity would be a point where the signature of an object is zero, creating a \"gravitational well\" that warps space-time.",
    "**Fractal Time** : Time is not linear, but a fractal, self-similar pattern that repeats at different scales. Each iteration of the fractal represents a different era or epoch, with the same events repeating themselves in a cyclical manner. The fractal structure of time would create a \"temporal resonance\" where events from different eras would influence each other, creating a complex web of cause and effect.",
    "**Quantum Flux** : The universe is a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of quantum probabilities. Every event, no matter how small, creates a ripple in the quantum flux, influencing the behavior of particles and objects across the universe. This would create a \"quantum echo\" where events from the past continue to shape the present and future.",
    "**Nexus Points** : The universe is filled with nexus points, locations where multiple dimensions or realities intersect. These points would create \" portals\" to other realities, allowing for travel and communication between different planes of existence. The nexus points would be unstable, causing distortions in space-time that could be harnessed for energy or exploited for travel.",
    "**Echo Memories** : Memories are not just stored in the brain, but are imprinted on the fabric of space-time itself. When an event occurs, it creates an \"echo memory\" that resonates across the universe, influencing the behavior of objects and creatures. This would create a collective unconscious, where the memories of all beings are intertwined, shaping the course of history.
