    "**Wind-Powered Portable Charger**: Design a portable charger that harnesses wind energy through a small, compact turbine. The charger would be equipped with solar panels for charging during daylight hours and a small rechargeable battery as a backup. It could be used for charging smartphones, laptops, or other small electronic devices when traditional batteries are unavailable.",
    "**Bicycle-Powered Generator**: Create a generator that attaches to the bicycle's rear wheel. As you pedal, the generator produces electricity which can be stored in a battery pack. This battery can then be used to charge electronic devices like smartphones or GPS devices. It's an eco-friendly way of generating power while exercising.",
    "**Human-Operated Hand-Cranked Generator**: Develop a hand-cranked generator that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Users can manually turn the crank to charge their devices. This concept is similar to the old-fashioned battery-powered radio but adds the functionality of charging modern gadgets. It can also serve as an emergency power source in remote areas without access to electricity.",
    "**Biodegradable Battery Technology**: Research and develop a new type of battery made from biodegradable materials such as cellulose or algae. These batteries could be embedded into clothing or accessories (like a watch) and would decompose naturally over time, reducing environmental waste. Additionally, the energy source could come from kinetic energy generated by body movement or ambient heat.",
    "**Water-Powered Microturbine System**: Design a system that uses water currents to power microturbines, which in turn generate electricity. This system could be installed in rivers or streams near areas where devices need to be charged. The electricity generated can be stored in batteries or directly used to charge devices. Itâ€™s particularly useful for coastal regions and communities near water bodies."
