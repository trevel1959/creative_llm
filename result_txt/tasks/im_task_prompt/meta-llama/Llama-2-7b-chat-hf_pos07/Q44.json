    "Smart Dumbbells: Create a set of dumbbells that can connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their workouts, monitor their progress, and receive personalized recommendations for improvement. The dumbbells could have sensors to measure weight, reps, and time, and the app could provide feedback on proper form and technique.",
    "Grip Dumbbells: Design a set of dumbbells with interchangeable grips, allowing users to customize their workout routine based on their specific goals.
