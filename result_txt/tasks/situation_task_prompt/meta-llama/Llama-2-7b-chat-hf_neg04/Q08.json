    "Floating Water Filtration Islands: Create man-made islands that float on the water, equipped with advanced filtration systems that can remove pollutants and contaminants from the water. These islands could be placed strategically in areas with high levels of water pollution, providing clean drinking water to nearby communities.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Harvesting: Develop a network of solar-powered water harvesting systems that can collect and store rainwater, snowmelt, and groundwater. These systems could be placed in areas with high levels of rainfall, providing a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Water-Absorbing Buildings: Design buildings that have integrated water-absorbing materials into their structures. These materials could absorb pollutants from the air and water, providing clean drinking water for the building's occupants. This could be especially useful in urban areas with high levels of air pollution.",
    "Vertical Agriculture: Implement vertical agriculture systems that can grow crops in tall, narrow towers. These systems could use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow crops without the need for soil, reducing the risk of water pollution. The crops could be used to provide fresh produce for local communities, while the water used for irrigation could be treated and reused.",
    "Water-Based Energy Storage: Develop a system that uses water as a medium for storing energy generated from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power. This could involve building large reservoirs that can store energy in the form of compressed air or gravitational potential energy, which could then be released as clean drinking water when needed. This system could provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, while also storing excess energy generated from renewable sources."
