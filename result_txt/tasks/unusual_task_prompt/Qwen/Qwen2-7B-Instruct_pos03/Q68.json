    "**Scented Soap Dispenser**: Design a soap dispenser that not only dispenses soap but also incorporates a scent diffuser. This can be achieved by integrating an ultrasonic diffuser into the base of the dispenser. As you pump the soap out, a small amount of essential oil is dispersed into the air, adding a pleasant fragrance to the bathroom or kitchen.",
    "**Automatic Refill System**: Create a soap dispenser that automatically refills itself when it senses that the soap level is getting low. This can be done using a smart sensor and an attached refill mechanism. The dispenser could connect to your Wi-Fi network and alert you when it's time to replace the soap bottle, ensuring constant availability.",
    "**Customizable Dispenser**: Offer a soap dispenser that allows users to choose between different types of soap (e.g., antibacterial, moisturizing, etc.). Users can select their preferred soap through a digital interface on the dispenser or via an app on their smartphone. This way, the dispenser adjusts its output based on the selected soap type.",
    "**Hygiene Reminder**: Design a soap dispenser that reminds users to wash their hands for the recommended duration. This can be achieved through an in-built timer. The dispenser could have a screen that shows the current time spent washing hands and a countdown timer for the recommended 20 seconds. This feature promotes better hygiene practices.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Refills**: Develop a soap dispenser that uses refillable cartridges instead of single-use bottles. These cartridges can be made from biodegradable materials and filled with concentrated soap that needs less water to dilute. The dispenser would have a built-in system to detect when a cartridge is empty and guide the user to the correct refill option. This reduces waste and encourages more sustainable habits."
