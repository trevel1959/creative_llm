    "'s Solar-Powered Solution: is a company that has developed a new type of solar-powered battery that can charge devices without the need for wires or cables. This battery is small enough to fit in a smartphone, and it uses a unique solar panel to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This would be an excellent solution for powering devices if all batteries stopped working.",
    "Kinetic Energy Converter: Another solution would be to's kinetic energy converter. This device uses the motion of the user to generate electricity. For example, the user could wear a kinetic energy converter on their wrist, which would generate electricity as they move their arm. This would be a great way to power devices on the go.",
    "Human-Powered Generator: Another option would be to's human-powered generator. This device uses the user's body heat to generate electricity. The user would would wear a special suit that captures their body heat and uses it to charge a small battery. This would be an excellent solution for powering devices when all other options are unavailable.",
    "Wind-Powered Charger: If all batteries stopped working, another solution would be to's wind-powered charger. This device uses the power of the wind to charge a small battery. The user would would use a small wind turbine to capture the wind's energy and use it to charge their device. This would be a great solution for powering devices in remote locations.",
    "Solar-Powered Backpack: If all batteries stopped working, another solution would be to's solar-powered backpack. This backpack is equipped with solar panels that capture the sun's energy and use it to charge the user's devices. The user would could wear the backpack and use it to charge their devices on the go. This would be an excellent solution for powering devices when all other options are unavailable."
