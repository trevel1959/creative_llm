    "Build a bridge: Another option would be to build a bridge or tunnel across the body of water. This would allow for land-based transportation to travel across the water without the need for boats or ships. It would also have the advantage of being more stable and less affected by weather conditions.",
    "Use a hovercraft: A hovercraft is a type of vehicle that can travel on both land and water. In the absence of ships and boats, a hovercraft could be used to travel across large bodies of water. It would be able to take off and land on water, making it a versatile mode of transportation.",
    "Use a submarine: A submarine is a type of underwater vehicle that can travel below the water's surface. In the absence of ships and boats, a submarine could be used to travel across large bodies of water. It would be able to move quickly and quietly, making it an effective mode of transportation.",
    "Use a magnetic levitation train: A magnetic levitation train is a type of train that uses magnetic forces to levitate above the tracks. In the absence of ships and boats, a magnetic levitation train could be built to travel across bodies of water. It would be faster and more efficient than traditional trains and could potentially be used for both land and water transportation.",
    "Use a floating island: A floating island is a type of artificial island that is built on top of a large body of water. In the absence of ships and boats, a floating island could be built and used as a mode of transportation. It would be a stable and self-sufficient mode of transportation, providing a place to live, work, and travel."
