    "Attend live concerts: I would focus on attending live concerts as much as possible. I would try to attend as many concerts as I could, and I would make sure to take notes and record my own versions of the songs I hear there. This way, I could still enjoy music and keep it alive.",

    "Collaborate with other musicians: I would reach out to other musicians and try to collaborate with them. We could create new music together and perform it live. This way, I could still enjoy music and create something new.",
