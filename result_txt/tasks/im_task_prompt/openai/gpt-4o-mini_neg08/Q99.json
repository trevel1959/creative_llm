    "**Ergonomic Design**: Redesign the tape dispenser with an ergonomic handle and base that allows for easy one-handed operation. The base could have a non-slip grip and a weight distribution that makes it stable on various surfaces, ensuring that it doesn't tip over while in use.",
    "**Multi-Tape Functionality**: Create a tape dispenser that can hold multiple rolls of different types of tape (e.g., masking tape, washi tape, duct tape) at once. Users could switch between tapes easily with a lever or button, allowing for versatile use without the need for multiple dispensers.",
    "**Integrated Cutting Tool**: Incorporate a built-in cutting tool that can cut through different materials, such as paper, fabric, or plastic, alongside the tape. This tool could have adjustable settings for different thicknesses and materials, making it a multifunctional crafting companion.",
    "**Magnetic Base**: Design a tape dispenser with a magnetic base that can stick to metal surfaces, such as a filing cabinet or a workbench. This would provide easy access to tape while keeping the workspace organized and free of clutter.",
    "**Decorative Customization**: Offer customizable skins or covers for the tape dispenser, allowing users to personalize their dispensers with colors, patterns, or even their names. This could be achieved through removable vinyl wraps or 3D-printed designs that snap onto the dispenser."
