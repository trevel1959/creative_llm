    "**The Great Heirloom Problem**: With immortality, people would live for centuries, accumulating wealth, knowledge, and power. However, this would lead to a complex web of inheritance, as individuals would need to manage their vast possessions, relationships, and legacies. The concept of inheritance would become a massive, intricate puzzle, with multiple stakeholders and conflicting interests. Governments and institutions would need to adapt to handle the unprecedented scale of wealth transfer, property disputes, and social mobility.",
    "**The Immortal Knowledge Paradox**: As people live indefinitely, they would accumulate vast amounts of knowledge and experience. However, this would create a paradox: the more they know, the more they would realize how little they understand. The sheer volume of information would become overwhelming, making it difficult for individuals to prioritize, retain, and apply their knowledge effectively. This could lead to a phenomenon where immortals become increasingly disconnected from the present, struggling to adapt to the rapidly changing world.",
    "**The Timeless Artistic Conundrum**: Immortals would have the luxury of time to hone their creative skills, leading to unprecedented artistic and cultural advancements. However, this would also create a challenge: how would immortals cope with the pressure of producing innovative work, constantly pushing the boundaries of art and innovation, while also dealing with the weight of their own legacy? The pressure to create something truly groundbreaking would become unsustainable, potentially stifling creativity and leading to a culture of stagnation.",
    "**The Eternally Changing Self**: Immortals would experience centuries of personal growth, relationships, and identity shifts. As they adapt to new circumstances and environments, their sense of self would evolve, making it difficult to maintain a consistent identity. This would lead to a fascinating, yet challenging, phenomenon: the eternal quest for self-discovery. Immortals would need to continually redefine themselves, navigating the complexities of their ever-changing psyche and the expectations of those around them.",
    "**The Forever Young Dilemma**: Immortals would face the eternal conundrum of staying young and vibrant while their bodies continued to age. They would need to navigate the delicate balance between maintaining their physical appearance and preserving their mental and emotional well-being. This would lead to a culture of intense focus on physical fitness, wellness, and self-care, as immortals strive to maintain their youthful essence amidst the inevitable ravages of time."
