    "**Saltwater Intrusion**: As the oceans turn into freshwater, saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources like rivers and aquifers could be reduced. This would lead to an increase in freshwater availability for drinking and irrigation in areas where saltwater intrusion is a current issue.",
    "**New Coastal Ecosystems**: The change in water salinity could lead to the creation of new coastal ecosystems, supporting a variety of flora and fauna. This could lead to a significant increase in biodiversity and potentially new opportunities for research and conservation efforts.",
    "**Impact on Ocean Life**: The change in water salinity could have a profound impact on marine life. Many species are adapted to specific salt levels, and a sudden change could lead to mass die-offs and disrupt the marine food chain.",
    "**Increased Energy Production**: If the oceans turned into freshwater, hydroelectric power plants could potentially be built in coastal areas, increasing the world's renewable energy production. This could lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a shift towards more sustainable energy sources.",
    "**Impact on Climate**: The change in ocean water salinity could impact global climate patterns. Freshwater has a lower heat capacity than saltwater, which could lead to changes in ocean currents and potentially affect global climate patterns."
