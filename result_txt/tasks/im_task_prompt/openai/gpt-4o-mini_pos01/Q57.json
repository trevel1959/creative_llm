    "**Integrated Touchpad**: Combine a traditional mouse with a touchpad on its surface, allowing users to switch between precise clicking and fluid gestures without needing to move their hand away. This could enhance multitasking capabilities, especially for graphic designers or gamers who require quick access to shortcuts.",
    "**Smart Gesture Recognition**: Incorporate advanced gesture recognition technology that allows users to control their computer with hand movements above the mouse. This would enable users to perform tasks like scrolling, zooming, or switching applications without physically touching the mouse, promoting a more hygienic workspace.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity**: Create a mouse that can seamlessly switch between multiple devices (like a laptop, tablet, and smartphone) with a simple button press or gesture. This would eliminate the need for multiple mice and provide a smoother experience for users who frequently transition between devices.",
    "**Customizable Button Layout**: Introduce a mouse with programmable buttons that can be rearranged or customized based on user preference. Users could physically slide buttons to different locations or use a mobile app to set their functions, catering to gamers, designers, and office workers alike.",
    "**Sustainable Materials and Energy Source**: Develop a mouse made entirely from biodegradable materials, with a built-in solar panel that charges the battery during use. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce electronic waste, making the mouse a sustainable choice."
