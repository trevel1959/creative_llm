    "Lawn Mower with Artificial Intelligence: Create a lawn mower with AI capabilities that can adjust its cutting path and speed based on the terrain and grass type. This will result in a more efficient and customized cutting experience. The AI system can also detect and avoid obstacles, such as trees and rocks, to prevent damage to the mower or injury to the user.",
    "Solar-Powered Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower that runs solely on solar power, eliminating the need for gasoline or battery charging. This eco-friendly design will reduce carbon emissions and provide a more sustainable lawn care solution. The mower can be equipped with a high-capacity battery to ensure a long cutting time on a single charge.",
    "Autonomous Lawn Mower: Create a self-driving lawn mower that can navigate and cut a lawn without human intervention. The mower can be equipped with sensors and GPS technology to avoid obstacles and navigate around the lawn. This will save time and effort for homeowners and commercial property managers, allowing them to focus on other tasks.",
    "Smart Lawn Mower: Design a lawn mower with advanced sensors and connectivity features. The mower can monitor grass height, moisture levels, and temperature to optimize cutting settings and prevent over- or under-watering. The mower can also connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to schedule cuts, monitor progress, and receive alerts when the mower needs maintenance.",
    "Modular Lawn Mower: Create a lawn mower with interchangeable cutting components, allowing users to easily switch between different cutting modes. For example, a user can switch from a traditional cutting blade to a mulching blade for more efficient grass disposal, or to a side-discharge blade for a more even cut. This modular design will provide homeowners with more flexibility and versatility in their lawn care routine."
