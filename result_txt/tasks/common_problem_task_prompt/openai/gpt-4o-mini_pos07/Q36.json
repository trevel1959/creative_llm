    "**Aesthetic and Zoning Issues**: The installation of solar panels can alter the visual landscape of a neighborhood. Some residents may object to the appearance of solar panels on their homes, leading to conflicts within communities. Zoning laws may also restrict where solar panels can be placed, complicating the installation process and requiring permits that could delay the project.",
    "**Intermittent Energy Production**: Solar energy production is dependent on weather conditions and daylight hours. This inconsistency can lead to energy shortages, particularly during cloudy days or at night. Without proper energy storage solutions, homes may experience power outages or rely on traditional energy sources, undermining the goal of going solar.",
    "**High Initial Costs and Financing Barriers**: Although solar panels can save money in the long run, the initial investment can be prohibitive for many homeowners. This financial barrier may prevent low-income families from participating in the program, creating inequities in access to renewable energy and potentially leading to social unrest or dissatisfaction with the initiative.",
    "**Maintenance and Technical Issues**: Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate efficiently. Homeowners may lack the knowledge or resources to properly maintain their systems, leading to decreased performance over time. Additionally, if a significant number of installations occur simultaneously, the demand for qualified technicians may exceed supply, resulting in long wait times for repairs.",
    "**Environmental Impact of Manufacturing**: The production of solar panels involves the extraction and processing of materials that can have significant environmental impacts. From mining for silicon to the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing, the overall environmental benefits of solar energy may be compromised if not managed responsibly. This could lead to public backlash against the initiative."
