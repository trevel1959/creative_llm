    "**Mood-Responsive Lighting**: Integrate smart lighting that adjusts based on the time of day and the user's mood. For instance, if the alarm goes off in the morning, soft, warm lighting could gradually brighten to simulate a natural sunrise, making waking up less jarring. At night, the system could dim lights or change colors based on the userâ€™s preferences for a calming environment.",
    "**Dynamic Alarm Tones**: Instead of a static alarm sound, the system could offer a library of sounds that evolve over time. Users could choose a base sound (like birds chirping or ocean waves) that gradually shifts to more energizing tones as the time to wake up approaches, ensuring a more pleasant and effective wake-up experience.",
    "**Activity-Based Alerts**: The system could analyze the user's schedule and habits to provide alerts based on activities. For example, if the user tends to snooze their alarm, the system could introduce a gentle vibration on the bedside table or a subtle shake of the pillow to encourage waking up, while providing reminders of important tasks or events that are scheduled for the day.",
    "**Integrated Sleep Cycle Monitoring**: By incorporating sleep cycle analysis, the alarm system could determine the optimal time to wake the user within a designated window. Using sensors to monitor sleep patterns, it could wake the user during light sleep, making the waking process feel more natural and less groggy.",
    "**Home Integration Features**: The alarm system could integrate with other smart home devices to create a seamless environment. For example, when the alarm goes off, the coffee maker could start brewing, the thermostat could adjust to a comfortable temperature, and curtains could automatically open to let in natural light, creating a more inviting waking experience."
