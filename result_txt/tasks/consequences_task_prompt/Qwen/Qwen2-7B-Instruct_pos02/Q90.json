    "**Global Economic Boom**: The immediate impact would be a significant boost in global economic activity. Erasing world debt would provide billions of people with immediate financial relief, increasing their disposable income. This could lead to increased consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Businesses may also benefit from reduced debt burdens, enabling them to invest more in expansion, innovation, and job creation.",
    "**Reduced Inequality**: Erasing debt can significantly reduce income inequality. Currently, debt disproportionately affects lower-income households who often have less financial cushioning. By eliminating this burden, wealth disparity could decrease, potentially leading to a more equitable society. This might result in increased social mobility and better opportunities for those previously constrained by debt.",
    "**Stimulated Innovation and Entrepreneurship**: With the financial burden of debt removed, individuals and businesses may feel freer to take risks. This could lead to a surge in innovative ventures and startups as people are no longer limited by their debt obligations. Additionally, governments may have more fiscal space to invest in public goods like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which can further stimulate economic growth and innovation.",
    "**Enhanced Global Stability**: Debt crises often contribute to political instability and conflict. By erasing world debt, countries may experience a reduction in geopolitical tensions, leading to a more stable international environment. This could facilitate smoother trade relationships, encourage foreign investment, and promote peace and cooperation among nations.",
    "**Reevaluation of Financial Systems**: Such an event would likely prompt a reevaluation of how debts are managed globally. It might lead to reforms that aim to prevent future crises by making the financial system more resilient. For example, there could be discussions around creating more sustainable debt structures, developing international frameworks for debt relief, or promoting financial literacy and responsible borrowing habits worldwide."
