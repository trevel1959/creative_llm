    "**Eco-Friendly Print Mode**: Introduce a dedicated eco-friendly printing mode that reduces ink and paper usage by optimizing document layouts and using draft quality settings by default. This feature could also suggest alternative formats, like double-sided printing or using smaller fonts, to minimize waste. Users could be rewarded with points for choosing eco-friendly options, which could be redeemed for discounts on ink or paper.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Printing Interface**: Create an AR interface that allows users to visualize their printed documents in a virtual space before printing. Using a smartphone or tablet, users could see how the document will look in its final form, including layout adjustments and color settings. This feature would be particularly useful for graphic designers and marketers who need to ensure accuracy in color and design.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Integrate voice recognition technology into printers, allowing users to print documents hands-free. Users could simply say commands like \"Print my last document\" or \"Print the report from last week,\" making the printing process more accessible, especially for those with mobility issues. This feature could also include voice feedback to confirm commands.",
    "**Integrated Document Scanner with AI**: Enhance printers with a built-in document scanner that utilizes AI to automatically categorize and organize scanned documents. The printer could recognize text and images, suggesting relevant tags or folders for storage. This would streamline the process of digitizing documents, making it easier for users to find and access their files later.",
    "**Customizable Printer Skins and Designs**: Offer a range of customizable printer skins or designs that users can choose from to match their home or office decor. This would transform the printer from a utilitarian object into a stylish accessory, appealing to those who value aesthetics in their workspace. Users could even upload their own designs for a truly personalized look."
