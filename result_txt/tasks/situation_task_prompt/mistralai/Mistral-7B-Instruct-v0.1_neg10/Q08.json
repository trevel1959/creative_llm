    "Develop a water purification system: You could create a small, portable water purification system that uses a combination of filters and chemical treatments to remove contaminants from polluted water sources. This system could be powered by solar energy, making it sustainable and eco-friendly.",
    "Harvest rainwater: You could set up a rainwater harvesting system to collect and store rainwater. This water could then be filtered and purified using a combination of natural and chemical treatments to ensure it is safe to drink.",
    "Collect and purify water from natural sources: You could venture out into the wilderness to collect water from natural sources such as rivers, lakes, and streams. This water would need to be purified using a combination of filters, chemical treatments, and boiling to ensure it is safe to drink.",
    "Use a water filtration app: There are many water filtration apps available that can help you identify safe drinking water sources based on your location. These apps use data from government and other sources to provide real-time information on the safety of water sources.",
    "Join a community water project: Many communities have water projects that work to provide clean drinking water to people in need. You could join one of these projects to help with tasks such as drilling wells, building water treatment facilities, and distributing clean water to communities in need."
