    "Once in a vibrant forest, a young bird named Luma woke one morning, her wings heavy and her spirit weighed down by doubt. She had forgotten how to fly. The other birds soared above her, their songs echoing like laughter. Luma sat on her branch, watching the clouds drift by, feeling the wind tease her feathers. One day, an old wise owl landed beside her. “Remember the joy of the sky,” he whispered. Inspired, Luma spread her wings, closed her eyes, and leaped. The wind caught her, and with a flutter of hope, she soared, rediscovering freedom among the clouds.",
