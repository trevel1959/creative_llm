    "Sonic Storage: Develop a device that converts sound waves into digital data. This device can be a small, portable speaker that records and stores important information through sound waves. For example, a user can record a meeting by speaking into the speaker, and the information will be stored in digital format. To retrieve the information, the user can play back the recording through the speaker, and the data will be displayed on a small screen.",
    "Holographic Display: Create a holographic display that can project important information in a 3D format. This display can be used for presentations, meetings, and other important events. The holographic display can project the information in a way that appears lifelike, making it easier for the user to understand and remember the information.",
    "Smell-O-Vision: Develop a device that can capture and store scent memories. This device can be a small, portable container that captures the scent of a particular moment or event. When the user wants to recall the memory, they can simply spray the container, and the scent will be released, bringing back the memory. This device can be used for personal memories, such as a favorite childhood smell, or for business purposes, such as capturing the scent of a new product.",
    "Telepathic Communication: Create a device that allows users to communicate through telepathy. This device can be a headset that uses brain-computer interface technology to transmit thoughts directly from one person's brain to another. This device can be used for remote meetings, presentations, and other forms of communication, eliminating the need for paper or other recording methods. The device can also be used for personal communication, such as sending a message to a loved one."
