    "**Eco-Friendly Smart Door Locks**: Develop smart door locks that are powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. These door locks could integrate sensors to detect the presence of natural light and automatically switch between solar or battery power modes. They can also use biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) for enhanced security while reducing reliance on physical keys.",
    "**Interactive Doorway Displays**: Create a series of interactive displays that transform doorways into information hubs. For example, in a school, this could be an interactive map showing the location of classrooms, restrooms, and other facilities. In a shopping mall, it could be a personalized recommendation system suggesting nearby stores based on user preferences. The displays can be touch-sensitive or use augmented reality (AR) to provide a more engaging experience.",
    "**Sound-Activated Mood Lighting**: Design a door system that changes its lighting color based on the time of day or user preferences. When someone enters through the door, sensors can detect the time and adjust the lighting accordingly. For instance, in the morning, the door might display a bright white light to simulate sunlight, while at night, it could have softer, warmer colors. This not only enhances the ambiance but also potentially reduces energy consumption.",
    "**Privacy-Enhancing Door Panels**: Develop door panels that change their transparency when exposed to certain types of electromagnetic waves. For example, these could be used in professional settings where privacy is crucial, such as doctors' offices or hotel rooms. By using specific frequencies, the door panels can transition from transparent to opaque, providing an immediate barrier without the need for physical barriers like curtains or blinds.",
    "**Smart Doorway Fitness Challenges**: Create a system that encourages physical activity by turning doorways into interactive fitness checkpoints. When someone enters through a doorway, they might trigger a series of challenges, such as doing push-ups or squats, to unlock the door. This can be especially useful in communal living spaces like dormitories or shared apartments, promoting health and community engagement simultaneously. The system could also track progress over time and offer rewards for consistent participation."
