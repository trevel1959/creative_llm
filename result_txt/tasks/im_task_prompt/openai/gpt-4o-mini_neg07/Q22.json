    "**Solar-Powered Flashlight with Energy Storage**: Design a flashlight that not only uses solar panels for charging but also includes a built-in battery pack that can store excess energy. This way, the flashlight can be charged during the day while being used at night, and it can even serve as a power bank for charging other devices in emergencies. The design could include a foldable solar panel for portability.",
    "**Multi-Functional Flashlight with Tools**: Create a flashlight that includes multiple tools within its body, such as a small knife, screwdriver, or even a whistle. This would make it a versatile tool for outdoor enthusiasts, campers, or emergency kits. The tools could be cleverly integrated into the design, ensuring they are easily accessible without compromising the flashlight's primary function.",
    "**Color-Changing LED Flashlight**: Develop a flashlight that allows users to change the color of the light emitted. This could be useful for various activities: red light for preserving night vision, blue light for attracting certain insects, or green light for reading maps without disturbing wildlife. The flashlight could feature a simple app that lets users select colors and adjust brightness levels.",
    "**Flashlight with Built-in GPS and SOS Features**: Introduce a flashlight that includes GPS tracking and an SOS signal feature. This would be especially useful for hikers or campers who might get lost. The flashlight could send out a distress signal with GPS coordinates when the SOS button is pressed, and it could also help users find their way back to a starting point by providing directions via a companion app.",
    "**Modular Flashlight Design**: Create a flashlight that can be customized with interchangeable parts. Users could swap out the lens for different beam patterns (flood vs. spotlight), change the body for different grip styles, or add attachments like a lantern head for broader illumination. This would allow users to tailor their flashlight to specific activities, enhancing its utility."
