    "**Public Resistance and Community Buy-In**: Residents may be resistant to changes in the public transportation system, especially if they are accustomed to existing routes and schedules. Overhauls may involve changes in routes, fare structures, or service frequency, leading to pushback from users. Engaging the community through public forums, surveys, and informational campaigns is essential to gain support and address concerns.",
    "**Disruption of Current Services**: During the overhaul process, existing services may be disrupted, causing inconvenience to current users. This can lead to frustration and a temporary decrease in ridership. Effective communication about timelines, alternative routes, and temporary solutions must be implemented to minimize disruption and maintain public trust.",
    "**Integration of Technology**: Incorporating new technology, such as real-time tracking, mobile payment systems, and smart ticketing, can enhance user experience but also poses challenges. Issues such as system compatibility, data privacy concerns, and the digital divide (where some residents may lack access to technology) must be addressed to ensure a smooth transition and equitable access for all users.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: While overhauling public transportation aims to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability, the construction phase can have negative environmental impacts. Assessing and mitigating these impacts through eco-friendly practices, such as using sustainable materials and minimizing construction waste, is crucial to align with environmental goals.",
    "**Coordination with Other City Services**: A successful transportation overhaul requires coordination with various city departments, including urban planning, public safety, and utilities. Challenges may arise in aligning timelines, managing shared resources, and ensuring that the transportation overhaul complements other city initiatives, such as housing development or road improvements."
