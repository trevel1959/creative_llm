    "**Virtual Reality Therapy for Phobias**: Develop a VR experience that simulates the environment and sensations associated with a specific phobia (e.g., acrophobia, ophidiophobia). The user is placed in a virtual scenario where they must confront and overcome their fear. The VR system tracks the user's physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance) and adjusts the experience accordingly to create a tailored, immersive therapy session.",
    "**Mind-Controlled Prosthetic Limbs**: Design a prosthetic limb that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. Utilize electroencephalography (EEG) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect neural activity associated with motor intentions. The prosthetic limb can then be programmed to respond accordingly, allowing users to control it with their minds.",
    "**Augmented Reality Art Gallery**: Create an immersive art experience where visitors can explore a virtual art gallery using AR technology. The gallery features interactive, AI-generated art pieces that respond to the viewer's movements and emotions. The artwork can change color, shape, or even emit sounds in response to the viewer's reactions, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.",
    "**Personalized Wellness Retreats**: Develop a VR platform that offers customized wellness retreats tailored to individual users' needs and preferences. The user can select from various environments (e.g., beach, forest, mountain) and activities (e.g., yoga, meditation, hiking). The VR system can track the user's physiological responses and adjust the experience to create a relaxing and rejuvenating experience.",
    "**Interactive Museum Exhibits**: Design an interactive museum exhibit that uses AI-powered projection mapping to bring artifacts to life. The exhibit can display real-time information, animations, and even 3D reconstructions of historical events or cultural artifacts. Visitors can engage with the exhibit through touch-sensitive interfaces, allowing them to manipulate and explore the artifacts in a unique and immersive way."
