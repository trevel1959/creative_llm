    "Artificially-Intelligent Glasses: People with poor vision could use AI-powered glasses that use machine learning algorithms to enhance their vision. These glasses would use cameras to detect the environment and objects around the user and use the AI to recognize and highlight the important details. For example, the glasses could identify faces, recognize objects, and highlight important text, making it easier for people with poor vision to navigate their surroundings.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: Bionic eye implants could be used to restore vision to people with poor vision. These implants would use advanced microchips and sensors to convert light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, allowing the user to perceive their surroundings. The implants could also be connected to a wearable device that provides additional features such as night vision, motion detection, and image enhancement.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Smart contact lenses could be developed to provide people with poor vision with real-time information about their surroundings. These lenses would have a small display embedded in the lens that shows important information such as the time, directions, and messages. The lenses could also have built-in sensors that detect objects and faces, allowing the user to navigate their surroundings more easily.",
    "Virtual Reality Glasses: Virtual reality glasses could be used to provide people with poor vision with a simulated visual experience. These glasses would use advanced graphics and processing power to create a virtual environment that mimics the real world, allowing the user to navigate and interact with their surroundings in a more immersive way. The glasses could also be connected to a wearable device that provides additional features such as voice recognition and object recognition.",
    "Neurostimulation: Neurostimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be used to improve vision in people with poor vision. TMS uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain, allowing the brain to reorganize and adapt to new visual information. This could help people with poor vision to see more clearly and navigate their surroundings more easily."
