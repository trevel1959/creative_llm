    "Floating Islands: In a world without planes, travelers could utilize a network of interconnected floating islands as a means of traversing continents. These islands, made of a lightweight yet durable material, would be anchored to the ocean floor and connected by a series of bridges and tunnels. Passengers could board the islands at designated ports and travel comfortably across the ocean, taking in the breathtaking views of the sea and the coastline.",
    "Hovercrafts: In a world without planes, hovercrafts could become the primary mode of transportation for long-distance travel. These vessels would use advanced magnetic levitation technology to hover above the ground, reducing the need for airports and runways. Passengers could board the hovercrafts at designated terminals and travel at high speeds, reaching their destinations in a fraction of the time it would take by sea or land.",
    "Submersibles: In a world without planes, submersibles could become the go-to mode of transportation for intercontinental travel. These underwater vessels would use advanced propulsion systems to travel through the ocean at incredible speeds, allowing passengers to reach their destinations in a fraction of the time it would take by sea. The submersibles could be designed to accommodate a variety of passengers and cargo, making them an ideal option for both personal and commercial travel.",
    "Teleportation: In a world without planes, teleportation technology could become the ultimate mode of transportation. Passengers could simply step into a teleportation device at one location and emerge at their destination instantaneously, eliminating the need for any form of transportation altogether. This technology could revolutionize the way people travel, making it faster, more convenient, and more environmentally friendly.",
    "Space Travel: In a world without planes, space travel could become the only viable option for intercontinental travel. Passengers could board spacecrafts at designated spaceports and travel through the cosmos, reaching their destinations in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks. This mode of transportation would offer breathtaking views of the universe and the opportunity to experience zero gravity, making it an unparalleled travel experience."
