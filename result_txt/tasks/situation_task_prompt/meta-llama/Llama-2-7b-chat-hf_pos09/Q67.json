    "Use Satellite Imagery: With no clouds, satellite imagery could be used to predict weather patterns. Advanced algorithms could be developed to analyze the images and identify patterns in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These patterns could be used to make accurate predictions about the weather.",
    "Solar Radiation: The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface could be used to predict weather patterns. By monitoring the amount of radiation, scientists could identify changes in atmospheric conditions that could lead to specific weather patterns.",
    "Atmospheric Pressure: By analyzing changes in atmospheric pressure, scientists could predict weather patterns. Changes in pressure can indicate changes in air masses and fronts, which can lead to different weather conditions.",
    "Ocean Currents: The movement of ocean currents can have a significant impact on weather patterns. By monitoring the movement of currents, scientists could predict changes in weather patterns and track the movement of storms.",
    "Volcanic Activity: Volcanic eruptions can affect weather patterns by injecting ash and gas into the atmosphere. By monitoring volcanic activity, scientists could predict changes in weather patterns and track the movement of storms."
