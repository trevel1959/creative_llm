    "**Massive Food Shortage**: Photosynthesis is the primary source of oxygen and organic compounds for most living organisms. Without it, plants would no longer be able to produce the oxygen we breathe, and the food chain would collapse. Herbivores would starve, and carnivores would soon follow. The lack of food would lead to widespread famine, and the global population would plummet. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Catastrophic Climate Change**: Photosynthesis helps regulate the Earth's climate by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and producing oxygen. Without it, the concentration of CO2 would skyrocket, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect. This would result in extreme temperature fluctuations, devastating weather events, and the loss of entire ecosystems. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Ecosystem Disruption**: Photosynthesis is a keystone process that supports the entire food web. Without it, the delicate balance of ecosystems would be disrupted, leading to the collapse of entire ecosystems. This would have a ripple effect, causing the loss of biodiversity, and potentially even extinctions. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Atmospheric Changes**: Photosynthesis helps maintain the Earth's atmospheric composition. Without it, the atmosphere would become toxic, and the air we breathe would become unbreathable. This would lead to a mass extinction event, as even the most resilient organisms would struggle to survive. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Geological Consequences**: Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the Earth's geological processes. Without it, the carbon cycle would be severely disrupted, leading to changes in ocean chemistry, and potentially even triggering massive geological events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. (Confidence score: 0.7)"
