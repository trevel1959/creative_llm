    "Use a Water Purification System: One solution to obtain clean drinking water even if all traditional sources are polluted is to use a water purification system. There are various types of water purification systems available, such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet, and activated carbon filters. These systems can remove contaminants and bacteria from the water, making it safe to drink.",
    "Collect Rainwater: Another option is to collect rainwater. Rainwater is typically cleaner than surface water and can be collected using a rain barrel or a larger storage system. However, it's important to filter the water to remove any contaminants before drinking it.",
    "Harvest Greywater: Greywater is the wastewater from sinks, showers, and washing machines. It can be collected and treated using a greywater system to make it safe for drinking. This system typically involves a filter that removes contaminants and bacteria.",
    "Drill a Well: If the groundwater is not contaminated, drilling a well can be an option for obtaining clean drinking water. However, this option may not be feasible for everyone, as it requires a significant investment of time and money.",
    "Use Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe for drinking. This process can be expensive and energy-intensive, but it can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water."
