    "**Artwork Transportation and Handling**: Transporting artwork safely is a critical concern. Different types of art require specific handling and packaging to avoid damage. For example, fragile pieces like glass sculptures need extra care, while larger installations may require special equipment. If proper protocols are not followed, artworks could be damaged in transit, leading to financial loss and disappointment for both artists and organizers.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Issues**: Successfully promoting the exhibition is essential for attracting visitors. However, there can be challenges in reaching the target audience effectively. This includes creating engaging promotional materials, utilizing social media effectively, and managing public relations. If the marketing strategy is poorly executed, it could result in low attendance, impacting the artists' visibility and sales potential.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Organizing an art exhibition can be expensive, and managing the budget is crucial. Unexpected costs can arise from various areas, such as venue fees, insurance for artworks, catering for opening receptions, or marketing expenses. If the budget is not meticulously planned and monitored, it could lead to financial strain or the need to cut essential elements of the exhibition, diminishing its overall quality.",
    "**Artist Coordination and Communication**: Coordinating with multiple artists can be complex, especially if they have differing needs and expectations. Clear communication is vital to ensure that artists are aware of timelines, installation requirements, and exhibition guidelines. Miscommunication could lead to confusion, last-minute changes, or even artists pulling out of the exhibition, which would negatively affect the event's overall integrity.",
    "**Visitor Experience Management**: Ensuring a positive experience for visitors is essential for the success of the exhibition. Potential problems could include overcrowding, inadequate signage, or a lack of engaging programming (like artist talks or guided tours). If visitors feel overwhelmed or confused, they may leave with a negative impression, which could affect future exhibitions and the reputation of the organizers."
