    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding for the establishment and ongoing maintenance of a conservation park can be a significant hurdle. Many conservation projects rely on grants, donations, or government support, which can be inconsistent. This financial instability may hinder the ability to implement necessary conservation measures, staff hiring, and educational programs.",
    "**Community Engagement and Opposition**: Engaging local communities in the conservation efforts is crucial, yet it can also be fraught with challenges. Some residents may oppose the park due to fears of restricted land use, loss of livelihood, or changes to local culture. Building trust and fostering collaboration with these communities is essential but can be time-consuming and complex.",
    "**Invasive Species Management**: Once a conservation park is established, managing invasive species can become a pressing issue. Invasive plants and animals can outcompete native species, disrupt ecosystems, and undermine conservation efforts. Developing a strategic plan for monitoring and controlling these species is vital but can require significant resources and expertise.",
    "**Climate Change Impact**: Climate change poses a long-term threat to the integrity of conservation parks. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter habitats, affect species distribution, and lead to the loss of biodiversity. Establishing a park without considering these factors may result in future challenges that compromise conservation goals.",
    "**Visitor Management and Education**: Balancing public access with conservation goals is a delicate issue. Increased visitor numbers can lead to habitat degradation, littering, and wildlife disturbances. Implementing effective visitor management strategies, such as designated trails, educational programs, and responsible tourism initiatives, is crucial to mitigate these impacts."
