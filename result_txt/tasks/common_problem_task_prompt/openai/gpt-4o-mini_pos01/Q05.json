    "**Safety Hazards**: The construction process itself poses various safety risks. Tools may cause injuries, and workers could fall from heights. To address this, proper safety gear such as helmets, harnesses, and gloves should be worn, and a safety plan should be established before beginning construction.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Building a tree house can disrupt the local ecosystem, affecting wildlife and plant life. To minimize this impact, builders should conduct an environmental assessment and choose a location that will not harm local flora and fauna. Additionally, using eco-friendly materials can help reduce the overall environmental footprint.",
    "**Permitting and Legal Issues**: Depending on the location, building a tree house may require permits or could be subject to zoning laws. Failing to obtain the necessary permissions can lead to fines or even forced removal of the structure. It's essential to check local regulations and secure any required permits before starting construction.",
    "**Access and Egress Challenges**: Accessing the tree house during and after construction can be problematic. If the tree is too high or if the access ladder is unstable, it could pose risks for builders and users. To solve this, builders should create a safe, sturdy access method, such as a well-constructed ladder or staircase, ensuring it is secure and easily navigable.",
    "**Weather Considerations**: Weather conditions can significantly impact both the construction process and the usability of the tree house. Rain, wind, or extreme temperatures can hinder progress and affect the materials used. To counteract this, builders should plan their construction timeline around favorable weather forecasts and choose materials that can withstand various weather conditions."
