    "Robotic pollinators: Create robotic pollinators that can navigate plants and transfer pollen from one flower to another. They could be equipped with sensors to identify flowers and adjust their movements accordingly.",
    "Pollination drones: Use drones equipped with pollen collection and dispensing systems to pollinate plants. These drones could be controlled remotely and programmed to visit specific plants or areas.",
    "Wind-powered pollinators: Develop wind-powered pollinators that use the power of the wind to simulate the movement of pollinators. These devices could be attached to the plants and use the wind to transfer pollen between flowers.",
    "Self-pollination: Encourage self-pollination by developing plants with larger, more accessible stamens and pistils. This would allow the plant to pollinate itself without the need for external pollinators.",
    "Pollination through water: Utilize water sources to help plants pollinate. Plants could be designed to release pollen into the water, which would then be transported to other plants through the water system."
