    "Energy-efficient LED bulbs: Replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs that have a longer lifespan and consume less energy. This would reduce the need for constant electricity usage and provide a more sustainable light source.",
    "Light harvesting: Develop a device that can capture and store light, similar to how some plants store energy in their leaves. This stored light could be released when needed, providing a renewable source of light that doesn't rely on the sun.",
    "Light-emitting windows: Incorporate special windows that can emit light, either through a transparent or translucent material that can be charged with electricity to produce a soft, ambient glow. This would allow natural light to enter during the day and provide artificial light when needed.",
    "Artificial satellite lighting: Utilize satellites in orbit around the Earth to transmit light to the planet's surface. These satellites could be equipped with solar panels and use lasers or other light-emitting technologies to beam light directly to the Earth's surface, creating a constant source of light that doesn't rely on the sun.",
    "Indoor farming: Develop a system of indoor farming that uses artificial lighting to grow plants and other organisms. This would provide a sustainable source of food and other resources, while also generating light that can be used for various purposes within a home or community."
