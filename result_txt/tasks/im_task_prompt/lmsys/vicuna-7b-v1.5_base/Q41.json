High-quality trucks with sturdy construction and smooth bearings can enhance the skateboard's performance and make it easier to perform tricks. Additionally, trucks with adjustable height and angle can provide a more customized fit for different skateboarders.",
    "Skateboard wheels: Upgrading the wheels on a skateboard can also improve its performance. Larger wheels with a higher contact patch provide better grip and stability, while smaller wheels with a lower contact patch offer faster, more agile turning. Different wheel materials such as urethane or aluminum can also affect the skateboard's performance and durability.",
    "Skateboard bearings: Another important component of a skateboard is the bearings. High-quality bearings with a low friction coefficient can improve the skateboard's speed and responsiveness. Additionally, bearings with lubricant can reduce friction and extend the lifespan of the bearings.",
    "Skateboard safety features: Safety is an important aspect of skateboarding. Adding safety features such as impact-resistant decks, padded grips, and non-slip footpads can help prevent injuries and make skateboarding a safer activity.",
    "Skateboard accessories: There are many accessories that can be added to a skateboard to improve its functionality and aesthetics.
