    "Smart Cap: Integrate a smart cap that detects when the pen is empty and alerts the user, eliminating the need for frequent refills. The cap could also have a built-in light that illuminates the writing surface in low-light conditions.",
    "Ink Indicators: Add a series of colored ink indicators that show the level of ink remaining in the pen. This would allow users to quickly determine when it's time to refill without having to unscrew the cap.",
    "Magnetic Attachment: Create a magnetic attachment that allows users to securely store their pens on a magnetic desk organizer or a metal surface, keeping them within reach and reducing clutter.",
    "Customizable Grip: Offer interchangeable grip covers in various sizes and textures to accommodate different writing styles and preferences. This would cater to a wider audience and enhance the pen's versatility.",
    "Ink Flow Control: Develop a mechanism that allows users to adjust the ink flow, enabling them to write with varying degrees of boldness or smoothness. This could be particularly useful for those who prefer varying line widths or for artistic purposes."
