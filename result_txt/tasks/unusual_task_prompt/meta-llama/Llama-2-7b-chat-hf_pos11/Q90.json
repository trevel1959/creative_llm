    "Corkscrew-powered transportation: Design a vehicle that uses the spiral shape of a corkscrew to improve its efficiency and maneuverability. For example, a corkscrew-shaped car could have a spiral-shaped body that allows it to easily navigate tight spaces and make sharp turns, or a corkscrew-powered bicycle could have a spiral-shaped frame that provides a smooth and efficient ride."
