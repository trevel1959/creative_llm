    "Carrier Pigeons: With phones not working, a classic method of long-distance communication could be to use carrier pigeons. These birds could be trained to fly between locations and carry messages attached to their legs. This method would be reliable and slow, but it would allow for communication over long distances.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to send messages between locations. These pigeons are trained to find their way back home, even over long distances. By attaching a message to the pigeon's leg, the recipient could receive the message once the pigeon arrives.",
    "Optical Signaling: Another method of long-distance communication could be through optical signaling. This involves using mirrors or lenses to reflect or focus light signals between locations. This method would be fast and reliable, but it would require a clear line of sight between the two locations.",
    "Drone Messengers: Drones could be used to carry messages between locations. These drones could be equipped with GPS and communication technology, allowing them to navigate and deliver messages quickly and efficiently. This method would be faster than traditional methods and could be used in areas where a clear line of sight is not possible.",
    "Smoke Signals: In a more old-fashioned approach, smoke signals could be used to communicate over long distances. By creating smoke signals with specific patterns, messages could be conveyed between locations. This method would be slow and unreliable, but it could be an effective way to communicate in areas where other methods are not possible."
