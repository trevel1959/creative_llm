    "ideas for traveling if all roads become impassable: 1. Hot Air Balloon: With all roads impassable, a hot air balloon could be a viable option for transportation. It could carry passengers and cargo over long distances, providing a safe and scenic mode of transportation. The balloon could be powered by a gas burner or solar panels, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly option.",
    "Magnetic levitation train: Maglev trains are already in use in some parts of the world, but with all roads impassable, they could become the primary mode of transportation. Maglev trains use magnetic levitation to lift the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing for faster travel. They could be powered by electricity or even solar panels, making them a sustainable option.",
    "Hoverbikes: Hoverbikes are similar to motorcycles but use fans to create lift, allowing them to hover above the ground. They could be powered by electricity or gasoline, making them a versatile mode of transportation. With all roads impassable, hoverbikes could provide a convenient and efficient way to travel over long distances.",
    "Underwater Tunnels: With all roads impassable, underwater tunnels could become the next mode of transportation. These tunnels could be built using advanced materials and technology, allowing for safe and efficient travel underwater. They could be powered by electricity or even solar panels, making them a sustainable option.",
    "Spacecraft: With all roads impassable, space travel could become the next mode of transportation. Spacecraft could carry passengers and cargo over long distances, providing a safe and efficient way to travel. They could be powered by solar panels or nuclear reactors, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly option."
