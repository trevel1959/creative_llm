    "Limited funding: Developing countries often have limited budgets, which can make it difficult to implement the clean water initiative effectively. The initiative could seek funding from international organizations or apply for grants to help finance the project.",
    "Maintenance of water infrastructure: Once the clean water infrastructure is established, necessary funding should be maintained to ensure its proper functioning and ongoing maintenance. This can be a challenge in developing countries where funding may be unstable, necessitating the need for sustainable funding sources.",
    "Limited expertise and training: Many developing countries have limited expertise in water treatment and distribution, which can hinder the successful implementation of the initiative. Training programs should be established to develop local expertise and capacity building should be a priority.",
    "Contamination of water sources: Developing countries may have polluted water sources, such as rivers and lakes, which can contaminate the treated water and render it unsafe for consumption. The initiative should focus on establishing effective wastewater treatment systems to mitigate this risk.",
    "Water scarcity: Many developing countries experience water scarcity due to overpopulation, drought, or climate change. If the clean water initiative relies solely on the availability of water sources, it could struggle to achieve its goals. The initiative should consider alternative sources of clean water, such as rainwater harvesting or desalination."
