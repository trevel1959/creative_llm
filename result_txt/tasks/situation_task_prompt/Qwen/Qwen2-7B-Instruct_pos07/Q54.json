    "**Inflatable City-Crafts**: Design large, inflatable structures that can be filled with air and used as temporary cities on water. These could have living quarters, dining areas, entertainment spaces, and even gardens. They would be anchored to the seabed using lightweight, yet sturdy, materials. To travel, they would be inflated, navigated using wind, currents, and small propellers, and deflated once reaching the destination.",
    "**Bioluminescent Rafts**: Develop rafts made from biodegradable materials that incorporate bioluminescent organisms. These organisms would provide light during night time voyages, allowing travelers to navigate without relying on external sources of light. The raft could also function as a beacon, guiding ships back if they were to get lost.",
    "**Water-Walking Pods**: Create pods that can walk on water using a modified form of the Bernoulli effect. The pods would use powerful fans or turbines to create a low-pressure area underneath them, causing them to float above the water surface, minimizing friction and allowing for smooth, fast travel. This concept is inspired by the way some animals like water striders move on water.",
    "**Submerged Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs)**: Build a fleet of self-driving, underwater vehicles that can transport goods and people through the ocean floor. These vehicles would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, able to detect and avoid obstacles automatically. They could also use the ocean currents to their advantage for propulsion, significantly reducing energy consumption.",
    "**Solar-Powered Hydrogen-Fuelled Flying Boats**: Design hybrid aircraft capable of taking off and landing on water, powered by solar energy during the day and hydrogen fuel at night. These planes would feature wings that double as solar panels during daylight hours, generating electricity to power the hydrogen fuel cells. When flying, they would skim over the water surface, minimizing drag and increasing efficiency. "
