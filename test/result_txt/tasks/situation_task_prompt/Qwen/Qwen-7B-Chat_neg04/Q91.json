    "Use a special suit or clothing that can detect impacts and provide an immediate response, such as releasing air or a protective shield.",
    "Develop a device that can simulate different sensations of touch, allowing the user to sense if they are being injured or if there is danger around them.",
    "Create a wearable device that uses sensors to detect changes in body position or movement, and provides real-time feedback on potential hazards.",
    "Design a system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in the user's behavior and predict when they may be at risk of injury.",
    "Utilize virtual reality technology to create a simulated environment where the user can practice safety procedures and learn how to avoid injuries."
