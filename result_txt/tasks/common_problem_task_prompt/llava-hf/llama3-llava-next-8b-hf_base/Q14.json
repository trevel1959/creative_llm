    "Safety and Site Management: High-rise buildings often require strict safety regulations and protocols in place. A construction site must be safe for the workers, visitors, and the general public. Failure to follow safety regulations can result in accidents and injuries, leading to costly delays and potential lawsuits.",
    "Quality and Maintenance: To maintain the high-rise building, proper execution of the design and construction is critical. Low-quality building materials can lead to structural integrity issues during the construction process, as well as costly repairs in the future. Regular maintenance is essential to keep the building safe and functional for an extended period.",
    "Labor Force: Depending on the location and time of year, finding a skilled and reliable workforce can be a significant challenge. Attrition and fluctuating staffing levels can throw off the construction timeline and increase costs. To mitigate this issue, building owners can explore alternative labor sources, including the use of apprenticeship programs to develop future talent.",
    "Material Supply Chain: Efficiently managing the supply chain for high-rise building materials is crucial. Delays in the delivery of materials can be costly, leading to additional delays in the construction process. Effective supply chain management is essential to have materials available at the right time and maintain the construction timeline.",
    "Weather-Related Issues: Construction projects in certain areas may be susceptible to weather-related problems, such as hurricanes, floods, or wildfires. It is essential to have contingency plans in place for weather-related issues and to work with local authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of the construction site and the local community."
