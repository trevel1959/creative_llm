    "Create art: Art is a great way to express oneself and entertain oneself. If I had to live in silence, I would use my time to create art, such as paintings, drawings, or sculptures.

    "Play music: Music is a powerful tool for entertainment and relaxation. If I had to live in silence, I would use my time to learn to play an instrument, such as a guitar or a piano, or to sing. I would find solace in the rhythm and melody of music, and use it to soothe my mind and soul.",
