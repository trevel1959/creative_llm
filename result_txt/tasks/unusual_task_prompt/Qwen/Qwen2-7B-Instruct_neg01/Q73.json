    "**Innovative Light Therapy for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)**: Develop a light therapy device that utilizes advanced algorithms to adjust its intensity based on the user's circadian rhythm. The light bulbs would change colors throughout the day to mimic natural sunlight, helping to regulate mood and improve sleep patterns.",
    "**Eco-friendly Light Bulbs**: Create a line of light bulbs that not only reduce energy consumption but also contribute to environmental conservation. These bulbs could be designed to plant trees or clean up oceans with every purchase. Each bulb sold would fund a tree planting project or contribute to ocean cleanup efforts, making a tangible impact on the environment.",
    "**Smart Lighting for Home Automation**: Design a series of smart light bulbs that integrate seamlessly into existing home automation systems. Users can control the lighting through voice commands, mobile apps, or even facial recognition. The bulbs could learn from the user's habits and preferences, automatically adjusting brightness, color temperature, and intensity to create the perfect ambiance for different activities.",
    "**Artistic Light Bulb Sculptures**: Transform traditional light bulbs into artistic sculptures that double as functional lighting fixtures. These could be created in various shapes, sizes, and materials, such as glass, metal, or even recycled materials. They could be designed to be interactive, changing colors or patterns based on music, sound, or movement.",
    "**Light Bulb Art Exhibitions**: Organize an annual art exhibition where artists use light bulbs as the primary medium. This could include installations, sculptures, and even performance art pieces that explore themes like energy consumption, sustainability, and innovation. By showcasing light bulbs in unconventional ways, this exhibition would challenge perceptions and promote creative thinking about everyday objects."
