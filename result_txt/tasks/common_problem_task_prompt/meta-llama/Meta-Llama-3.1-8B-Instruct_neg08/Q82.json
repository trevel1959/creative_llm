    "**Eco-Friendly Modular Design**: Create a modular tiny house that can be easily disassembled, reused, and recycled. Each module would be designed to be energy-efficient, using sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, low-VOC paints, and solar panels. The modules could be stacked to create a unique, multi-level design, with each level serving a specific purpose (e.g., sleeping, cooking, or relaxing). This design would not only reduce waste but also provide a sense of community, as multiple modules could be combined to create a shared living space.",

The Nest would have a retractable roof, allowing occupants to stargaze or enjoy the outdoors while still being protected from the elements. A built-in hammock or reading nook would add to the cozy atmosphere.",

The exterior would be clad in durable, weather-resistant materials like aluminum or stainless steel, with a bold, eye-catching color scheme.",

A built-in hammock or daybed would allow occupants to relax and unwind in a peaceful, serene environment.",
    "**The Loft**: Create a tiny house that features a spacious, loft-like interior with a dramatic, open ceiling. The Loft would have a minimalist, industrial-chic aesthetic, with exposed ductwork, concrete floors, and a bold, color-blocked design. A built-in reading nook or workspace would be suspended from the ceiling, creating a sense of floating above the main living area. A retractable skylight would allow natural light to pour in, making"
