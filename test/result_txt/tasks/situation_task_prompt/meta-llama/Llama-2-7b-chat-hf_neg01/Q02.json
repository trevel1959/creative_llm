    "Community Gardens: With supermarkets closed, people could come together to create community gardens in vacant lots or unused spaces in their neighborhoods. These gardens could provide fresh produce, herbs, and other edible plants, allowing people to grow their own food and be self-sufficient.",
    "Urban Foraging: Cities have a wealth of untapped resources in the form of wild edibles. People could learn to forage for wild mushrooms, berries, and other edible plants growing in urban areas. This would provide a sustainable source of food and help reduce waste.",
    "Vertical Farming: With supermarkets closed, people could turn to vertical farming techniques to grow their own food indoors. This method involves growing plants in vertically stacked layers, often using hydroponics or aeroponics, which can be done in small spaces. This would provide a reliable source of fresh produce year-round.",
    "Food Co-ops: In the absence of supermarkets, people could form food cooperatives, where members pool their resources to purchase food in bulk. This would allow individuals to access a wider variety of food at a lower cost, while also supporting local farmers and reducing waste.",
    "Online Marketplaces: With supermarkets closed, people could turn to online marketplaces that connect consumers with local farmers and food producers. These platforms could provide a virtual marketplace where people could purchase fresh, locally-sourced produce, eliminating the need for a physical storefront. This would support local agriculture and ensure people have access to fresh food, even in the absence of supermarkets."
