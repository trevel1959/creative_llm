    "Insect farming: Insects like crickets and mealworms are already used as a source of protein for animals. They are also rich in vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and potassium. By farming these insects, we could provide a sustainable source of essential nutrients.",
    "Algae cultivation: Algae are rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein. They can be grown in water, requiring minimal land and resources. With algae farming, we could provide a nutritious food source that is easy to produce and transport.",
    "Symbiotic relationships: By cross-breeding different plants, we could create new species that provide essential nutrients. For example, we could breed a plant that produces vitamin C with another that produces calcium, creating a nutrient-rich fruit.",
    "Bacteria-based food sources: Certain bacteria like Bacillus subtilis can produce vitamins and minerals like vitamin B12 and iron. By cultivating these bacteria and using them as a food source, we could provide essential nutrients without relying on fruits and vegetables.",
    "Cellular agriculture: This involves growing cells in a controlled environment, such as a lab, to produce nutrient-rich foods. By using cellular agriculture, we could create a variety of nutrient-dense foods, including vitamins and minerals, without relying on traditional agriculture."
