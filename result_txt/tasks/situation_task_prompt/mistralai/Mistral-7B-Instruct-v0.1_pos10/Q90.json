    "Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it fresh. If there was no more rain, we could collect water from the sea and use desalination technology to make it fresh and drinkable.",
    "Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting rainwater and storing it for later use. We could install rainwater harvesting systems in buildings and homes to collect water during rainfall and store it for use in irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable uses.",
    "Groundwater extraction: Groundwater is water that is stored beneath the earth's surface. We could extract groundwater from underground aquifers and use it for drinking and other non-potable uses.",
    "Wastewater recycling: Wastewater recycling is the process of treating wastewater to make it safe for reuse. We could collect wastewater from households and businesses and use it for irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable uses.",
    "Cloud seeding: Cloud seeding is the process of adding chemicals to clouds to stimulate rainfall. If there was no more rain, we could use cloud seeding technology to create artificial rainfall and collect the water that falls."
