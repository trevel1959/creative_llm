    "Utilize artificial lighting. On cloudy days, artificial lighting could be used to supplement the lack of natural sunlight. This could include installing LED lights in homes, businesses, or public spaces. These lights could be energy-efficient and could also be powered by solar panels.",
    "Create a sun simulation. A sun simulation could be created using LED lights or other artificial light sources. This could be done in a greenhouse or indoor space to simulate the natural light from the sun. This could be useful for growing plants, especially in areas with limited sunlight.",
    "Use mirrors to reflect sunlight. Mirrors could be used to reflect sunlight onto a surface, such as a wall or a piece of metal. This could be useful for heating a space or providing light in a room.",
    "Create a light tunnel. A light tunnel could be created using mirrors and artificial light sources. This could be used to channel sunlight into a space, even on cloudy days. The light tunnel could be used to heat a space or provide light in a room.",
    "Use transparent windows. Transparent windows could be used to let in sunlight, even on cloudy days. These windows could be made of materials that allow light to pass through, such as glass or acrylic."
