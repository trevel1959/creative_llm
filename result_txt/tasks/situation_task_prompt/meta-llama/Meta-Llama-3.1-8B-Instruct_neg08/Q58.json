    "**Bioluminescent Bait**: Develop a system where insects are attracted to bioluminescent baits that are harmless to the environment. These baits would mimic the natural light patterns of insects' natural habitats, drawing them away from human settlements. The insects would then be safely captured and relocated to areas where they can thrive without causing harm.",
    "**Pheromone Disruptors**: Create a device that emits a specific frequency of pheromone disruptors, interfering with the insects' communication systems. This would prevent them from coordinating and would render them less effective in causing damage.",
    "**Edible Insect Traps**: Design edible traps that mimic the taste and texture of insects' natural food sources. These traps would be made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, ensuring they are safe for consumption by other animals and the environment. The trapped insects could then be used as a sustainable food source or safely released back into the wild.",
    "**Micro-Drone Swarms**: Develop a swarm of micro-drones that can be deployed to target specific areas where pests are present. These drones would use advanced sensors and algorithms to detect and eliminate the pests, minimizing the use of pesticides and other chemicals.",
    "**Genetic Modification of Insect Food Sources**: Research and develop genetically modified crops that are resistant to insect damage. These crops would be designed to produce a toxin that is harmless to humans and other animals but toxic to the target insects. This would reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals, making the environment safer and more sustainable.
