    "**Glow-in-the-Dark Furniture**: Design furniture that incorporates glow-in-the-dark materials. For example, a coffee table could have a glass top filled with glow-in-the-dark resin or embedded with luminous stones. This furniture would emit a soft light, creating an ambient atmosphere while being functional. Custom pieces can be made to match the decor of the room, ensuring both style and practicality.",
    "**Firefly Terrarium**: Create a small terrarium that houses bioluminescent organisms or fireflies. This self-contained ecosystem would not only provide a natural light source but also bring a piece of nature indoors. The gentle flickering of the fireflies or the steady glow of bioluminescent algae would add a magical touch to the room, perfect for relaxation or gatherings.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Utilize reflective materials to enhance any available light sources. Install mirrors strategically around the room to bounce light from windows or even candles. You can also use metallic or reflective wallpaper to amplify the ambient light. This method transforms a dimly lit space into a brighter environment without needing additional light sources.",
    "**Natural Candlelight Display**: Instead of standard candles, create a display of scented soy or beeswax candles arranged artistically in different heights and shapes. These candles can be placed in glass holders or lanterns to provide safety and style. The warm glow of the candlelight can create a cozy atmosphere, perfect for intimate gatherings or relaxation.",
    "**Solar-Powered Lanterns**: Use solar-powered lanterns that can be placed around the room. During the day, these lanterns can charge in natural light, and at night, they can provide illumination. They come in various designs, from modern to vintage, and can be hung or placed on surfaces. This eco-friendly solution not only lights up the room but also promotes sustainability."
