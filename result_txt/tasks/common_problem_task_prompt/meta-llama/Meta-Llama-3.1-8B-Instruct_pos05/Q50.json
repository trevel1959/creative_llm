    "**Eco-Hub Village**: Design a futuristic eco-village with interconnected, self-sustaining modules that generate their own energy, harvest rainwater, and produce organic food. The modules would be made from recycled and locally sourced materials, minimizing waste and carbon footprint. Each module would have its own unique design and function, such as a community center, library, or art studio, fostering creativity and collaboration among residents.",
    "**Aquaponics Oasis**: Create a closed-loop system where fish, plants, and microorganisms work together to produce a sustainable food source. The system would utilize a network of interconnected ponds, hydroponic gardens, and greenhouses, providing a consistent supply of fresh produce and fish while minimizing water waste. This innovative approach would not only feed the community but also create a unique ecosystem for research and education.",
    "**Treehouse City**: Develop a vertical forest community where residents live in sustainable treehouses with integrated solar panels, wind turbines, and green roofs. The city would be designed to mimic the natural forest ecosystem, with towering trees providing shade, oxygen, and a habitat for local wildlife. The treehouses would be connected by walkways and bridges, creating a sense of community and promoting a connection with nature.",
    "**Bio-Dome Community**: Design a geodesic dome-shaped community that incorporates advanced biotechnology and sustainable design principles. The dome would be covered in a lush, vertically-stacked garden, providing a year-round supply of fresh produce and oxygen. The interior would feature a futuristic, modular design with amenities such as a community kitchen, fitness center, and educational spaces, promoting a healthy and active lifestyle.",
    "**Floating Eco-Island**: Construct a self-sustaining, floating island community that harnesses the power of the ocean and wind. The island would be made from recycled and sustainable materials, with a unique, curved design that maximizes energy production and minimizes environmental impact. The community would feature a range of innovative features, such as ocean-based aquaculture, wave energy harvesting, and advanced water filtration systems, creating a thriving ecosystem for residents and marine life alike."
