    "Insect-Sensing Drones: Develop drones equipped with advanced sensors that can detect and track insect populations. These drones could be deployed in areas where insect infestations are most likely to occur, providing early warning systems for pest control. The drones could also be used to deploy targeted pest control measures, such as insecticides or traps, to eliminate infestations.",
    "Insect-Proof Shelters: Design and build shelters that are impermeable to insects, using materials such as insect-repelling fabrics or screens. These shelters could be used for both human habitation and agricultural storage, providing a safe and secure environment for people and crops.",
    "Insect-Inspired Robotics: Develop robots that mimic the behavior and abilities of insects, using advanced sensors and actuators to detect and eliminate pests. These robots could be deployed in areas where insect infestations are most likely to occur, providing a more targeted and efficient means of pest control.",
    "Insect-Friendly Architecture: Design buildings and structures that are friendly to insects, incorporating features such as insect-friendly materials, windows, and roofs. This could help to maintain a balance between human and insect populations, ensuring that both can coexist in harmony."
