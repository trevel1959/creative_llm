    "Plant a universal garden: With no one to disturb or harm the garden, I would create a paradise on Earth. I would plant a variety of flora from different planets and galaxies, each with unique properties and healing powers. The garden would be a symbol of hope and renewal, a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living things. It would also serve as a sanctuary for any extraterrestrial beings who might find themselves lost in the universe.",
    "Write a cosmic opera: As the last person on Earth, I would compose a grand opera that would celebrate the universe's vastness and diversity.

It would be a testament to the power of art to transcend boundaries and bring people together. The opera would be performed for any extraterrestrial beings who might stumble upon Earth, offering them a glimpse into humanity's creativity and imagination."
