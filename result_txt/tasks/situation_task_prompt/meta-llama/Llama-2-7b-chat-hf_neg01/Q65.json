    "Solar-Powered Stained Glass Windows: In a world without lamps or lighting fixtures, stained glass windows could become a creative solution for lighting up a room at night. By using solar panels to power a hidden LED strip within the stained glass, the windows could glow with a warm, soft light. This would not only provide adequate illumination but also add a touch of elegance and beauty to the room.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting System: Mirrors are not just for reflecting light; they can also be used to create it. By using a mirror-based lighting system, a room could be lit up with a diffused, soft light. The mirrors could be placed in a strategic pattern, such as a grid or a spiral, to maximize the light distribution. This system would not only provide light but also add a touch of sophistication to the room.",
    "Glowing Plant Installations: In a world without artificial light sources, glowing plants could become the new norm. By using genetically modified plants that produce their own light, a room could be illuminated with a natural, organic glow. This would not only provide light but also add a touch of magic and wonder to the space.",
    "Light-Emitting Walls: Walls could be designed with light-emitting properties, providing a soft, ambient light that would illuminate a room without the need for any other light sources. This could be achieved through the use of special paints or coatings that contain light-emitting particles. This would not only provide light but also create a unique and futuristic look for the room.",
    "Holographic Lighting: In a world without traditional light sources, holographic technology could become the new standard for illumination. By using holographic projections, a room could be lit up with a three-dimensional, floating light source. This would not only provide light but also create a visually striking and memorable experience for those in the room."
