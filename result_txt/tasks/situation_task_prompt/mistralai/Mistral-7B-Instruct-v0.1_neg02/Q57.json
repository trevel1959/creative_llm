    "Underwater Homes: With the rising ocean levels, living on land would become a thing of the past. Instead, we could build homes underwater, where we can swim and explore the of the ocean. These homes could be designed to withstand the harsh ocean conditions and equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable life.",
    "Floating Cities: Another option would be to build floating cities on large platforms or ships. These cities could be designed to withstand the ocean's waves and equipped with all the necessary infrastructure for a sustainable life.",
    "Elevated Homes: If we can't live underwater or on a ship, we could build our homes on elevated platforms or stilts. This would allow us to live on land while keeping our homes safe from the rising ocean levels.",
    "Artificial Islands: We could also create artificial islands in the ocean to build our homes on. These islands could be designed to withstand the ocean's waves and equipped with all the necessary infrastructure for a sustainable life.",
    "Vertical Gardens: Finally, we could build vertical gardens in the ocean to create a new type of habitat for humans. These gardens could be designed to withstand the ocean's conditions and provide a unique living experience."
