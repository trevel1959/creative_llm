    "Technical Challenges: Another potential problem is the technical challenges associated with designing a spaceship. Designing a spaceship that can travel at high speeds, withstand extreme temperatures, and withstand the harsh conditions of space is a complex engineering challenge. There may be technical difficulties that arise during the design process, such as finding materials that can withstand the extreme conditions or designing systems that can operate in microgravity.",
    "Limited Resources: A potential problem is the limited resources available for designing a spaceship. Designing a spaceship requires a large amount of resources, including funding, materials, and skilled personnel. If there is a shortage of resources, it can delay the project and make it more difficult to achieve the desired goals.",
    "Environmental Factors: Designing a spaceship that can travel to other planets and moons in our solar system can be challenging due to the environmental factors that it will encounter. The ship will have to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and other environmental factors that it will encounter during its journey.",
    "Navigation and Communication: A potential problem in designing a spaceship is the navigation and communication systems. Designing a spaceship that can navigate through space and communicate with Earth is a complex task that requires advanced technology and systems. There may be issues with navigation and communication systems that can arise during the design process, such as interference from solar flares or the need for backup systems.",
    "Human Factors: Another potential problem in designing a spaceship is the human factors associated with space travel. Designing a spaceship that can accommodate the needs of astronauts for extended periods of time in space can be challenging. This includes designing systems for air, water, and waste management, as well as providing a comfortable living environment for the astronauts."
