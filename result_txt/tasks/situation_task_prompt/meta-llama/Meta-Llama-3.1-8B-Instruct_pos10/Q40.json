    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a backpack with integrated solar panels on the back and sides, allowing you to harness energy from the sun while on-the-go. The backpack would have a built-in battery pack to store excess energy for nighttime use or during periods of low sunlight. This would enable you to charge your devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and portable speakers, without relying on traditional batteries.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop shoes with built-in kinetic energy harvesting technology, converting the energy generated by your footsteps into electrical power. This power would be stored in a small battery pack, allowing you to charge your devices as you walk. The shoes could also include a small display to show your energy production and storage levels.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting**: Explore the use of bioluminescent organisms, such as glowing mushrooms or bacteria, to create sustainable lighting. These organisms could be used to power small devices, like flashlights or lanterns, providing a unique and eco-friendly alternative to traditional batteries.",
    "**Piezoelectric Flooring**: Design a floor that incorporates piezoelectric materials, which generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress, such as footsteps or vibrations. This energy could be harnessed to power devices in the surrounding area, such as lighting, security systems, or even small appliances.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a system that harnesses energy from the atmosphere to power devices. This could be achieved by capturing water vapor from the air and using it to generate electricity through a process called electrodialysis. The system could also include a built-in water collection and purification system, providing a sustainable source of clean water and electricity. [/INST] "
