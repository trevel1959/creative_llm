    "**Nature-based grooming**: I would rely on natural resources to maintain my personal grooming habits. I'd use coconut oil as a moisturizer, olive oil for hair care, and lemon juice as a natural bleach for hair lightening. I'd also use charcoal to create a natural face mask and exfoliate my skin with sugar or salt. For nail care, I'd use a mixture of lemon juice and olive oil to keep my nails healthy and strong. ",
    "**DIY beauty products**: I'd create my own beauty products using household items. For example, I'd make a face mask using honey and yogurt, a hair mask using avocado and banana, and a body scrub using coffee grounds and sugar. I'd also use essential oils like lavender and tea tree oil to create natural fragrances and skincare products. ",
    "**Traditional methods**: I'd rely on traditional methods of grooming, such as using a hot stone to exfoliate my skin, a bamboo comb to detangle my hair, and a silk cloth to soften my skin. I'd also use a natural soap made from plant-based ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter to clean my body. ",
    "**Food-based grooming**: I'd use food items to maintain my personal grooming habits. For example, I'd use egg whites as a hair mask to add protein and shine to my hair, and use honey as a natural lip balm to moisturize my lips. I'd also use turmeric as a natural face mask to reduce inflammation and brighten my skin. ",
    "**Sustainable and eco-friendly**: I'd focus on sustainable and eco-friendly grooming methods. I'd use reusable cloth pads instead of disposable sanitary products, and make my own natural soap using recycled materials. I'd also use a bamboo toothbrush and a natural deodorant made from coconut oil and baking soda. "
