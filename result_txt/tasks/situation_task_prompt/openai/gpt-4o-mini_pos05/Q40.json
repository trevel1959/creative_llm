    "**Biofuel Cells**: Develop portable biofuel cells that convert organic materials into electricity. For example, a small device could use food waste, such as fruit peels or vegetable scraps, to generate power. Users would simply insert their organic waste into the device, which would then break it down and produce electricity. This could be a sustainable way to power devices while reducing waste.",
    "**Thermoelectric Generators**: These devices convert temperature differences into electrical energy. By placing a thermoelectric generator on a heat source (like a stove or even your own body heat), you could power your devices. For instance, a small gadget could be designed to sit on your heating vent at home or even be worn as a wristband that utilizes body heat to generate power for your smartwatch.",
    "**Hand-Crank Generators**: Reintroducing the classic hand-crank generator, but with a modern twist. These devices could be designed to be compact and stylish, allowing users to charge their devices through manual effort. Imagine a sleek, portable crank that you can use while waiting in line or watching TV. This would not only power your devices but also provide a workout.",
    "**Piezoelectric Flooring**: Install piezoelectric tiles in high-traffic areas (like homes, offices, or public spaces) that generate electricity when stepped on. These tiles could be connected to a grid that powers devices in the vicinity. For example, walking through a mall could charge your phone or other devices simply by walking on the specially designed floor.",
    "**Hydro-Powered Devices**: Create small hydroelectric generators that can be placed in sinks or bathtubs. As water flows through, it could turn a turbine that generates electricity. This would be especially useful in homes where running water is readily available. Devices like smart speakers or lights could be powered by this constant flow of energy."
