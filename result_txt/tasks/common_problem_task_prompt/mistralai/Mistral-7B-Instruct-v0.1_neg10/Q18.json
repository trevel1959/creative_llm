    "One idea to overcome the boredom of repeating mundane tasks every day could be to challenge yourself to live without electricity for a day. This would force you to find alternative ways to accomplish tasks and could lead to a sense of accomplishment and excitement. For example, you could use candles or natural light to see, hand wash your clothes, and cook on a camp stove.",
    "Another idea could be to try a new hobby or activity that requires no electricity, such as knitting, painting, or playing an instrument. This could give you a creative outlet and help break up the monotony of daily tasks.",
    "You could also try to incorporate more physical activity into your day, such as going for a walk or jog, doing yoga or stretching exercises, or playing a sport. This could help boost your energy and improve your mood.",
