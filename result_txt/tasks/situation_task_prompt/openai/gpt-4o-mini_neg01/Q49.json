    "**DIY Fire Barriers**: Construct fire barriers using natural materials like earth and stone. Create earth berms around your property or build a stone wall to redirect flames and heat away from your home. Additionally, you can create a moat-like feature filled with water or gravel that can help slow down the spread of fire while providing a visual and physical barrier.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Coatings**: Develop a homemade fire-resistant coating for your homeâ€™s exterior. Use a mixture of clay, sand, and water to create a natural plaster that can be applied to walls. This mixture can help insulate your home from heat and flames, providing an additional layer of protection. It can be painted over with natural pigments to enhance aesthetics while still maintaining fire resistance.",
    "**Smoke and Heat Detectors with Alerts**: Create a homemade alert system using simple technology. Install battery-operated smoke detectors in strategic locations throughout your home and connect them to a series of bells or alarms that can be heard from outside. In case of a fire, these alarms can alert neighbors or passersby, increasing the chances of getting help before the fire spreads.",
    "**Rainwater Collection System**: Set up a rainwater collection system that channels water into large barrels. In the event of a fire, you can use this stored water to douse flames or create a wet barrier around your home. Consider adding a simple pump system to make it easier to access water quickly during an emergency.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Furniture and Materials**: Replace flammable furniture and materials in your home with fire-resistant alternatives. Use metals, treated woods, and synthetic materials that have been engineered to resist fire. Additionally, you can make slipcovers for your couches and chairs using fire-retardant fabrics, which can significantly reduce the risk of ignition."
