    "The first consequence of the world turning into a single city would be overpopulation. With everyone living in one place, there would be a significant increase in the number of people, which could lead to a strain on resources",
    "Another consequence would be the loss of individual cultures and traditions. With everyone living in the same place, there would be less diversity and homogeneity in terms of culture, language, and beliefs.",
    "The city would become highly dependent on technology and infrastructure, which could lead to a breakdown of systems if they were not properly maintained.",
    "The environment would also suffer, as the concentration of people and resources in one place would put a strain on natural resources",
    "The economy would become highly centralized, with a few large corporations controlling the majority of the wealth"
