    "Gravity would change: If the Earth stopped rotating, gravity would still be present, but it would be distributed differently. The force of gravity would be stronger at the poles and weaker at the equator. This would cause the water in the oceans to shift, with the water at the poles becoming denser and the water at the equator becoming lighter.",
    "Day and night would be disrupted: Without rotation, there would be no day or night. The sun would be overhead at all times, and there would be no need for artificial lighting.",
    "Weather patterns would change: The rotation of the Earth is responsible for the movement of air masses, which in turn affects weather patterns. Without rotation, weather patterns would be disrupted, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes could become more frequent.",
    "Seasons would disappear: The rotation of the Earth is responsible for the changing seasons. Without rotation, there would be no change in the angle of the Earth's axis to the sun, and seasons would disappear.",
    "Life on Earth would be affected: The rotation of the Earth is necessary for the survival of many species of plants and animals. Without rotation, the growth and reproduction of these species would be disrupted, and the ecosystem would be thrown off balance."
