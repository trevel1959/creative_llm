    "Gravity: Mars has only about one-third of the gravity of Earth, which could make movement and physical activities more challenging. For example, walking on Mars might feel like flying, and jumping would be much higher.",
    "Extreme Temperature: Mars has extreme temperature variations, ranging from -125°C to 20°C. This could make it difficult to maintain a comfortable living environment inside a habitat.",
    "Communication: The distance between Mars and Earth is about 225 million kilometers, which means that communication would be delayed by several minutes due to the speed of light. This could make real-time communication difficult.",
    "Limited Resources: Mars has no native resources, such as water, food, or shelter. This means that all resources would need to be transported from Earth, which would be expensive and logistically challenging.",
    "Psychological Effects: Living in such an isolated and alien environment could have psychological effects on individuals, such as stress, anxiety, and depression."
