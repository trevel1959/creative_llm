    "**Key Fob with Integrated Charging**: Design a key fob that has a built-in solar panel or kinetic energy charger. As the user carries the keys or parks the car in sunlight, the key fob charges itself, ensuring that the battery never runs out. This would eliminate the need for frequent battery replacements and make the key more eco-friendly.",
    "**Multi-Function Key Fob**: Transform the car key into a multi-functional device that includes features like a flashlight, a panic button, and a remote start function. This would not only simplify the number of devices a user carries but also enhance the usability of the key fob in various situations, such as finding your way in the dark or deterring potential threats.",
    "**Personalized Key Covers**: Offer customizable key covers that can be tailored to reflect the ownerâ€™s personality or interests. Users could choose colors, patterns, and even engrave their names or a favorite quote. This would make keys easily identifiable and add a personal touch to an otherwise mundane object.",
    "**Gesture Control Features**: Integrate gesture control technology into the key fob, allowing users to perform certain functions with simple hand movements. For example, waving the key fob could unlock the car, while a double wave could start the engine. This would add a layer of convenience and futuristic flair to everyday car usage.",
    "**Emergency SOS Functionality**: Equip the key fob with an emergency SOS feature that, when pressed for a certain duration, sends an alert to emergency contacts or services. This could be particularly useful in situations where the driver feels unsafe or needs assistance, providing peace of mind and added security."
