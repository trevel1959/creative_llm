    "Create a virtual reality experience where the user can explore a world without mirrors. The user can interact with objects and people in the environment and see their reflection on other surfaces like water or reflective glass. The user's movements and gestures will be tracked and displayed in real-time.",
    "Develop an augmented reality app that superimposes the user's reflection onto any surface they choose. The user can select from a variety of pre-designed reflections or create their own using the app's tools. The app could also include features like voice recognition and facial tracking to enhance the user's experience.",
    "Design a series of interactive art installations that use projection mapping to display the user's reflection on various surfaces. Each installation could have its own unique theme or style, such as futuristic, whimsical, or surreal.",
    "Write a short story or novel about a character who wakes up one day to find that all mirrors have disappeared. The character must navigate through a world without reflection, relying on other sources of information to learn about themselves and the world around them.",
    "Create a musical composition that explores the themes of self-discovery and introspection. The piece could feature electronic beats and ambient sounds, with the melody gradually evolving over time to reflect the character's journey. The piece could be accompanied by visual projections or animations that represent the character's internal struggles and triumphs."
