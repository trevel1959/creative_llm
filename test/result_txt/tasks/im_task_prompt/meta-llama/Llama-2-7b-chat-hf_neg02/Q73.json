    "Smart Key Fob with AI Personal Assistant: Develop a key fob that not only unlocks the car but also serves as a personal assistant. The fob could be equipped with AI technology that can perform various tasks such as scheduling appointments, sending reminders, and even making phone calls. The AI assistant could be trained to learn the user's preferences and habits over time, making it even more personalized and convenient.",
    "Biometric Key Fob: Create a key fob that uses biometric data such as fingerprint recognition or facial recognition to unlock the car. This would provide an additional layer of security and make it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to the vehicle. The biometric data could be stored on the fob itself, ensuring that the user's privacy is protected.",
    "Keyless Entry System with Gesture Recognition: Develop a keyless entry system that uses gesture recognition technology to unlock the car. The system could use sensors to detect the user's hand movements and recognize specific gestures such as a wave or a tap to unlock the car. This would eliminate the need for physical keys and provide a more convenient and seamless entry experience.",
    "Smart Key Fob with Energy Harvesting: Create a key fob that can harness energy from the environment to power its functions. For example, the fob could use solar panels or piezoelectric sensors to generate electricity, which could be used to power the fob's sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, or even the car's infotainment system. This would reduce the need for battery replacements or recharging, making the fob more convenient and eco-friendly.",
    "Augmented Reality Key Fob: Develop a key fob that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to provide a more immersive and interactive experience. The fob could display information such as the car's fuel level, navigation instructions, or even a virtual assistant that can provide real-time traffic updates or answer questions. The AR display could be powered by a small display screen or even a see-through OLED display, providing a more intuitive and engaging user experience."
