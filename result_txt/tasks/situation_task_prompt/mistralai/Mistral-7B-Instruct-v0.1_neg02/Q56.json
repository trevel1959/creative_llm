    "Invent a new technology that allows us to see our reflection without the use of mirrors. This could be a device that captures an image of our surroundings and uses computer vision to identify and display our reflection in real-time.",
    "Use augmented reality to create a virtual mirror that can be viewed on any surface. This would allow us to see our reflection as if we were looking into a mirror, but without the need for physical mirrors.",
    "Develop a system that uses infrared technology to capture an image of our reflection. This could be done by placing an infrared camera in front of us and then displaying the image on a screen.",
    "Use a 3D printer to create a custom mirror that is designed to fit the shape of our face. This would allow us to see our reflection as if we were looking into a mirror, but with a more personalized and unique experience.",
    "Create a mobile app that uses the camera on our smartphone to capture an image of our reflection. This app could then use machine learning algorithms to analyze the image and provide insights and suggestions based on our reflection, such as makeup tips or fashion advice."
