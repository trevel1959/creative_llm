    "**Aurora**: A spaceship that transforms into a living, breathing entity. The hull is covered in bioluminescent panels that can change color and pattern to communicate with other spaceships or with the environment. The ship's propulsion system is based on a network of thin, glowing tendrils that can stretch and retract to navigate through space. When not in use, the ship can retract into a compact, spherical shape, allowing it to hide in the darkness of space.",
    "**Echoes**: A spaceship that exists in multiple timelines simultaneously. The ship's hull is made up of a lattice structure that can shift and change to reflect different versions of reality. The crew can travel through different timelines by shifting the lattice structure, allowing them to gather knowledge and resources from parallel universes. However, this comes at a cost, as each shift creates a new timeline, and the crew must navigate the consequences of their actions across multiple realities.",
    "**Nexus**: A spaceship that serves as a hub for intergalactic communication and trade. The ship's hull is a vast, hollow sphere that can be expanded and contracted to accommodate different types of cargo and passengers. The interior is filled with a network of transparent tubes and walkways that allow for easy navigation. The ship's propulsion system is based on a series of high-speed wormholes that can connect distant star systems, making it a key hub for intergalactic commerce and diplomacy.",
    "**Luminari**: A spaceship that uses a unique form of propulsion based on the manipulation of light and energy. The ship's hull is made up of a series of glowing, crystalline structures that can absorb and redirect energy from the surrounding environment. The crew can use this energy to propel the ship at incredible speeds, making it a key asset for exploration and defense. However, the ship's energy signature is highly visible, making it a target for hostile forces.",
    "**Oasis**: A spaceship that serves as a self-sustaining ecosystem, capable of supporting a diverse array of plant and animal life. The ship's hull is covered in a lush, green landscape that can be modified to accommodate different environments and climates. The ship's propulsion system is based on a network of underground tunnels and pipes that can harness energy from the surrounding environment, making it a key asset for long-term exploration and settlement. However, the ship's ecosystem is highly dependent on the surrounding environment, making it vulnerable to changes in the local ecosystem. [/INST] Assistant: These ideas are just a"
