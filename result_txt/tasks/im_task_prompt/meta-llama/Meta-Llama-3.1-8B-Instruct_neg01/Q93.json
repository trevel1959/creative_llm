    "\"Glow-in-the-Dark Bowling\": Imagine a bowling alley where the lanes, balls, and pins are all infused with glow-in-the-dark technology. As players take their turns, the lanes and surroundings light up, creating an immersive and futuristic experience. The glow-in-the-dark elements would also allow for unique special effects, such as glowing strike zones or neon-lit pins that change color when hit.",
    "\"Virtual Reality Bowling\": In this concept, players wear VR headsets and controllers to experience a fully immersive bowling experience. The VR environment would simulate a virtual bowling alley, complete with realistic sound effects, graphics, and even the sensation of throwing a ball. Players could compete against virtual opponents or participate in special VR-only challenges, such as bowling through a virtual storm or navigating a winding, obstacle-filled lane.",
    "\"Retro-Futuristic Bowling\": This idea combines vintage and futuristic elements to create a unique and eye-catching bowling experience. The bowling alley would feature retro-futuristic decor, complete with neon lights, vintage arcade games, and a futuristic twist on classic bowling equipment. Players could choose from a variety of retro-futuristic bowling balls, each with its own unique design and abilities, such as a ball that shoots laser beams or one that leaves a trail of sparks behind it.",
    "\"Glow-in-the-Dark Mini Golf\": This concept takes the glow-in-the-dark idea from the first concept and applies it to a mini golf course. Players would navigate through a darkened course, using glow-in-the-dark obstacles, balls, and putters to guide them through the challenging holes. The course would feature unique glow-in-the-dark elements, such as glowing tunnels, neon-lit water hazards, and even a glow-in-the-dark windmill.",
    "\"Augmented Reality Bowling\": In this concept, players use AR technology to enhance their bowling experience. The AR system would project virtual bowling balls, pins, and even opponents onto the real-world bowling lane, creating a hybrid experience that combines the physical and digital worlds. Players could use AR-powered bowling balls that change color, shape, or size depending on their performance, and even participate in AR-only challenges, such as bowling through a virtual storm or navigating a virtual obstacle course.
