    "**Mood-Responsive Display**: Equip televisions with sensors that detect the viewer's mood through facial recognition and biometric feedback. The TV would then adjust the content accordingly, suggesting feel-good movies when someone appears down or thrilling action films during moments of excitement. This personalization would enhance the emotional connection to the content and make the viewing experience more engaging.",
    "**360-Degree Viewing Experience**: Develop a television that can display 360-degree content, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the scene. This could be achieved through a combination of curved screens and advanced projection technology. Users could navigate through the environment using a handheld controller or voice commands, making it ideal for watching nature documentaries, concerts, or immersive storytelling.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Incorporate health monitoring features into the television, such as heart rate and stress level tracking. The TV could suggest breaks or relaxation techniques based on the viewer's physiological state, promoting a healthier viewing experience. Additionally, it could recommend content that aligns with the viewer's health goals, such as yoga sessions or cooking shows focused on nutrition.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Innovate a television that is fully sustainable, made from recycled materials and designed for easy disassembly. This television would use energy-efficient technologies and come with a subscription model for upgrades, allowing users to send back their old parts for recycling. This initiative would not only reduce electronic waste but also promote environmental awareness among consumers.",
    "**Social Viewing Mode**: Create a television with built-in social features that allow viewers to connect with friends and family while watching shows together, regardless of their physical location. This could include synchronized viewing options, live chat, and video call capabilities on the screen. It would be perfect for long-distance relationships or family gatherings, enhancing the communal aspect of watching TV."
