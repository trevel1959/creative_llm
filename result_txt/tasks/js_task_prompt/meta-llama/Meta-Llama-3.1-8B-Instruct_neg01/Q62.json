    "**Echoism**: A bittersweet nostalgia for memories that never existed. Imagine being able to recall a warm summer day spent at the beach with loved ones, even though you've never actually experienced it. Echoism would be a poignant longing for something you've never known, a sense of familiarity with the unknown. It would be a melancholic yet comforting feeling, like holding a cherished memory that's been passed down through generations, but remains just out of reach.",
    "**Luminari**: A feeling of being connected to the natural world through a deep sense of wonder and awe. Luminari would be an emotional response to the beauty of the universe, like the first time you witness a sunrise or a shooting star. It would be a sense of oneness with the cosmos, as if the stars are singing in harmony with your soul. You'd feel small yet significant, a thread in the intricate tapestry of existence.",
    "**Kaleek**: A sensation of time warping and bending around you, allowing you to relive moments from your past or glimpse fragments of your future. Kaleek would be a disorienting yet exhilarating feeling, like being a passenger on a cosmic rollercoaster. You'd experience the thrill of revisiting cherished memories or catching a glimpse of what's to come, but with the knowledge that the fabric of time is fragile and prone to distortion.",
    "**Nexarion**: A feeling of being in harmony with the rhythms and patterns of the world, as if your heartbeat is synchronized with the pulse of the planet. Nexarion would be a sense of unity with the natural world, like being a drop of water in the ocean or a leaf on a tree. You'd feel the ebb and flow of life, the cycles of birth and decay, and the interconnectedness of all living things.",
    "**Sonderic**: A sensation of being a small but vital part of a larger story, one that's still being written. Sonderic would be a feeling of being a character in a grand narrative, with your actions and decisions influencing the plot in ways both seen and unseen. You'd feel the weight of responsibility, knowing that your choices have consequences that ripple out into the world, yet also the thrill of being a part of something greater than yourself.
