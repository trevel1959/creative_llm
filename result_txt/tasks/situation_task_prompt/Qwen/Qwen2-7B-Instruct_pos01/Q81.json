    "**Unique DNA Sample**: Create a system where each person can provide a unique DNA sample for verification. This could be collected from a simple cheek swab and stored in a secure database. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) because it's based on a scientific fact - everyone has unique DNA. However, it requires significant infrastructure to store and manage the data securely.",
    "**Retina or Iris Scanning**: Utilize advanced biometric technology to scan an individualâ€™s retina or iris pattern. This method offers a high level of uniqueness and difficulty to replicate (confidence score 0.85). It's widely used today but needs to overcome privacy concerns and technical limitations.",
    "**Voice Recognition**: Develop a robust voice recognition system that can accurately identify someone's voice. This could involve recording a phrase or sound specific to the individual during registration (confidence score 0.75). Voice recognition is effective but can be compromised by factors like accents, illnesses, or similar-sounding voices.",
    "**Finger Vein Pattern**: Implement a finger vein scanning system, which captures the unique patterns inside a person's fingers. This is less common but offers high accuracy (confidence score 0.8). It requires specialized scanners that might not be as readily available or affordable as other biometric systems.",
    "**Behavioral Biometrics**: Analyze a person's unique behavioral patterns such as typing speed, keystroke dynamics, or gait analysis. This could involve collecting data over time and comparing it to established norms (confidence score 0.7). Behavioral biometrics is a newer field and faces challenges with data collection and privacy issues."
