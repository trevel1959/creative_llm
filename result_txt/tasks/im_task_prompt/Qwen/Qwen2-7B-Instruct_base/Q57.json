    "**Ergonomic Design for Improved User Comfort**: Create a computer mouse that adapts to the user's grip and posture. It could be designed with sensors to track hand movements and adjust its shape in real-time to provide optimal comfort and support. The mouse could also use haptic feedback to alert users when they are gripping too tightly or sitting in an uncomfortable position for extended periods.",
    "**Voice-Controlled Computer Mouse**: Develop a mouse that can be controlled using voice commands. This would be particularly useful for individuals with limited mobility or disabilities. The device could have integrated AI that understands specific commands (e.g., \"scroll up\", \"click\") and executes them without the need for physical movement. This innovation could significantly enhance accessibility in the tech industry.",
    "**Smart Mouse with Built-in Screen Magnifier**: Introduce a mouse that includes a built-in screen magnifier, making it ideal for people with visual impairments. The mouse would project a magnified view of the cursor on the screen, allowing users to navigate more easily. Additionally, it could incorporate audio feedback that describes the on-screen actions and objects, providing a fully accessible browsing experience.",
    "**Wireless Charging Mouse Pad**: Create a computer mouse pad that not only provides a surface for the mouse to glide smoothly but also charges the mouse wirelessly. This innovative mouse pad would feature an internal battery and a charging station, ensuring that the mouse remains powered while the user works. It could also include features like wireless charging for other devices, such as smartphones or tablets, enhancing its utility.",
    "**Interactive Artistic Mouse**: Design a computer mouse that allows users to create digital art directly from their movements. By integrating advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms, the mouse could interpret hand gestures and translate them into stylized brush strokes or animations within various digital art applications. This would appeal to artists and creative professionals looking for a more expressive and intuitive way to work with digital media."
