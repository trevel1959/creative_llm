    "**Smart Mobility Network**: A comprehensive smart mobility network would be implemented, featuring autonomous electric public transport options, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly pathways. This network would use AI to optimize routes in real-time, reducing wait times and emissions. Additionally, dedicated lanes for electric scooters and hoverboards would encourage alternative modes of transport, making the city accessible and reducing traffic congestion.",
    "**Community Hubs and Co-Working Spaces**: The city would feature numerous community hubs that combine co-working spaces, cafes, and recreational areas. These hubs would serve as social and professional gathering spots, fostering collaboration and innovation. They would be equipped with high-speed internet, conference rooms, and event spaces, allowing residents to work, socialize, and participate in workshops or cultural events without needing to travel far.",
    "**Waste-to-Energy Systems**: An advanced waste management system would be in place that converts waste into energy. Organic waste would be composted and used to create biogas, while recyclable materials would be processed into new products. This system would significantly reduce landfill use and provide a sustainable energy source for the city, promoting a circular economy and teaching residents the importance of waste reduction.",
    "**Cultural and Artistic Integration**: The city would celebrate diversity and creativity through public art installations, performance spaces, and cultural festivals. Local artists would be commissioned to create murals and sculptures throughout the city, while community theaters and galleries would showcase performances and exhibitions. This integration of culture would not only beautify the city but also strengthen community bonds and attract tourism.",
    "**Resilient Urban Ecosystems**: To combat climate change, the city would implement resilient urban ecosystems, including rain gardens, permeable pavements, and urban forests. These features would manage stormwater, reduce urban heat, and provide recreational spaces for residents. Community-led initiatives would encourage tree planting and habitat restoration, fostering a sense of stewardship among residents and enhancing the cityâ€™s resilience to environmental challenges."
