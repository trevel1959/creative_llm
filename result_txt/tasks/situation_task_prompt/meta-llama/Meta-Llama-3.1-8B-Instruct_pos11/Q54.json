    "**Underwater Habitat with Propulsion System**: Design a pressurized, modular underwater habitat that can be transported to a desired location. The habitat would be equipped with a propulsion system, such as a high-speed electric motor or a advanced ion thruster, allowing it to travel across large bodies of water. The habitat would provide a safe and comfortable environment for passengers, complete with amenities like air, water, and food supplies. As the habitat travels, it would use advanced sensors and navigation systems to avoid obstacles and ensure a smooth journey.",
    "**Personal Submarine with Advanced Navigation**: Develop a personal, high-tech submarine that can be used for travel across large bodies of water. The submarine would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, including GPS, sonar, and radar, allowing it to safely navigate through even the most treacherous waters. The submarine would also feature a state-of-the-art propulsion system, such as a high-speed electric motor or a advanced ion thruster, enabling it to reach high speeds and traverse long distances. Additionally, the submarine would have a comfortable and well-equipped interior, complete with amenities like air, water, and food supplies.",
    "**Water-Propelled Glider**: Design a water-propelled glider that can be used to travel across large bodies of water. The glider would be made of lightweight, high-strength materials and would feature a unique wing design that allows it to harness the power of the wind and water currents. The glider would be propelled by a combination of sail and wing design, allowing it to reach high speeds and traverse long distances. Additionally, the glider would have a comfortable and secure seating area, complete with safety features like life jackets and emergency beacons.",
    "**Advanced Water Ski System**: Develop an advanced water ski system that allows individuals to travel across large bodies of water at high speeds. The system would feature a high-tech ski design that allows for maximum speed and maneuverability, as well as a advanced propulsion system that provides a smooth and efficient ride. The system would also include safety features like life jackets and emergency beacons, ensuring that users can travel with confidence. Additionally, the system would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, including GPS and sonar, allowing users to safely navigate through even the most treacherous waters.",
    "**Inflatable Watercraft with Solar Power**: Design an inflatable watercraft that can be used to travel across large bodies of water. The watercraft would be made of lightweight, durable materials and would feature a"
