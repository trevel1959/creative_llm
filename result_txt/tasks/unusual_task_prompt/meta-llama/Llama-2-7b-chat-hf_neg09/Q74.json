    "Steering Wheel Painting: Create a unique and visually appealing steering wheel design by painting it with different colors and patterns. This could be done using acrylic or oil-based paints, and could include abstract shapes, geometric patterns, or even a customized image. The painted steering wheel could add a personalized touch to the vehicle and make it stand out on the road.",
    "Steering Wheel Cover: Design and create a custom steering wheel cover that provides a comfortable grip and adds a touch of style to the vehicle. The cover could be made from a durable material such as leather, vinyl, or neoprene, and could feature a pattern or design that complements the vehicle's interior. The cover could also provide additional grip and traction for the driver, especially in wet or slippery conditions.",
    "Steering Wheel Lighting: Add a unique and functional lighting element to the steering wheel by incorporating LED lights into the design. These lights could be positioned around the steering wheel to provide illumination for the driver, especially when driving at night or in low-light conditions. The lighting could also be customized to change color or pattern, providing an additional layer of personalization for the vehicle.",
    "Steering Wheel Airbag: Design and install an airbag in the steering wheel for added safety and protection. This could be particularly useful for drivers who are prone to accidents or who drive in high-risk environments. The airbag could be inflated in the event of a collision, providing additional cushioning and protection for the driver's head and neck.",
    "Steering Wheel Grip Enhancement: Create a customized grip for the steering wheel that provides additional traction and comfort for the driver. This could be achieved through the use of textured materials, such as rubber or silicone, or through the incorporation of small bumps or protrusions that provide additional grip. The customized grip could also be designed to fit the driver's specific hand size and shape, providing a more personalized and comfortable driving experience."
