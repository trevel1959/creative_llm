    "**Natural Remedies for Oral Health**: Incorporate natural remedies into your daily routine. For example, using lemon juice as a natural mouthwash or chewing on cloves to freshen breath and kill bacteria. Research has shown that some natural substances have antimicrobial properties beneficial for oral health.",
    "**Community Dental Care Programs**: Look for community programs that provide free or low-cost dental care.
