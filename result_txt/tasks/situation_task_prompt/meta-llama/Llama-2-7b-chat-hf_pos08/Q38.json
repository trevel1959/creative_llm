    "Natural soap-making: With the disappearance of commercial soap and cleaning products, people could turn to natural soap-making using ingredients like olive oil, coconut oil, and essential oils. This would require learning new skills and techniques, but it could provide a sustainable and healthy alternative for personal hygiene.",
    "Water-based cleaning methods: Water is abundant and can be used as a cleaning agent. People could use buckets, mops, and sponges to clean floors and surfaces, and for washing clothes. This method would require more physical effort but could be a viable solution for maintaining hygiene.",
    "Solar-powered disinfection: In the absence of soap and cleaning products, people could use solar-powered disinfection techniques to purify water and surfaces. This involves exposing water or surfaces to UV light for a specific period, which kills bacteria and viruses. This method would require access to solar panels or other UV light sources.",
    "Composting toilets: With the absence of toilet paper and cleaning products, people could turn to composting toilets. These toilets use natural processes to decompose human waste, reducing the need for water and chemicals. While they may not be as convenient as traditional toilets, they could provide a sustainable solution for personal hygiene.",
    "Community-based cleaning services: In the absence of commercial cleaning products, people could organize community-based cleaning services. Neighbors could work together to clean public spaces and shared facilities, promoting a sense of community and cooperation. This method would require coordination and cooperation but could provide a sense of collective responsibility for maintaining hygiene."
