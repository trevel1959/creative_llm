    "**Flavor Infuser**: Design a compartment within the toaster that allows users to add their favorite oils, spices, or herbs. As the sandwich toasts, the infuser would release these flavors into the sandwich, creating a unique taste experience. This could be especially appealing for gourmet sandwiches or for those looking to experiment with new flavors.",
    "**Dual-Compartment Design**: Create a toaster with two separate compartments that can toast two different sandwiches at once, each with its own temperature and time settings. This would allow users to prepare multiple sandwiches simultaneously, catering to different tastes and preferences, such as one vegetarian and one meat-based sandwich.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Guide**: Incorporate a digital recipe guide that suggests various sandwich combinations based on the ingredients users have on hand. Users could input their available ingredients, and the toaster would suggest the best sandwich recipes, including optimal toasting times and temperatures. This feature could be paired with a companion app for easy access.",
    "**Reversible Grilling Plates**: Introduce reversible grilling plates that can be swapped out depending on the desired texture. One side could be smooth for traditional sandwiches, while the other could have ridges for grilling paninis or creating a pressed sandwich effect. This versatility would enhance the user's culinary options and experiences.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Function**: Implement a self-cleaning mechanism that uses steam to clean the interior of the toaster after use. Users could activate this feature with the push of a button, ensuring that crumbs and grease are easily removed without the need for manual cleaning. This would make maintenance effortless and keep the appliance in pristine condition."
