    "**Augmented Reality Display**: Introduce an augmented reality (AR) feature where users can point their smartphone or AR glasses at physical objects to perform calculations. For example, pointing at a grocery item could display its price, and the calculator could compute total costs or discounts in real-time. This would create an interactive shopping experience and aid in budgeting.",
    "**Customizable User Interface**: Allow users to customize the calculatorâ€™s interface to suit their preferences. Users could choose different themes, layouts, and button sizes. For example, students might prefer a layout that emphasizes scientific functions, while professionals might want a more streamlined interface for financial calculations. This personalization would enhance user engagement and efficiency.",
    "**Integrated Learning Mode**: Create a learning mode that helps users understand the math behind the calculations. For example, when a user inputs a complex equation, the calculator could provide step-by-step solutions and explanations. This feature would be especially beneficial for students learning math concepts, helping them to develop problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of the subject.",
    "**Gamification Features**: Incorporate gamification elements to make calculations more engaging. Users could earn points for completing calculations correctly, unlocking achievements for mastering certain math concepts, or competing with friends in calculation challenges. This would motivate users to practice their math skills while having fun, appealing particularly to younger audiences.",
    "**Multi-Device Synchronization**: Enable the calculator to sync across multiple devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers. Users could start a calculation on one device and continue it on another seamlessly. Additionally, they could save frequently used formulas or calculations in the cloud, allowing for easy access and collaboration with others, such as sharing calculations with classmates or colleagues."
