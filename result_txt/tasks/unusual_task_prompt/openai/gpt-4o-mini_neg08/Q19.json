    "**Scented Drawer Freshener**: Instead of buying commercial drawer fresheners, you can place a small, unused candle in your dresser or closet. As the candle warms from the ambient temperature, it will release a subtle fragrance, keeping your clothes smelling fresh. This is a great way to repurpose old candles that may not be suitable for burning anymore.",
    "**Temporary Picture Hanger**: If you need to hang a picture but don't want to put holes in your walls, melt a small amount of wax from a candle and use it to stick the picture frame to the wall temporarily. Once the wax cools and hardens, it will hold the frame in place. This method works best for lightweight frames and is ideal for renters or those who frequently change their decor.",
    "**DIY Lip Balm**: Candles made from natural waxes like beeswax can be repurposed into homemade lip balm. Melt down the candle, mix it with a bit of coconut oil and essential oils, and pour it into small containers. Once it cools, youâ€™ll have a moisturizing lip balm that is perfect for dry, chapped lips, all while giving new life to an old candle.",
    "**Wax Seals for Letters**: Candles can be used to create beautiful, personalized wax seals for letters or invitations. Simply melt the candle and drip the wax onto the envelope flap, then press a seal stamp into the warm wax before it hardens. This adds a touch of elegance and a vintage feel to your correspondence, making it more memorable.",
    "**Emergency Lubricant**: If you have a stuck zipper or squeaky door hinges, rubbing a candle on the affected area can serve as a quick fix. The wax acts as a lubricant, allowing the zipper to glide smoothly or the door to open quietly. This is a handy trick to keep in mind for those minor household inconveniences."
