    "**Innovative Cooking Utensil**: Design a spatula that doubles as a measuring tool. The handle could be equipped with a series of embedded units (e.g., milliliters, cups) which can slide out to measure ingredients directly. This would be particularly useful for those who are always in need of precise measurements but struggle with remembering them or having multiple tools in the kitchen.",
    "**Multi-functional Spatula**: Create a spatula that can transform into different kitchen tools. For instance, when unfolded, it could function as a ladle, while folded it serves as a spatula. This idea is ideal for individuals who prefer compact tools or have limited storage space.",
    "**Sustainable Spatula**: Develop a spatula made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo or recycled plastics. The design could also incorporate a mechanism that allows for easy disassembly, making it easier to clean and recycle parts. This is a creative solution for environmentally conscious cooks.",
    "**Interactive Spatula App**: Combine a digital app with a physical spatula to provide cooking guidance and recipes. The spatula could have sensors that detect what's being cooked and suggest appropriate recipes or cooking times based on the food type. Users can also receive notifications about when their dish is ready or if they need to adjust the heat.",
    "**Spa-spatula**: Introduce a line of spatulas specifically designed for use in beauty treatments such as facial masks or hair styling. These spatulas could be made of soft, non-porous materials to prevent irritation and bacteria buildup. They might also feature unique shapes to better apply or remove products in specific areas of the face or scalp. "
