    "**Inflatable Neck Support**: Design a small, inflatable neck support that can be adjusted to the desired firmness. This device would wrap around the neck, providing support for the head while sleeping on your side or back.

It could be compact enough to fit in a travel bag, making it a perfect solution for those on the go.",
    "**Cocoon Sleep Mask**: This innovative sleep mask would not only block out light but also feature a built-in, cushioned area that cradles the head. The mask would be filled with soft gel or foam, allowing it to mold to the contours of the head while providing gentle support. It would also include adjustable straps to keep it securely in place, offering a unique blend of comfort and darkness for a restful nightâ€™s sleep.",
    "**Neck Hammock**: A lightweight, portable neck hammock could be hung from a door frame or a sturdy beam. This device would gently cradle the head and neck while allowing the body to relax in a semi-reclined position. The hammock would be made from breathable materials and designed to evenly distribute weight, preventing any strain on the neck. This would be especially useful for power naps or while traveling.",
    "**The Gravity Blanket Pillow**: Inspired by weighted blankets, this concept involves a specially designed blanket that has pockets filled with soft, lightweight beads. Users can fold or scrunch the blanket to create a custom headrest that provides gentle pressure and support. The weight of the blanket would create a calming effect, making it easier to fall asleep while also providing the necessary support for the head.",
    "**Memory Foam Neck Wrap**: A wrap that can be worn around the neck, filled with memory foam that molds to the user's shape. This wrap would provide gentle support to the head while lying down, reducing strain on the neck. It could have adjustable Velcro straps for a snug fit and be covered in soft fabric for comfort. This solution would be particularly beneficial for side sleepers who need extra neck support."
