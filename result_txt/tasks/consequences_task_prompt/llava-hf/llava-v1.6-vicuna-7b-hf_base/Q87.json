    "Habitat disruption: Cloning extinct animals could potentially disrupt the ecological balance in their natural habitats. For example, if an extinct species were cloned and reintroduced, it might alter the population dynamics of other species that rely on that ecosystem.",
    "Ecological imbalance: Cloning extinct animals could lead to an ecological imbalance if the reintroduced species have traits that are not compatible with their original habitat. This could result in the displacement of native species and disruption of the food chain.",
    "Potential for disease transmission: Cloning extinct animals could also pose a risk of disease transmission to the ecosystem. If the cloned animals carry genetic traits that make them susceptible to diseases, they could introduce those diseases into the ecosystem, potentially harming other species.",
    "Conservation concerns: Cloning extinct animals could potentially divert resources and attention away from conserving endangered species that still exist in the wild. It may also create false hope that extinct species can be brought back, leading to a lack of focus on preserving the remaining species.",
    "Public safety concerns: Cloning extinct animals could potentially pose a threat to public safety if the cloned animals are not properly monitored and managed. For example, if a cloned predator species were released into the wild, it could pose a threat to human safety."
