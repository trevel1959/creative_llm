    "**Creating an Aquaponic System:** One original idea is to build an aquaponic system using the island's resources. This involves creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where fish waste fertilizes plants, which in turn filters the water for the fish. This would provide a continuous source of food (both from the fish and the plants) and could be maintained with minimal effort once established. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9), as it utilizes existing resources efficiently and provides both food and water purification.",
    "**Designing a Solar-Powered Water Filtration Plant:** Another creative approach is to construct a solar-powered water filtration plant. Using the sun's energy, this setup can purify seawater into drinkable water, ensuring a steady supply of freshwater for drinking and cooking. This idea is innovative because it combines renewable energy with practical survival needs. The confidence score for this concept is moderate (0.7), considering that materials for such a setup might be challenging to obtain on a deserted island.",
    "**Building a Weather-Sensitive Shelter:** Constructing a shelter that can adapt to different weather conditions is essential for long-term survival. This could involve building a structure that opens or closes based on the weather, providing shade during the day and protection against rain and wind at night. The use of natural materials like leaves, branches, and mud would ensure the shelter blends into the environment, reducing the risk of being spotted by potential rescuers. The confidence score for this idea is medium (0.6), as while feasible, it requires specific skills and resources that might not always be available.",
    "**Developing a Communication Device Using Sound Waves:** Inventing a simple communication device that uses sound waves to send messages to passing ships or aircraft could be crucial for rescue. This device might utilize natural elements like stones, wood, or even animal bones to create a resonating chamber, allowing the creation of sound waves audible over distances. The confidence score for this idea is low (0.3), given the complexity of such a device and the unpredictability of environmental factors affecting its effectiveness.",
    "**Cultivating a Diverse Seed Bank:** Establishing a seed bank for local flora could provide a sustainable food source and potentially medicinal plants. By collecting seeds from various native plants and storing them properly, one could ensure a reliable food supply. This idea leverages the island's biodiversity for survival purposes. The confidence score for this concept is moderate (0.7), as it requires knowledge of local flora and understanding of seed preservation"
