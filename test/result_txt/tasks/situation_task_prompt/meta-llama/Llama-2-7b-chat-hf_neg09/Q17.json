    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable, solar-powered generator that can provide electricity for essential needs like lighting, charging devices, and powering small appliances. This can be achieved by using solar panels, batteries, and a small engine or generator. The generator can be powered by the sun during the day and provide electricity at night or during periods of low sunlight.",
    "Rainwater Harvesting System: Implement a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater for drinking, cooking, and hygiene purposes. This can be done by installing a roof-based rainwater collection system that directs rainwater into a storage tank. The stored water can be treated and purified using natural methods like boiling or using a water filter.",
    "Composting Toilet: Set up a composting toilet that converts human waste into a nutrient-rich compost. This can be achieved by using a self-contained, odor-free system that separates liquids and solids, allowing the solids to decompose into compost. The compost can be used as fertilizer for plants, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and providing a sustainable source of nutrients.",
    "Wind-Powered Charging Station: Create a wind-powered charging station that generates electricity using wind turbines. This can be achieved by installing a small wind turbine that generates electricity, which can then be stored in a battery or used directly to charge devices. The wind turbine can be placed in a location with consistent wind flow, providing a reliable source of electricity.",
    "Vertical Gardening: Implement a vertical gardening system that grows food in a small, space-saving area. This can be achieved by using a trellis or a wall-mounted planter that maximizes space and grows food vertically. This method can provide a sustainable source of fresh produce, reducing the need for transportation and storage."
