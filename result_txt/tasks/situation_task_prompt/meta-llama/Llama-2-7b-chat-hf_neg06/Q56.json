    "Use a reflective surface: If all mirrors vanished, you could use a reflective surface like a shiny piece of metal, a polished stone, or even a well-polished piece of wood to see your reflection. For example, you could hold up a silver dollar and gaze into its reflective surface to see your face.",
    "Look in a body of water: Water has a natural tendency to reflect light and images, so you could try looking into a body of water like a lake, river, or even a bowl of water to see your reflection. The ripples on the surface of the water would create a distorted image, but you could still make out your features.",
    "Use a two-way mirror: A two-way mirror, also known as a one-way mirror or a blind mirror, is a special type of glass that allows light to pass through in one direction but not the other. You could use a two-way mirror to see your reflection by standing in front of it and looking through it into a room where there is a light source. The light will pass through the mirror and create an image of you on the other side.",
    "Look in a funhouse mirror: A funhouse mirror is a type of mirror that distorts images, making them appear larger or smaller than they really are. You could find a funhouse mirror at an amusement park or carnival, or you could create your own by tilting a regular mirror at an angle. Stand in front of the funhouse mirror and look at your reflection to see a distorted image of yourself.",
    "Use a virtual mirror app: In today's digital age, there are many apps available that allow you to take a photo of yourself and see your reflection in a virtual mirror. These apps use augmented reality technology to superimpose a virtual mirror image of yourself onto your real-life surroundings. You can find these apps by searching for \"virtual mirror\" or \"augmented reality mirror\" in your app store."
