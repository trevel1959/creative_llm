    "**Exoskeleton Mobility Device**: A wearable exoskeleton designed specifically for individuals who cannot stand would allow for enhanced mobility. This device would be equipped with robotic limbs that mimic natural walking motions, allowing the user to move around by using a combination of arm movements and body shifts. The exoskeleton could be programmed for different terrains and environments, adapting to the user's needs, whether indoors or outdoors. Additionally, it could have a feature that allows the user to transition smoothly from sitting to standing positions for social interactions.",
    "**Mobile Pod Chair**: A futuristic pod-like chair that incorporates smart technology and autonomous movement. This chair would have wheels and sensors that detect obstacles, allowing it to navigate through various environments without manual control. Users could program destinations via a touchscreen interface or voice commands, and the chair would take them there safely. It could also include features like a built-in refrigerator for snacks, a charging station for devices, and a recline function for relaxation.",
    "**Robotic Companion Drone**: A small, hovering drone designed to assist individuals with mobility challenges. This drone would be equipped with a platform that can carry the userâ€™s belongings and can even provide a seat for short distances. Users could control the drone through a smartphone app or voice commands, allowing it to transport them from one place to another. The drone could also be programmed to recognize and avoid obstacles, making it a safe and efficient mobility aid.",
    "**Sliding Mat System**: A series of specialized mats that can be placed around a home or workspace, allowing users to slide from one area to another. These mats would have a smooth, low-friction surface and could be designed with built-in tracks to guide movement. Users could use their arms to push off from one mat to another, making it easy to navigate through their environment. The mats could also be equipped with sensors to alert caregivers if assistance is needed.",
    "**Interactive Floor Tiles**: A system of smart floor tiles that respond to the user's movements. These tiles would have pressure sensors and touch technology that could detect where the user is and guide them to their desired location through lights and sounds. For instance, if a user wanted to move to the kitchen, stepping on the corresponding tile would illuminate a path leading to it. The tiles could also be programmed to create games or challenges, encouraging movement and engagement."
