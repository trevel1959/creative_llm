    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: Design a bicycle helmet that is equipped with solar panels on its exterior. These panels can be used to charge devices such as smartphones, GPS devices, or even small lights for night-time visibility. The helmet could also have built-in charging ports to make it easy to connect and charge various devices. This idea addresses the issue of safety by ensuring riders are visible and connected while also promoting sustainable energy use.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation**: Create a helmet that integrates AR technology to provide real-time navigation directly into the rider's field of vision. The helmet would project a map onto the userâ€™s visor, showing the route, speed, and estimated time of arrival. It could also highlight potential hazards, such as potholes or pedestrians, enhancing safety. The helmet could be paired with an app on the rider's phone for customization and updates.",
    "**Emergency Alert System**: Develop a helmet that includes an integrated emergency alert system. The helmet would have sensors that detect if the rider has fallen or is in danger, and automatically sends a distress signal to pre-registered contacts, along with the rider's location. This feature can provide quick assistance during accidents or when the rider is unable to respond, ensuring immediate help is on the way.",
    "**Hybrid Cooling System**: Design a helmet that combines traditional ventilation with modern cooling technologies. For example, it could incorporate a small fan system and liquid cooling channels within the helmet liner to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the helmet. This hybrid approach would keep the rider cool during hot rides and prevent heat-related injuries.",
    "**Personalized Comfort and Fit System**: Create a helmet that uses advanced sensors to monitor the rider's head shape and adjust the helmet's fit in real-time. By using a combination of pressure sensors and machine learning algorithms, the helmet can optimize comfort and reduce the risk of injury caused by a poor fit. This feature would enhance safety by ensuring the helmet provides the best possible protection for each individual rider."
