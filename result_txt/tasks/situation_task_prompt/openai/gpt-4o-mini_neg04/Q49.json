    "**Heat-Reflective Window Films**: Install heat-reflective window films on all windows to reduce the amount of heat entering your home during a fire. These films can help keep the interior cooler and minimize the risk of glass shattering due to extreme temperatures. Additionally, using shades or shutters made from fire-resistant materials can provide an extra layer of protection by blocking radiant heat from external flames.",
    "**DIY Fire-Resistant Coating**: Create a homemade fire-resistant coating using common materials. For example, a mixture of baking soda and water can be applied to wooden surfaces to provide a temporary fire-retardant barrier. This coating can be reapplied regularly, especially before high-risk seasons, to help protect wooden structures, decks, and fences from catching fire.",
    "**Emergency Fire Sand Bucket**: Set up a series of fire sand buckets around your property. Fill these buckets with sand, which can be used to smother small fires before they spread. Sand is an effective fire suppressant, and having these strategically placed can allow for quick action in the event of a fire. Make sure to keep the buckets covered to prevent rain from diluting the sand.",
    "**Create a Fire Watch Group**: Organize a neighborhood fire watch group that meets regularly to discuss fire safety and prevention strategies. Members can take turns monitoring the area for signs of fire, ensuring that everyone is vigilant. The group can also share resources, such as homemade fire-retardant solutions or firebreak landscaping techniques, and create a communication plan for emergencies.",
    "**Use of Fire-Resistant Fabrics**: Replace or cover outdoor furniture and awnings with fire-resistant fabrics. Materials like fiberglass or treated canvas can withstand high temperatures and help prevent flames from spreading to your home. Additionally, consider using fire-retardant tarps to cover wood piles or other combustible materials stored near your home."
