    "**Echo**: A social media platform that focuses on preserving memories rather than creating new ones. Users can upload and share moments from their past, with a twist - each post is \"echoed\" back in time to the original date it was created. This means that users can see how their memories evolve over time, and how their perspectives change as they grow older. For example, a user might post a photo from their 10th birthday, and then see how their perception of that event changes when they post a photo from their 20th birthday, looking back on the same event.",
    "**Nexus**: A social media platform that connects people based on their shared interests and passions, rather than their geographical location or social connections. Users can create profiles that highlight their hobbies, skills, and values, and then search for others who share similar interests. This platform would be especially useful for people who are looking to connect with others who share their passions, whether it's a hobby, a profession, or a social cause.",
    "**Lumina**: A social media platform that uses AI to analyze users' posts and provide personalized recommendations for how to improve their mental health and well-being. The platform would use natural language processing to identify signs of anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues, and then offer suggestions for how to cope with these feelings. For example, if a user posts about feeling overwhelmed, the platform might suggest taking a break, practicing mindfulness, or reaching out to a friend for support.",
    "**Catalyst**: A social media platform that focuses on social change and activism. Users can create profiles that highlight their causes and passions, and then connect with others who share their goals. The platform would use AI to identify areas where users can make the most impact, and provide resources and tools to help them take action. For example, a user might create a profile highlighting their commitment to reducing plastic waste, and then connect with others who share their goal, sharing tips and resources for reducing plastic use.",
    "**Puzzle**: A social media platform that challenges users to solve puzzles and brain teasers, with rewards for completing challenges and sharing solutions with others. The platform would use AI to generate puzzles that are tailored to each user's skill level and interests, and provide a sense of community and competition as users work together to solve challenges. For example, a user might complete a puzzle and then share their solution with others, earning badges and rewards for their achievement. [/INST] [/INST] [/"
