    "Employing boats or river ferries to transport people and vehicles across the river. This would involve operating a shuttle service to move people and vehicles back and forth across the river, using the water for guidance and propulsion.",
    "Utilizing specialized transportation vehicles or hovercraft capable of traveling over water to navigate the river. This would involve developing vehicles or hovercraft that can hover above the water's surface, enabling them to move effortlessly across the river.",
    "Building a series of inflatable rafts or floating platforms to transport people or vehicles across the river. This would involve constructing a series of inflatable rafts or platforms equipped with buoyancy systems and securing them together using ropes or other materials to create a bridge over the river."
