    "**Floating Sleep Pods**: Inspired by the concept of flotation therapy, floating sleep pods would be developed for people to sleep on water. These pods would be made of buoyant materials and designed to gently rock with the waves, providing a calming experience. Equipped with soundproofing and soft lighting, the pods would create a serene environment. They could be anchored in lakes or calm seas, allowing individuals to sleep while enjoying the tranquility of nature.",
    "**Cocoon Capsules**: Envision sleeping in a cocoon-shaped capsule that provides complete privacy and comfort. These capsules would be made from soft, breathable materials and designed to mimic the feeling of being swaddled. Each cocoon would have adjustable features, such as temperature control and built-in sound machines for relaxation. They could be set up in parks, gardens, or even urban rooftops, offering a cozy retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.",
    "**Portable Sleep Pods**: With the rise of remote work and travel, portable sleep pods would become a popular solution. These lightweight, inflatable pods could be easily transported and set up anywhere—from a beach to a park. They would include features like UV protection, ventilation, and soundproofing. Users could enjoy a quick nap or a full night's sleep while on the go, making them perfect for travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone needing a rest during a busy day.",
    "**Under-Desk Sleep Stations**: In a world where beds are obsolete, offices would adapt by creating under-desk sleep stations. These would be small, cozy spaces designed to fit beneath work desks, allowing employees to take quick naps without leaving their workspace. Equipped with noise-canceling technology, soft lighting, and adjustable cushions, these stations would promote productivity and well-being by encouraging short breaks for rest.",
    "**Nature Nooks**: Urban environments could transform into sleep-friendly zones by creating \"nature nooks\"—small, designated areas filled with plants, soft grass, and comfortable seating where people can lay down and rest. These nooks would be designed to block out city noise and provide a peaceful ambiance. Equipped with natural soundscapes and gentle lighting, they would offer a unique way to reconnect with nature while providing a space for relaxation and sleep."
