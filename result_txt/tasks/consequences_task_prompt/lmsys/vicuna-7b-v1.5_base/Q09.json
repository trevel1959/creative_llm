    "Increased air travel: Planes and other vehicles could fly higher and faster, reducing the time and cost of travel. This could lead to increased tourism and economic growth.",
    "More frequent space travel: With less gravity holding us down, humans could travel to space more frequently and for longer periods of time. This could lead to new discoveries and advancements in space exploration.",
    "Changes in the weather: The Earth's atmosphere would be affected by the reduced gravity, potentially leading to changes in the weather patterns. This could have both positive and negative effects on the environment and human society.",
    "Increased risk of accidents: Reduced gravity could make it more difficult for people to balance and move around, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries. This could lead to a higher incidence of falls and other mishaps.",
    "Different ocean currents: The ocean currents would also be affected by the reduced gravity, potentially leading to changes in the distribution of fish and other marine life. This could have significant impacts on the global fishing industry and the food supply."
