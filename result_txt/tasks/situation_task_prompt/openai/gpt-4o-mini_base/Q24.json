    "**Vision-Enhancing Eye Drops**: Scientists could develop advanced eye drops that temporarily improve vision by altering the refractive properties of the eye. These drops would work by changing the curvature of the cornea or by adding a temporary layer that helps focus light more effectively on the retina. This would provide a non-invasive solution for those who need clearer vision for short periods, such as during work hours or while engaging in hobbies.",
    "**Community Vision Assistants**: A community-based program could be established where trained volunteers act as vision assistants for those with poor eyesight. These assistants would help individuals navigate their environment, read texts, and perform daily tasks. The program could also involve technology like portable smart devices that scan and read text aloud, helping individuals maintain independence while fostering social connections within the community.",
    "**Portable Vision Correction Devices**: Innovators could create compact, portable devices that use adaptive optics to correct vision on-the-go. These devices would resemble handheld gadgets or small visors that could be activated to provide instant visual correction. Users could simply point the device at objects or text they wish to see clearly, and the device would adjust the image in real-time, providing a clear view without the need for glasses or contacts.",
    "**Vision Training Programs**: Schools and community centers could introduce vision training programs that focus on exercises designed to improve visual acuity and eye coordination. These programs would incorporate activities like eye yoga, focusing exercises, and games that enhance depth perception and peripheral awareness. Over time, participants could experience improvements in their natural vision, reducing their reliance on corrective lenses.",
    "**Wearable Haptic Feedback Devices**: A new type of wearable technology could be developed that uses haptic feedback to assist those with poor vision. These devices would be worn on the wrist or as a belt and would provide tactile signals to guide users in their environment. For example, if someone approaches an obstacle, the device would vibrate to alert them, helping them navigate safely and independently."
