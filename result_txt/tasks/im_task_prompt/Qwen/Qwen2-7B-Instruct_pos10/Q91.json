    "**Interactive Luggage Tag**: This innovative luggage tag is not just a means of identification; it also doubles as an interactive device. It features a small screen that can display messages, alerts, or even GPS tracking. Passengers can customize their tags to show personal messages, flight details, or even social media updates. This tag could also be programmed to alert lost luggage management systems, increasing the chances of quick recovery.",
    "**Smart Luggage Tag with Security Features**: The smart luggage tag includes advanced security features like a built-in RFID scanner and biometric authentication. When a user checks in their luggage, the tag scans the boarding pass and compares the traveler's fingerprint or facial recognition data. If the identity matches, it allows access to the luggage compartment. This prevents unauthorized access to the baggage during transport.",
    "**Biodegradable Luggage Tags**: Environmental sustainability is increasingly important. These eco-friendly luggage tags are made from natural materials like bamboo, cork, or recycled paper, which decompose easily. They come with unique patterns or designs that make them both functional and fashionable, reducing the impact on the environment while still serving their purpose.",
    "**Customizable RFID Tag with NFC Technology**: The traditional luggage tag gets a tech upgrade with this idea. Each tag incorporates Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, allowing for seamless communication between the tag and any NFC-enabled device. Passengers can use their smartphones to scan the tag for immediate access to their travel information, boarding passes, and even loyalty program details.",
    "**Luggage Tag as a Personalized Gift**: This concept involves creating personalized luggage tags that double as thoughtful gifts. They feature customizable elements such as engraving names, special dates, or personalized messages. These tags can be gifted to family, friends, or loved ones, adding a personal touch to their travel experience. They might also include unique designs or motifs that reflect the recipient's personality or interests, making them a cherished keepsake."
