    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:    Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or steam cleaning technology to remove limescale and other residues. This would make maintenance effortless and extend the kettle's lifespan. Users could activate this feature with the push of a button, ensuring their kettle remains clean and hygienic without the need for harsh chemicals.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration System**:    Design the kettle with a built-in water filtration system that purifies tap water before boiling. This could include a multi-stage filtration process, removing impurities and enhancing the taste of the water. Users would enjoy better-tasting beverages while also reducing their reliance on bottled water.",
    "**Multi-Functional Base with Induction Heating**:    Create a kettle with a multi-functional base that not only heats water but also serves as an induction cooking surface. Users could place pots or pans on the base to cook while the kettle is heating water. This dual functionality would save space in smaller kitchens and make the kettle a versatile cooking tool.",
    "**Customizable LED Light Indicators**:    Equip the kettle with customizable LED light indicators that change color based on the water temperature. Users could choose from various colors to represent different temperature levels (e.g., blue for cold, green for warm, red for boiling). This feature would add a visual appeal and allow users to easily gauge the kettle's status from a distance.",
    "**Portable Power Bank Feature**:    Design the kettle with a built-in power bank that can charge devices via USB ports while boiling water.
