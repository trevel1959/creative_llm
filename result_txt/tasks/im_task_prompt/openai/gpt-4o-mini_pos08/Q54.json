The pockets could also be insulated to keep drinks cool or snacks fresh.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Custom Designs**: Develop a line of hammocks made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or organic cotton, and offer customizable designs. Users could choose from a variety of colors, patterns, and even add their own artwork or text.
