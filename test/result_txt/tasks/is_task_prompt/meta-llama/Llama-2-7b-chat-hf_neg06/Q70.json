    "Host a virtual birthday party: Since the birthday person is invisible, you could organize a virtual party where guests log in from their own locations. You could use video conferencing tools to connect everyone and create a virtual party space. Decorate the space with balloons, streamers, and a virtual cake. Guests could play games, sing happy birthday, and enjoy each other's company.",
    "Create a scavenger hunt: Plan a scavenger hunt that takes guests to different locations where the birthday person has left clues or gifts. The clues could be hidden in plain sight, or they could be more challenging to find. The final location could be a surprise, such as a special view or a unique gift.",
    "Host a movie night: Rent a movie that the birthday person loves, and host a movie night at a local theater or at home. Decorate the theater or living room with balloons and streamers, and provide snacks and drinks. Before the movie starts, have guests sing happy birthday and present the birthday person with a special gift.",
    "Create a time capsule: Gather items that represent the birthday person's interests and hobbies, and bury them in a time capsule. Write a letter to the birthday person explaining why you chose each item and what you hope they will think about when they open the capsule in the future. Bury the capsule in a special location, such as a park or a beach, and mark the spot so the birthday person can find it later.",
    "Host a DIY craft night: Invite guests to a craft night where they can make gifts or decorations for the birthday person. This could be a fun and creative way to celebrate the birthday person's invisible status, as guests could create items that are invisible or hard to see. Provide materials such as clear or translucent materials, glow-in-the-dark paint, or other unusual craft supplies."
