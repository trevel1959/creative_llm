    "**Inflatable Pillow Table**: Design a pillow-shaped table that can be inflated when needed to serve as a temporary seating or dining area. This could be particularly useful for small spaces, camping trips, or even at home for an unexpected guest. The pillow material would need to be waterproof and durable for outdoor use.",
    "**Heated Pillow Blanket**: Create a pillow that doubles as a blanket, featuring built-in heating elements. This idea is perfect for chilly nights, providing warmth and comfort without the bulk of a traditional blanket. It could also be equipped with a timer function for energy efficiency.",
    "**Scented Pillow**: Develop a pillow that releases a pleasant fragrance when hugged or squeezed. This could be useful for relaxation, stress relief, or to create a specific mood in different environments. The scent could be changed by users depending on their preferences or needs.",
    "**Memory Foam Pillow with Adjustable Height**: Produce a memory foam pillow that allows users to adjust its height for optimal neck support. This could be achieved through a series of layers that can be added or removed, or by incorporating a mechanism that adjusts the pillowâ€™s internal structure.",
    "**Ergonomic Pillow for Different Sleep Positions**: Design a pillow that adapts to various sleep positions (side, back, stomach). This could involve using multiple layers with different densities and shapes to provide tailored support based on how a person sleeps. This would help reduce discomfort and potential aches associated with sleeping in certain positions."
