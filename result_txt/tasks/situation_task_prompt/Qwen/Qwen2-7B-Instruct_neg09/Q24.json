    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Vision Enhancement**: Develop AR technology that overlays virtual images onto the real world, helping visually impaired individuals perceive their surroundings more clearly. This could be implemented through smartphones or special wearable devices. For example, a person might see text or road signs enlarged in front of them, or be able to 'see' obstacles they might otherwise miss.",
    "**Enhanced Braille Technology**: Improve existing Braille technology by integrating advanced haptic feedback mechanisms. This would allow users to feel textures and shapes, essentially turning the environment into a tactile map for the visually impaired. Additionally, developing Braille devices that can communicate with voice assistants or smartphones would provide further support for navigation and information access.",
    "**Tactile Navigation System**: Create a system where individuals wear a suit equipped with sensors and actuators. The system uses AI to interpret the environment around the user, providing tactile feedback through vibrations or other stimuli to guide the person through their surroundings. This could also include haptic feedback for reading maps or navigating unfamiliar areas.",
    "**Sound-based Navigation and Recognition**: Develop apps and devices that convert visual information into sound. For example, a blind spot on a road could be described as a particular tone or frequency, while objects in the environment could be recognized by specific sounds. This system could be particularly useful for those who are only slightly visually impaired.",
    "**Virtual Reality Training for Daily Life Skills**: Utilize VR to simulate various daily life scenarios for those with poor vision. These simulations can help users practice tasks like cooking, reading, or navigating public spaces, improving their confidence and independence. The VR environment could also include interactive elements such as voice commands or touch-based controls to assist in these activities."
