    "**Eco-Island City**: A sustainable, self-sufficient city built on a series of interconnected, man-made islands. The city would be designed with the latest eco-friendly technologies, such as green roofs, solar panels, and advanced water filtration systems. The islands would be arranged to maximize natural ventilation, reduce wind resistance, and provide stunning ocean views. Residents would have access to a variety of public transportation options, including electric boats and hyperloops.",
    "**Underwater Habitat**: A futuristic, pressurized underwater habitat that would allow residents to live comfortably beneath the waves. The habitat would be constructed from durable, corrosion-resistant materials and would feature large windows for observing marine life. Residents would have access to advanced life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management. The habitat would be powered by renewable energy sources, such as tidal or wave power.",
    "**Floating City**: A city built on a series of interconnected, floating platforms that would allow residents to live on the water while still being connected to the mainland. The platforms would be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own energy generation, water collection, and waste management systems. Residents would have access to a variety of public transportation options, including boats and amphibious vehicles.",
    "**Mega-Tunnel Network**: A vast network of underground tunnels and caverns that would provide a safe and comfortable living space for residents. The tunnels would be designed to be self-sustaining, with their own energy generation, water collection, and waste management systems. Residents would have access to a variety of public transportation options, including hyperloops and autonomous vehicles.",
    "**Space-Based Habitat**: A self-sustaining habitat built in orbit around the Earth, providing a safe and comfortable living space for residents. The habitat would be designed to be powered by solar panels and would feature advanced life support systems, including air recycling, water purification, and waste management. Residents would have access to a variety of public transportation options, including spacecraft and orbital elevators. [/INST] "
