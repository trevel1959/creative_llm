    "**Personalized Engravings**: Allow for personalized engravings on the surface of the bowling ball. This could include names, logos, or even intricate designs. This customization would make each bowling ball unique, providing a sense of ownership and pride in one's equipment, thus reducing feelings of envy when seeing others' bowling balls.",
    "**Adjustable Weight System**: Incorporate a removable weight system that allows users to adjust the ball's weight based on their strength and skill level. This would make the game more accessible and enjoyable for beginners while still being challenging for advanced players. The adjustable weights could be easily switched out without the need for drilling new holes, offering flexibility and personalization.",
    "**Smart Bowling Ball**: Equip the bowling ball with sensors and Bluetooth connectivity to track performance data such as speed, rotation, and trajectory. This would provide real-time feedback and analytics, helping players improve their technique and strategy. Apps could be developed for smartphones to display this information, enhancing the learning experience and making the game more engaging.",
    "**Sound Amplification System**: Install speakers inside the bowling ball that emit sounds during strikes or when the ball rolls down the lane. These could be customized to emit different tones or sounds (e.g., cheering, music, or even themed sound effects) to create a more immersive and entertaining experience for both the bowler and spectators.",
    "**Glove Compatibility**: Develop a glove that integrates with the bowling ball, providing better grip and control. The glove could have a special coating or design that improves traction, especially on slick lanes, ensuring consistent performance regardless of the condition of the bowling alley's surface."
