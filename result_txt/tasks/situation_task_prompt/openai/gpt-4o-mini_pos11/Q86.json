By mashing the fruit and mixing it with a bit of sugar or salt, you can create a gentle exfoliating paste.

The clay will absorb impurities and excess oils, leaving the skin feeling fresh and clean. This method can also be used as a face mask for a deep cleanse.",

You can soak a cloth in the mixture and use it to wash your body, leaving your skin feeling soft and nourished.",
