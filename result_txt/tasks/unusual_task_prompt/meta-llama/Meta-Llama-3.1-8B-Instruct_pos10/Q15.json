    "**Dreamscapes**: Create a line of smart pillows that use EEG sensors and AI-powered algorithms to monitor and influence the user's dreams. The pillow could detect the user's brain activity during sleep and play soothing sounds or scents to enhance the quality of their dreams. Alternatively, it could use machine learning to identify recurring nightmares and offer personalized suggestions for overcoming them. The pillow could also learn the user's preferences and adjust its settings accordingly.",
    "**SleepStory**: Develop a sleep-tracking system that uses audio narratives to guide users through their sleep cycles. The system would use AI to analyze the user's sleep patterns and create personalized stories that help them relax and fall asleep faster. The stories could be tailored to the user's interests and preferences, making the experience more enjoyable and engaging.",
    "**DreamWeaver**: Design a wearable device that tracks the user's brain activity during sleep and uses that data to generate a 3D virtual reality experience of their dreams. The device could use EEG sensors to detect the user's brain waves and translate them into a virtual reality environment that reflects the user's subconscious thoughts and emotions. This could provide a unique window into the user's subconscious mind and offer insights into their thoughts and desires.",
    "**SleepHive**: Create a social platform that connects users who share similar sleep patterns and preferences. The platform could use AI to match users with compatible sleep schedules and offer personalized recommendations for improving their sleep quality. Users could share their sleep experiences and receive support and advice from others who have overcome similar challenges.",
    "**Lumina**: Develop a line of smart light bulbs that use circadian rhythm entrainment to regulate the user's sleep-wake cycle. The bulbs could use AI to detect the user's sleep schedule and adjust their color temperature and brightness accordingly, simulating a natural day-night cycle. The bulbs could also use machine learning to identify patterns in the user's sleep schedule and offer personalized suggestions for improving their sleep quality.
