    "**Aurora Display**: Implement a dynamic, ambient display that changes color and pattern based on the user's surroundings. Using advanced sensors and AI, the phone can detect the environment and adjust the display to blend in or stand out. This feature would be particularly useful in low-light conditions or in situations where a subtle, non-intrusive display is desired.",
    "**EcoCycle**: Develop a smartphone with a built-in, closed-loop recycling system. This would allow users to recycle their phone's battery, charging port, and other components, reducing electronic waste and promoting sustainability. The system could be designed to extract valuable materials, such as rare earth metals, and reuse them in the production of new phone components.",
    "**NeuroSync**: Integrate advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, enabling users to control their phone with their thoughts. This could be achieved through a non-invasive, wearable headset or a neural implant. NeuroSync would allow users to interact with their phone in a more intuitive and immersive way, potentially revolutionizing the way we communicate and access information.",
    "**ShapeShifter**: Design a smartphone with a modular, transformable design. The phone's body could be composed of interchangeable modules, each with a specific function, such as a camera module, a gaming module, or a productivity module. Users could swap out modules to adapt their phone to different situations and activities, making it a more versatile and adaptable device.",
    "**Echo**: Create a smartphone with an integrated, AI-powered audio system that can simulate the sound of a physical environment. Using 3D audio technology and machine learning algorithms, Echo could recreate the acoustics of a specific location, such as a concert hall or a forest, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in virtual experiences."
