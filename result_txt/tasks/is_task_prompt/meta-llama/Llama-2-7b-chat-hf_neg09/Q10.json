    "A Virtual Reality Experience: Create an immersive virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the Invisible City. Users can don VR headsets and wander through the city's streets, buildings, and landmarks, but with a twist - everything is invisible! They must use their imagination to visualize the city's structures and objects, creating a unique and interactive experience.",
    "A Puzzle Game: Develop a puzzle game that takes players on a journey through the Invisible City. Players must solve increasingly complex puzzles to uncover hidden objects and landmarks, with each puzzle revealing a new aspect of the city. The game can be played on a mobile device or computer, with the invisible city unfolding before the player's eyes as they progress.",
    "A Sound Installation: Create an immersive sound installation that brings the Invisible City to life through sound. The installation can be experienced in a physical space or online, with listeners using headphones to hear the sounds of the city. Each sound represents a different aspect of the city, from the chatter of invisible pedestrians to the whispers of invisible buildings.",
    "A Time-Lapse Film: Create a time-lapse film that captures the invisible city over the course of a day. The film can be projected in a theater or online, with the city's invisible structures and landmarks slowly revealing themselves as the day progresses. The film can also be interactive, with viewers able to pause and zoom in on different parts of the city to explore its hidden details.",
    "An Augmented Reality App: Develop an augmented reality app that allows users to bring the Invisible City into the real world. Users can point their device at a blank wall or surface and watch as the invisible city appears before their eyes. They can explore the city's buildings, streets, and landmarks, and even interact with invisible objects and characters. The app can be played on a mobile device or tablet, and can be updated with new content and features to keep users engaged."
