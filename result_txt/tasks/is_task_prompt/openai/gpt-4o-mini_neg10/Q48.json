    "Once upon a time in a vibrant jungle, there lived a horse named Zuri, who was born with striking zebra stripes instead of the usual chestnut coat. Zuri often felt out of place among the other horses, who teased her for being different. One day, a fierce storm swept through the jungle, leaving the other horses trapped on a muddy hillside. Zuri, with her unique stripes, stood out to a group of nearby zebras who had spotted her. They rallied together, using their strength and Zuri's unique markings to lead the way to safety. From that day on, Zuri embraced her uniqueness, becoming a hero among both horses and zebras.",
