This option would allow for a unique and relaxing sleeping environment, potentially offering views of the stars or city lights.",
    "**Airborne Pods**: Design small, autonomous flying pods that can be launched from a central hub.

They could be equipped with advanced features like AI assistants, entertainment systems, and energy-efficient power sources. This futuristic idea offers a new dimension to lodging options, providing a sense of adventure and novelty.",
    "**Underwater Domes**: Build underwater domes that provide a unique sleeping experience while allowing users to explore marine life.
