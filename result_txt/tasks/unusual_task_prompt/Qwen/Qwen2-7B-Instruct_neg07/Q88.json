    "**DIY Air Freshener**: Utilize an empty tissue box as a container for your homemade air freshener. You can add scented oils or essential oils mixed with water to the bottom of the box, then place a used tissue on top. As the tissue absorbs the oil mixture, it will continuously release fragrance into the room, keeping the air smelling fresh and pleasant.",
    "**Portable Travel Organizer**: Transform the tissue box into a compact travel organizer by cutting holes for items like pens, USB drives, or even small toiletries. The box's size makes it perfect for storing and carrying essentials when traveling. Use a clear tape or a marker to label each compartment for easy identification.",
    "**Desk Drawer Dividers**: Cut out sections from the tissue box to create custom dividers for your desk drawer. This can help organize stationery items, paper clips, rubber bands, or any other small office supplies, making your workspace more efficient and tidy.",
    "**DIY Jewelry Organizer**: Modify the tissue box into a stylish jewelry holder. Cut off the top layer, leaving only the sides and bottom intact. Attach hooks, clips, or small compartments to store necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and rings. Decorate the box with paint, fabric, or stickers to match your personal style.",
    "**Insect Trap**: Create a DIY fly trap by placing a few drops of honey inside the tissue box. Insects are attracted to the sweet smell of honey and will enter the box, getting stuck in the glue or adhesive you've applied on the walls of the box. This is a simple, eco-friendly way to manage household pests without using harmful chemicals."
