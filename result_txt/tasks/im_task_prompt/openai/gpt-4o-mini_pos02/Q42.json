    "**Expandable and Modular Design**: A suitcase that can expand or contract based on the amount of belongings would be incredibly useful. Using a modular design, users could attach or detach compartments as needed. For example, a base suitcase could have detachable side pockets for shoes or dirty laundry, allowing travelers to customize their luggage based on the trip's requirements.",
    "**Built-in Weight Scale and Smart Packing Assistant**: A suitcase that includes a built-in weight scale would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees. Additionally, integrating a smart packing assistant within a companion app could provide packing suggestions based on the duration of the trip, weather conditions, and personal preferences, ensuring travelers pack efficiently and effectively.",
    "**Self-Driving Suitcase**: Inspired by advancements in autonomous technology, a suitcase that can follow its owner around would revolutionize travel. Using sensors and cameras, the suitcase would navigate through airports and other crowded areas, allowing travelers to move hands-free. It could also have a \"stop\" feature, where it stays put when the owner is not in motion.",
    "**Solar-Powered Charging Port**: To cater to the tech-savvy traveler, a suitcase equipped with solar panels on its exterior could charge devices on the go. The suitcase would feature USB ports to allow users to charge their smartphones, tablets, or laptops while traveling, ensuring they stay connected without needing to find an outlet.",
    "**Built-in Security Features**: Enhancing the security of suitcases is crucial. A suitcase with biometric locks (fingerprint or facial recognition) would ensure that only the owner can access its contents. Additionally, incorporating a loud alarm that activates if someone attempts to tamper with the suitcase could deter theft and provide an extra layer of safety."
