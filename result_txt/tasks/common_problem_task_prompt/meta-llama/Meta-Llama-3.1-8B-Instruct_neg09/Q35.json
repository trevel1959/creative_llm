    "**Zoo Without Walls**: A revolutionary concept that blurs the lines between the zoo and the surrounding city. By integrating the zoo's infrastructure with the urban landscape, visitors can explore the animal habitats amidst the bustling city life. This fusion creates an immersive experience, allowing people to connect with nature and wildlife in a more organic and engaging way. For instance, a lion enclosure could be designed to resemble a savannah, with grasslands and trees, while a city street nearby could be lined with shops and restaurants, creating a seamless transition between the two environments.",
    "**Zoo of the Future**: A futuristic zoo that incorporates cutting-edge technology to create an immersive and interactive experience. The zoo would feature augmented reality (AR) exhibits, virtual reality (VR) experiences, and AI-powered animal interactions. Visitors could use AR glasses to see virtual animals, learn about their habitats, and even participate in virtual animal feedings. The VR experiences would allow visitors to step into the shoes of a zookeeper, caring for the animals and learning about their behavior. AI-powered interactions would enable visitors to ask questions and receive personalized responses from the animals themselves, creating a more engaging and educational experience.",
    "**Zoo for the Senses**: A sensory-focused zoo that caters to visitors with diverse abilities and preferences. The zoo would be designed to stimulate multiple senses, including sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. For example, a sensory garden would feature plants with different textures, fragrances, and colors, while a soundscaping exhibit would recreate the sounds of various ecosystems. A tactile exhibit would allow visitors to touch and feel different animal hides, while a taste-testing station would offer samples of fruits and vegetables commonly consumed by zoo animals. This inclusive approach would ensure that everyone can enjoy and appreciate the zoo's offerings.",
    "**Zoo of the Past**: A historical zoo that takes visitors on a journey through time, showcasing the evolution of zoos and the animals that inhabit them. The zoo would be divided into different eras, each featuring animals and exhibits from that time period. Visitors could walk through a recreation of a medieval menagerie, see animals from the Victorian era, and explore a modern zoo. This historical approach would not only educate visitors about the history of zoos but also provide a unique perspective on the role of zoos in conservation and animal welfare.",
    "**Zoo Without Borders**: A zoo that transcends geographical boundaries, bringing together animals and ecosystems from around the world. The zoo would feature interconnected"
