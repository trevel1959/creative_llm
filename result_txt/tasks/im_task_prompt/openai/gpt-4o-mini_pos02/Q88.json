    "**Adjustable Length with Memory Foam Grip**: Create ski poles that can easily adjust in length with a simple twist mechanism, allowing skiers to customize the pole height based on their skiing style or terrain. Additionally, the grips could be made from a memory foam material that molds to the skier's hand, providing maximum comfort and reducing fatigue during long runs.",
    "**Multi-Functional Pole with Built-in Tools**: Innovate ski poles that incorporate various tools into their design, such as a detachable avalanche probe, a small shovel, or a bottle opener for après-ski relaxation. This multifunctionality would appeal to backcountry skiers who need to travel light but still want essential tools at their fingertips.",
    "**LED Light Indicators for Safety**: Integrate LED lights into the ski poles that can change color based on conditions or signal to other skiers. For example, a red light could indicate the skier is stopping or in distress, while green could mean it’s safe to pass. This feature would enhance safety on crowded slopes, especially in low visibility conditions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials with Customizable Designs**: Develop ski poles made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, appealing to environmentally conscious skiers. Additionally, offer customizable designs where skiers can choose colors, patterns, or even add personal graphics, making their ski poles unique and reflective of their personality.",
    "**Shock Absorbing Technology**: Introduce ski poles with built-in shock-absorbing technology to minimize impact on the skier's arms and wrists during tough landings or rough terrain. This could involve a spring-loaded mechanism or specialized materials that flex under pressure, providing a smoother skiing experience and reducing the risk of injury."
