    "**Smart Coffee Brewing System**: Create a smart coffee brewing system that connects to your smartphone or home automation system (like Google Home or Amazon Alexa). The system could allow you to schedule your coffee brewing times, adjust the strength of the coffee, and even monitor the coffee's freshness through sensors in the coffee maker. This would ensure you always have perfectly brewed coffee at your desired time without having to manually manage the process.",
    "**Portable Solar-Powered Coffee Maker**: Develop a portable coffee maker that can be powered by solar energy. This device would be particularly useful for camping trips, outdoor events, or any situation where electricity is not readily available. It would consist of a compact design that can brew a small batch of coffee, complete with a solar panel on top that can recharge during daylight hours.",
    "**Customizable Coffee Bean Grinding Machine**: Design a coffee maker that includes a built-in bean grinder. Users can choose their preferred type of beans, grind them right before brewing, and select from different grind sizes (e.g., fine for espresso, medium for drip coffee, etc.). This machine would offer better flavor control and fresher coffee compared to using pre-ground beans.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Recommendation System**: Create a coffee maker that incorporates a touchscreen interface allowing users to input their preferences (e.g., coffee type, roast level, desired strength) and provides personalized recommendations for brewing settings. The system could also include a database of recipes, tips, and pairings, enhancing the user's coffee experience.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Maker with Composting Function**: Develop a coffee maker that features a composting function for used coffee grounds. After brewing, the machine could automatically separate the grounds from the water, compress them into manageable chunks, and deposit them into a compartment designed for composting. This would reduce waste and encourage environmentally conscious consumption, making it easier for users to contribute to sustainable living practices."
