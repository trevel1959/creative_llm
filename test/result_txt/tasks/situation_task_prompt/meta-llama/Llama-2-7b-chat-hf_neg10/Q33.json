    "Nature's rhythm: Take inspiration from the natural world to create a time-keeping system. For instance, you could use the position of the sun, moon, or stars to mark the passage of time. You could also observe the changes in the environment, such as the length of shadows or the colors of the sky, to gauge time.",
    "Community chimes: Set up a system where different members of the community take turns ringing a bell or blowing a horn at specific times of the day. This would create a rhythmic pattern that could be used to keep track of time. You could also designate specific sounds or melodies for different times of the day, such as a morning song or an evening lullaby.",
    "Personal timekeeping devices: Create personal time-keeping devices that are unique to each individual. For example, you could use a series of colored stones or beads to represent different time periods, or designate specific shapes or symbols to represent different times of the day. This way, you could keep track of time without relying on any external clocks or watches.",
    "Time-based art: Use art to represent time. For instance, you could create a mural that depicts different scenes or activities at different times of the day. You could also use different colors or textures to represent different time periods. This way, you could visually represent time without needing any physical clocks or watches.",
    "Interactive timekeeping: Create a system where time is kept through interactive means. For example, you could create a large, communal calendar that everyone in the community can contribute to. Each person could have a specific task or activity associated with a particular time of day, and they could mark it on the calendar as they complete it. This way, everyone would be able to see the passage of time and keep track of their responsibilities and commitments."
