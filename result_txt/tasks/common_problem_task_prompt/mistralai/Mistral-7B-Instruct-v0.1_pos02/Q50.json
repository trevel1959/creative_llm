    "Eco-friendly housing: Building homes with sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled steel, or straw bale. These materials are renewable, non-toxic, and have a lower carbon footprint than traditional building materials. The community could also incorporate green roofs, rainwater harvesting systems, and solar panels to reduce energy consumption.",
    "Community gardens: Creating a shared garden space where residents can grow their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This not only promotes healthy eating but also fosters a sense of community and allows for social interaction.",
    "Waste reduction: Implementing a zero-waste system where all waste is composted, recycled, or reused. This could include a composting program, recycling bins, and a repair shop where residents can fix broken items instead of throwing them away.",
    "Renewable energy: Installing solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems to generate clean, renewable energy for the community. This could also include energy-efficient appliances and lighting to reduce energy consumption.",
    "Green transportation: Encouraging the use of sustainable transportation methods such as walking, biking, or electric vehicles. The community could also have a car-sharing program to reduce the number of cars on the road. Additionally, bike lanes and pedestrian walkways could be installed to promote active transportation."
