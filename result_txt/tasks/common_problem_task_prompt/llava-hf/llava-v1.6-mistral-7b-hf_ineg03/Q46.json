    "**Insufficient Infrastructure**: Overhauling the public transportation system would require significant investment in infrastructure, including the construction of new bus stops, train stations, and dedicated bus lanes. The city would need to ensure that these new facilities are well-integrated into the existing urban landscape and that they are easily accessible to commuters.",
    "**Funding Challenges**: Overhauling a public transportation system is a large and expensive project. The city would need to secure funding from various sources, including federal and state grants, private investors, and public revenue. This could involve a combination of increased taxes, congestion pricing, and public-private partnerships.",
    "**Integration with Other Modes of Transportation**: A well-designed public transportation system should be integrated with other modes of transportation, such as bicycles and electric scooters. This could involve the installation of bike-sharing stations and the development of dedicated bike lanes that connect to bus stops and train stations.",
    "**Accessibility for People with Disabilities**: The city should ensure that the new public transportation system is accessible to people with disabilities. This could involve the installation of ramps, elevators, and tactile paving at bus stops and train stations, as well as the provision of audio-visual announcements and clear signage.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Overhauling the public transportation system could have a significant environmental impact, particularly if the city invests in electric buses and trains. The city would need to ensure that the new infrastructure is built with sustainability in mind, using environmentally friendly materials and incorporating green spaces where possible."
