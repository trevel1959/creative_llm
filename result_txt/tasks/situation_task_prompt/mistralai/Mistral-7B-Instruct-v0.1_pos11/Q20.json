    "Travel by sea: If there were no more planes, one of the most viable options would be to travel by sea. This could involve taking a cruise ship or booking a passage on a cargo ship that is heading to the desired destination. While this may be slower than flying, it offers the opportunity to experience different cultures and lifestyles, as well as the chance to see beautiful landscapes and wildlife along the way.",
    "Take a train: Another option would be to take a train to the nearest port and then board a ship to the desired destination. This could be a more eco-friendly option as trains emit less carbon dioxide than planes. Additionally, taking a train allows for more leisure time and the opportunity to explore the countryside along the way.",
    "Rent a car: If you are looking for a more adventurous and flexible option, renting a car could be a great way to travel. This would allow for the freedom to stop at any location along the way and explore different areas. It could also be a more cost-effective option, especially if you are traveling in a group.",
    "Take a bicycle: If you are looking for a more environmentally friendly and physically active option, taking a bicycle could be a great way to travel. This would allow for the opportunity to explore different areas at a slower pace and take in the scenery along the way. It could also be a more cost-effective option, especially if you are traveling in a group.",
    "Take a helicopter: While planes are not the only option for air travel, helicopters could be used to travel between continents. This would be a more expensive option, but it would offer the opportunity to see the world from a unique perspective and experience the thrill of flying. Additionally, helicopters could be used to travel to remote areas that are not accessible by other means."
