    "AI-Powered Vaccine Design: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the genetic makeup of the new disease and design a personalized vaccine tailored to the specific strain. This approach would enable the vaccine to be more effective and efficient, as it would be optimized for the specific virus.",
    "Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine: Create VLPs that mimic the virus, but are non-infectious, and can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the virus. This approach would provide long-term immunity without the risk of adverse effects associated with traditional vaccines.",
    "DNA Vaccine: Develop a DNA vaccine that encodes for specific proteins on the surface of the virus. This approach would allow the body to produce the proteins itself, triggering an immune response and providing long-term protection against the disease.",
    "Membrane-Mimicking Vaccine: Create a vaccine that mimics the structure of the virus membrane, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the virus more effectively. This approach would provide broad protection against multiple strains of the virus.",
    "Combination Vaccine: Develop a vaccine that combines different components of the virus, such as proteins or nucleic acids, to stimulate a broader and more effective immune response. This approach would provide long-term protection against multiple aspects of the virus, including its ability to replicate and cause disease."
