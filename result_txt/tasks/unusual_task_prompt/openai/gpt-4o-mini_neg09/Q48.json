    "**DIY Cat Toy**: Create a fun and engaging toy for your feline friend by attaching a string to a CD and dangling it for them to chase. The shiny surface will catch their attention, and the lightweight nature of the CD makes it easy for them to bat around. You can even glue some feathers or fabric on it to make it more enticing.",
    "**Artistic Wall Hanging**: Use CDs to create a unique wall hanging or mobile. String multiple CDs together using fishing line or thread and hang them in a creative pattern.
