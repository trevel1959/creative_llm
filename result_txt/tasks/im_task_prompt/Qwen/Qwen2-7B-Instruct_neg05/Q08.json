    "**Interactive Refrigerator Organizer**: Design a refrigerator with built-in digital screens that display the expiration dates of items. Users can scan barcodes or manually input item details to keep track of freshness. It also features voice commands for adding items to a shopping list, helping users avoid forgetting items they need.",
    "**Energy-Efficient Refrigerator**: Develop a smart refrigerator that uses AI to adjust its temperature based on the user's habits and the contents stored inside.
