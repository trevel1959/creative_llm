    "Solar-Powered Umbrellas: With the absence of trees, humans could turn to solar-powered umbrellas as a solution for shade. These umbrellas could be equipped with photovoltaic panels that harness the sun's energy to generate electricity, powering a built-in fan or cooling system. This would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional umbrellas.",
    "Sky-Net: In a world without trees, a new technology called Sky-Net could be developed. Sky-Net is a network of interconnected, floating devices that can be deployed in the sky to provide shade. These devices could be designed to mimic the canopy of trees, providing a cooling effect through a combination of shade and evaporative cooling. Sky-Net could also be used for other purposes, such as cleaning pollutants from the air or providing wireless internet access.",
    "Climate-Controlled Clothing: As a substitute for trees, people could turn to clothing that can regulate their body temperature. Scientists could develop special fabrics that can absorb and release heat, keeping the wearer cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather. These fabrics could be integrated into clothing lines, providing a practical and comfortable solution for finding shade.",
    "Urban Green Roofs: In the absence of trees, cities could adopt green roofs as a way to provide shade. Green roofs are covered with vegetation, such as grasses, flowers, and trees, and can be installed on buildings to provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and create habitats for wildlife. By planting green roofs in urban areas, people could still enjoy the benefits of trees without having to worry about their absence.",
    "Personal Shade Devices: For those who want more portable and personalized shade, there could be a variety of small, handheld devices that can provide shade. These devices could be powered by batteries or solar panels and could be designed in different shapes and sizes to fit individual needs. They could be equipped with cooling systems, such as fans or misting systems, to provide a refreshing escape from the sun."
