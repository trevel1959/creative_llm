    "Artificially Intelligent Glasses: With the sudden disappearance of glasses and contact lenses, people with poor vision could turn to advanced artificially intelligent glasses that use machine learning algorithms to enhance vision. These glasses could use sensors to detect the wearer's surroundings and automatically adjust the level of magnification or color correction needed.",
    "Virtual Reality Enhancement: Another option for people with poor vision would be to use virtual reality technology to enhance their vision. Special VR headsets could be designed to simulate a world with clearer vision, allowing people to navigate and interact with their surroundings more easily.",
    "Augmented Reality Guidance: Augmented reality technology could also be used to provide real-time guidance and feedback to people with poor vision. For example, an AR app could be developed that uses a smartphone camera to detect obstacles and provide audio or visual cues to help the wearer avoid them.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could be used to restore vision in people with severe vision loss. BCIs work by detecting electrical signals in the brain and translating them into visual images. This technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way people with vision loss interact with the world.",
    "3D Printed Prosthetics: Finally, people with poor vision could turn to 3D printed prosthetics to improve their ability to see. 3D printing technology allows for the creation of customized prosthetics that can be tailored to the individual's specific needs. These prosthetics could be designed to enhance vision by magnifying objects or providing additional light."
