    "Hydrogen Fusion Energy: This energy source would involve the fusion of hydrogen atoms to create helium, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. The technology to achieve this is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a clean and limitless energy source.",
    "Solar Roadways: This idea involves covering roads and highways with solar panels that can generate electricity from the sun. The energy generated could be used to power electric vehicles, as well as homes and businesses in the surrounding areas.",
    "Tidal Energy: This type of energy would harness the power of ocean tides to generate electricity. It could be done through tidal barrages or tidal lagoons, where large barriers are built in coastal areas to contain the tide and generate power when the tide flows in and out.",
    "Nuclear Fusion Energy: This type of energy would involve the fusion of atomic nuclei to create new elements, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. The technology to achieve this is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a clean and limitless energy source.",
    "Quantum Energy: This type of energy would be generated through the manipulation of quantum particles, which are the building blocks of matter and energy. The technology to achieve this is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a clean and limitless energy source."
