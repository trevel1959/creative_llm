    "**Bioluminescent Wall**: I'd create a bioluminescent wall using genetically engineered microorganisms that emit a soft, ethereal glow. These microbes would be embedded in a specialized gel-like substance, allowing them to thrive and produce light. The wall would be designed to respond to temperature and humidity changes, adjusting its brightness and color to create a cozy ambiance. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optic Plant**: I'd develop a plant that incorporates fiber optic strands infused with a phosphorescent material. As the plant grows, the fiber optic strands would stretch and intertwine, creating a network of glowing fibers. The plant would be designed to respond to sound and movement, adjusting its light patterns to create a dynamic display. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Luminescent Paint**: I'd invent a special paint that contains microscopic particles that absorb and store light energy during the day. At night, these particles would release a soft, luminescent glow, illuminating the room without any external power source. The paint could be applied to walls, ceilings, or even furniture, providing a unique and energy-efficient lighting solution. (Confidence: 0.85)",
    "**Glowing Crystals**: I'd discover a way to cultivate crystals that emit a soft, pulsing light. These crystals would be grown in a specialized environment, allowing them to absorb and store energy from the environment. At night, the crystals would release their stored energy, creating a warm, gentle glow that would illuminate the room. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Electro-Conductive Fabric**: I'd develop a special fabric that incorporates electro-conductive materials, allowing it to harness and store electrical energy from the environment. When worn or draped, the fabric would generate a soft, pulsing light, providing a unique and wearable lighting solution. The fabric could be designed to respond to sound, movement, or even emotions, creating a dynamic and interactive lighting experience. (Confidence: 0.85) [/INST] "
