    "**DIY Natural Ventilation**: Create a passive cooling system by strategically opening windows and doors to encourage cross-ventilation. Use natural airflow patterns by identifying wind directions and placing fans in windows to draw in cooler air while expelling warm air. Additionally, installing window boxes with plants can help shade windows and cool incoming air.",
    "**Reflective Surfaces**: Cover windows with reflective materials, such as aluminum foil or reflective window film, to deflect sunlight during hot days. You could also create DIY window screens with reflective fabric to maintain airflow while reducing heat gain. For cooler days, use insulated curtains or blankets to retain warmth at night.",
    "**Indoor Greenery**: Incorporate a variety of indoor plants to help regulate humidity and temperature. Plants like peace lilies and snake plants can release moisture into the air, creating a cooling effect. You can also set up a small indoor water feature, such as a fountain, to increase humidity and provide a soothing sound that helps mask noise from outside.",
    "**Evaporative Cooling System**: Create a simple evaporative cooling system using a fan and a wet cloth. Hang a damp cloth in front of a fan, allowing the air to pass through the moisture, which will cool the air as it evaporates. This method is especially effective in low-humidity environments and can be enhanced by using ice water to dampen the cloth.",
    "**Layered Clothing and Blankets**: Embrace a multi-layered approach to clothing and bedding. In colder temperatures, wear thermal layers, wool socks, and cozy blankets to retain body heat. In warmer conditions, opt for breathable fabrics like cotton or linen. Creating a cozy atmosphere with blankets and pillows can also help psychologically manage discomfort from temperature extremes."
