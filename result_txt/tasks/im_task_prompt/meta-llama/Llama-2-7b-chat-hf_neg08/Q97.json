    "Add a Phone Holder: Another improvement for a dog leash is to include a phone holder. This would allow dog owners to keep their phone close by while walking their dog, without having to worry about dropping it or losing it. The phone holder could be designed to clip onto the leash, providing easy access to the phone when needed. This would be particularly useful for owners who need to make calls or send messages while walking their dog.",
    "Make it Waterproof: A waterproof dog leash would be a great improvement for owners who enjoy walking their dogs near water or in wet conditions. The leash could be made with a waterproof material, such as nylon or rubber, to ensure that it remains functional even when exposed to water. This would be especially useful for owners who live in areas with frequent rain or near bodies of water.",
    "Add a Reflective Material: A reflective material added to the dog leash would make it more visible in low-light conditions, reducing the risk of accidents or injuries. The reflective material could be applied to the leash in a strip or pattern, providing a high level of visibility. This would be particularly useful for owners who walk their dogs in the early morning or evening when visibility is limited.",
    "Incorporate a Training Aid: A dog leash could be improved by incorporating a training aid, such as a vibration or sound-emitting device. This would help owners to train their dogs to walk nicely on a leash, without pulling or jumping. The device could be set to vibrate or emit a specific sound when the dog pulls on the leash, providing a subtle reminder to the owner to correct their dog's behavior.",
    "Add a Comfortable Handle: A comfortable handle on a dog leash would make walking more enjoyable for both the owner and the dog. The handle could be designed with a cushion or grip, providing a comfortable surface for the owner to hold onto. This would be particularly useful for owners who walk their dogs for extended periods of time or have difficulty gripping a standard leash handle."
