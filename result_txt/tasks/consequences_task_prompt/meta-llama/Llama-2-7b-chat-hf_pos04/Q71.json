    "Ethical dilemmas: Immortality would raise a host of ethical dilemmas, such as how to allocate limited resources among an endless stream of immortal beings, or how to prevent immortal individuals from accumulating too much power and influence.",
    "Psychological impact: Living forever would likely have a profound psychological impact on individuals, including feelings of isolation, loneliness, and boredom. Immortal individuals might also experience a loss of empathy and compassion as they watched their loved ones grow old and die, leading to a disconnection from the natural cycle of life.",
    "Societal upheaval: The discovery of immortality would likely lead to a complete overhaul of society, as people would no longer be limited by their lifespan. This could result in a breakdown of traditional social structures, such as family, education, and employment, as people would no longer have the same sense of urgency or motivation to pursue these institutions."
