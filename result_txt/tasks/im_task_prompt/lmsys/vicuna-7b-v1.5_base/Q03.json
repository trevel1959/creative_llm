    "Integrate voice control: Voice control would allow users to operate the microwave hands-free, making it even more convenient. Users could simply speak their desired settings, and the microwave would respond accordingly.",
    "Incorporate Wi-Fi connectivity: Wi-Fi connectivity would allow users to remotely monitor and control their microwave from their smartphones or other devices. This would be particularly useful for those who forget to turn off their microwave or want to check if their food is cooked.",
    "Add a smart sensor: A smart sensor would enable the microwave to automatically adjust its cooking time and power based on the type and amount of food placed inside. This would ensure that food is cooked to the perfect temperature and prevent over-cooking or under-cooking.",
    "Implement a recycling system: A recycling system would allow users to easily dispose of their used cooking oil and other food waste. This would not only help reduce waste but also promote sustainable living.",
    "Add a built-in air purifier: A built-in air purifier would help to remove any lingering odors and impurities from the air inside the microwave. This would not only improve the overall air quality but also make the microwave a more pleasant place to cook."
