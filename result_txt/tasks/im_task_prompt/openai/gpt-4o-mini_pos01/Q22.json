    "**Modular Design**: Create a flashlight with a modular design that allows users to attach different heads or accessories for various functions. For instance, one attachment could be a lantern mode for camping, another could be a strobe for emergency signaling, and a third could be a UV light for detecting counterfeit money or inspecting surfaces. This versatility would make the flashlight more useful in various situations.",
    "**Solar Charging Capability**: Incorporate solar panels into the design of the flashlight for eco-friendly charging. This would allow users to recharge their flashlight during outdoor activities without needing an electrical outlet. A small battery could store energy gathered from the solar panels, ensuring that the flashlight is always ready for use.",
    "**Built-in Power Bank**: Add a power bank feature that allows the flashlight to charge other devices, such as smartphones or tablets. This would be particularly useful during camping trips or emergencies when access to power is limited. The flashlight could include multiple USB ports for charging several devices simultaneously.",
    "**Voice Activation**: Implement voice activation technology that allows users to turn the flashlight on or off and adjust brightness levels using voice commands. This would be particularly helpful in situations where hands are occupied, such as during repairs or when carrying items. A companion app could enhance this feature by allowing users to customize voice commands.",
    "**Personal Safety Features**: Design the flashlight with built-in safety features such as a panic alarm or a GPS tracker. The panic alarm could emit a loud sound when activated, drawing attention in emergencies. The GPS tracker could help locate the flashlight if it gets lost or assist in finding a person in distress by sending their location to emergency contacts."
