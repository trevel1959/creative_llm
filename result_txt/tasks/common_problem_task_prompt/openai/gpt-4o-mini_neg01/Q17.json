    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of new venues and the increased activity can have detrimental effects on the local environment. Issues such as habitat destruction, increased pollution, and resource depletion can arise. This can lead to long-term ecological consequences, and communities may face backlash from environmental groups if proper sustainability measures are not implemented.",
    "**Security Concerns**: With large crowds gathering for events, security becomes a top priority. However, this can lead to potential issues such as over-policing, civil liberties violations, and heightened tensions between law enforcement and citizens. Moreover, the risk of terrorist attacks or other violent incidents can create a climate of fear, affecting both the attendees and the local population.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While hosting the Olympics can bring economic benefits, it can also exacerbate existing inequalities. The costs of hosting may lead to increased taxes or diverted funds from essential services, affecting lower-income residents. Additionally, the jobs created may be temporary and not benefit the local economy in the long run, leading to a disparity between those who profit from the event and those who do not.",
    "**Cultural Misrepresentation**: The Olympics can sometimes overlook or misrepresent the host nation's culture. This can lead to feelings of alienation among local communities and may result in protests or negative media coverage. Ensuring that the local culture is authentically represented and respected during the event is crucial to fostering goodwill and community pride.",
    "**Post-Games Legacy**: After the Olympics conclude, many host cities struggle with what to do with the infrastructure and venues built for the event. If not properly planned, these facilities can become white elephants, costing taxpayers maintenance fees without providing ongoing benefits. This can lead to community resentment and a sense of wasted investment."
