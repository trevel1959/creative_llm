    "Public safety: A zoo is a public space, and ensuring the safety of visitors is crucial. This includes maintaining clear boundaries between the animals and the public, providing proper signage and warnings, and implementing safety measures such as barriers, fences, and designated viewing areas. Potential problems include accidents, injuries, or even fatalities caused by animal encounters or facility malfunctions.",
    "Enrichment and mental stimulation: Animals in a zoo require mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and stress. This can be achieved through the provision of toys, puzzle feeders, and other forms of enrichment. Potential problems include inadequate enrichment programs, lack of variety in enrichment activities, or insufficient space for animals to move around and explore.",
    "Staff management: Running a zoo requires a team of staff members, including zookeepers, veterinarians, and other professionals. Managing the staff, including hiring, training, and scheduling, can be a challenge. Potential problems include high turnover rates, difficulty finding qualified candidates, and managing the workload of staff members.",
    "Financial management: Zoos require funding to operate, which can be a challenge, especially during economic downturns. This includes managing budgets, finding funding sources, and balancing expenses with revenue. Potential problems include insufficient funding, high operational costs, and difficulties in attracting and retaining visitors.",
    "Conservation and education: Many zoos aim to promote conservation and education. This includes raising awareness about the animals and their habitats, as well as providing educational programs and resources for visitors. Potential problems include a lack of funding for conservation efforts, difficulties in attracting and engaging visitors, and ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of educational materials."
