    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Bags**: Design a trash can that uses biodegradable liners made from plant-based materials. These bags would decompose naturally in landfills, reducing plastic waste. The trash can could have a built-in compartment for storing these bags, making it easy for users to replace them when needed.",
    "**Odor Neutralization System**: Integrate an odor-neutralizing mechanism that utilizes activated charcoal filters or essential oil diffusers. This feature would help eliminate unpleasant smells emanating from the trash can, making it more suitable for indoor use. Users could customize the scent or replace filters easily.",
    "**Solar-Powered Compaction**: Create a solar-powered trash can that includes a compaction mechanism. This would allow the can to compact waste, increasing its capacity and reducing the frequency of emptying. The solar panel would power the compaction system, making it eco-friendly and energy-efficient.",
    "**Interactive Recycling Education**: Incorporate a small screen or LED display on the trash can that provides educational content about recycling and waste reduction. The display could show fun facts, tips on reducing waste, or even a game that encourages users to sort their trash correctly. This would engage the community and promote better waste disposal habits.",
    "**Community Contribution Feature**: Develop a trash can that allows users to scan a QR code linked to a community platform. Users could report when the can is full or needs maintenance, and in return, they could earn points or rewards for their contributions. This would encourage community involvement in maintaining cleanliness and promote responsible waste management."
