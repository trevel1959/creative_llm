    "Nutritional Fortification: Food manufacturers could increase the nutritional content of staple foods like grains, pasta, and rice by fortifying them with essential vitamins and minerals. This would make it easier for people to get their daily recommended intake of nutrients from their regular diet.",
    "Indoor Gardening: Encouraging people to grow their own fruits and vegetables indoors using hydroponic or aeroponic systems could help reduce the reliance on outdoor agriculture. This would allow for the cultivation of fresh produce in areas where traditional farming is not possible.",
    "Nutritional Injections: In cases where it's difficult to consume enough nutrients through food, nutritional injections could be an alternative option. These injections could be tailored to provide a balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals, ensuring that people receive the necessary nutrients even if they cannot consume fruits and vegetables.",
    "Plant-Based Meat and Dairy Alternatives: Developing plant-based meat and dairy alternatives that are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals could help meet the nutritional needs of a population that relies less on traditional animal-based products.",
    "Nutritional Education: Implementing nutritional education programs could help people make healthier choices and ensure they are getting the necessary nutrients from their diet.
