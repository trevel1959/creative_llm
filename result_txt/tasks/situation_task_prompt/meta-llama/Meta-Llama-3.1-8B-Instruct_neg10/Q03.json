    "**Celestial Colony**: I would live on a space station called Stellaluna, a massive, orbiting colony that would serve as a hub for intergalactic travel and exploration. Stellaluna would be a marvel of engineering, with towering spires and gleaming, metallic surfaces.

The city would be powered by a network of ancient, mystical artifacts, which would harness the energy of the dragon's slumber.",
