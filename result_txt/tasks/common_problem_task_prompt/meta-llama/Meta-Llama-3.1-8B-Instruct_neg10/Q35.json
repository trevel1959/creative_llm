The room will be filled with interactive exhibits, cryptic clues, and realistic sound effects, making it feel like a real zoo crisis.",
    "**Interactive Animal Adoption Program**: Develop an online platform where users can adopt virtual animals, receive updates on their \"adopted\" pets, and even interact with them through virtual visits.

    "**Zoo-Based Board Game**: Create a board game where players take on the role of zoo managers, tasked with balancing animal care, visitor satisfaction, and financial constraints.
