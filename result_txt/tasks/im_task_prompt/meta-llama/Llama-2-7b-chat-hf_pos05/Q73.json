    "Smart Key Fob with Built-In Fingerprint Recognition: Incorporate a fingerprint sensor into the key fob, allowing users to unlock their car with a simple touch of their finger. This technology is already available in some high-end vehicles, but making it more accessible and affordable for the masses could revolutionize the way we think about car keys.",
    "Augmented Reality Car Key App: Develop an app that overlays digital information onto the real world, allowing users to access their car's vital statistics, such as fuel level, tire pressure, and even a virtual map of their route. This app could also provide additional features like remote start, lock/unlock, and even a virtual key fob.",
    "Biometric Car Key: Design a car key that incorporates advanced biometric sensors, such as a heart rate monitor, to provide an additional layer of security. For example, the key could only unlock the car if the user's heart rate is within a certain range, ensuring that the car is only accessed by authorized individuals.",
    "Smart Car Key with Artificial Intelligence: Create a car key that learns the user's driving habits and preferences over time, adapting to their needs and providing personalized recommendations. For example, the key could suggest the most efficient route to a user's destination based on their usual commute, or even alert the user if they forget something in the car.",
    "Transparent Car Key: Design a car key that is made of a transparent, flexible material, allowing users to see their keychain and the keys themselves without having to physically unlock the car. This could be especially useful in dark or dimly lit areas, where it can be difficult to find the key in a purse or pocket. Additionally, the transparent key could provide an added layer of security, as it would be more difficult for someone to pickpocket the key without the owner's knowledge."
