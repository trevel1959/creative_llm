    "**Customizable Brush Heads**: Develop a line of interchangeable brush heads tailored for specific dental needs, such as sensitive gums, whitening, or plaque removal. Users could select a brush head that suits their current oral health condition and easily switch them out. Each brush head could come with a QR code that, when scanned, provides instructions and tips for optimal use.",
    "**Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Design the toothbrush with a built-in UV light sanitizing feature that activates when the brush is placed back in its charging base. This would ensure that the brush head remains free from bacteria and germs, promoting better oral hygiene. The UV sanitizer could also have an indicator light to show when the sanitization process is complete.",
    "**Personalized Vibration Modes**: Introduce multiple vibration settings that can be customized through the toothbrush or the accompanying app. Users could choose from gentle, moderate, or vigorous modes depending on their comfort level or the sensitivity of their gums. This feature would cater to individual preferences and enhance the brushing experience.",
    "**Interactive Learning for Kids**: Create a version of the electric toothbrush specifically for children that includes fun, interactive features. This could include a built-in timer with animated characters that encourage kids to brush for the full two minutes, as well as educational games that teach them about dental hygiene. The toothbrush could reward kids with points for consistent brushing, which they could redeem for small prizes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop an electric toothbrush made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or bamboo. Additionally, the packaging could be minimal and compostable. This eco-conscious approach would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and reduce the ecological footprint associated with traditional toothbrushes."
