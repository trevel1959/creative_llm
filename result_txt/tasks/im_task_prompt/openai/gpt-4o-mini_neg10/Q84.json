    "**Multifunctional Design**: Design a coat rack that combines multiple functions. For example, it could include a small shelf for keys, a mirror for last-minute checks before leaving the house, and a charging station for electronic devices. This would not only save space but also streamline the process of leaving the house.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Lighting**: Incorporate LED lighting into the coat rack that changes colors based on the time of day or the user's mood. Soft, warm lighting could be used in the morning to energize the user, while calming blue lights could be activated in the evening. This would add an aesthetic appeal and enhance the ambiance of the entryway.",
    "**Personalized Hooks**: Create a coat rack with customizable hooks that can be personalized with the userâ€™s name or favorite colors. Each family member could have their own unique hook, making it easier to identify whose coat is whose and adding a touch of personality to the space.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Construct the coat rack from sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood or recycled plastic. Additionally, incorporate a plant holder into the design, allowing users to add greenery or small succulents. This would not only improve air quality but also contribute to a more environmentally friendly home.",
    "**Interactive Coat Rack**: Develop a coat rack that features a small touch screen interface. Users could interact with it to leave notes for family members, check the weather, or even play music through Bluetooth speakers embedded in the rack. This would transform the coat rack into a central hub of communication and entertainment in the home."
