    "**Inflatable Wing Suit**: Develop a lightweight, inflatable wing suit that can be worn by individuals. The suit would have a rigid structure to provide lift and stability, allowing the wearer to glide across the water. The inflatable material would provide buoyancy, making it easier to stay afloat. This innovation could revolutionize water travel, enabling people to traverse vast distances with minimal equipment.",
    "**Underwater Walking Device**: Design an underwater walking device that utilizes a combination of propulsion systems and buoyancy control. This device would allow users to walk along the seafloor, exploring the ocean's depths with ease. The device would be equipped with a pressurized compartment, ensuring the user's safety while navigating the underwater environment.",
    "**Surface-Powered Submarine**: Create a submarine that uses surface-based power sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to propel itself through the water. This innovative design would eliminate the need for onboard power generation, reducing the submarine's carbon footprint and increasing its efficiency. The submarine would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, enabling it to traverse vast distances with precision.",
    "**Underwater Cable Propulsion**: Develop a system that utilizes underwater cables to propel vehicles across the ocean. The cables would be anchored to the seafloor and connected to a vehicle, such as a submersible or a buoy. As the vehicle moves along the cable, it would be pulled through the water, reducing energy consumption and increasing speed. This technology could revolutionize underwater transportation, enabling the efficient movement of people and cargo.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Propulsion**: Study the unique propulsion mechanisms employed by marine animals, such as dolphins and whales, and develop a human-scale equivalent. This could involve creating a device that utilizes the principles of fluid dynamics and biomimicry to generate thrust. The device would be powered by a combination of human energy and advanced materials, allowing users to propel themselves through the water with minimal effort. This innovative technology could enable people to travel long distances with ease, while also reducing the environmental impact of traditional watercraft. [/INST] Assistant: Here are five creative and original ideas for traveling across a large body of water if all ships and boats disappeared: 1.  **Inflatable Wing Suit**: Develop a lightweight, inflatable wing suit that can be worn by individuals. The suit would have a rigid structure to provide lift and stability, allowing the wearer to glide across the water. The inflatable material would provide buoyancy, making it easier to stay afloat."
