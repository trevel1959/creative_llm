    "**Disruption of ocean ecosystems**: The oceans host a diverse range of marine life, including fish, whales, and coral reefs. A sudden change in water salinity could disrupt the ecosystem, leading to the death of many species and a collapse of marine food chains.",
    "**Freshwater shortage**: Converting the oceans into freshwater would reduce the global supply of saltwater, which is used for drinking, agriculture, and industry. This could lead to a global freshwater shortage, causing widespread drought and food scarcity.",
    "**Impact on climate change**: The oceans play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. If the oceans turned into freshwater, the change in water properties could disrupt the Earth's heat balance, leading to unpredictable climate patterns and extreme weather events.",
    "**Erosion of coastlines**: As the sea level rises, coastal erosion would increase, leading to the loss of land and property. This could also cause damage to the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and ports.",
    "**Electrical grid disruption**: Many power plants rely on seawater for cooling. If the oceans turned into freshwater, the cooling systems would be compromised, leading to power outages and a disruption of the global electrical grid."
