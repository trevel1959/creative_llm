    "Underwater Habitat: I would construct an underwater habitat, using the structure of an old shipwreck as a foundation. The exterior would be covered in coral and other marine life, blending seamlessly with the ocean floor. The interior would be designed with an open floor plan, allowing for easy movement and interaction with the underwater environment. Large windows would provide a view of the surrounding marine life, and the interior would be equipped with air tanks and life support systems.",
    "Floating Island: I would create a floating island, using a large, sturdy platform made of bamboo and other sustainable materials. The island would be surrounded by a moat, and the interior would be lush and tropical, with a variety of plants and animals. The island would be equipped with solar panels and wind turbines to generate clean energy, and the interior would be designed for sustainability and minimal waste.",
    "In the Sky: I would build a house in the sky, using a hot air balloon as the foundation. The balloon would be filled with helium, and the house would be constructed from lightweight materials such as bamboo and straw. The interior would be cozy and comfortable, with large windows providing a view of the Earth below. The house would be equipped with a hot air balloon for movement and navigation.",
    "In a Tree: I would construct a house within the trunk of a large tree, using branches and leaves as support. The interior would be spacious and airy, with large windows providing a view of the surrounding forest. The house would be powered by solar panels, and the interior would be designed for sustainability and minimal waste.",
    "In a Cave: I would create a house within a cave, using the natural rock formations as support. The interior would be spacious and comfortable, with a large fireplace for warmth and a natural spring for fresh water. The house would be powered by solar panels, and the interior would be designed for sustainability and minimal waste."
