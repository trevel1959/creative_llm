    "**Built-in Augmented Reality (AR) Guide**: Integrate an AR feature into the camera that provides live feedback and tips while composing a shot. For instance, when the user points the camera at a scene, the AR overlay could suggest composition techniques, such as the rule of thirds or leading lines, by highlighting areas of interest in the viewfinder. This would not only educate users but also improve their photographic skills on the go.",
    "**Gesture-Controlled Zoom and Focus**: Develop a gesture recognition system that allows users to control zoom and focus through hand movements. For example, a simple hand wave could zoom in or out, while pinching fingers could adjust the focus. This would eliminate the need for physical buttons, making the camera more intuitive and user-friendly, especially in situations where hands are occupied or wet.",
    "**Interactive Community Features**: Embed a social platform directly into the camera interface, allowing users to share their photos, get feedback, and collaborate with others in real-time. Photographers could connect with local peers for spontaneous photo walks, participate in challenges, or even join live workshops streamed through the camera. This would create a sense of community and inspire creativity among users.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Focus on sustainability by using biodegradable materials for the camera body and packaging. Additionally, integrate solar panels into the design to charge the camera using sunlight, promoting eco-conscious photography. This initiative would appeal to environmentally-minded consumers and encourage outdoor photography without the worry of battery life.",
    "**Customizable User Interface (UI)**: Allow users to customize the camera's UI to suit their shooting style and preferences. For example, users could rearrange buttons, change color themes, and choose which features are displayed prominently. This personalization would make the camera feel more like an extension of the photographer, enhancing their overall experience and comfort."
