    "**Safety Hazards During Construction**: Building a tree house often involves climbing, using power tools, and handling heavy materials, which can lead to accidents. Workers or helpers may fall from heights, get injured by tools, or suffer from fatigue-related issues. Proper safety gear, training, and supervision are essential to mitigate these risks.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction of a tree house can have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. Cutting branches or damaging the tree can affect local wildlife habitats, and improper waste disposal can lead to pollution. It’s crucial to consider eco-friendly practices, such as using sustainable materials and minimizing disturbance to the tree and surrounding area.",
    "**Permitting and Legal Restrictions**: Depending on the location, building a tree house may require permits or adherence to local zoning laws. Failing to obtain the necessary approvals can result in fines or the requirement to dismantle the structure. It’s important to research local regulations before beginning construction to avoid legal complications.",
    "**Design and Accessibility Challenges**: Designing a tree house that is both functional and safe can be challenging. It must accommodate the needs of its users, such as children or adults, and provide easy access. If the design is not well thought out, it may result in difficult entry and exit points, inadequate space, or safety concerns regarding railings and ladders.",
    "**Weather Resistance**: A tree house is exposed to the elements, which can lead to deterioration over time. Rain, snow, and UV exposure can damage the materials used, leading to rot or structural failure. Ensuring that the tree house is built with weather-resistant materials and proper drainage systems is essential to prolong its lifespan."
