    "Virtual Reality Nature Expeditions: Create a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore the national park without physically being there. Using VR technology, visitors can embark on guided tours of the park's most breathtaking landscapes, encounter wildlife, and learn about the park's unique ecosystems. This idea combines technology and nature to create an immersive experience that would be both educational and entertaining.",
    "Citizen Science Program: Establish a citizen science program that allows visitors to contribute to the park's scientific research and conservation efforts. This could include projects such as monitoring wildlife populations, tracking changes in the environment, and identifying new species. By engaging visitors in the scientific process, the park can foster a sense of ownership and stewardship among the public.",
    "Interactive Nature-Inspired Art Installations: Create interactive art installations that respond to the park's natural environment. For example, a light installation could change color and pattern based on the time of day, weather conditions, or the presence of wildlife. These installations could be placed throughout the park, providing visitors with an immersive and dynamic experience that blends art and nature.",
    "Sustainable Living Exhibition: Develop an exhibition that showcases sustainable living practices and technologies. This could include exhibits on renewable energy, water conservation, and sustainable building materials. By highlighting the ways in which we can live in harmony with the natural world, the park can inspire visitors to make environmentally conscious choices in their own lives.",
    "Nature-Based Therapy Programs: Offer nature-based therapy programs for individuals with physical, emotional, or cognitive challenges. Studies have shown that spending time in nature can have a profoundly positive impact on mental and physical health. By providing these programs, the park can help visitors connect with nature and improve their overall well-being."
