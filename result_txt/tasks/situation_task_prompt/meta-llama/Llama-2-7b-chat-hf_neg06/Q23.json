    "Fingernail Carvings: Without pens or pencils, people could use their fingernails to carve words or drawings onto surfaces. This method would require patience and precision, as the carvings would be temporary and could be easily smudged or erased. However, it could also lead to a new form of artistic expression, as people could use their nails to create intricate designs and stories.",
    "Stone or Bone Markings: In a world without pens or pencils, people could use stones or bones to create marks on paper.

    "Memory Mnemonics: Without the ability to write things down, people could rely on their memories to retain information. They could use techniques like the \"memory palace\" method, where they associate specific memories with specific locations or objects, or they could use rhymes or songs to help them remember important information. This method would require a great deal of mental discipline and creativity, but it could lead to a more efficient and effective way of remembering information.",
    "Tattoos: In a world without pens or pencils, people could use tattoos to write messages or images onto their bodies. This method would be permanent and would require a great deal of courage, as the words or images would be etched into the skin. However, it could also be a powerful way of expressing oneself and preserving important messages for the future.",
    "Mind Mapping: Without the ability to write things down, people could use mind maps to organize their thoughts and ideas.

This method would require a great deal of creativity and mental agility, but it could lead to a more efficient and effective way of thinking and communicating."
