    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Display**:    - Enhance the calculator experience by integrating augmented reality. When paired with a smartphone or AR glasses, users could project complex equations and graphs in their environment. For example, students could visualize 3D graphs of functions right on their desks, helping them better understand concepts in calculus or geometry. This would make learning more interactive and engaging.",
    "**Customizable User Interface**:    - Allow users to personalize their calculator interface with themes, colors, and layouts. Users could choose between a classic look, a modern minimalist design, or even a playful cartoon style. Additionally, they could create custom button layouts for frequently used functions or create shortcuts for specific calculations, catering to their unique needs and preferences.",
    "**Collaborative Calculation Mode**:    - Develop a feature that allows multiple users to connect their calculators via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for collaborative problem-solving. This mode would enable students to work together on math problems in real-time, sharing their screens and calculations. Teachers could use this feature to conduct interactive lessons, where students can contribute to solving problems collectively.",
    "**Integrated Learning Assistant**:    - Transform the calculator into a learning tool by incorporating a built-in tutoring feature. When users struggle with a calculation, the calculator could provide hints or step-by-step solutions. It could also include a library of math concepts, formulas, and practice problems, allowing users to learn while they calculate. This would be particularly useful for students studying for exams or those trying to grasp new mathematical concepts.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar Charging**:    - Redesign the calculator to include a solar charging panel, making it more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient. This feature would allow users to recharge their calculators using sunlight, reducing the need for batteries and promoting sustainability. Additionally, the calculator could include a battery life indicator to remind users when itâ€™s time to recharge."
