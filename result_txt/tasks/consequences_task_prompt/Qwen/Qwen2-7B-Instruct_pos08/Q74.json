    "**Consequences of Global Urbanization**: If the world turned into a single city, it would lead to an unprecedented level of urban density. The immediate consequence would be a massive strain on existing infrastructure such as housing, transportation, water supply, sanitation, and waste management systems. This could result in significant challenges in managing resources efficiently and maintaining quality of life for the population. For instance, there might be a severe shortage of green spaces, leading to a lack of fresh air and increased pollution.",
    "**Cultural Fusion**: A single global city would likely lead to an unprecedented cultural fusion. As people from different backgrounds come together, traditional customs and languages might merge, creating new forms of art, music, cuisine, and fashion. However, this process might also lead to the loss or dilution of some unique cultural identities.",
    "**Economic Integration**: With the entire world functioning as one city, economic transactions would become more seamless. Trade barriers would likely disappear, and economies would be tightly integrated. This could lead to a global market that is highly efficient but might also exacerbate wealth inequalities between developed and developing nations.",
    "**Environmental Challenges**: A single city would require an enormous amount of resources and energy to function, posing significant environmental challenges. The demand for materials, food, and energy would put immense pressure on natural resources, potentially leading to ecological collapse unless sustainable practices are prioritized.",
    "**Political Unification and Governance**: In a single global city, governance becomes a complex issue due to diverse political ideologies, legal systems, and cultural norms. It would be challenging to establish a unified political structure that effectively manages the city's affairs while respecting individual freedoms and local autonomy."
