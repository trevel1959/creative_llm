    "Oral tradition: Another option for storing information would be through oral tradition, where people would pass down knowledge and stories through word of mouth. This method would be more resilient to technological failures and could help preserve cultural heritage.",
    "Engraving on stone or metal: Information could be engraved on durable materials like stone or metal, allowing for long-term preservation of knowledge. This method would require specialized skills and equipment but could be highly resistant to damage.",
    "Bioluminescent organisms: Genetically engineered organisms that emit light could be used to store information in a form that is both visible and resilient to environmental factors.",
    "Subterranean repositories: Storing information in underground repositories, such as caves or abandoned mines, could provide protection from natural disasters and other external factors. These repositories could be designed to be self-sustaining, with built-in mechanisms for preservation and security.",
    "Encoded in DNA: Another option for storing information would be to encode it in the DNA of living organisms. This method would be highly resistant to damage from environmental factors and could be passed down through generations of organisms."
