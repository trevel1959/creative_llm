    "**Genetic Engineering**: Use genetic engineering to create pest-resistant plants that produce substances that deter or repel insects. For example, certain plants have been found to naturally produce compounds that deter pests. These plants could be genetically modified to produce even stronger deterrents or to target specific pest species.",
    "**Ultrasonic Pest Deterrents**: Utilize ultrasonic technology to create devices that emit high-frequency sounds that are harmful to insects. These devices could be placed around areas where pests are known to be a problem, such as in kitchens, gardens, or food storage facilities.",
    "**Scent-Based Pest Control**: Develop a system that uses scent-based technology to attract pests and then trap or eliminate them. This could involve creating traps that use pheromones or other scent-based attractants to lure pests, which would then be trapped and either killed or relocated.",
    "**Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Implement a comprehensive IPM approach that uses a combination of biological, cultural, and chemical methods to control pests. This could involve using natural predators, such as ladybugs or lizards, to control pest populations, as well as using chemical treatments in targeted and strategic ways.",
    "**Insect-Proofing Structures**: Develop technologies that can be used to create insect-proof structures, such as buildings, greenhouses, or storage facilities. This could involve using materials that are resistant to insect infestations, such as stainless steel or glass with insect-repellent coatings."
