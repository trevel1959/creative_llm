    "on Cloudy Days, Harvest Solar Energy: To harness the energy of the sun even on cloudy days, you could build a solar-powered roof that absorbs and stores energy from the sun's rays. The roof would be designed with special photovoltaic cells that convert light into electricity, which could then be stored in batteries or fed into the grid. This would provide a reliable source of clean energy, even on cloudy days.",
    "Create a Cloud-Based Reflector: Another idea is to create a cloud-based reflector that uses the sun's rays to reflect light onto a surface, providing a concentrated source of light even on cloudy days. The reflector could be designed as a network of inflatable panels that are suspended in the clouds, allowing the sun's rays to pass through and be reflected onto a surface below. This would provide a consistent source of light, even when the sun is obscured by clouds.",
    "Build a Sun-Powered Funnel: A sun-powered funnel is a device that uses the sun's rays to channel light into a narrow beam, providing a concentrated source of light even on cloudy days. The funnel would be designed with a series of mirrors or lenses that focus the sun's rays onto a central point, creating a beam of light that could be directed onto a surface. This would provide a reliable source of light, even when the sun is obscured by clouds.",
    "Create a Cloud-Based Lighting System: A cloud-based lighting system is a network of light sources that are suspended in the clouds, providing a diffuse source of light that can be directed onto a surface. The light sources could be LEDs or other energy-efficient lighting technologies, and could be powered by a combination of solar energy and batteries. This would provide a reliable source of light, even on cloudy days, and could be used to illuminate large areas or to provide supplemental lighting in areas with limited sunlight.",
    "Build a Cloud-Based Optical Fiber System: A cloud-based optical fiber system is a network of optical fibers that are suspended in the clouds, providing a means of transmitting light signals over long distances. The optical fibers could be designed with"
