    "Smart Luggage Tag: Develop a luggage tag that utilizes Bluetooth technology to enable real-time tracking of luggage. This tag would provide travelers with peace of mind, as they would be able to monitor the location of their luggage in real-time, even when it's in transit. The tag could also be integrated with a mobile app, allowing users to receive notifications when their luggage is approaching the baggage claim area.",
    "Personalized Luggage Tag: Design a customizable luggage tag that allows travelers to add their name, initials, or a personal message to the tag. This would make the luggage more identifiable and less likely to be misplaced or lost. The tag could also be made of a unique material, such as wood or leather, to give it a personal touch.",
    "Luggage Tracker with Built-in Battery: Create a luggage tag that includes a built-in battery, allowing it to track the luggage's location for an extended period. This would be particularly useful for long trips or for travelers who want to ensure that their luggage is always accounted for. The tag could also include a low-battery alert, reminding travelers when it's time to recharge the tag.",
    "Luggage Tag with Security Features: Develop a luggage tag that includes advanced security features, such as a built-in RFID chip or a tamper-evident design. This would provide an added layer of protection against theft or tampering, giving travelers greater peace of mind when traveling. The tag could also include a hidden compartment for storing valuable items, such as cash or important documents.",
    "Luggage Tag with Augmented Reality Display: Create a luggage tag that includes an augmented reality (AR) display, allowing travelers to view information about their luggage in real-time. For example, the tag could display the flight number, destination, or baggage claim information, making it easier for travelers to navigate the airport. The AR display could also be used to provide additional information, such as weather forecasts or local attractions, at the traveler's destination."
