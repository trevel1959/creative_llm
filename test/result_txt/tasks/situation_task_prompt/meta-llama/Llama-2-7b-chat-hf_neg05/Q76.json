    "Carrier Pigeons: In the event of a global phone blackout, people could resort to using carrier pigeons as a means of long-distance communication. Trainers could be employed to teach pigeons to fly with tiny messages attached to their legs, allowing them to deliver messages over vast distances. This method would be slow but reliable, and would provide an opportunity for people to reconnect with the past when communication was more personal and less reliant on technology.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Similar to carrier pigeons, homing pigeons could be used to send messages over long distances. These pigeons are trained to find their way back home, even when released far away. By attaching a message to the pigeon's leg, people could send messages to distant locations, with the pigeon acting as a natural messenger.",
    "Optical Messages: In a world without phones, people could use optical messages to communicate. This method involves sending messages through a series of mirrors or lenses, allowing people to communicate over long distances by reflecting light signals. For example, a message could be written on a piece of paper and placed in a mirror, which would then be reflected towards a second mirror, and so on, until the message reaches its destination.",
    "Semaphore Flags: Another option for long-distance communication would be to use semaphore flags. This method involves using a system of flags to convey messages by using a series of predetermined movements and positions. By using a sequence of flags, people could send messages over long distances, similar to how Morse code is used to transmit messages over radio waves.",
    "Smoke Signals: In a more primitive form of communication, people could use smoke signals to convey messages over long distances. By creating smoke signals with different shapes and colors, people could send messages that could be seen from a distance. This method would be slower than other forms of communication but could be an effective way to communicate in areas with low visibility or in situations where other methods are not possible."
