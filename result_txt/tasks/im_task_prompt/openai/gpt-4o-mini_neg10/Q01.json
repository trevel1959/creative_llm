    "**Modular Design**: Create a wristwatch with a modular design that allows users to customize the look and functionality. The watch could have interchangeable straps, faces, and even tech modules that can be added or removed based on the wearer’s needs. For example, a user could add a fitness tracker module, a payment module, or even a GPS module for hiking, making the watch adaptable to different activities and styles.",
    "**Augmented Reality Interface**: Integrate augmented reality (AR) technology into the wristwatch, allowing users to project information directly onto their surroundings. For instance, by looking at a restaurant through the watch, the user could see reviews, menus, and even directions projected in real-time. This would transform the wristwatch into a powerful tool for navigation and information access.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Mechanism**: Develop a wristwatch that uses a combination of solar power and kinetic energy to recharge itself. This eco-friendly watch would reduce the need for battery replacements and promote sustainability. Additionally, it could feature a small display that shows how much energy has been collected, encouraging users to engage in outdoor activities to keep their watch charged.",
    "**Personalized Health Coach**: Create a wristwatch that acts as a personal health coach by integrating advanced health monitoring features such as blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, and stress levels. The watch could provide tailored recommendations for exercise, meditation, and nutrition based on the wearer’s data, promoting a healthier lifestyle. It could even send reminders to drink water or take breaks during long work sessions.",
    "**Holographic Projection**: Innovate a wristwatch that incorporates holographic projection technology, allowing users to project a virtual interface above the watch face. This could enable them to interact with notifications, calls, or even play games in 3D space, providing a unique and engaging way to interact with technology without needing to look down at the watch."
