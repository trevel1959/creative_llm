    "Biocontrol: Utilize natural predators of insects to control their populations. For example, certain types of birds, bats, and spiders are known to prey on insects.",
    "Insect-resistant plants: Develop and cultivate plants that are resistant to insect infestations. This would reduce the need for chemical pesticides and protect the environment.",
    "Biological pest control: Use beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings, to control pest populations. These insects feed on harmful insects, helping to maintain a natural balance.",
    "Integrated pest management: Implement a combination of techniques, such as physical barriers, traps, and targeted pesticides, to manage insect populations. This approach would minimize the impact on non-target species and reduce the risk of developing pesticide-resistant pests.",
    "Insect repellent technology: Develop and deploy insect repellent technology, such as drones and wearable devices, to deter insect infestations in human-populated areas."
