    "Once, in a quiet village, there lived a man who claimed to be the keeper of the Moon. Each night, he would climb a ladder made of stars to polish its silvery surface. The villagers laughed, dismissing his tales as madness. One fateful night, a child, curious and brave, followed him. To her amazement, she found the man painting constellations and whispering secrets to the Moon. He revealed that the Moon held dreams, and he was its guardian. Inspired, the child returned, spreading his magic. The villagers, now believers, looked up at the Moon with wonder, forever changed by the manâ€™s celestial care.",
