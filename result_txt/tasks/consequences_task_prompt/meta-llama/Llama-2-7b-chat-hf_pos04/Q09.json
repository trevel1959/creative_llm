    "Massive Redistribution of Matter: If the Earth's gravity were halved, the distribution of matter on the planet would undergo a radical change. Large structures like mountains and continents would begin to float away, and the oceans would start to boil off into space. This would lead to the formation of massive gas clouds, which would then coalesce into new celestial bodies.",
    "Increased Atmospheric Erosion: With less gravity holding the atmosphere in place, the air would begin to escape into space, causing massive atmospheric erosion. This would lead to the formation of a thick, protective shield of atmosphere around the planet, which would protect it from harmful solar radiation and space debris.",
    "Unprecedented Weather Patterns: A halving of the Earth's gravity would result in unprecedented weather patterns. The atmosphere would become increasingly unstable, leading to more frequent and intense storms, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms. The jet stream would also become more turbulent, leading to unpredictable and extreme weather events.",
    "Extreme Tectonic Activity: With less gravity holding the Earth's crust together, the tectonic plates would begin to shift and move more rapidly, leading to extreme earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The polar regions would experience increased volcanic activity, causing massive floods and landslides.",
    "Unforeseen Biological Changes: A halving of the Earth's gravity would have a profound impact on the planet's ecosystems. Many species would struggle to adapt to the altered gravitational environment, leading to widespread extinctions. Those that do adapt would undergo significant physiological changes, such as increased muscle mass and bone density, to compensate for the reduced gravity. This could lead to the emergence of entirely new species that are better suited to the altered environment."
