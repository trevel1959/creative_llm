    "**Innovative Bicycle Solar Panel System:** Develop a bicycle that integrates solar panels on its frame or wheels to charge electronic devices or power onboard accessories like lights or speakers. The system could be designed with high-efficiency solar cells that can capture sunlight even on cloudy days. This idea promotes sustainable living and enhances the utility of bicycles for everyday urban commuters.",
    "**Ergonomic Bike Seat with Health Monitoring:** Design a bicycle seat that not only provides comfort but also includes sensors to monitor the rider's posture, heart rate, and other biometric data. This seat could provide real-time feedback through an app on a smartphone, helping users maintain a healthy lifestyle while cycling. Additionally, it could offer features like personalized workout routines based on user data, making cycling more engaging and beneficial for fitness enthusiasts.",
    "**Smart Bike Lane Navigation System:** Create a smart bicycle that utilizes GPS and AI technology to navigate bike lanes, avoiding traffic, and finding the safest routes. The bike could come equipped with a dashboard display showing the optimal route, estimated time of arrival, and potential hazards ahead. This system would enhance safety and efficiency for cyclists in congested urban areas.",
    "**Recycling Bicycle Frames:** Launch a project where old bicycle frames are repurposed into functional furniture pieces such as chairs, tables, or benches. This initiative would reduce waste and promote sustainability by giving new life to discarded materials. The process could involve collaboration with local artisans or DIY workshops, encouraging community involvement and creativity.",
    "**Portable Bicycle-Powered Air Purifier:** Develop a bicycle that doubles as an air purifier, utilizing the kinetic energy generated by the cyclist to power filters and fans that clean the air. The device could be integrated into the bicycle's frame, allowing riders to breathe cleaner air during their commute, especially in polluted cities. This concept combines physical exercise with environmental responsibility, promoting healthier lifestyles and cleaner air."
