This would not only reduce electronic waste but also allow users to tailor their smartphones to their specific needs and preferences, making it a more sustainable option.",
    "**AI-Powered Personal Assistant**: An enhanced AI personal assistant that learns from user behavior and preferences could provide personalized recommendations and automate daily tasks. For example, it could suggest optimal routes based on traffic patterns, remind users of upcoming appointments with context-sensitive information, or even curate a playlist based on the userâ€™s mood detected through voice tone analysis. This would create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.",
    "**Virtual Reality Integration**: Smartphones could come equipped with built-in VR capabilities, allowing users to easily switch between traditional smartphone functions and immersive virtual experiences. This could include everything from gaming to virtual meetings or social gatherings. With lightweight VR headsets that connect seamlessly, users could experience a new level of interaction with their devices, transforming how they consume media and connect with others.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Sources**: A smartphone made from biodegradable materials and powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels integrated into the case, would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, the device could come with a recycling program that incentivizes users to return their old phones for sustainable disposal or refurbishment, promoting a circular economy in technology."
