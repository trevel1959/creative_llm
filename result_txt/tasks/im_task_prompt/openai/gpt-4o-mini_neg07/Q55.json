    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Develop a customizable grip section that allows users to adjust the thickness and shape according to their comfort preferences. This could be achieved with a silicone sleeve that molds to the user's fingers or a set of interchangeable grips in different shapes and sizes, promoting better ergonomics and reducing hand fatigue during long writing sessions.",
    "**Modular Nib System**: Create a fountain pen with a modular nib system that allows users to easily swap out nibs for different writing styles or ink flow preferences. Users could choose from a variety of nib types, such as fine, medium, broad, or even specialty nibs for calligraphy or art, enhancing the versatility of the pen for different tasks.",
    "**Integrated Ink Reservoir**: Design a fountain pen with a built-in, refillable ink reservoir that can hold multiple ink colors at once. This would allow users to switch between colors on-the-fly without needing to change cartridges. The reservoir could have a simple twist mechanism to select the desired ink color, making it perfect for artists and note-takers who enjoy using multiple colors.",
    "**Digital Companion App**: Develop a companion app that connects to the fountain pen via Bluetooth. The app could track writing habits, provide prompts for creative writing, or even digitize handwritten notes in real-time. Users could also customize their pen settings, such as ink flow and pressure sensitivity, enhancing their writing experience and productivity.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses ultrasonic waves or a small heating element to clean the nib and feed system automatically. This would help maintain optimal performance and prolong the life of the pen without the need for manual cleaning, making it more user-friendly for those who may not have the time or inclination to clean their fountain pens regularly."
