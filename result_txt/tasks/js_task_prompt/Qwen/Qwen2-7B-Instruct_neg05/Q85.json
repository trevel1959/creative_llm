Inclusive societies would celebrate differences, promoting equal opportunities and a sense of belonging for all members.",
    "**Resilience and Adaptability Increase:** Lastly, I'd work on increasing resilience and adaptability in humans. This would help individuals cope better with life's challenges, whether personal setbacks or global crises. With enhanced resilience, people would bounce back from adversity faster, learn from experiences, and adapt to changing circumstances more effectively. This could lead to a more robust, adaptable society capable of overcoming obstacles together."
