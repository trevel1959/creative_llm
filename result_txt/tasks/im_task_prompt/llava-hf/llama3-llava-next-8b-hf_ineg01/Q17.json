    "Smart Laundry Assistant: Create a washing machine with a built-in smart assistant that can help users manage their laundry more efficiently. The assistant can provide personalized recommendations based on the type of fabric, the stain, and the desired wash cycle. It can also send notifications when the laundry is done, and it can be controlled remotely through a smartphone app.",
    "Self-Cleaning Washing Machine: Design a washing machine that has a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light and natural enzymes to break down and remove any odors or stains left behind after the wash cycle. This can reduce the need for additional detergent and improve the overall cleanliness of the laundry.",
    "Energy Harvesting: Develop a washing machine that harnesses the energy generated during the spin cycle to generate electricity. This can be achieved through a small turbine or generator that uses the rotational energy to produce power. This can help offset the energy consumption of the washing machine and contribute to a more sustainable home.",
    "Personalized Washing Cycles: Create a washing machine that allows users to customize their wash cycles based on the type of fabric and the desired outcome. This can include options for delicate fabrics, wool, sportswear, and more. The machine can also offer pre-programmed cycles for common laundry tasks, such as stain removal or fabric softening.",
    "Automated Folding and Sorting: Develop a washing machine that includes an automated folding and sorting system. This can help save time and effort by folding and sorting the laundry automatically, allowing users to focus on other tasks."
