    "**Smart Ceiling Fan with Integrated Lighting and Air Purification:** Design a ceiling fan that incorporates smart technology, LED lighting, and air purification capabilities. The fan would be controlled through a smartphone app or voice commands, allowing users to adjust the speed, lighting color temperature, and air purification settings according to their preferences. The fan blades could also double as air purifier filters, enhancing indoor air quality. ",
    "**Reversible Ceiling Fan with Decorative Blades:** Create a ceiling fan that features reversible blades, which can be easily swapped out for different decorative designs. This allows homeowners to change the look of their room seasonally or to match specific decor themes. The reversible feature also reduces storage space requirements for multiple fans.",
    "**Wind-Driven Ceiling Fan with Solar Charging:** Develop a ceiling fan powered by wind and solar energy. When there's a breeze, the fan will operate using the kinetic energy from the wind. In areas with limited sunlight, it can also harness solar energy through a built-in solar panel. This eco-friendly design reduces reliance on traditional power sources and promotes sustainable living.",
    "**Automated Ceiling Fan with Movement Detection:** Design a ceiling fan that automatically adjusts its speed based on the movement detected in the room. Using motion sensors, the fan would slow down when no one is present to save energy and turn off completely after a set period without activity. This intelligent system ensures energy efficiency and comfort simultaneously.",
    "**Adjustable Ceiling Fan with Variable Blade Pitch:** Create a ceiling fan with adjustable blade pitch angles, allowing users to optimize airflow for different seasons and room sizes. The pitch can be adjusted manually or through a remote control, providing personalized cooling or heating effects. This innovative feature offers greater flexibility in managing air circulation within a space."
