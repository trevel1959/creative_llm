    "Self-cleaning leaves: The new plant species would have leaves that are naturally self-cleaning. This could be achieved through the production of a special waxy substance on the leaves that repels dirt and debris. This would make the plant easier to maintain and reduce the need for frequent cleaning.",
    "Increased drought tolerance: The new plant species would be highly tolerant to drought conditions. This could be achieved through genetic engineering or selective breeding to increase the plant's ability to store water and reduce water loss through its leaves. This would make the plant more resilient to dry spells and help it survive in harsh environments.",
    "Edible flowers: The new plant species would have flowers that are edible and can be consumed by humans. This could be achieved through selective breeding to develop flowers that are not only visually appealing but also safe for consumption. The flowers could be used in salads, soups, and other dishes.",
    "Pollination by insects: The new plant species would be designed to be pollinated by insects, rather than relying on the wind or other mechanisms. This could be achieved through the development of specialized flowers that are attractive to specific insects. This would ensure that the plant is able to reproduce effectively and maintain its population.",
    "Biofuels production: The new plant species would be designed to produce biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, from its tissues. This could be achieved through genetic engineering to introduce enzymes that convert the plant's carbohydrates into usable fuels. This would make the plant a sustainable source of energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."
