    "Smart Picture Frame: Create a picture frame that can connect to the internet and display images from various online sources, such as Instagram or Flickr. Users can also upload their own photos and create a slideshow with music and transitions. The frame can also act as a digital picture viewer, allowing users to zoom in and out, and rotate images.",
    "Interactive Memory Lane: Design a picture frame that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to display a timeline of memories associated with a particular location. When a user stands in front of the frame, it displays a 3D representation of the location and superimposes images from their personal photo library onto the AR environment. Users can interact with the memories by tapping on them to see a larger version or sharing them on social media.",
    "Personalized Art Gallery: Create a picture frame that uses machine learning algorithms to curate a personalized art gallery based on a user's preferences. The frame can display a variety of art styles and genres, and users can select their favorite pieces to create a customized collection. The frame can also offer recommendations based on the user's viewing history and preferences.",
    "Time-Lapse Movie Maker: Design a picture frame that can create time-lapse movies from a user's photo library. The frame can analyze the photos and create a video that condenses a year's worth of memories into a 3-minute video. Users can customize the video by adding music, transitions, and captions.",
    "Social Media Frame: Create a picture frame that connects to social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook. Users can select their favorite photos from their feed and display them on the frame. The frame can also display a live feed of the user's social media activity, allowing them to see their latest posts and interactions on the frame. Users can also use the frame to post photos and receive likes and comments directly on the frame."
