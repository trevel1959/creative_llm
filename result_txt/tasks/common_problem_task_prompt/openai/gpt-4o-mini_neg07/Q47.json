    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Handling computer components poses a risk of static electricity, which can damage sensitive hardware like CPUs and RAM. A builder might inadvertently discharge static electricity while touching components, leading to failure or reduced lifespan. To address this, it's advisable to use an anti-static wrist strap, work on an anti-static mat, and regularly ground oneself by touching a metal surface.",
    "**Cooling System Inefficiency**: Proper cooling is essential for the performance and longevity of a computer. If a builder fails to install an adequate cooling solution (like fans or liquid cooling systems), the computer may overheat, causing thermal throttling or hardware damage. To prevent this, builders should calculate the thermal requirements of their components and select appropriate cooling solutions, ensuring good airflow in the case.",
    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Selecting a power supply unit (PSU) that does not provide enough wattage for the components can lead to system instability or failure to boot. If the PSU cannot handle the power demands of the CPU and GPU, it may shut down unexpectedly or damage components. Builders should calculate the total wattage required using online calculators and choose a PSU with some overhead for future upgrades.",
    "**Cable Management Chaos**: Poor cable management can lead to airflow issues, making cooling less effective, and can create a cluttered appearance that makes troubleshooting difficult. A builder might end up with tangled cables obstructing airflow or blocking access to ports. To avoid this, it's important to plan cable routing in advance, use zip ties or Velcro straps to bundle cables, and utilize modular or semi-modular PSUs to minimize unnecessary cables.",
    "**Software Installation Confusion**: After assembling the hardware, installing the operating system and drivers can be a daunting task, especially for beginners. Issues such as BIOS settings, partitioning drives, or driver compatibility can arise, leading to confusion and frustration. To simplify this process, builders should create a checklist for installation steps, research the required drivers in advance, and follow detailed guides or video tutorials specific to their hardware."
