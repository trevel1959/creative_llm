    "If the Earth had two moons, the gravitational pull would be significantly stronger, which could affect ocean tides and currents. This could lead to increased coastal erosion and flooding in some areas, while others could experience drought and desertification.",
    "The presence of two moons could also affect theta waves that are thought to regulate our brain waves and sleep patterns. Studies have shown that exposure to moonlight can disrupt sleep, and having two moons could exacerbate this effect.",
    "If the Earth had two moons, it could lead to a phenomenon known as tidal locking. This occurs when one side of a planet is always facing the moon, while the other side is always facing away from it. This could cause extreme temperature changes on the Earth's surface, with one side being perpetually cold and the other perpetually hot.",
