    "Bicycles: One option for traveling long distances without a car is to use bicycles. This is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly mode of transportation that can be used for both short and long distances. Bicycles can be used for commuting to work, school, or for leisure activities such as touring. With the increasing popularity of cycling, many cities have invested in bike lanes and infrastructure, making it safer and more convenient to travel by bike. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Electric skateboards: Another option for traveling long distances without a car is to use electric skateboards. These boards are lightweight, easy to maneuver, and can reach high speeds, making them a great alternative to cars for short to medium distance travel. They are also environmentally friendly and can be used on bike lanes, making them a convenient option for commuting. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Hydrofoils: For longer distances, hydrofoils could be a viable option. Hydrofoils are small, personal watercraft that use the water's surface to lift the hull of the craft, reducing drag and increasing speed. They are powered by a small engine and can reach speeds of up to 30 knots, making them a fast and efficient mode of transportation. However, they are not as practical for short distances and require a body of water to operate. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "Hot air balloons: For traveling long distances, hot air balloons could be an option. Hot air balloons use lift bags filled with hot air to rise above the ground, allowing passengers to travel long distances without the need for roads or infrastructure. They are a unique and romantic mode of transportation, but they are not as practical for shorter distances and require a significant amount of fuel to operate. Confidence Score: 0.5",
    "Maglev trains: For long-distance travel, maglev trains could be a viable option. Maglev trains use magnetic levitation technology to lift the train above the tracks, reducing friction and increasing speed. They are energy-efficient and can reach high speeds, making them a fast and practical mode of transportation for long distances. However, they are not as practical for short distances and"
