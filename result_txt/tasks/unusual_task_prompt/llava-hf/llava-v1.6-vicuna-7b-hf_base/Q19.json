The candle would be lit and its heat would be used to melt a small amount of wax, which would then be poured into a small container with a wick. The wax would be allowed to cool and harden, creating a wax melter. The wax melter would be placed near the fan, and when the wax is lit, it would melt and release a pleasant scent into the air. The fan would then circulate the scent throughout the room.",
