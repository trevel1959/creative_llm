    "**Sonic Knife**: A knife with a built-in, high-frequency sonic blade that vibrates at an incredibly high speed, allowing for precise cuts without the need for manual pressure. The sonic blade is powered by a rechargeable battery and can be adjusted to different frequencies for various cutting tasks. For example, a higher frequency could be used for delicate cuts, while a lower frequency would be better suited for tougher materials. This innovative design would make cutting tasks faster, safer, and more efficient.",
    "**Smart Knife**: A knife with an integrated, AI-powered cutting system that adapts to the user's cutting style and preferences. The knife would come equipped with sensors that track the user's cutting movements, allowing the AI to learn and adjust the blade's sharpness, angle, and speed in real-time. This smart knife would provide personalized cutting experiences, making it easier for users to achieve precise cuts and reducing fatigue.",
    "**Edible Knife**: A knife made from a unique, plant-based material that is not only biodegradable but also edible. This knife would be perfect for chefs and food enthusiasts who want to minimize waste and create a unique dining experience. The edible knife could be designed to dissolve in water or break down naturally, eliminating the need for disposal and reducing plastic waste.",
    "**Gravity Knife**: A knife that uses a combination of magnets and a rare-earth material to create a self-sharpening, gravity-defying blade. The knife would have a unique, curved design that allows it to pivot and self-sharpen, eliminating the need for manual sharpening. This innovative design would make the knife more durable and easier to use, especially for those with limited dexterity.",
    "**Nano-Knife**: A knife with a nanotechnology-infused blade that can cut through materials at the molecular level. The nano-knife would be made from a specialized material that can be programmed to cut specific materials, such as carbon fibers or advanced composites. This cutting-edge technology would revolutionize industries such as aerospace, automotive, and textiles."
