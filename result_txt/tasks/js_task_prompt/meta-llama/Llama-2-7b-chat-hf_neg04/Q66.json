    "Sustainable Energy: Create a private island with a focus on sustainable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Incorporate energy-efficient buildings and appliances, and invest in research and development of new renewable energy technologies.",
    "Eco-Friendly Transportation: Design the island with a network of electric and hydrogen fuel cell-powered transportation systems, including electric cars, bikes, and boats. This would reduce the carbon footprint of the island and create a zero-emission transportation network.",
    "Sustainable Agriculture: Develop a self-sufficient agricultural system that utilizes permaculture techniques, hydroponics, and vertical farming to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This would reduce the island's reliance on external food sources and create a sustainable food system.",
    "Water Management: Design the island with a comprehensive water management system that collects and recycles rainwater, greywater, and blackwater. Incorporate water-saving technologies, such as low-flow showerheads and toilets, and invest in desalination and wastewater treatment plants.",
    "Innovative Waste Management: Create a waste management system that minimizes the island's impact on the environment. Incorporate recycling and composting facilities, and invest in research and development of new waste-to-energy technologies. Additionally, design the island with a zero-waste policy, where all waste is either recycled, composted, or converted into energy."
