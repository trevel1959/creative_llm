    "**Modular Laundry Basket**: Design a modular laundry basket system that can be customized based on household needs. Each module could represent a different category (e.g., colors, whites, delicates) and can be detached for easy transport. Users can add or remove modules based on the size of their laundry load, and the modules can be stacked for compact storage when not in use. This design encourages organization and efficiency.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Utilize advanced materials that have self-cleaning properties or incorporate UV-C light technology to sanitize the interior of the basket regularly. This feature would help prevent odors and bacteria buildup, keeping the laundry area fresher and healthier. The basket could have a timer or be activated when closed to ensure it cleans itself after each use.",
    "**Foldable Laundry Basket with Built-in Ironing Board**: Create a foldable laundry basket that, when opened, reveals a built-in ironing board. This design would save space in smaller homes while providing a convenient solution for users to iron clothes right after they come out of the dryer. The ironing board could be designed with a heat-resistant surface and include compartments for holding the iron and starch, streamlining the laundry process.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket made entirely from recycled materials, emphasizing sustainability. Additionally, incorporate a design that encourages users to recycle their clothes, such as a detachable compartment for items that can be donated or repurposed. This basket could feature educational labels that inform users about sustainable laundry practices, fostering a more eco-conscious approach to laundry.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Hamper and Drying Rack**: Combine a laundry basket with a detachable hamper and an integrated collapsible drying rack. This multifunctional design would allow users to separate dirty laundry easily, store clean clothes, and dry delicate items without needing additional space. The drying rack could be designed to fold away neatly when not in use, maximizing space efficiency."
