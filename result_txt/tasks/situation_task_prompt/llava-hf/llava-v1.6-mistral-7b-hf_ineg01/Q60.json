    "**Time Banks**: Time banks are systems where individuals can exchange their time and skills with others. For example, a person with carpentry skills could offer to build a table for someone in exchange for help with gardening or another task. This system relies on trust and community engagement and can be set up at a local level.",
    "**Community Currencies**: Local communities could create their own currencies, which are not tied to the global economy. These currencies could be used to trade goods and services within the community. The value of the currency would be based on the needs and resources of the community, rather than on external factors.",
    "**Resource Sharing**: In a world without currency, people might focus on sharing resources rather than buying and selling. This could involve setting up community gardens, tool libraries, and other shared resources where individuals could access what they need without the need for money.",
    "**Skill Exchange**: People could trade skills and knowledge instead of money. For example, a person with expertise in technology could teach others in exchange for lessons in a different skill, such as cooking or dance.",
    "**Eco-Credit**: In a post-currency world, individuals could earn \"eco-credits\" for contributing to environmental sustainability efforts. These credits could then be used to trade goods and services within the community."
