    "**Water Purification System**: Develop a portable, self-sustaining water purification system that can remove dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants from water sources. This system could use advanced technologies like UV light, filtration, or even nanotechnology to purify water. It could be powered by solar energy, making it a reliable and eco-friendly solution for keeping clean.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cleaning Powders**: Create a line of natural, biodegradable cleaning powders made from plant-based ingredients like baking soda, coconut oil, and essential oils. These powders could be used for various cleaning tasks, from washing clothes to scrubbing surfaces, and would be gentler on skin and the environment than traditional soap.",
    "**Personal Air Cleaning Devices**: Design wearable or handheld devices that use advanced air filtration technology to remove dirt, dust, and other particles from the air, allowing people to breathe clean air and stay clean without soap. These devices could be powered by rechargeable batteries or even wearable energy harvesting technology.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabrics**: Develop innovative fabrics that can self-clean through advanced nanotechnology or other means, eliminating the need for soap or other cleaning agents. These fabrics could be integrated into clothing, bedding, or even building materials, providing a convenient and sustainable solution for keeping clean.",
    "**Hydrophobic Coatings**: Create specialized coatings that can be applied to surfaces to repel water and dirt, making cleaning easier and more efficient. These coatings could be used on clothing, furniture, or even building exteriors, reducing the need for soap and other cleaning agents. They could also be designed to be self-healing, restoring their hydrophobic properties over time."
