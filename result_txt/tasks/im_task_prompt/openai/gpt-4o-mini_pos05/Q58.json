    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Source**: Develop a hair dryer made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, incorporate a solar-powered option, allowing users to charge the dryer with solar energy, making it a more environmentally friendly choice. This would appeal to eco-conscious consumers and reduce the carbon footprint of hair styling.",
    "**Dual Functionality with a Straightening Option**: Create a hair dryer that can also function as a straightener. The device would have an adjustable nozzle that can be transformed into flat plates, allowing users to dry and straighten their hair simultaneously. This dual functionality would save time and reduce the need for multiple styling tools.",
    "**Built-in Hair Care Infuser**: Introduce a feature that allows users to infuse hair care products, such as oils or conditioners, into the airflow. The dryer would have a compartment for these products, which would be heated and dispersed as the hair is dried. This would provide a deep conditioning treatment while styling, enhancing the health and shine of the hair.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Design a hair dryer with advanced noise-canceling technology to minimize sound during operation. This could be achieved through a combination of sound-absorbing materials and specialized motor designs. A quieter hair dryer would make the experience more pleasant, especially for early morning or late-night users.",
    "**Customizable Aesthetic Options**: Offer a hair dryer with interchangeable outer shells that allow users to customize the look of their device. These shells could come in various colors, patterns, and textures, allowing individuals to express their personal style. This feature would not only make the hair dryer more visually appealing but also allow for easy replacement if the outer shell becomes damaged."
