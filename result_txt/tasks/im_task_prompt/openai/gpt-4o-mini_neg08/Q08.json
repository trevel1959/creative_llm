    "**Adjustable Temperature Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For example, a section could be specifically designed for dairy products, another for fruits and vegetables, and a separate zone for meats. Users could control the temperature settings through a digital interface, ensuring optimal preservation conditions for each type of food.",
    "**Built-in Water Filtration and Infuser**: Incorporate a built-in water filtration system that not only purifies tap water but also includes an infuser option for flavoring water with fruits, herbs, or vegetables. This would encourage healthier hydration habits and reduce the need for bottled drinks. The infuser could be designed to be removable for easy cleaning.",
    "**Sustainable Energy Mode**: Develop a refrigerator that can switch to a low-energy mode during peak electricity hours. This mode would adjust the compressor's activity and the internal temperature slightly to save energy without compromising food safety. Users could receive alerts about peak hours based on local energy provider data, allowing them to adjust usage patterns.",
    "**Interior Smart Lighting**: Implement LED lighting that adjusts based on the contents and user activity. For example, when the refrigerator door opens, the lights could brighten to make it easier to see the contents, and dim when closed. Additionally, different colors could indicate specific temperature zones or alert users to items that need to be consumed soon.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Features**: Introduce a self-cleaning function that utilizes UV-C light technology to sanitize the interior surfaces of the refrigerator. This feature would help reduce bacteria and odors, providing a healthier storage environment for food. Users could set the cleaning schedule based on their usage patterns, ensuring convenience and hygiene."
