    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a network of thin-film solar panels that can capture water vapor from the air, even in arid regions. These panels would be coated with a special membrane that can extract water from the air, condensing it into droplets. This water can then be collected and stored for future use.",
    "**Condensation-Based Water Collection**: Design a series of transparent, domed structures that can be placed in areas where rain is scarce. These domes would be equipped with a thin layer of water-repellent material on the inside, allowing water vapor to condense and collect on the surface. The collected water can then be channeled into a storage tank.",
    "**Evapotranspiration-Based Water Harvesting**: Create a system that mimics the natural process of evapotranspiration, where plants release water vapor into the air. This system would consist of a network of tubes filled with a special hydrogel that absorbs water from the soil and releases it as water vapor. The vapor would then be collected and condensed, providing a sustainable source of water.",
    "**Solar Still-Based Water Collection**: Develop a series of solar stills that can be placed in areas where rain is scarce. These stills would use the sun's heat to evaporate water from a shallow pool, which would then condense on a cool surface, allowing for collection and storage.",
    "**Bio-Inspired Water Collection**: Design a system that mimics the way certain plants, such as the \"velvet leaf\" plant, collect water from the air. This system would consist of a network of tiny, hair-like structures that can absorb water vapor from the air, allowing for efficient collection and storage."
