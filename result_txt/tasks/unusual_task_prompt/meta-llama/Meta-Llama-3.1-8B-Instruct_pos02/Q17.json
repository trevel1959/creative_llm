    "**Smart Coffee Mug with Temperature Control**: Design a coffee mug that can adjust its temperature to the perfect level for the drink inside. The mug would have a built-in heating or cooling element, allowing users to adjust the temperature to their liking. This could be controlled through a mobile app or a physical button on the mug. The mug could also have a built-in timer, so the user can set a specific temperature for a certain amount of time.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Coffee Mug**: Create a coffee mug that changes color or pattern based on the user's emotions. The mug would be equipped with a built-in sensor that detects the user's emotional state through their brain activity or heart rate. The mug could display a calming color scheme when the user is feeling stressed, or a vibrant color when they're feeling energized.",
    "**Self-Sustaining Coffee Mug**: Design a coffee mug that can harvest energy from the environment to keep the drink inside at the perfect temperature. The mug could be equipped with a small solar panel or thermoelectric generator, allowing it to harness energy from the sun or heat from the surroundings. This would eliminate the need for batteries or external power sources.",
    "**Coffee Mug with Personalized Flavor Profile**: Develop a coffee mug that can adapt to the user's taste preferences and suggest customized flavor profiles. The mug would be equipped with a built-in flavor analyzer that detects the user's taste preferences through their drinking habits. The mug could then suggest new flavors or brewing methods based on the user's preferences.",
    "**Augmented Reality Coffee Mug**: Create a coffee mug that brings the user's coffee to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. The mug would have a built-in display that projects AR content, such as animations, games, or educational information, onto the surface of the mug. The user could interact with the AR content using their smartphone or a separate controller. This could enhance the coffee-drinking experience and provide a unique form of entertainment."
