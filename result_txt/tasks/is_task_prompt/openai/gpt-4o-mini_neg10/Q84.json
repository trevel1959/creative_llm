The inhabitants, called Skyrunners, had wings crafted from ethereal silk, allowing them to glide gracefully between the floating structures. Every morning, they gathered at the Great Spire, where the Elders shared tales of the earth below, a place they had only seen in dreams. One day, a curious Skyrunner named Lira ventured too close to the edge and discovered a hidden staircase descending into the unknown. What lay below could change everything.",
