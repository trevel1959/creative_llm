    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Collection and Filtration System: Create a system that utilizes the sun's energy to collect and filter rainwater or ocean water, making it safe for consumption. This could involve constructing a large, curved mirror or reflective surface to focus sunlight onto a central point, where the water is collected and filtered through a series of membranes or sand filters. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Create a Sustainable Food System: Develop a system that allows for the growth of crops and livestock on the island. This could involve creating a greenhouse using natural materials like palm fronds or bamboo, and using the island's sunlight and rainwater to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Alternatively, you could create a system for raising fish or other seafood in a man-made pond or enclosure. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Build a Shelter Using Local Materials: Design and construct a shelter using materials found on the island, such as palm fronds, vines, and rocks. This could involve creating a dome-shaped structure using a frame of interconnected palm fronds and vines, covered in a layer of leaves or other waterproof material. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Create a Signaling Device: Develop a device that can be used to signal for help or communicate with any potential rescuers. This could involve creating a fire or smoke signal during the day, or using a mirror or other reflective surface to create a signal at night. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Create a Watercraft: Design and construct a watercraft using materials found on the island, such as driftwood, vines, and rocks. This could involve creating a raft or canoe that can be used to travel to nearby islands or signal for help. Confidence Score: 0.8"
