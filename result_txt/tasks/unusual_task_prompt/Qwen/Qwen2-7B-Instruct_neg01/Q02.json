    "**Interactive Virtual Reality Experience**: Design a virtual reality (VR) experience where participants are immersed in a world where they can manipulate objects with their minds. They control their movements through a motion-sensing glove that simulates the sensation of touching and manipulating virtual objects. The twist is that the VR system also incorporates a rubber hand illusion, making users believe that the virtual objects they're manipulating are actually touching a rubber hand in front of them.",
    "**Augmented Reality Art Installation**: Create an augmented reality art installation where visitors interact with digital art pieces by placing a rubber hand on a designated surface. As the hand touches various parts of the installation, it triggers different animations or changes to the artwork. This could be a dynamic, interactive way for people to engage with art and feel more connected to the piece.",
    "**Educational Tool for Sensory Perception**: Develop a device that allows individuals to experience the rubber hand illusion firsthand. The tool would consist of a mechanical arm with a rubber hand attached, which can move and touch objects in front of the user. By controlling the movements of the rubber hand through a controller, users can learn about the brain's ability to perceive sensations from a limb that doesn't physically exist.",
    "**Therapeutic Session for Body Image Issues**: Design a therapeutic session that uses a rubber hand to help individuals with body image issues. Participants wear a virtual reality headset and see themselves in a virtual environment where they control the movement of a rubber hand. By gradually increasing the size and appearance of the rubber hand, therapists can help patients overcome negative perceptions of their own bodies and build self-esteem.",
    "**Interactive Game for Motor Skill Development**: Create a video game that incorporates a rubber hand as a key element. Players must complete tasks using both their actual hands and the virtual rubber hand, requiring coordination between the two. This game could be tailored for children learning motor skills or adults looking to improve their dexterity and hand-eye coordination, while also offering a fun, immersive experience."
