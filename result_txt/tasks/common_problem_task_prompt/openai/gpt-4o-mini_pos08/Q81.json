    "**Venue Availability**: Finding a suitable venue that meets the technical requirements for screenings, such as sound and projection quality, can be a significant challenge. Additionally, venues may have scheduling conflicts. To address this, festival organizers should start searching for venues early and consider multiple locations. Having backup options and flexible scheduling can help mitigate this issue.",
    "**Film Selection Process**: Choosing which films to showcase can be contentious, as there may be differing opinions among the selection committee. This could lead to disputes and dissatisfaction among filmmakers and audiences. To ensure a fair selection process, organizers could implement a transparent voting system where all committee members can rank their choices. They could also establish clear criteria for selection, focusing on diversity, originality, and audience appeal.",
    "**Audience Engagement**: Attracting an audience to the festival can be challenging, especially if itâ€™s a new event. Without proper marketing and outreach, attendance may fall short of expectations. To enhance audience engagement, organizers could leverage social media campaigns, collaborate with local influencers, and offer early-bird ticket discounts. Creating interactive experiences, such as Q&A sessions with filmmakers, could also draw in more attendees.",
    "**Technical Issues**: Technical difficulties during screenings, such as equipment failure or poor sound quality, can severely impact the audience's experience. To prevent this, organizers should conduct thorough equipment checks and have backup systems in place. Additionally, hiring a skilled technical team to oversee the screenings can ensure smooth operations throughout the festival.",
    "**Legal and Licensing Issues**: Securing the rights to screen films can be a complex process involving contracts and negotiations with filmmakers and distributors. Failure to navigate this properly could result in legal repercussions. To manage this risk, organizers should consult with legal experts in film rights and licensing early in the planning process to ensure all necessary permissions are obtained."
