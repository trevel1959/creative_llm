    "Create a Natural Navigation System: Develop a system that utilizes natural cues, such as the position of the sun, moon, stars, and landmarks, to help individuals navigate. This could involve creating a series of maps that highlight the positions of these celestial bodies and landmarks at different times of day and year, allowing people to use them to determine their location. Additionally, develop a mobile app that can be used to observe and record the positions of these celestial bodies and landmarks in real-time, providing an accurate and reliable navigation system.",
    "Build a Community-Driven Mapping System: Create a crowdsourced mapping platform that relies on the collective knowledge of the community to create and maintain accurate maps. This platform could be accessible through a mobile app or website, allowing individuals to contribute their own knowledge and observations of their surroundings. By aggregating this data, a comprehensive and accurate map of the area could be created, providing a reliable means of navigation.",
    "Develop a Compass-Based Navigation System: Design a compass that incorporates advanced technology, such as GPS and magnetic sensors, to provide a more accurate and reliable means of navigation. This compass could be used in conjunction with a map or other navigation aids, providing a comprehensive navigation system that is easy to use and understand. Additionally, develop a mobile app that can be used to display the compass's readings and provide real-time navigation instructions.",
    "Utilize Animal Navigation Systems: Study the natural navigation systems of animals, such as migratory birds, sea turtles, and bees, to develop a new navigation system inspired by their abilities. For example, develop a system that uses magnetic fields and celestial cues to guide individuals, similar to the way that migratory birds use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. This system could be used in conjunction with other navigation aids, such as maps and GPS, to provide a more accurate and reliable means of navigation.",
    "Create a Personal Navigation System: Develop a personal navigation system that utilizes advanced technology, such as wearable devices and artificial intelligence, to provide a more accurate and reliable means of navigation. This system could include a wearable device, such as a smartwatch or fitness tracker, that incorporates GPS and other sensors to track an individual's location and provide real"
