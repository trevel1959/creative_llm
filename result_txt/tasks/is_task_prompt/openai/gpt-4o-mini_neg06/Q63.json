    "In a whimsical town, there was a school unlike any other—The School Where Pets are Teachers. Every classroom was led by a different animal. Mr. Whiskers, the wise old cat, taught math with yarn balls, while Miss Paws, the enthusiastic dog, inspired students to write stories through playful barks and wagging tails. The fish in the aquarium taught science, explaining the water cycle with splashes and bubbles. Students learned empathy and teamwork through the pets’ unique methods. One day, a shy girl named Lily found her voice when a parrot named Polly encouraged her to sing. It was a magical place where learning felt like play.",
