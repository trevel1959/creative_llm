    "**Pacing Issues**: A common problem in screenwriting is achieving the right pacing. If the story moves too slowly, viewers may lose interest; if it’s too fast, they may feel overwhelmed. Writers can use techniques such as alternating between high-stakes scenes and quieter moments to create a rhythm that keeps audiences engaged. Testing pacing through table reads can also help identify areas that need adjustment.",
    "**Dialogue Authenticity**: Crafting realistic dialogue can be challenging, as it must sound natural while advancing the plot. Poor dialogue can break immersion and lead to criticism. To combat this, writers should listen to real conversations, study different speech patterns, and consider each character's unique voice, ensuring that dialogue reflects their personality, background, and emotional state.",
    "**Plot Holes and Inconsistencies**: As the screenplay develops, plot holes or inconsistencies may arise, undermining the story’s credibility. These can be avoided by outlining the plot thoroughly before writing and keeping track of character actions and motivations throughout the script. Regularly revisiting the outline can help maintain coherence and address any potential issues early in the process.",
    "**Balancing Themes and Messages**: Screenplays often explore multiple themes, and it can be difficult to balance them without overwhelming the audience. Writers should focus on a central theme while allowing secondary themes to emerge organically. Using symbolism and subtext can enrich the narrative without overtly stating the message, creating a more engaging experience for viewers.",
    "**Marketability and Audience Expectations**: Writers may struggle with creating a story that is both original and marketable. While it’s important to stay true to one’s vision, understanding audience expectations and genre conventions can help. Conducting market research and analyzing successful films in the same genre can provide insights into what resonates with viewers, allowing writers to innovate within established frameworks."
