    "A pencil sharpener that uses AI to optimize sharpening for different types of pencils: The pencil sharpener of the future could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the pencil and determine the best sharpening angle and pressure to use. This would result in a more consistent and efficient sharpening process, with fewer pencils ending up too sharp or too dull. The AI could be trained on a dataset of different pencil types and their ideal sharpening parameters, and could even learn from user preferences over time.",
    "A pencil sharpener that doubles as a desk organizer: This pencil sharpener would have a built-in tray or compartment to hold other office supplies, such as paper clips, rubber bands, or pushpins. The sharpener could be designed with a slanted top surface to make it easy to slide items into the tray, and the sharpener itself could be angled to make it easy to access the sharpener without knocking over other items on the desk.",
    "A pencil sharpener that uses solar power: This pencil sharpener would be powered by a built-in solar panel, allowing it to sharpen pencils without the need for electricity. The solar panel could be positioned on a desk or table, and the sharpener could be designed to rotate or tilt to maximize exposure to sunlight. This would make it a great option for campers, travelers, or anyone who wants to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "A pencil sharpener that uses a unique sharpening mechanism: Instead of using a traditional rotating blade or stone, this pencil sharpener could use a mechanism that pulls the graphite core of the pencil through a series of tiny cutting blades. This would result in a cleaner, more precise sharpening action, with less waste and fewer pencil fragments. The mechanism could be designed to be easy to clean and maintain, and could even be reversible for when the pencil becomes too dull to sharpen.",
    "A pencil sharpener that incorporates a built-in eraser: This pencil sharpener would have a built-in eraser that could be used"
