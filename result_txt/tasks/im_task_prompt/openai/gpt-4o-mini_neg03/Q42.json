    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Create a suitcase with a modular design that allows users to add or remove compartments based on their needs. For example, travelers could attach extra sections for shoes, electronics, or clothing. This would cater to different types of trips, whether itâ€™s a business trip, vacation, or adventure travel, making it versatile and user-friendly.",
    "**Built-in Charging Station**: Equip the suitcase with solar panels or a built-in battery pack that can charge electronic devices on the go. This would include USB ports and wireless charging pads on the exterior, allowing travelers to charge their phones, tablets, and other gadgets while waiting at the airport or during layovers.",
    "**Self-weighing Feature**: Integrate a weight sensor that automatically measures the suitcase's weight and displays it on a digital screen. This would help travelers avoid overweight baggage fees by allowing them to check the weight of their suitcase before heading to the airport. The suitcase could also suggest optimal packing arrangements to balance weight distribution.",
    "**Expandable and Collapsible Design**: Design a suitcase that can expand or collapse based on the amount of items packed. This would be particularly useful for travelers who might buy souvenirs or additional items during their trip. The suitcase could feature a zipper system that allows it to grow in size, maintaining its structural integrity while providing extra space when needed.",
    "**Integrated Security Features**: Incorporate advanced security features such as biometric locks (fingerprint recognition) or a facial recognition system. This would ensure that only the owner can access the suitcase, providing peace of mind against theft. Additionally, a built-in alarm system could alert the owner if someone tries to tamper with it."
