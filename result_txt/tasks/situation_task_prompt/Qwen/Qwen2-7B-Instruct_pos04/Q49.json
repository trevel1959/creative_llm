    "**Water Balloon System:** In this innovative approach, a system of water balloons is installed around your home's perimeter. When a fire breaks out, sensors alert the homeowner, who then releases the balloons into the air near the fire. The balloons burst, releasing water that can extinguish the flames or cool them down, buying valuable time for professional help to arrive.",
    "**Smart Mirror Fire Extinguisher System:** A smart mirror is integrated into your bathroom or kitchen, doubling as both a functional piece of decor and a safety device. Upon detecting smoke or heat, the mirror automatically transforms into a full-sized fire extinguisher, providing an immediate response to any fire that may start within the home.",
    "**Solar-Powered Water Cannon:** A large solar-powered water cannon is strategically placed on your property, equipped with a high-pressure hose that can be directed at potential fire threats. This system uses the sun's energy to power its operation, ensuring it remains ready for use even during power outages. When activated, it can quickly douse fires with a powerful stream of water.",
    "**Smoke-Activated Fire Retardant Curtain:** Specialized curtains are installed in key areas of your home, such as hallways or doorways leading to bedrooms. These curtains contain a fire retardant material that becomes activated when smoke is detected. As the curtains expand, they block the spread of fire and smoke, giving occupants more time to evacuate safely.",
    "**Portable Fire Blanket with Emergency Exit Ladder:** A portable fire blanket, designed to withstand high temperatures, is kept within easy reach in every room. It can be used to smother small fires. Additionally, a retractable emergency exit ladder is attached to the outside of your home, providing a quick escape route if all doors and windows become blocked by flames. Both items can be easily packed and transported during an evacuation."
