    "Community Gardens: With supermarkets closing down, communities could come together to create their own gardens. This would provide a sustainable source of fresh produce, ensuring everyone has access to food. Community gardens could be set up in public spaces, such as parks or empty lots, and could be maintained through volunteer work. This would not only provide food but also foster a sense of community and social interaction.",
    "Urban Agriculture: Cities could invest in urban agriculture projects, such as rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and hydroponic systems. These systems could provide a reliable source of fresh produce, even in urban areas with limited space. Urban agriculture could also help to reduce food transportation costs and carbon emissions, making it a more sustainable option.",
    "Online Food Co-ops: With supermarkets closing, people could turn to online food co-ops. These co-ops could be run by volunteers and would allow members to order food directly from local farmers and producers. This would ensure that people still have access to fresh, locally produced food, even if they cannot physically visit a supermarket. Online co-ops could also help to support local businesses and promote sustainable agriculture.",
    "Food Scavenging: In the absence of supermarkets, people could turn to food scavenging. This involves foraging for food in the wild, such as berries, nuts, and edible plants. Food scavenging could provide a reliable source of food, especially in areas with abundant wild resources. However, it is important to ensure that foraging is done sustainably and responsibly, to avoid over-harvesting and degrading the environment.",
    "Bartering and Exchange: With supermarkets closed, people could turn to bartering and exchange systems to obtain food. This involves exchanging goods or services for food, rather than using money. Bartering and exchange systems could help to promote community and social interaction, as people work together to obtain the food they need. For example, someone might exchange their gardening skills for a basket of fresh produce. This system could also help to promote sustainable agriculture and reduce waste, as people are incentivized to use and value their skills and resources more carefully."
