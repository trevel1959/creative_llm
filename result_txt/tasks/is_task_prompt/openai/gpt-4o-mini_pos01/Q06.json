    "Once, a vibrant rainbow arched across the sky, radiating colors that brought joy to all who beheld it. One day, a grumpy cloud named Nimbus cast a shadow over the rainbow, draining it of its colors. The rainbow, now gray and sad, wandered the world searching for its lost hues. Along its journey, it met a wise old owl who advised it to find happiness within. As the rainbow helped others rediscover their joy, it slowly regained its colors, brighter than ever. Finally, Nimbus, touched by the rainbowâ€™s kindness, cleared away, allowing the colors to shine brilliantly once more.",
