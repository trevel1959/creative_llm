    "**Customizable Blades**: Design interchangeable fan blades that allow users to easily swap out colors, materials, or patterns to match their home decor. This could be achieved with a simple click-and-lock mechanism, allowing for quick changes without needing tools. Seasonal or holiday-themed blades could be marketed, encouraging users to refresh their space throughout the year.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Combine the functionality of a ceiling fan with an air purification system. The fan could feature a built-in HEPA filter and UV light that cleans the air while circulating it, providing dual benefits of comfort and health. Users could control the air purification settings via a mobile app, receiving alerts when itâ€™s time to replace the filter.",
    "**Mood Lighting Features**: Integrate LED lights into the fan design that can change colors and brightness based on user preferences or time of day. Using a mobile app or remote control, users could set different lighting moods, such as a warm glow for relaxation or bright white light for productivity. The fan could even sync with music for an ambient lighting experience during gatherings.",
    "**Solar-Powered Option**: Develop a ceiling fan that can be powered by solar energy. This could involve a small solar panel installed on the roof or a dedicated solar array, allowing the fan to operate independently of the electrical grid. This eco-friendly option would appeal to sustainability-conscious consumers and help reduce electricity costs.",
    "**Personalized Airflow Control**: Create a fan with adjustable airflow direction that can be controlled remotely. Users could set the fan to oscillate, or lock it in a specific direction, such as directly above or angled toward a seating area. This feature could be particularly useful in larger rooms where airflow needs to be directed strategically."
