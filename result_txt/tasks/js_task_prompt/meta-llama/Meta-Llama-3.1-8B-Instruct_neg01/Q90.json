    "**Bioluminescent Skin**: I'd give humans the ability to produce their own light, like fireflies. This would allow people to communicate and express themselves in a completely new way. Imagine being able to convey emotions and ideas through colorful, dynamic displays on your skin. It would also enable people to navigate in the dark without needing artificial light sources, reducing energy consumption and making outdoor activities safer. Bioluminescent skin could also be used for artistic purposes, creating mesmerizing light shows that blend with the environment.",
    "**Regenerative Limbs**: I'd grant humans the ability to regrow lost or damaged limbs, like some species of salamanders. This would revolutionize the way we approach injuries and illnesses. No more worrying about prosthetics or amputations; people could simply regrow their limbs, restoring their full mobility and independence. This ability would also reduce the need for medical interventions and surgeries, making healthcare more efficient and cost-effective.",
    "**Enhanced Sensory Perception**: I'd give humans a range of new senses, such as electroreception (like sharks), echolocation (like bats), or even a heightened sense of smell (like bloodhounds). This would allow people to perceive their environment in entirely new ways, from detecting subtle changes in their surroundings to navigating through the dark. Imagine being able to \"see\" the world through a combination of senses, gaining a deeper understanding of the world and its intricate connections.",
    "**Environmental Adaptation**: I'd allow humans to adapt to extreme environments, like the freezing cold or scorching heat, without needing special equipment. This would enable people to live and thrive in areas previously inhospitable to humans, from the Arctic tundra to the driest deserts. Humans could also adapt to changing environmental conditions, like rising sea levels or extreme weather events, by modifying their physiology to cope with these challenges.",
    "**Neural Interface**: I'd give humans a direct neural interface, allowing them to control technology with their minds. This would revolutionize the way we interact with devices, from smartphones to computers. Imagine being able to type emails, play games, or control robots with mere thoughts. This ability would also enable people with disabilities to interact with the world in new and empowering ways, breaking down barriers and promoting inclusivity."
