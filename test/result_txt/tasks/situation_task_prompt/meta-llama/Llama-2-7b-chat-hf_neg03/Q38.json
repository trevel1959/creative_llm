    "Natural Soap Nets: Create a network of underground gardens filled with natural soap-producing plants, such as soapberry trees, to provide a sustainable source of cleaning products. These gardens could be maintained by a team of trained \"Soap Keepers\" who would harvest the soap and distribute it to communities in need.",
    "Solar-Powered Distillation: Develop a solar-powered still that uses the sun's energy to purify water and create a concentrated cleaning solution. This solution could be diluted with water as needed for various cleaning tasks, such as washing dishes or cleaning floors.",
    "Air-Powered Cleaning: Invent an air-powered cleaning device that uses compressed air to propel tiny cleaning particles, such as microscopic bubbles or nanoparticles, to clean surfaces. This device could be powered by a hand-crank or a small solar panel, making it a portable and eco-friendly cleaning solution.",
    "Water-Saving Showerheads: Develop a showerhead that uses a patented water-saving technology to reduce water usage by up to 75%. This showerhead would use a combination of air pressure and water flow to create a powerful cleaning experience while minimizing water waste.",
    "Microbe-Based Cleaning: Create a line of cleaning products that utilize beneficial microorganisms to clean and disinfect surfaces. These products would be safe for use around people and pets, and could be applied to a variety of surfaces, including countertops, floors, and upholstery. The microorganisms would break down dirt and grime, leaving surfaces clean and sanitized."
