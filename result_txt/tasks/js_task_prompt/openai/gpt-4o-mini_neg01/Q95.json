    "**Aquatic Oasis with Interactive Tidal Zones**: This habitat would feature a large central water body that mimics a coastal ecosystem with tidal pools, coral reefs, and mangroves. The habitat would be equipped with interactive tidal zones that can be adjusted to simulate different tidal levels, allowing visitors to observe how various marine species adapt to changing environments. This habitat would include glass tunnels for visitors to walk through, providing a 360-degree view of marine life, and would also incorporate educational displays about ocean conservation.",
    "**Desert Mirage Habitat**: Inspired by desert ecosystems, this habitat would feature a series of micro-environments that replicate different desert landscapes, such as sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and oasis areas. The habitat would use innovative cooling technologies to create shaded areas and mimic the temperature fluctuations of a desert environment. Animals like fennec foxes, tortoises, and various reptiles would thrive in this setting. Interactive sand dunes would allow visitors to dig and discover hidden treasures, simulating the experience of exploring a desert while learning about its unique inhabitants.",
    "**Cave and Cavern Ecosystem**: This habitat would simulate a subterranean environment, featuring a network of caves and caverns filled with stalactites, stalagmites, and bioluminescent plants. It would house nocturnal animals like bats, cave-dwelling fish, and unique invertebrates. The habitat would be designed with low-light areas to mimic natural cave darkness, allowing visitors to experience the wonders of a hidden ecosystem. Educational displays would explain the importance of caves in biodiversity and conservation efforts.",
    "**Mountain Stream Habitat**: This habitat would replicate a mountainous region with flowing streams, rocky outcrops, and alpine vegetation. It would include a series of waterfalls and pools that provide diverse aquatic environments for species such as trout, otters, and amphibians. The design would feature walking paths that allow visitors to experience the habitat from different elevations, with lookout points to observe animals in their natural behaviors. Educational signage would highlight the significance of freshwater ecosystems and the threats they face.",
    "**Urban Jungle Habitat**: This habitat would blend urban architecture with natural elements, creating a vibrant space where wildlife can thrive alongside human activity. Vertical gardens, green roofs, and artificial trees would provide habitats for birds, insects, and small mammals. The habitat would include areas for community involvement, such as workshops on urban gardening and wildlife conservation. This design would serve as a model for sustainable urban living, demonstrating how cities can coexist with nature."
