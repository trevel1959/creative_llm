    "In a quiet village, a peculiar sunflower seed was planted by a hopeful gardener named Elara. While all her other flowers thrived, this sunflower stubbornly refused to bloom. Days turned into weeks, and villagers whispered about the “cursed” seed. Elara, however, nurtured it with love, believing in its hidden potential. One fateful night, under a full moon, the sunflower began to shimmer, revealing a luminous glow. Instead of petals, it sprouted tiny stars that twinkled in the darkness. Elara realized that beauty comes in many forms, and sometimes, what seems like failure is simply a different kind of magic waiting to unfold.",
