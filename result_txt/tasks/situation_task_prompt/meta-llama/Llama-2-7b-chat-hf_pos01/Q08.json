    "Desalination Plants: Building desalination plants in coastal areas could be a solution to obtain clean drinking water. These plants use reverse osmosis or other filtration methods to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it suitable for drinking. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting and storing rainwater could be an effective way to obtain clean drinking water. This can be done through the construction of rainwater harvesting systems, which can be connected to buildings and homes to collect and store rainwater. The water can then be treated and purified for drinking. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Algae-based Water Filtration: Algae can be used to purify water through a process called phytoremediation. This involves using algae to absorb and break down pollutants in water, resulting in clean and safe drinking water. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Atmospheric water harvesting involves collecting water from the air using specialized equipment. This water can then be purified and used for drinking. This method can be particularly useful in areas with low rainfall or where traditional water sources are polluted. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "Bio-filter Bottles: Developing bio-filter bottles that use natural organisms to purify water could be a creative solution to obtain clean drinking water. These bottles would contain a special filter that would remove impurities and contaminants from the water, making it safe to drink. Confidence Score: 0.6"
