    "**Multi-Purpose Sweater with Built-in Storage**: Design a sweater with hidden pockets and compartments that can hold essentials like a phone, wallet, keys, and even a small water bottle. These pockets could be strategically placed to maintain the sweater's aesthetic while providing functionality. Additionally, a detachable pouch could be included for even more versatility, allowing users to carry their belongings without needing a bag.",
    "**Temperature-Regulating Fabric**: Develop a sweater made from advanced materials that actively regulate body temperature. Utilizing phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb, store, and release heat as needed, this sweater could keep the wearer comfortable in various climates. It could be particularly useful for those who frequently transition between indoor and outdoor environments.",
    "**Interactive Sweater with LED Displays**: Introduce a sweater with customizable LED panels that allow wearers to display messages, images, or patterns. Controlled via a smartphone app, users could express their creativity or mood through dynamic visuals. This could also be a fun way to promote events or support causes, making the sweater a conversation starter.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Sweater with Recycled Materials**: Create a line of sweaters made entirely from recycled fibers, such as plastic bottles or discarded textiles. This sustainable approach not only reduces waste but also raises awareness about environmental issues. Additionally, the sweaters could be designed to be easily disassembled for recycling at the end of their life cycle, encouraging a circular fashion economy.",
    "**Sweater with Built-in Heating Elements**: Design a sweater with integrated, adjustable heating elements powered by a rechargeable battery. Ideal for cold weather, the wearer could control the temperature through a smartphone app or a simple button on the sweater. This would provide comfort during outdoor activities like hiking or skiing, making it a practical choice for winter sports enthusiasts."
