    "**Structural Integrity**: Ensuring that the tree house is structurally sound is crucial. This involves selecting appropriate materials that can resist decay, rot, and insects, as well as using proper construction techniques to prevent sagging, collapse, or instability. A common issue could be finding the right balance between using natural materials for an authentic look and modern materials that provide better durability and safety.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: Building a tree house requires considering the impact on the local ecosystem. Potential problems include disturbing the tree's natural growth, altering the habitat of the surrounding flora and fauna, and potentially attracting wildlife that could pose a threat to humans or the tree. Solutions might involve consulting with ecologists or arborists, choosing less sensitive tree species, and designing the tree house with minimal disturbance to the environment.",
    "**Access and Egress**: Accessing and exiting the tree house safely is another concern. One issue might be creating a stable and safe ladder or rope system that can accommodate users of different sizes and ages without compromising the integrity of the tree. Another problem could be ensuring there is a clear path for emergency evacuation, especially if the tree house is located high up in the canopy.",
    "**Aesthetic Considerations**: While the primary function of a tree house is practical, its appearance can also play a significant role in user satisfaction. A common challenge is finding a design that harmonizes with the natural surroundings while also being visually appealing. This might involve balancing simplicity with creativity, respecting the existing landscape, and choosing colors and materials that blend well with the environment.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on where the tree house is built, there may be local regulations that need to be followed. This could include obtaining permits, adhering to zoning laws, and ensuring compliance with building codes. Non-compliance could result in fines, legal issues, or the requirement to dismantle the structure."
