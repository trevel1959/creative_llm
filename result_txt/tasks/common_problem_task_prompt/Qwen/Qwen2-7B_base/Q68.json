    "Isolation: The vastness of the ocean could lead to feelings of isolation and anxiety for the crew, especially if they are inexperienced. This could impact their mental health and performance on the boat.",
    "Lighting: Navigating in the dark can be dangerous and difficult. The crew will need to rely on navigational lights and instruments to guide the boat safely, without risking a collision with other ships or hitting an object.",
    "Power source: Sailing boats typically rely on solar panels or gasoline generators to power their on-board systems. However, with an extended trip across the Atlantic, the crew may need to find an alternative power source, such as wind turbines or solar batteries.",
    "Water supply: The crew will need to have a sufficient supply of fresh water to last for the duration of the trip. However, maintaining water quality and purity could be challenging in the open ocean.",
    "Food supply: The crew will need to have a sufficient supply of food to last for the duration of the trip, including fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat. However, with an extended trip across the ocean, finding a suitable food source could be challenging."
