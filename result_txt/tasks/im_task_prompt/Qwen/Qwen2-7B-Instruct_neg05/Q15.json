    "**Designing a \"Lost and Found\" Backpack System for Schools**: Develop a backpack that can be linked to a centralized lost and found system in schools. The backpack would have an embedded chip that, when scanned at any school's designated area, immediately displays the owner's contact information on a screen or through a connected app. This not only reduces the time spent looking for lost items but also promotes responsibility among students.",
    "**Smart Backpack with Health Monitoring Features**: Create a backpack that integrates health monitoring features. It could include sensors to track physical activity levels, monitor posture while studying or sitting, and even remind users to stand up and stretch after prolonged periods of sitting. Additionally, it could have a feature that monitors air quality inside the bag (especially useful for those carrying lunches) and alerts the user if conditions are unhealthy.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Self-Charging Backpack**: Design a backpack that harnesses kinetic energy from walking or running to charge its internal battery. This would not only help students keep their devices powered up without needing an electrical outlet but also encourage more physical activity. The backpack could further include a solar panel to capture sunlight, making it an environmentally sustainable solution.",
    "**Customizable, Modular Backpack for Different Needs**: Offer a backpack that allows users to swap out different modules based on their needs. For example, a student might need a module with extra pockets for books, another with compartments for laptops, and yet another with hydration and snack storage. This flexibility caters to various educational environments and personal preferences, making the backpack more versatile and practical.",
    "**Innovative Backpack with Augmented Reality Navigation**: Develop a backpack equipped with AR technology to assist in navigation, particularly useful for students commuting to school. The backpack could display directions overlaid on the real world via its AR interface, helping them navigate unfamiliar routes easily. This feature could also integrate safety elements, such as alerting the user to potential hazards or providing emergency contact information in case of accidents."
