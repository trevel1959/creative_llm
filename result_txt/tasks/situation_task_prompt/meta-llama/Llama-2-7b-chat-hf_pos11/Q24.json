    "Create a community-based support system: People with poor vision could band together to form a support group where they can share their experiences, provide emotional support, and offer practical help. They could also collaborate on advocacy efforts to raise awareness about the challenges of living without glasses or contact lenses.",
    "Develop new assistive technologies: Engineers and inventors could focus on creating new technologies to help people with poor vision navigate their surroundings. For example, specialized canes with sensors to detect obstacles, smart glasses with augmented reality displays, or even brain-computer interfaces that can translate visual information into sound or touch.",
    "Emphasize alternative forms of communication: With the loss of glasses and contact lenses, people might rely more heavily on non-visual forms of communication, such as speech, sign language, or Braille. Communities could invest in training programs to teach these skills and promote greater understanding and inclusion.",
    "Redesign public spaces for accessibility: Cities and towns could redesign public spaces to be more accessible and inclusive for people with poor vision. This could involve installing tactile paving, audible signals for crosswalks, and other features that make it easier for people to navigate without vision.",
    "Foster a culture of acceptance: Rather than viewing the loss of glasses and contact lenses as a disability, people could embrace it as an opportunity to develop new coping strategies and adaptations. By promoting a culture of acceptance and inclusivity, people with poor vision could feel more confident and empowered in their daily lives."
