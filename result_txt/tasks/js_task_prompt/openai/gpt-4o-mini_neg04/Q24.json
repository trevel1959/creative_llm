    "**Integrated Smart Mobility System**: A seamless, multi-modal transportation system would connect every part of the city. This would include electric autonomous buses, bike-sharing programs, pedestrian-friendly pathways, and aerial tramways for longer distances. Real-time data would be available through a city app, allowing residents to plan their journeys efficiently and reduce reliance on personal vehicles, thereby minimizing traffic congestion and pollution.",
    "**Renewable Energy Hubs**: The city would be powered entirely by renewable energy sources, including solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems. Each neighborhood would have its own energy hub that generates and stores energy locally. Residents could monitor their energy consumption and production through smart meters, and excess energy could be sold back to the grid, creating a self-sustaining energy economy.",
    "**Cultural Exchange Zones**: Designated areas within the city would celebrate cultural diversity through art, food, and performances. These zones would host regular festivals, workshops, and exhibitions that encourage interaction between different cultural groups. By promoting understanding and collaboration, these spaces would strengthen community ties and enhance social cohesion.",
    "**Adaptive Reuse Architecture**: The city would prioritize adaptive reuse of existing structures, transforming old factories, warehouses, and historic buildings into vibrant community centers, housing, and commercial spaces. This approach would preserve the city's history while minimizing waste and the need for new construction. Innovative design would ensure that these spaces meet modern needs while maintaining their unique character.",
    "**Health and Wellness Corridors**: Dedicated corridors for health and wellness would be integrated into the cityâ€™s layout. These would include walking and biking paths, outdoor gyms, meditation gardens, and spaces for yoga and fitness classes. Local health professionals would offer free wellness workshops and activities, encouraging a holistic approach to health that encompasses physical, mental, and emotional well-being."
