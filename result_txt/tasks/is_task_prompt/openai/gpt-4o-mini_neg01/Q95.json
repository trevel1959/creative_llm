    "Once in a vibrant jungle, there lived a fierce tiger named Tigris, renowned for his strength and majesty. However, Tigris harbored a secret fear—mice. Their tiny squeaks sent him scurrying up trees, leaving the jungle animals baffled. One day, a mouse named Mimi approached him, trembling. “Why are you scared of me?” she squeaked. Tigris sighed, “You’re so small, yet so quick!” Mimi smiled and offered to teach him agility. Together, they practiced, and Tigris learned that size doesn’t define strength.
