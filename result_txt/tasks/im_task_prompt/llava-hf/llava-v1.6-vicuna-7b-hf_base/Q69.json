    "Customizable yoga mat sizes: A yoga mat can be a bit of a one-size-fits-most solution, especially for beginners. A potential improvement could be to create adjustable, modular mats that can fit multiple users and provide an individual fit for different body types.",
    "Integrated yoga blocks and straps: While yoga blocks and straps are useful accessories, they add extra steps to the practice. To improve this, a yoga mat could incorporate built-in block and strap holders that simplify storage and allow for easy access during practice.",
    "Aroma diffusing yoga mat: A yoga practice is not only a physical activity, but also a mental one. The incorporation of an aroma diffusing feature into a yoga mat could potentially enhance the overall experience by providing calming scents to improve focus and relaxation.",
    "Yoga mat case or bag: Traveling with a yoga mat can be cumbersome and challenging to protect in a gym bag. An improvement would be to create a lightweight, durable, and compact case or bag designed specifically for yoga mats, making it easier for users to transport and store their mat without damage.",
    "Personalized yoga mat prints and designs: Currently, many yoga mats offer generic designs and basic geometric patterns. By incorporating a personalization option that allows users to upload their own photos, patterns, or text, yoga mats can become a unique reflection of the individual practitioner, enhancing the overall experience."
