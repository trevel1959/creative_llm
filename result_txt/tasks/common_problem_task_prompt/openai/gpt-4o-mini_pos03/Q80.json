    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Food waste is a significant concern at weddings, often leading to excess leftovers that go uneaten. Couples should seek caterers who specialize in farm-to-table options, using locally sourced and seasonal ingredients to minimize transportation emissions. Additionally, they could plan for a buffet or family-style meal to allow guests to take only what they will eat, and consider donating any leftovers to local shelters or food banks.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Invitations and Favors**: Traditional paper invitations can contribute to deforestation and waste. Couples can opt for digital invitations or use recycled paper for printed ones. For wedding favors, instead of the typical plastic trinkets, they could choose sustainable items like seed packets, small potted plants, or handmade soaps that guests can use or plant, reducing waste and leaving a positive impact.",
    "**Attire and Accessories**: The fashion industry is a significant contributor to pollution, and wedding attire is no exception. Couples should consider renting dresses and suits instead of purchasing new ones or sourcing outfits from second-hand shops. Additionally, they can support local artisans by choosing handmade accessories or decorations, which can also reduce the carbon footprint associated with shipping.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Guests traveling to the wedding can create a considerable carbon footprint, especially if they are flying. Couples could encourage carpooling or arrange for a shuttle service from a central location to minimize individual vehicle use. Providing information about public transportation options or nearby accommodations can also help guests make eco-conscious travel choices.",
    "**Waste Management Strategies**: Weddings often generate a lot of waste, from food scraps to decorations. Couples can implement a comprehensive waste management plan by setting up clearly labeled recycling and composting stations at the venue. They could also work with vendors who prioritize sustainable practices, ensuring that all materials used are recyclable or compostable, and plan for proper disposal after the event."
