    "Vertical Garden Farm: Instead of traditional soil-based farming, a vertical garden farm can be set up using hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics techniques. This approach allows for higher yields in smaller spaces, reduces water usage, and minimizes the need for soil.",
    "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA): Set up a CSA program where members of the community can purchase fresh produce directly from the farm. This approach encourages community involvement and supports local agriculture.",
    "Agroforestry: Incorporate agroforestry practices into the farm, such as intercropping and integrating trees and shrubs with crops. This approach improves soil health, reduces erosion, and provides habitat for beneficial insects and birds.",
    "Farm-to-Table Restaurant: Establish a farm-to-table restaurant on the property, where customers can enjoy fresh, organic meals made from ingredients grown on the farm. This approach not only supports local agriculture but also creates a unique dining experience.",
    "Educational Program: Offer educational programs for schools, community groups, and individuals interested in sustainable agriculture. This approach can include workshops, tours, and hands-on experiences that teach about organic farming practices, soil health, and sustainable living."
