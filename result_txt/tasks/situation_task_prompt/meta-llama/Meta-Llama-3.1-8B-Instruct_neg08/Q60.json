    "**Global Exchange Platforms**: In a world without traditional currency, a network of exchange platforms would emerge, allowing individuals to trade goods and services directly. These platforms would be built on blockchain technology, ensuring secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. Users could create profiles, list their skills, and offer goods for exchange. For instance, a person could offer their skills as a graphic designer in exchange for a meal at a local restaurant. The platform would facilitate the exchange, and the transaction would be recorded on the blockchain, creating a permanent and unalterable record.",
    "**Time Banking**: Time banking is a system where individuals exchange time and skills rather than money. In a world without currency, time banking would become the primary means of exchange. People would earn time credits by contributing their skills, and these credits could be redeemed for services or goods offered by others. For example, a person could earn time credits by helping a neighbor with their gardening, and then use those credits to get a massage or have their car repaired.",
    "**Resource-Based Economy**: In a resource-based economy, resources are allocated based on need rather than monetary value. A global network of community-managed resource centers would be established, where people could access goods and services without the need for currency. These centers would be stocked with goods produced locally, using renewable energy and sustainable practices. People would contribute their skills and time to the community, and in return, they would have access to the resources they need.",
    "**Gift Economy**: A gift economy is a system where goods and services are exchanged without expectation of payment or reciprocity. In a world without currency, gift economies would flourish. People would share their skills, goods, and services with others, not for personal gain, but to build relationships, foster community, and create a sense of belonging. For example, a person might offer their cooking skills to a neighbor in need, or share their knowledge of permaculture with a community garden.",
    "**Skill-Based Bartering**: Skill-based bartering involves exchanging skills and expertise directly for goods and services. In a world without currency, this system would become the norm. People would offer their skills in exchange for what they need, creating a web of reciprocal relationships. For instance, a person might offer their skills as a carpenter in exchange for a massage, or trade their knowledge of photography for a meal at a local restaurant. This system would promote collaboration, creativity, and a sense of community."
