    "Create a rainwater harvesting system: Build a rainwater collection system that captures and stores rainwater for irrigation purposes. This can be done by installing a roof-based rainwater harvesting system, which collects rainwater and stores it in a tank or cistern. The stored water can then be used for watering plants, flushing toilets, and other non-potable uses.",
    "Use greywater for irrigation: Greywater is wastewater generated from sinks, showers, and washing machines. It can be treated and reused for irrigation purposes. A greywater system collects and treats greywater, and then distributes it to plants and gardens. This can help reduce the amount of potable water used for irrigation.",
    "Develop a hydroponic system: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. This can be a great option for watering plants in a world without rain, as the nutrient solution can be tailored to the specific needs of the plants and can be reused multiple times. Hydroponic systems can be indoor or outdoor, and can be used for a variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs.",
    "Utilize fog collection: In areas with high humidity, fog can be collected and used for irrigation. Fog collection systems use a network of fine mesh screens or fog nets to capture fog and condense it into water. This water can then be stored in tanks or cisterns for use in irrigation.",
    "Create a symbiotic relationship with nature: Instead of relying on artificial irrigation methods, consider creating a symbiotic relationship with nature. This can involve planting plants that are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, and using natural methods of pest control and fertilization. By working with nature, rather than against it, you can create a more sustainable and resilient garden that is less reliant on external water sources."
