    "**Smart Hairbrush with Hair Analysis**: Create a smart hairbrush equipped with sensors that analyze hair health as you brush. The brush could measure factors like hair thickness, moisture levels, and breakage. An accompanying app could provide personalized hair care tips, product recommendations, and track the user's hair health over time, encouraging better hair care routines.",
    "**Adjustable Bristle Firmness**: Innovate a hairbrush with adjustable bristle firmness. Users could switch between soft, medium, and firm bristles based on their hair type and styling needs. This could be achieved through a simple twist mechanism or interchangeable bristle heads, allowing for a customized brushing experience that caters to different hair textures and styles.",
    "**Multi-Function Hairbrush**: Develop a hairbrush that combines multiple hair care tools into one. For instance, one side could have traditional bristles for detangling, while the other side features a heated straightening plate. This would allow users to detangle and style their hair simultaneously, saving time and reducing the number of tools needed in their hair care routine.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hairbrush**: Create a sustainable hairbrush made from biodegradable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Additionally, the brush could feature replaceable bristle heads, reducing waste over time. An eco-conscious design would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and promote sustainable beauty practices.",
    "**Hairbrush with Aromatherapy**: Design a hairbrush that incorporates aromatherapy features. The handle could contain a small reservoir for essential oils, which would be released through tiny vents while brushing. This would not only enhance the hair care experience with pleasant scents but could also provide therapeutic benefits, such as calming lavender or invigorating citrus."
