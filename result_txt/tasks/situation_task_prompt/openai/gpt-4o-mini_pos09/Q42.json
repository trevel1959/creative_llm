    "**Water Collection and Filtration**: Finding a reliable source of drinking water is crucial. I would create a rainwater collection system using large leaves or any available containers to gather rainwater. To ensure it's safe to drink, I would use solar disinfection by filling clear bottles with water and leaving them in the sun for several hours. Additionally, I would search for freshwater streams or ponds, ensuring to filter the water through cloth or sand to remove impurities.",
    "**Food Foraging and Fishing Techniques**: To sustain myself, I would start foraging for edible plants, fruits, and nuts, identifying them through visual clues and any prior knowledge of local flora. For protein, I would create simple fishing tools like spears or traps using sharp stones and sticks. Iâ€™d also explore tidal pools for shellfish and learn to recognize the best times for fishing, such as during low tide.",
    "**Fire Creation for Cooking and Warmth**: Fire is essential for cooking food, boiling water, and keeping warm. I would gather dry twigs, leaves, and larger logs to create a fire pit. Using a friction method like a bow drill or a fire plough, I would create an ember and transfer it to my tinder bundle. Once the fire is established, I could use it for cooking, warding off insects, and signaling for help with smoke signals.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create visible signals. This could include building large SOS signs on the beach using rocks or logs and maintaining a smoke signal with a fire during the day. I would also gather reflective materials, such as shiny shells or pieces of glass, to create a signal that could catch the attention of passing ships or planes.",
    "**Crafting Tools and Weapons**: To improve my chances of survival, I would start crafting tools from available materials. Sharp stones could be fashioned into knives for cutting, while wooden sticks could be carved into fishing spears or digging sticks. These tools would help me with food preparation, building, and foraging more effectively."
