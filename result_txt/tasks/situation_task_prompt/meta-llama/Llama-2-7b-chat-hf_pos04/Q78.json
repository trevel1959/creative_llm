    "Outdoor Adventures: Without toys, children could use their surroundings as their playground. They could climb trees, explore rocks, and create games using nature's elements. For example, they could play \"I Spy\" with different types of leaves, or create a \"Nature Obstacle Course\" using branches and rocks.",
    "DIY Toys: Children could learn to create their own toys using recycled materials like cardboard, paper, and fabric. They could make puppets, marble runs, or even build their own board games. This would encourage creativity, problem-solving, and sustainability.",
    "Imaginative Storytelling: Without toys, children could use their imaginations to create their own stories and games. They could act out scenarios with their friends, using their voices, bodies, and surroundings as props. This would help develop their creativity, communication, and social skills.",
    "Sports and Games: Children could learn various sports and games that don't require toys, such as soccer, basketball, or tag. These activities would provide exercise, teamwork, and social interaction. They could also create their own games using items found around the house, like a balloon volleyball game or a hula hoop contest.",
    "Music and Dance: Children could use music and dance to create their own play. They could learn to play simple instruments like maracas, tambourines, or even create their own instruments using household items. They could also create dance routines using different styles of music, like hip-hop, ballet, or folk dancing. This would help develop their creativity, coordination, and self-expression."
