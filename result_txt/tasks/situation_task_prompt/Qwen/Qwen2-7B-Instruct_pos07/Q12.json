    "**Solar Thermal Heating:** Construct a system using large solar collectors to capture sunlight and transfer heat to a fluid. This heated fluid is then circulated through pipes embedded in the floor or walls of your home, warming the entire structure passively.",
    "**Geothermal Heat Pumps:** Install a geothermal heat pump which uses the constant temperature of the ground as a heat source or sink. In colder months, it extracts heat from the ground and pumps it into your home. During warmer periods, it moves heat out of your home into the cooler ground.",
    "**Biochar Stoves:** Build or use biochar stoves that incorporate biochar—a highly porous carbon material produced by slow-burning biomass—which can store and release heat over time. These stoves are fueled by wood, but because they utilize biochar, they burn hotter and longer than traditional wood stoves.",
    "**Heat Recycling:** Create an efficient system to recycle heat generated during daily activities such as cooking, showering, or washing clothes. For example, the heat from hot water used in the shower could be captured and used to pre-heat water for the next shower, or to heat the house.",
    "**Insulated Passive House:** Design your home with high-quality insulation, triple-pane windows, and other energy-efficient building techniques to minimize the need for heating. By maximizing thermal mass and ensuring a well-sealed envelope, your home will maintain warmth with minimal external energy input."
