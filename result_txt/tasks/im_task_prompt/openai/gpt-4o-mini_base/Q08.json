    "**Adjustable Temperature Zones**: Design a refrigerator with customizable temperature zones that can be adjusted based on the type of food stored. For instance, a dedicated zone for fruits and vegetables that maintains optimal humidity and temperature, while another zone could be tailored for dairy or meats. This would enhance food preservation and ensure that each item is stored under the best conditions.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Assistant**: Incorporate a touchscreen interface that allows users to input the ingredients they have in the fridge. The refrigerator could then suggest recipes based on those ingredients, making meal planning easier and reducing food waste. The interface could also connect to online recipe databases, allowing users to explore new dishes and cooking techniques.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**: Develop a refrigerator that uses eco-friendly cooling technology, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration, which eliminates the need for harmful refrigerants. This would not only make the refrigerator more environmentally friendly but could also lead to lower energy consumption and quieter operation.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Interior**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light or ozone technology to sanitize the interior of the refrigerator. This would help eliminate odors, bacteria, and mold without the need for harsh chemicals. Users could activate the cleaning cycle with the push of a button, ensuring a clean and hygienic environment for food storage.",
    "**Flexible Shelving and Compartments**: Create a refrigerator with modular shelving and compartments that can be easily adjusted or removed based on the user's needs. This flexibility would allow for better organization and the ability to store larger items, such as pizza boxes or party platters, without compromising space."
