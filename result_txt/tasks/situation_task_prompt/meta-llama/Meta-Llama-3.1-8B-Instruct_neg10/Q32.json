    "**DIY Toothbrush Subscription Box**: Imagine a monthly subscription box that delivers a new, unique toothbrush design every month. Each toothbrush would be crafted from sustainable materials and have a fun, playful shape. For example, one month it might be a toothbrush shaped like a cat, and the next month it could be a toothbrush shaped like a guitar. The twist? Each toothbrush would come with a set of \"toothpaste tablets\" that are infused with different flavors and scents, like strawberry or mint. Users could mix and match the toothpaste tablets to create their own custom flavors. This would add a fun element to oral hygiene and make it feel less like a chore.",
    "**Tooth-Friendly Foods**: In a world without dentists, people would need to focus on consuming tooth-friendly foods that are gentle on their teeth and gums. One idea could be a line of \"Tooth-Friendly\" snack bars made from ingredients like apples, carrots, and celery. These bars would be designed to be crunchy and satisfying, but also easy on the teeth. Another idea could be a line of \"Tooth-Friendly\" smoothies made from ingredients like coconut milk, spinach, and berries. These smoothies would be designed to be refreshing and healthy, while also being gentle on the teeth.",
    "**At-Home Whitening Kits**: In a world without dentists, people would need to find alternative ways to whiten their teeth. One idea could be an at-home whitening kit that uses a combination of natural ingredients like activated charcoal, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide. The kit could come with a set of pre-made whitening trays that users could fill with the whitening solution and wear for a set amount of time each day. The kit could also come with a set of \"whitening sponges\" that users could use to gently scrub their teeth and remove surface stains.",
    "**Tooth-Shaping Molds**: In a world without dentists, people would need to find alternative ways to shape and mold their teeth. One idea could be a line of tooth-shaping molds that users could use to create custom shapes and designs on their teeth. These molds could be made from a variety of materials like silicone, metal, or even 3D-printed plastic. Users could choose from a variety of pre-made designs or create their own custom designs using a 3D printer.",
