    "Inflatable Pillow Fort: In this scenario, you could create an inflatable pillow fort that provides the necessary support and comfort for a good night's sleep. The fort could be made of multiple inflatable pillows that are connected together to form a large, soft structure. You could also add some additional features like a built-in fan to keep the fort cool and a built-in nightlight for ambiance.",
    "Balloon Pillow: Another creative solution would be to use balloons as pillows. You could blow up a few balloons to the desired size and shape, and then tie them off to create a soft, round pillow. This solution would not only provide comfort but also add a fun and playful touch to your sleeping arrangement.",
    "Pillowcase with Built-In Support: You could create a pillowcase with built-in support to help you rest your head comfortably. The pillowcase could be made of a stretchy material that provides extra cushioning and support, and it could also have some sort of built-in headrest or contour to cradle your head.",
    "Cushion Tree: If all pillows disappeared, you could create a makeshift cushion tree to rest your head on. You could use a large, sturdy branch or a piece of wood as the base, and then cover it with a pile of soft cushions and blankets. This would create a cozy and comfortable resting spot that would allow you to get a good night's sleep.",
    "DIY Pillow Alternative: Another option would be to create a DIY pillow alternative using household items. For example, you could use a rolled-up towel or a large, flat stone as a makeshift pillow. You could also use a piece of cardboard or a flat piece of wood as a base, and then cover it with a pile of soft blankets or cushions. This would provide a soft and comfortable surface to rest your head on, even without traditional pillows."
