    "Zoo-Themed Mini Golf Course: Create a mini golf course within the zoo that incorporates various animal habitats and environments. Each hole could feature a different animal species, such as a piranha-infested Amazon River hole or a giraffe-necked golf ball return. Visitors could also encounter interactive elements, like a \"roar-ing\" lion's den or a \"slithery\" snake tunnel.",
    "Animal-Themed Spa and Wellness Center: Offer a spa and wellness center within the zoo where visitors can relax and rejuvenate while surrounded by their favorite animals. Treatments could include animal-inspired massages, such as a \"penguin-firming\" massage or a \"zebra-stripe\" facial. Visitors could also enjoy a \"wild\" yoga class or take a dip in an \"aquatic\" pool filled with colorful fish and other aquatic creatures.",
    "Interactive Animal Encounters: Create a series of interactive experiences where visitors can get up close and personal with various animal species. For example, visitors could feed and pet a friendly alpaca, learn about the social behavior of capuchin monkeys, or even take a \"penguin for a walk\" (using a specialized harness and trainers). These encounters could be tailored to different age groups and interests, from toddlers to animal enthusiasts.",
    "Virtual Reality Animal Tours: Develop a virtual reality experience that allows visitors to explore different animal habitats and ecosystems from the comfort of a VR headset. Visitors could take a virtual tour of the Amazon rainforest, observe penguins in Antarctica, or even visit a coral reef teeming with marine life. This would provide a unique and immersive way for visitors to learn about and appreciate different animal species and their habitats.",
    "Sustainable Animal Products Marketplace: Create a marketplace within the zoo where visitors can purchase sustainable and eco-friendly products made from animal byproducts. For example, visitors could purchase handbags made from recycled plastic bags found in sea turtle habitats or soaps made from the ashes of burned wood collected from the forest. This"
