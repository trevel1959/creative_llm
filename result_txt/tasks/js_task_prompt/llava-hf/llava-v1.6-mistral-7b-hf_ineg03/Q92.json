    "**Solar System with Multiple Suns**: Imagine a solar system with multiple suns at the center, each with its own set of planets orbiting around it. This would create a complex and dynamic system, with each sun exerting its own gravitational pull on the planets. It could also lead to interesting astronomical phenomena, such as eclipses and gravitational lensing.",
    "**Nested Solar System**: In this design, the planets would be arranged in a series of concentric circles around the sun, similar to the structure of an onion. The innermost circle would be the innermost planet, while the outermost circle would be the outermost planet. This would create a visually striking and unique solar system.",
    "**Solar System with Interconnected Planets**: In this design, the planets would be interconnected by a network of gravitational pull points. These points would allow for the possibility of travel between planets without the need for rockets or spacecraft. This would create a solar system that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "**Solar System with Floating Planets**: In this redesign, the planets would be floating in space, with no orbits around the sun. This would create a dynamic and fluid solar system, with the planets drifting and moving freely. It could also lead to interesting interactions between the planets, such as collisions and gravitational tugs.",
    "**Solar System with Mobile Planets**: In this design, the planets would be mobile, with the ability to move and change their positions in the solar system. This would create a constantly evolving and dynamic solar system, with new interactions and relationships between the planets."
