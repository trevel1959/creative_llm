    "**Eco-Friendly Cart with Solar-Powered Charging**: Design a shopping cart made from recycled materials that includes solar panels on the top. These panels could power a small battery that operates features like a digital display, USB charging ports for devices, and LED lights for nighttime shopping. This eco-friendly approach not only promotes sustainability but also adds practical functionality for shoppers who need to charge their devices while on the go.",
    "**Multi-Functional Cart with Modular Attachments**: Create a shopping cart with modular components that can be customized based on the shopper's needs. For example, attachments could include a cooler for perishable items, a child seat, or a basket specifically designed for fragile items. This versatility would cater to different shopping scenarios, making the cart more user-friendly and efficient.",
    "**Navigation Assistance Cart**: Integrate GPS technology into the shopping cart, allowing it to provide navigation assistance within large stores. Shoppers could input their shopping list, and the cart would guide them through the aisles to find each item efficiently. This feature could also include alerts for special promotions or items on sale nearby, enhancing the shopping experience and saving time.",
    "**Health Monitoring Cart**: Design a shopping cart that includes health monitoring features, such as a built-in scale to weigh items and calculate nutritional information. The cart could also have a heart rate monitor and an activity tracker for shoppers who want to maintain their health while shopping. By integrating wellness features, the cart could encourage healthier choices and promote a balanced lifestyle.",
    "**Self-Driving Cart**: Develop a self-driving shopping cart that follows the shopper around the store using advanced sensors and AI technology. Shoppers could simply walk around the store, and the cart would autonomously navigate to keep up with them, allowing them to have their hands free for browsing. This innovation would not only enhance convenience but also reduce the physical strain of pushing a cart."
