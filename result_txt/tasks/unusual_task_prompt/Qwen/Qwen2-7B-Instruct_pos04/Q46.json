    "**Inflatable Pillowcase for Air Travel**: Design a pillowcase that can be inflated using a small pump or breath. This would provide additional comfort and support for necks and heads during long flights. The case could have adjustable straps to secure it around the seat headrest, making it suitable for various airplane seats.",
    "**Interactive Pillowcase for Children**: Create a series of pillowcases that are interactive and educational for children. Each pillowcase features a different character or theme from a book, movie, or cartoon. Inside, there could be a small compartment where children store books or toys related to the theme. Additionally, the backside of the pillowcase could have pockets for parents to write notes or reminders for their kids.",
    "**Smart Pillowcase for Sleep Tracking**: Develop a pillowcase that includes sensors to monitor sleep patterns. It could track the user's movements, heart rate, and sleep stages. This information could be transmitted to a smartphone app, which would provide insights into the quality of sleep, offer tips for better sleep hygiene, and even suggest relaxation techniques based on the data collected.",
    "**Heated Pillowcase for Cold Weather**: In response to the cold temperatures, design a pillowcase that has built-in heating elements. These elements can be activated by plugging the pillowcase into an electrical outlet or using a battery pack. This would keep the head warm and cozy, especially beneficial for people who suffer from cold feet and hands at night.",
    "**Refrigerated Pillowcase for Hot Nights**: For individuals who struggle with hot nights, create a pillowcase that cools down when exposed to air. This could involve incorporating phase change materials within the pillowcase that absorb heat when in contact with skin and release it when cooler air is present. This design could also feature a fan or small air circulation system powered by a USB charger to enhance cooling effects."
