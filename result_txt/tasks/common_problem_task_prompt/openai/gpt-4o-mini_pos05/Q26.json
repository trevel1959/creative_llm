    "**Weather Conditions**: The weather on Mount Everest can be unpredictable and harsh, with sudden storms and extreme temperatures. Climbers may encounter blizzards, high winds, and temperatures plummeting well below freezing. This can lead to dangerous conditions, such as frostbite or hypothermia. Climbers need to closely monitor weather forecasts and have contingency plans for sudden changes.",
    "**Crowding and Traffic Jams**: During peak climbing seasons, the number of climbers attempting to summit Everest can lead to dangerous bottlenecks, especially at critical points like the Hillary Step. This congestion can increase the risk of accidents, limit oxygen supply for climbers waiting in line, and create panic situations. Effective management and timing of ascents are crucial to avoid these crowd-related issues.",
    "**Equipment Failure**: Climbers rely heavily on specialized gear, such as oxygen tanks, climbing harnesses, and weatherproof clothing. Any malfunction or failure of this equipment can have dire consequences. Climbers must ensure their gear is thoroughly checked and tested before the expedition and carry backups for essential items.",
    "**Physical and Mental Exhaustion**: The physical demands of climbing Everest can lead to extreme fatigue and mental strain. Long hours of climbing, combined with low oxygen levels, can impair judgment and decision-making abilities. Climbers need to be aware of their physical limits and prioritize rest and nutrition to maintain their strength and mental clarity.",
    "**Environmental Impact**: The increasing number of climbers on Everest has raised concerns about environmental degradation, including waste management issues and littering. Climbers often leave behind trash, human waste, and abandoned gear, which can harm the fragile ecosystem. A focus on responsible climbing practices and adherence to \"leave no trace\" principles is essential to preserve the mountain."
