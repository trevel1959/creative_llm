    "**Smart Suitcase with Built-in Technology**: Design a suitcase that incorporates smart technology to enhance travel experiences. The suitcase could feature built-in scales to ensure it doesn't exceed airline weight limits, an integrated power bank for charging devices, a Bluetooth tracker to locate the bag if lost, and a camera for taking photos from various angles. The suitcase could also have a voice assistant function to provide travel tips and information about the destination.",
    "**Biodegradable Suitcase**: Develop a suitcase made from biodegradable materials such as plant-based plastics or natural fibers like bamboo or hemp. This product would not only be environmentally friendly but also lightweight and durable. The suitcase could come in different sizes and styles to cater to various needs, including backpacks, duffel bags, and rolling suitcases. Marketing efforts could focus on sustainability and reducing waste.",
    "**Personalized Suitcase Collection System**: Create a unique system where each suitcase has a personalized design or engraving based on the traveler's preferences, interests, or even a memorable trip. This could involve a custom design service where customers can choose colors, patterns, or even upload images to be printed on the suitcase. The system could also include a QR code or NFC chip that links directly to the customer's travel plans or hotel reservations, making check-in and baggage handling easier.",
    "**Self-Healing Suitcase Material**: Develop a suitcase made from a material that can repair minor damages, such as scratches or small tears, without external intervention. This could be achieved through the use of self-healing polymers or advanced composite materials that can \"mend\" themselves over time when exposed to heat or pressure. This feature would be particularly appealing to frequent travelers who may occasionally mishandle their luggage.",
    "**Inflatable Suitcase for Air Travel**: Introduce a suitcase designed specifically for air travel that can be easily compressed and inflated. This suitcase would consist of a durable, lightweight fabric that can be rolled up and secured with straps when not in use, significantly reducing its volume. When ready for travel, the suitcase would be inflated to its full size using a built-in pump or by attaching it to an electrical outlet. This concept would save space in overhead compartments and reduce the risk of losing luggage due to size constraints."
