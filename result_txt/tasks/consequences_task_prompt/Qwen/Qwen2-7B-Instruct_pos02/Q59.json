    "**Global Innovation Boom**: If everyone became geniuses overnight, we could expect an unprecedented surge in innovation across all fields. This could lead to rapid advancements in science, technology, medicine, art, and more. For instance, scientists could potentially develop new cures for diseases within weeks or months instead of years. This would dramatically accelerate progress and potentially solve some of the world's most pressing issues.",
    "**Shift in Education Paradigms**: The education system would need to undergo significant changes. Instead of focusing on rote learning, schools would have to shift towards fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. This could lead to a more holistic educational approach that caters to diverse learning styles and abilities, enhancing the overall quality of education worldwide.",
    "**Economic Transformation**: The economy would experience a radical transformation as the workforce becomes more skilled and productive. There would be a shift from labor-intensive industries to knowledge-intensive sectors. This could result in increased productivity, economic growth, and a potential reduction in unemployment rates. However, it could also lead to a widening gap between those who benefit from this transformation and those left behind due to obsolescence of certain skills.",
    "**Social Dynamics and Inequality**: With everyone becoming geniuses, social dynamics might change significantly. Traditional markers of success such as wealth and status might lose their significance, leading to a more equitable society where intelligence and creativity are celebrated over material possessions. However, this could also exacerbate existing inequalities if not all individuals have equal access to resources, education, and opportunities.",
    "**Cultural Impact**: The cultural landscape would likely transform drastically. Literature, music, visual arts, and other creative fields would flourish as everyone would have the capacity to produce high-quality work. This could lead to a rich tapestry of global culture that blends diverse perspectives and innovations. However, it might also lead to a homogenization of culture as universal genius might overshadow local traditions and unique cultural expressions. "
