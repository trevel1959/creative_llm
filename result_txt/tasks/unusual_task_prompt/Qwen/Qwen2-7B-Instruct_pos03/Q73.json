    "**Interactive Light Bulb Lamp**: Create a light bulb lamp that can change its color based on user interaction or environmental conditions. For instance, when someone claps their hands nearby, the lamp could change to a random color from a predefined palette. Alternatively, it could sense ambient light levels and adjust its brightness accordingly, becoming dimmer during the day and brighter at night.",
    "**Educational Light Bulb Flashcards**: Design a light bulb-shaped device that doubles as an educational tool. When flipped upside down, the light bulb would display a question on one side and the answer on the other, encouraging self-testing. It could be programmed with various subjects or topics, making it a versatile learning aid for children.",
    "**Therapeutic Light Therapy Lamp**: Develop a light bulb that emits specific wavelengths of light designed to help alleviate symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or improve sleep patterns. The lamp could have adjustable settings for different times of the day or seasons, ensuring that users receive the appropriate type of light exposure for their needs.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Integrate a smart feature into the light bulb so it can be controlled through a smartphone app or voice commands via an AI assistant like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This allows users to control the light's brightness, color temperature, and even set schedules for daily usage, creating a more personalized lighting experience.",
    "**Recycling and Upcycling Initiative**: Launch a campaign where used light bulbs are collected and repurposed into new, innovative products. For example, old incandescent bulbs could be transformed into decorative wall sconces or chandeliers, while LED bulbs could be used to create unique pieces of art. This initiative not only reduces waste but also encourages creativity in reusing everyday objects."
