    "**Self-Closing Umbrella**: Imagine an umbrella that can automatically close itself when not in use. Using a combination of sensors and a small motor, the umbrella would detect when it's no longer needed (e.g., when the user enters a building) and fold itself up. This would prevent the hassle of manually closing it and keep the surrounding area dry.",
    "**UV-Blocking Umbrella**: This innovative umbrella would be designed with advanced materials that provide not only rain protection but also superior UV protection. With a special coating, the fabric would block harmful UV rays, making it ideal for sunny days as well. It could even change color based on UV exposure, alerting users to the intensity of the sun.",
    "**Rechargeable LED Umbrella**: This umbrella would feature integrated LED lights around the rim, providing illumination for nighttime use. It would have a rechargeable battery that can be powered via USB, allowing users to see and be seen in low-light conditions. This would enhance safety for those walking at night or during inclement weather.",
    "**Convertible Umbrella Chair**: This dual-purpose design would allow the umbrella to transform into a lightweight chair. The handle would have a collapsible frame that, when detached from the umbrella canopy, could be set up as a comfortable seat. This would be perfect for outdoor events, picnics, or waiting in line, providing both shade and a place to rest.",
    "**Personalized Umbrella with Mood Lighting**: This umbrella would come equipped with LED lights that change colors based on the user's mood or the environment. Controlled through a smartphone app, users could select different colors or patterns, making it a fun accessory for festivals, concerts, or casual outings. It would also enhance visibility during nighttime use."
