    "Virtual Note-Taking App: Develop a virtual note-taking app that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to project handwritten notes onto any surface. Users can take notes by physically writing on the projection, allowing for a more intuitive and interactive experience. The app can also integrate with other AI-powered tools, such as voice-to-text or image recognition, to enhance note-taking capabilities.",
    "Memory Mesh Network: Create a decentralized network of interconnected nodes, each representing a different aspect of important information. Users can contribute to the network by sharing their own notes and ideas, creating a collective repository of knowledge. The network can use blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and security, allowing for a trustworthy and accessible record of information.",
    "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): Develop a BCI device that allows users to record and store information directly into their brains. By using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, the device can detect neural activity and translate it into digital data. This allows users to record information in a more direct and intuitive manner, without the need for physical writing or typing.",
    "Holographic Data Storage: Develop a holographic data storage system that uses lasers to record information onto photopolymer holograms. These holograms can be stored in a variety of formats, including 2D and 3D holograms, and can be accessed using a laser-equipped reader. This technology offers high storage capacity, durability, and security, making it an ideal solution for long-term data archival.",
    "Neural Network-based Information Retrieval: Create a neural network-based information retrieval system that can analyze and classify information based on the user's brain activity. By using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to monitor the user's brain waves, the system can identify the user's current mental state and retrieve relevant information from a vast database. This system can be used for a variety of applications, including education, research, and personal organization."
