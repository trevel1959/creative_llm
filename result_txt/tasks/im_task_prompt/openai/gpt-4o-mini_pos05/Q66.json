    "**Multi-Functional Folding Design**:    Design a picnic basket that transforms into multiple functional items, such as a picnic blanket, portable table, or even seating. The basket could feature foldable sides that expand into a sturdy table, and the bottom could unroll into a water-resistant blanket. This multifunctionality reduces the number of items needed for a picnic and increases convenience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Modular Design**:    Create a picnic basket made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled plastics, with a modular design that allows users to customize compartments based on their needs. Removable dividers could help organize food, drinks, and utensils, while the eco-friendly approach would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Built-in Bluetooth Speaker and LED Lights**:    Enhance the picnic atmosphere by integrating a waterproof Bluetooth speaker into the basket, allowing users to play music while enjoying their meal. Additionally, include LED lights that can be activated for evening picnics, providing soft illumination to create a cozy ambiance without the need for candles or flashlights.",
    "**Integrated Food Preservation Technology**:    Incorporate vacuum-sealing technology within the basket that allows users to vacuum-seal their food items before heading out. This feature would help preserve freshness and prevent spoilage, making it ideal for longer outings. The basket could also have a built-in compartment for reusable vacuum-seal bags, promoting waste reduction.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Picnic Planner**:    Equip the picnic basket with an AR feature accessible through a companion app. Users could scan the basket with their smartphones to receive suggestions on picnic recipes, meal pairings, and even games or activities based on the number of people and location. This interactive feature would add an element of fun and planning to the picnic experience."
