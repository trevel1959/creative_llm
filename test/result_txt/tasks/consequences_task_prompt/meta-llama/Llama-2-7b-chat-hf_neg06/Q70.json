    "Gravity would be affected: If the speed of light were reduced by half, the strength of gravity would also be affected. The distance between planets and stars would appear to shrink, and the gravitational pull of these celestial bodies would be weaker. This would have significant implications for astronomy and space exploration.",
    "Time dilation would increase: With a slower speed of light, time would appear to pass more slowly near massive objects with strong gravitational fields, such as black holes or neutron stars. This means that time would pass more quickly near these objects relative to distant locations. This effect would be most pronounced in the vicinity of these objects and would have profound implications for our understanding of space-time.",
    "The cosmic microwave background radiation would change: The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. If the speed of light were reduced, the CMB would appear to shift in frequency, providing a new window into the early universe. This could potentially reveal new information about the origins of the universe and the formation of structure within it.",
    "The universe would appear younger: With a slower speed of light, the universe would appear younger than it actually is. This is because the age of the universe is calculated based on the speed of light, and if that speed were reduced, the universe would appear to be younger. This could have significant implications for our understanding of the history and evolution of the universe.",
    "Black holes would be affected: If the speed of light were reduced, the event horizon of a black hole would also be affected. The event horizon is the point of no return around a black hole, beyond which anything that enters cannot escape. With a slower speed of light, the event horizon would be farther away from the black hole, potentially making it easier to escape. This could have significant implications for our understanding of black holes and their role in the universe."
