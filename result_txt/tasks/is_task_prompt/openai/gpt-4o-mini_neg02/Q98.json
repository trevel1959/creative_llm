    "In the heart of a forgotten village, there was a small puddle that sparkled under the sun, refusing to dry up despite the seasons changing. The villagers whispered tales of a lost fairy who had wept there, her tears forming the magical puddle. One day, curious young Mia dipped her fingers into the water and felt a rush of warmth. To her surprise, the puddle began to glow, revealing glimpses of the fairy's world. Each day, Mia returned, sharing stories of her life, and in return, the fairy gifted her wisdom. The puddle became a bridge between two worlds, never drying up, forever alive with magic.",
