    "**Nature-Based Remedies**: Since all medicines would be gone, we'd have to rely on natural remedies to treat a common cold. I'd use a combination of herbal teas, such as elderberry, ginger, and eucalyptus, to help alleviate symptoms like congestion and coughing. The elderberry tea, in particular, has antiviral properties that could help combat the underlying infection. To boost the immune system, I'd recommend consuming foods rich in vitamin C, like citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens.",
    "**Honey and Lemon**: A classic combination! I'd use raw, unfiltered honey to soothe a sore throat and provide antimicrobial properties to combat the infection. Paired with lemon juice, which has antiviral properties, this mixture would help break down mucus and reduce inflammation. To enhance the effects, I'd add a pinch of salt to help loosen up mucus and promote drainage.",
    "**Steam Inhalation**: This ancient technique would be a game-changer in a world without medicines. I'd use a bowl of hot water, add eucalyptus oil or menthol, and inhale the steam to help loosen up mucus and reduce congestion. This would also help ease a sore throat and open up airways, making it easier to breathe. To take it to the next level, I'd add a few drops of peppermint oil to help calm the mind and body.",
    "**Rest and Hydration**: Sometimes, the best medicine is simply taking it easy and letting the body recover on its own. I'd recommend plenty of rest, staying hydrated with plenty of fluids like water, herbal teas, and clear broths. This would help the body replenish lost fluids, reduce inflammation, and support the immune system in fighting off the infection.",
    "**Spicy Foods**: Spicy foods have natural decongestant properties that could help alleviate congestion and sinus pressure. I'd recommend consuming foods like chili peppers, wasabi, or horseradish to help clear out mucus and promote drainage. The capsaicin in these foods would also help reduce inflammation and ease a sore throat. To make it more palatable, I'd pair spicy foods with a soothing drink like ginger tea or warm milk."
