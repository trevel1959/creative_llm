    "**DIY Drum Set**: Cut out holes of varying sizes to create a set of drums using rubber gloves. Fill each glove with different materials (e.g., beads, rice, or small pebbles) to produce distinct sounds. Attach a makeshift stand using sticks or dowels to create an impromptu drum set.",
    "**Puppetry Props**: Use rubber gloves as puppets or as props for hand puppets. Add some creative embellishments like felt, glitter, or fabric paint to create unique characters. This can be a fun and interactive way to tell stories or engage children in educational activities.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Planters**: Transform rubber gloves into biodegradable planters by filling them with potting soil and planting small herbs or succulents. As the gloves degrade, they will naturally compost, reducing waste and promoting sustainable gardening practices.",
    "**Sensory Toys**: Fill rubber gloves with different textures like beads, sand, or rice, and use them as sensory toys for children with special needs. This can help stimulate their senses and provide a calming, soothing experience.",
    "**Garden Markers**: Write the names of plants on rubber gloves and use them as garden markers. As the gloves degrade, they will naturally compost, and the plant names will be revealed, serving as a reminder of the garden's layout."
