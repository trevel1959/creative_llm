    "**Foldable and Stackable Design**: Create a laundry basket that can easily fold flat when not in use. This design would be ideal for small living spaces where storage is limited. Additionally, it could feature interlocking mechanisms that allow multiple baskets to stack securely on top of each other, maximizing vertical space and keeping laundry organized.",
    "**Multi-Compartment Basket with Color-Coding**: Design a laundry basket with multiple compartments that are color-coded for different types of laundry (e.g., whites, colors, delicates). Each compartment could have its own detachable liner that can be removed and washed separately, making it easier to sort and transport laundry to the washing machine.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Fabric**: Develop a laundry basket made from self-cleaning fabric that uses nanotechnology to repel dirt, odors, and stains. This would reduce the need for frequent washing of the basket itself, keeping it fresh and hygienic, and extending its lifespan.",
    "**Built-in Hamper with Odor Neutralizer**: Incorporate a built-in odor-neutralizing system into the laundry basket, using activated charcoal or other natural materials that absorb smells. This would be particularly useful for households with pets or for those who often leave dirty laundry sitting for longer periods.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Integrated Folding Surface**: Design a laundry basket that features a detachable lid that doubles as a folding surface. When itâ€™s time to fold clothes, users can simply remove the lid and use it as a flat surface, complete with measuring lines for folding shirts or pants evenly."
