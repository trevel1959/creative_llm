    "**Sunflower Selfie Garden**: Create a vibrant and Instagrammable garden featuring a series of sunflowers with built-in selfie stations. Each sunflower would have a unique, oversized smile painted on it, inviting visitors to take photos with the bright yellow blooms. The garden could include interactive elements, such as a \"smile-meter\" that tracks the number of happy selfies taken, or a \"sunflower selfie challenge\" where visitors can share their photos on social media using a branded hashtag.",
    "**Sunflower Symbiosis**: Develop a public art installation where sunflowers are paired with other plants that benefit from their growth, such as bees and butterflies. The installation could include a series of sunflowers with built-in \"nursery\" pots that contain the beneficial plants, creating a symbiotic relationship between the two. This concept highlights the interconnectedness of nature and encourages visitors to appreciate the importance of pollinators.",
    "**Sunflower Soundscapes**: Create an immersive experience where visitors can walk through a field of sunflowers and hear the sounds of nature, such as birds chirping, bees buzzing, and gentle rustling of leaves. The soundscapes could be triggered by sensors that detect movement, creating an interactive and dynamic experience. This concept combines the visual appeal of sunflowers with the auditory experience of nature.",
    "**Sunflower Sculpture Garden**: Design a sculpture garden featuring large-scale sunflower-inspired sculptures made from sustainable materials, such as recycled metal or reclaimed wood. The sculptures could be arranged to create a winding path, inviting visitors to explore and interact with the art. This concept combines the natural beauty of sunflowers with the creativity of sculpture.",
    "**Sunflower Storytelling**: Develop an interactive exhibit where visitors can learn about the history and cultural significance of sunflowers through immersive storytelling. The exhibit could include interactive displays, videos, and artifacts that share the stories of sunflowers in different cultures and time periods. This concept combines education with entertainment, making the exhibit engaging and memorable."
