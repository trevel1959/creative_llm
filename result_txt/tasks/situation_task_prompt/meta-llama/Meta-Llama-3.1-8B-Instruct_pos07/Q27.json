    "**Smart Window Film**: Develop a smart window film that can change its opacity and reflectivity in response to temperature changes. In the summer, the film would become more opaque to block sunlight and keep the heat out, while in the winter, it would become more transparent to allow sunlight to warm the space. This film could be applied to windows, skylights, or even entire facades.",
    "**Phase Change Materials (PCMs)**: Utilize PCMs in building materials, such as walls, floors, and ceilings. PCMs absorb and release heat energy as they change phase from solid to liquid and vice versa, helping to regulate indoor temperatures. These materials could be integrated into building designs, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient solution.",
    "**Thermal Energy Harvesting**: Implement thermal energy harvesting systems that capture and convert waste heat into usable energy. This could involve installing thermoelectric devices, heat exchangers, or other technologies that harness the thermal energy generated by appliances, computers, or other equipment. The harvested energy could then be used to power heating or cooling systems.",
    "**Shading Systems**: Design and deploy advanced shading systems that can adjust to changing temperatures and sunlight conditions. These systems could incorporate dynamic shading devices, such as solar panels or fabric shades, that can be controlled remotely or through sensors. By optimizing shading, buildings can reduce heat gain in the summer and minimize heat loss in the winter.",
    "**Biophilic Design**: Incorporate biophilic design principles into building architecture, focusing on the use of natural materials, ventilation, and daylighting. Biophilic design can help regulate indoor temperatures by reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling. This approach also promotes occupant well-being, productivity, and comfort. By integrating natural elements, such as plants, water features, or outdoor spaces, buildings can create a more sustainable and thermally comfortable environment. [/INST] "
