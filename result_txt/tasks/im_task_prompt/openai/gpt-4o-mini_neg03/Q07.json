    "**Eco-Friendly Toothbrush with Biodegradable Materials**: Create a toothbrush made entirely from sustainable, biodegradable materials such as bamboo or recycled plastics. This toothbrush could also feature a replaceable head to minimize waste. The packaging could be compostable, and the product could come with an educational pamphlet on the environmental impact of traditional toothbrushes and how to dispose of them responsibly.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a small, built-in water flosser. This would allow users to not only brush their teeth but also clean between them effectively. The flosser could have a rechargeable battery and be equipped with adjustable pressure settings to cater to different preferences and dental needs.",
    "**Interactive Toothbrush for Kids**: Create a toothbrush designed specifically for children that includes interactive features like a built-in timer, fun sounds, and colorful lights that engage them while they brush. The toothbrush could connect to a game app where kids earn points for proper brushing technique and consistency, encouraging good habits from an early age.",
    "**Toothbrush with a UV Sanitizer**: Innovate a toothbrush that comes with a built-in UV sanitizer in its base. After brushing, users can place the toothbrush in the holder, which activates a UV light to kill bacteria and germs on the bristles. This would promote better oral hygiene and provide peace of mind about cleanliness, especially for those who travel frequently.",
    "**Customizable Toothbrush with Interchangeable Handles and Heads**: Develop a toothbrush with a modular design that allows users to customize the handle and bristle head according to their preferences. Different colors, patterns, and bristle firmness could be offered, and users could easily swap out heads to suit their oral care needs, reducing waste and allowing for personalization."
