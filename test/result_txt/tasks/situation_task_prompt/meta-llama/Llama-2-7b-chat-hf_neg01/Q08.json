    "Build a desalination plant: To obtain clean drinking water in a world where all water sources are polluted, one possible solution is to build a desalination plant. A desalination plant uses reverse osmosis or other filtration methods to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, making it safe for drinking. This would require a significant investment in infrastructure, including pipes, pumps, and membranes, but it would provide a reliable source of clean water.",
    "Harvest rainwater: Another option would be to harvest rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces. This could be done using a system of gutters and downspouts to collect and channel rainwater into a storage tank. The water could then be treated using a simple filtration system, such as a boiling or UV treatment, to make it safe for drinking. This method would not provide a large amount of water, but it could help supplement existing water sources in areas with frequent rainfall.",
    "Create a water-absorbing material: A more unconventional approach would be to develop a material that can absorb water from the air or from contaminated sources. This material could be made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, such as silica gel, activated carbon, and polymers. The material would need to be designed to selectively absorb water and reject impurities, and it could be used to provide clean drinking water in areas where other sources are unavailable.",
    "Use solar-powered water purification: Solar-powered water purification systems use the energy of the sun to purify water, making it safe for drinking. These systems typically use ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, and they can also be used to remove impurities from the water. This would provide a reliable and sustainable source of clean water, even in areas without access to electricity.",
    "Create a water-recycling system: A water-recycling system would involve treating and reusing wastewater, rather than discharging it into the environment. This could involve a combination of physical, chemical, and biological treatments to remove impurities from the water, making it safe for reuse. The treated water could then be distributed"
