The headphones could also have a sleek and modern design, making them a stylish accessory for any outfit.",
    "Bone Conduction Headphones: Develop a pair of headphones that use bone conduction technology to transmit sound waves directly to the user's inner ear. This would allow the user to hear music or other audio without covering their ears, making the headphones ideal for people who want to be able to hear their surroundings while still enjoying their music. The headphones could also be designed with a sleek and minimalist aesthetic, making them a stylish accessory for any occasion."
