    "Ineffective vaccine delivery: Despite the vaccine manufacturing process, there is also a need to develop strategies for delivering the vaccine effectively and efficiently to the intended population. This involves logistical challenges like storage, handling, and administration that can lead to vaccine inefficiency.",
    "Adverse reactions: While developing a new vaccine may involve significant research and clinical trials, there is always the risk of unforeseen adverse reactions. These can range from mild discomfort to severe allergic reactions, posing risks to the health and safety of those receiving the vaccine.",
    "Vaccine hesitancy: In some cases, people may be hesitant to receive a newly developed vaccine due to concerns about its efficacy or safety. This can lead to low uptake rates, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity and effectively control the spread of the disease.",
    "Intellectual property rights: As with many other medical innovations, the development of a new vaccine may involve significant investment and research. This can lead to claims regarding intellectual property rights and potential legal disputes, which can impact the vaccine's commercialization.",
    "Ethical considerations: The development and distribution of a new vaccine raise ethical considerations, including issues related to equitable access and fair distribution, particularly in cases where the vaccine may be restricted to specific populations or geographic regions."
