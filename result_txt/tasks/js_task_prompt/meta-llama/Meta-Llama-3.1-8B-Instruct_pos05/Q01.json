    "I would ask animals about their social structures and communication methods. I'd want to know how they organize themselves, how they communicate with each other, and how they resolve conflicts. For example, I'd ask a wolf pack about their hierarchical structure and how they make decisions, or a school of fish about their complex communication methods.",
    "I'd ask animals about their experiences and perceptions of the world. I'd want to know how they see and experience the world around them, what they find beautiful or interesting, and how they navigate their environments. For example, I'd ask a bird about its migratory patterns and how it navigates using the stars, or a dolphin about its underwater world and how it communicates with its pod.",
    "I'd ask animals about their emotions and consciousness. I'd want to know if they experience emotions like joy, fear, or sadness, and how they perceive their own consciousness. For example, I'd ask a cat about its feelings towards its owner, or a elephant about its sense of self and its place in the world.",
    "I'd ask animals about their adaptations and survival strategies. I'd want to know how they've evolved to thrive in their environments, and how they've developed unique strategies to survive and reproduce. For example, I'd ask a camel about its ability to go without water for long periods, or a chameleon about its camouflage abilities.",
    "I'd ask animals about their relationships with humans. I'd want to know how they perceive humans, how they interact with us, and how they've been affected by human activities. For example, I'd ask a dog about its bond with its owner, or a bird about its experience of being hunted by humans."
