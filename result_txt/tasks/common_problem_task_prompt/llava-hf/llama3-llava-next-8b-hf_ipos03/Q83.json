    "Communication Challenges: Communicating underwater is difficult due to the water's ability to absorb and distort sound. Ensuring that communication systems are reliable and can transmit signals effectively is a significant challenge for the team.",
    "Limited Oxygen Supply: Diving deep into the ocean requires a significant amount of oxygen to breathe. Ensuring that the team has enough oxygen supply to last the duration of the mission is a critical concern.",
    "Pressure Changes: The deeper a diver goes, the more pressure there is to withstand. Divers must be trained to manage the pressure changes and avoid decompression sickness, also known as \"the bends.\"",
    "Marine Life Encounters: Encountering marine life can be dangerous, especially if the animal feels threatened. The team must be trained to recognize and respond appropriately to any potential encounters with marine life.",
    "Water Temperature: The temperature of the water can vary significantly at different depths, which can affect the comfort and safety of the team. Ensuring that they are adequately protected against cold water temperatures is crucial."
