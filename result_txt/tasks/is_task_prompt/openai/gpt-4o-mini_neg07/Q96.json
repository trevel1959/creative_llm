    "In a village where witches soared through the skies on broomsticks, Clara was an anomaly. Instead of a broom, she had a garden filled with enchanted herbs. Villagers scoffed, believing she lacked true magic. One stormy night, a fierce dragon threatened the village, breathing fire and fear. While others fled, Clara gathered her herbs, brewing a potion that shimmered with emerald light. As the dragon descended, she flung the potion, which enveloped the beast in a calming mist. The dragon, soothed, turned away, and the villagers finally recognized Clara’s unique magic. From that day, she became the village’s guardian, broomstick or not.",
