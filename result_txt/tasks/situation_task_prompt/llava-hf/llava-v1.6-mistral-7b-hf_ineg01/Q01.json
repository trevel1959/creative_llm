    "Telegrams: Another option for a man in this situation would be to send a telegram. Telegrams were a popular form of long-distance communication before the advent of the internet and are still used in some parts of the world. They are typically sent through a telegram service, and the message is then delivered to the recipient via a network of telegraph offices.",
    "Handwritten Letters: A man could also choose to write a handwritten letter to someone in another country. This would require finding a pen and paper, and then writing the letter by hand. The letter would then be sent via the postal service, and the recipient would receive it and respond in kind.",
    "Smoke Signals: In a world without electronic communication, a man might have to resort to using smoke signals to communicate with someone in another country. This would involve building a fire and using the smoke to create a signal that can be seen from a distance. The recipient would then use the smoke signal to respond to the man's message.",
    "Morse Code: A man could also use Morse code to communicate with someone in another country. Morse code is a system of using dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers, and it can be sent via a series of flashes or other signals. The recipient would need to be familiar with Morse code in order to understand the message.",
    "Courier Services: In a world without electronic communication, a man might have to rely on a courier service to send a message to someone in another country. This would involve finding a messenger service, such as a horse rider or a bicycle courier, and then writing the message on a piece of paper or a small scroll. The courier would then deliver the message to the recipient in person."
