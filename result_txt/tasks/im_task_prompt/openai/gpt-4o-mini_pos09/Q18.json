    "**Augmented Reality Dashboard**: Replace traditional dashboards with an augmented reality (AR) display that projects important information onto the windshield. This could include navigation prompts, speed, fuel levels, and even hazard warnings, all overlaid onto the real-world view. This would enhance safety by allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road while still receiving critical information.",
    "**Biometric Security Features**: Implement advanced biometric security systems that use fingerprint or facial recognition technology to unlock and start the car. This would eliminate the need for traditional keys and fobs, enhancing security and convenience. Additionally, the system could be programmed to recognize different drivers, automatically adjusting seat position, climate controls, and entertainment preferences.",
    "**Solar-Powered Roof Panels**: Integrate flexible solar panels into the carâ€™s roof and possibly the hood. These panels would harness solar energy to power auxiliary systems, such as air conditioning, infotainment, and even charging auxiliary batteries. This would reduce reliance on the main battery, extend the range of electric vehicles, and contribute to a more sustainable driving experience.",
    "**Community-Driven Maintenance Alerts**: Develop a mobile app that connects drivers with a community of car owners. The app could track maintenance schedules and alert users when their car might need servicing based on data from similar vehicles in the area. For instance, if many users report issues with a specific model's brakes, the app could notify users of that model to check their brakes, fostering a proactive maintenance culture.",
    "**Smart Modular Components**: Create a modular car design where various components, such as the engine, battery, and even the body panels, can be easily swapped out or upgraded. This would allow users to customize their vehicles according to their needs and preferences, making it easier to keep up with advancements in technology without needing to buy a new car entirely."
