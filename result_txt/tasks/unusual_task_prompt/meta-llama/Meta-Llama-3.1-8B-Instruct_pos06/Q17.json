    "**Smart Mug**: Design a coffee mug with a built-in sensor that tracks the temperature of the coffee and alerts the user when it's at the perfect drinking temperature (around 160Â°F). The mug could also have a built-in timer that reminds the user when it's time to refill their coffee.",
    "**Mood Mugs**: Create a line of coffee mugs with built-in mood-sensing technology that detects the user's emotions and responds with a corresponding color-changing design. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the mug could change to a calming blue color.",
    "**Coffee Connoisseur's Journal**: Design a coffee mug with a built-in journal that allows users to track their coffee tastings, note their favorite roasts, and even scan barcodes to log their coffee purchases. The journal could also include space for users to record their coffee-making techniques and experiment with new recipes.",
    "**Augmented Reality Mug**: Create a coffee mug with an augmented reality (AR) experience that brings the user's coffee to life. Using a smartphone app, users could scan the mug and unlock interactive content, such as 3D animations of coffee beans, virtual coffee tastings, or even a virtual coffee shop tour.",
    "**Sustainable Sipper**: Design a coffee mug made from 100% compostable and biodegradable materials, such as plant-based bioplastics or mushroom-based mycelium. The mug could also include a built-in coffee grounds container that allows users to compost their coffee waste at home."
