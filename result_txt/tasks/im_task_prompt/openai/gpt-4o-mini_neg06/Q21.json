    "**Eco-Friendly Door with Solar Panels**: Design a door that incorporates solar panels into its structure. This eco-friendly door could generate electricity to power outdoor lights or security cameras. Additionally, the door could feature an insulated core to improve energy efficiency, keeping homes cooler in summer and warmer in winter while harnessing renewable energy.",
    "**Interactive Augmented Reality Door**: Create a door that integrates augmented reality (AR) technology.

    "**Climate-Controlled Door**: Introduce a door with built-in climate control features that adjust to external weather conditions. This door could have sensors that detect temperature and humidity levels, automatically sealing tightly or allowing airflow as needed. This would help maintain a comfortable indoor climate while reducing energy costs by minimizing the need for heating or cooling systems."
