    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Compartments**:    Create a picnic basket with a modular design, featuring removable and interchangeable compartments. Users could customize the basket according to their needs, swapping out sections for sandwiches, fruits, or beverages. This could also include insulated sections for hot and cold items, allowing for a more organized and efficient packing experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Materials**:    Develop a picnic basket made entirely from eco-friendly and biodegradable materials. This basket could be made from recycled plastics or sustainable bamboo, promoting environmental consciousness. Additionally, the design could incorporate plant-based insulation to keep food fresh, and once it’s no longer usable, it could decompose without harming the environment.",
    "**Integrated Solar-Powered Charging Station**:    Enhance the picnic basket with an integrated solar panel that can charge devices like smartphones or portable speakers. The basket would have a built-in battery that stores solar energy, allowing users to enjoy music or stay connected while outdoors. This feature would be especially useful for day-long picnics or camping trips.",
    "**Picnic Basket with Built-In Seating**:    Design a picnic basket that transforms into a portable seating solution. The basket could have collapsible, lightweight seats or cushions that can be easily deployed when it’s time to eat. This would eliminate the need to carry extra seating, making it more convenient for outdoor gatherings.",
    "**Augmented Reality Picnic Planner**:    Introduce an augmented reality (AR) feature in the picnic basket's app that helps users plan their picnic. By scanning their surroundings, the app could suggest the best picnic spots, recommend food pairings based on the items packed, and even provide games or activities suitable for the location. This interactive feature would enhance the overall picnic experience."
