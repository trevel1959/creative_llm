    "Life is a game: In this universe, life is a game that is played according to a set of rules that are unknown to the players. The goal of the game is to accumulate points, which determine the level of existence one achieves after death. People are given a set of abilities and challenges to overcome, and the outcome of the game determines their reward or punishment. This would create a society where people are constantly striving to improve their position in the game, and the concept of winning and losing takes on a whole new meaning."
