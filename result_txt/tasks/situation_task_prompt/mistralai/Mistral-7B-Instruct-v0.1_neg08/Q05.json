    ": The sun is an essential source of light during the day, but if it didn't rise tomorrow, there are a few ways to ensure you have enough light. One option is to install artificial lighting in your home or workplace. You could also invest in solar panels to generate your own electricity and power your lighting system.",
    "Invest in alternative energy sources: Another option is to invest in alternative energy sources such as wind or hydro power. These sources can provide you with a sustainable and reliable source of energy to power your lighting system.",
    "Use natural light: You could also take advantage of natural light by opening up windows and doors to let in as much light as possible. This can be especially helpful if you have a south-facing window, which will receive the most sunlight.",
    "Invest in reflective materials: Another option is to invest in reflective materials such as mirrors or reflective paint. These materials can help bounce light around your space, creating a brighter and more well-lit environment.",
    "Buy emergency lighting: Finally, you could purchase emergency lighting such as flashlights or lanterns to have on hand in case the sun doesn't rise. These can be stored away and used in the event of an emergency."
