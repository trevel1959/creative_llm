    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Create a pillow that can be inflated using air or water. This type of pillow could be made from durable materials such as silicone or PVC, which are waterproof and easy to clean. The user can inflate it before bedtime, ensuring a comfortable and supportive headrest.",
    "**Memory Foam Wedge**: Design a wedge-shaped pillow that supports the head and neck in a more ergonomic position. The wedge can be filled with memory foam, which molds to the shape of the head and provides customized support. It can also be adjusted for different heights, depending on personal preference.",
    "**Smart Pillow**: Develop a pillow that uses technology to enhance sleep quality. The pillow could have sensors that track sleep patterns, body temperature, and heart rate. It could provide gentle vibrations or sounds to adjust the sleeping position or wake the user softly at the end of the night. Additionally, it might include built-in speakers for soothing music or white noise to improve sleep.",
    "**Gravity-Activated Pillow**: Invent a pillow that adjusts its shape based on gravity. The pillow could have a flexible, gravity-sensitive material that changes its shape when the user turns over. This would ensure that the head remains supported throughout the night, even if the person moves around in their sleep.",
    "**Lumbar Support Pillow**: Design a pillow that specifically targets the lower back area. This pillow could be worn like a belt or placed under the mattress, providing additional support where needed. It might use adjustable straps to fit various body sizes and shapes, ensuring maximum comfort for individuals with back pain or those who prefer a more tailored solution."
