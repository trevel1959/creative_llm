    "**Bioluminescent Cleaning Bacteria**: Develop a method to harness bioluminescent bacteria that can break down organic matter and produce a natural, non-toxic cleaning agent. This would involve creating a controlled environment for the bacteria to thrive and produce a consistent cleaning solution. Confidence: 0.8",
    "**Solar-Powered Disinfection**: Design a portable, solar-powered device that uses UV light to disinfect surfaces and water. This would involve using photovoltaic panels to generate electricity, which would then power a UV light source that can be directed at surfaces to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Confidence: 0.9",
    "**Edible Cleaning Agents**: Develop a line of edible cleaning agents made from natural ingredients like citrus, vinegar, and essential oils. These agents could be used to clean surfaces, but also provide a safe and healthy snack option. Confidence: 0.7",
    "**Composting for Hygiene**: Create a system for composting human waste and organic matter, which can then be used as a natural fertilizer and cleaning agent. This would involve developing a method for breaking down waste into a usable form, while also minimizing the risk of disease transmission. Confidence: 0.6",
    "**Air Purification with Plants**: Design a system that utilizes plants to purify the air and remove pollutants, which would help maintain hygiene in the absence of traditional cleaning products. This would involve selecting specific plant species with high air-purifying capabilities and integrating them into a network of air-circulating systems. Confidence: 0.8"
