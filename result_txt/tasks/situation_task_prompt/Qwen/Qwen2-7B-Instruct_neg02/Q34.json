    "**Rainwater Harvesting System**: You can create a system that collects rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces and stores it in large containers for use when it's needed. This could be as simple as setting up barrels under gutters, or more complex with the installation of underground tanks. The stored water can then be pumped through a hose or irrigation system to water your plants.",
    "**Aquaponics**: If rainwater stops, consider using an aquaponics setup where fish farming and plant cultivation are integrated in a sustainable system. The fish provide nutrients for the plants, which in turn filter the water for the fish. This system requires less water compared to traditional gardening methods and can be quite efficient even during dry periods.",
    "**Water Recycling**: Implement a water recycling system within your garden. This involves capturing runoff from the soil and reusing it for watering plants. You could set up a series of trenches filled with gravel or stones that channel water into a central reservoir, from which it can be directed back to your plants. This method mimics natural water collection systems found in nature.",
    "**Drip Irrigation**: Use a drip irrigation system, which delivers water directly to the base of each plant, minimizing water loss due to evaporation and runoff. This is a highly efficient way of watering plants, ensuring that the moisture goes exactly where it's needed. Drip lines can be laid out in a garden bed, and water is slowly released at specific intervals.",
    "**Mulching and Composting**: While rain is crucial for most plants, effective mulching and composting can significantly enhance water retention in the soil. Mulch helps to suppress weeds, retain moisture, and moderate soil temperature. Composting organic waste creates nutrient-rich soil amendments that improve soil structure and water holding capacity. Together, these practices can help sustain plant growth even during periods without rainfall. "
