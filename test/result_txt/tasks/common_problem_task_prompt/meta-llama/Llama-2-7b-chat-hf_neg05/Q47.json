    "\"Motherboard Mosaic\": Create a custom motherboard design using a mosaic of interlocking tiles, each one representing a different component of the computer. The tiles could be made of different materials, such as wood, metal, or even glass, and could be arranged in a pattern that reflects the circuitry of the motherboard. The final product would be a beautiful, functional work of art that showcases the inner workings of the computer.",
    "\"Circuit Sculpture\": Use a combination of 3D printing and electronics to create a sculpture that doubles as a functional computer. The sculpture could take the form of a human figure, with the components of the computer integrated into the body, or it could be a more abstract design that still conveys the idea of a computer. The sculpture could be interactive, with users able to access the computer's components and see how they work.",
    "\"Code-a-brick\": Create a custom LEGO-style brick that can be used to build a computer from scratch. Each brick would have a different function, such as a processor, memory, or storage, and users could use these bricks to build a custom computer that meets their specific needs. The bricks could be designed to be modular, allowing users to upgrade or modify their computer as needed.",
    "\"Robot Rock\": Create a custom computer case that doubles as a musical instrument. The case could be shaped like a robot, with different components of the computer integrated into the body of the robot. Users could play the robot using a variety of controls, such as buttons, levers, or even a touch screen, to create different sounds and melodies. The robot could also be programmed to perform different functions, such as playing a specific song or displaying a visual show.",
    "\"Mind Meld\": Create a computer that can be controlled using only the power of the user's mind. Using a combination of EEG sensors and AI algorithms, the computer could be programmed to recognize and interpret the user's thoughts and emotions, allowing them to control the computer without ever touching it. This could be especially useful for people with disabilities, as it would give them greater control over their computer and allow them to communicate more easily."
