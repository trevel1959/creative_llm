    "Implement a robotic cleaning system: Develop a robotic cleaning system that uses a combination of sensors and mechanical brushes to clean and remove insects from surfaces. This system could be programmed to target specific areas where insects are known to gather and could operate autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention.",
    "Use natural predators: Introduce natural predators of insects, such as ladybugs or lacewings, to help control their populations. These predators could be released in specific areas or introduced to a wider range to help reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Use natural insect repellents: Develop and implement natural insect repellents, such as essential oils or plant-based extracts, to deter insects from gathering in specific areas. These repellents could be sprayed on surfaces or used in outdoor areas to create a barrier against insects.",
    "Implement a chemical-free pest control system: Develop a chemical-free pest control system that uses a combination of physical barriers and biological agents to control insect populations. This system could include the use of traps, sticky surfaces, and natural predators to reduce the need for chemical pesticides.",
    "Use flies as bait: Develop a system that uses flies as bait to lure and trap insects. Flies are natural predators of many insects, and could be used to create a biological control system that reduces the need for chemical pesticides. This system could be implemented in areas where flies are known to gather, such asÔ∏è"
