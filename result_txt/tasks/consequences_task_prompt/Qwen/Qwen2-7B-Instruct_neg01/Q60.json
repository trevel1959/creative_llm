    "**Internet Education and Literacy Programs**: If the internet becomes a basic human right, governments could invest more in comprehensive digital literacy programs to ensure that everyone has the skills necessary to navigate the web effectively. This could include coding bootcamps for those interested in technology careers, digital citizenship education in schools, and online courses for lifelong learners. The consequence of this might be a more technologically savvy global population, which could lead to increased innovation and productivity.",
    "**Universal Access to Healthcare Information**: With the internet as a basic human right, every individual would have access to vast amounts of medical information and resources. This could revolutionize healthcare by empowering people to make more informed decisions about their health, understand potential diagnoses, and locate affordable healthcare options. However, it could also lead to misinformation and confusion, necessitating reliable, vetted sources to combat the spread of fake health information.",
    "**Cultural Preservation and Exchange**: The internet as a basic right would facilitate unprecedented global cultural exchange and preservation. Communities could share their unique traditions, languages, and histories with the world, potentially leading to a more interconnected and empathetic global society. On the flip side, there's a risk of cultural homogenization, where dominant cultures overshadow smaller, less accessible ones, leading to a loss of diversity.",
    "**Economic Opportunities and Entrepreneurship**: For individuals who might not have had access to traditional education or job markets, the internet opens up new avenues for entrepreneurship and remote work. This could significantly reduce global economic disparities by allowing people to work from anywhere and compete on a global scale. However, it could also exacerbate existing inequalities, as those without reliable internet access or digital skills are left behind.",
    "**Global News and Media Literacy**: With universal internet access, the public would have direct access to news from around the world, fostering a more globally aware citizenry. This could lead to better-informed public opinions and policies. Yet, the challenge would be ensuring that people can discern credible sources from misinformation, potentially leading to heightened political polarization if not addressed properly. "
