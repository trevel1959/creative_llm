    "\"I'm sorry, I didn't manage to do it, but I have a few ideas on how to make your laundry day easier. How about we try to make a laundry basket that can sort your clothes by color, fabric, and size? This way, you won't have to spend time sorting your clothes before washing them. We can also add a feature that allows you to select the wash cycle and temperature directly from the laundry basket. What do you think?\"",
    "\"Another idea I have is to create a laundry basket that can fold your clothes for you. Imagine coming home from work and finding your clothes already folded and ready to be put away. We can also add a feature that allows you to customize the folding style and texture of your clothes. What do you think?\"",
    "\"We can also create a laundry basket that can detect stains and odors in your clothes. This way, you can pre-treat your clothes before washing them, saving you time and energy. We can also add a feature that allows you to select the type of stain or odor and the recommended pre-treatment method. What do you think?\"",
    "\"Another idea I have is to create a laundry basket that can clean and sanitize your clothes. With the current pandemic, it's essential to keep our clothes clean and sanitized. We can add a feature that uses UV light or ozone to kill bacteria and viruses on your clothes. We can also add a feature that allows you to select the type of bacteria or virus you want to kill and the recommended sanitization method. What do you think?\"",
    "\"Lastly, we can create a laundry basket that can help you save space. With urban living, space is a premium. We can create a laundry basket that can fold and store itself when not in use. We can also add a feature that allows you to select the type of folding and storage method. What do you think?\""
