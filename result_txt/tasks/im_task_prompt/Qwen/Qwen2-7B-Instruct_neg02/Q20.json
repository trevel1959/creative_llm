    "**Innovative Coffee Infuser System**: Create a coffee maker that combines the functionality of an infuser into its design. Users can add various ingredients like spices, fruits, or herbs directly into the water reservoir before brewing. This would allow for a customizable coffee experience, where users can experiment with different flavors and aromas.",
    "**Interactive Coffee Experience Station**: Design a coffee maker that is also an interactive entertainment center. It could include features like a touch screen display that shows brewing progress, temperature, and time, along with a built-in music player or news channel. Users can choose their preferred type of coffee and customize it according to their taste while enjoying some background audio content.",
    "**Sustainable Coffee Pod Recycling System**: Develop a coffee maker that includes a recycling system for used coffee pods. The machine would automatically collect used pods from a designated drawer or compartment, sort them by type, and either compost biodegradable materials or recycle non-biodegradable ones. This approach promotes sustainability and reduces waste.",
    "**Smart Coffee Maker with Personalized Recipes**: Integrate artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into the coffee maker to create a personalized experience. Users can input their preferences, dietary restrictions, or even mood into the device, which then suggests or creates custom coffee recipes tailored to those specific needs.",
    "**Portable Coffee Maker with Built-In Battery**: Design a compact, battery-powered coffee maker that can be easily taken on trips, to offices, or camping. It could have a removable water tank, adjustable temperature settings, and a quick heating element.
