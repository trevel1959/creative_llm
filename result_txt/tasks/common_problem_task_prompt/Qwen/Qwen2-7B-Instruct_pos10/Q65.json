    "**Smartphone with Built-in Augmented Reality (AR) Lens**: Design a smartphone that comes equipped with an AR lens capable of enhancing user experience through virtual overlays. This can be used for gaming, education, tourism, and even shopping. For example, users could explore a virtual 3D model of historical landmarks while physically visiting them or try on clothes virtually before purchasing.",
    "**Smartphone with Environmental Monitoring Capabilities**: Integrate sensors into the phone that can detect various environmental factors like air quality, noise levels, humidity, and temperature. The phone could display this information on its screen and send alerts if any parameters fall outside safe limits. It could also connect to IoT devices around the user's home to provide comprehensive home monitoring solutions.",
    "**Voice-Activated Personalized Health Assistant**: Create a smartphone that includes advanced AI voice recognition capabilities, allowing users to interact with their device using natural language commands. This personal health assistant could provide personalized health advice, track diet and exercise routines, monitor medication schedules, and even alert doctors if there are any sudden changes in the user's health.",
    "**Smartphone with Dynamic Display Technology**: Develop a phone with a flexible display that can change shape based on the user's needs or preferences. For instance, the phone might fold or wrap around objects, providing a more ergonomic viewing experience when reading or watching videos. This technology could also be used for creating interactive interfaces or wearable tech applications.",
    "**Smartphone with Energy Harvesting Technology**: Design a smartphone that can generate electricity from ambient sources such as sunlight, vibrations, or body heat. This would not only extend battery life but also reduce dependence on traditional power sources. The phone could use this harvested energy to charge itself, powering features like wireless charging or extended usage during outdoor activities. "
