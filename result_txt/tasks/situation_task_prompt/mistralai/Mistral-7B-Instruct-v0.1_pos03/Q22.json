    "If all roads disappeared, one could use a network of bicycle lanes to move around the town or city. This would require the installation of bike lanes on all major streets and avenues, as well as the development of a comprehensive network of bike paths and trails. This would require significant investment in infrastructure, but it wouldilyealty be an effective and eco-friendly solution.",
    "Another option would be to use a network of electric scooters or other forms of electric transportation to move around the town or city. This would require the installation of charging stations and the development of a comprehensive network of scooter-friendly streets and sidewalks. This would also require significant investment in infrastructure, but it would be an effective and convenient solution for short distances.",
    "If all roads disappeared, one could use a network of waterways to move around the town or city. This would require the development of a comprehensive network of canals, rivers, and other waterways, as well as the installation of watercraft and other infrastructure to support water-based transportation. This would be a challenging solution, but it could be effective in areas with a lot of waterways.",
    "Another option would be to use a network of pedestrian-friendly streets and sidewalks to move around the town or city. This would require the development of a comprehensive network of sidewalks and pedestrian-friendly streets, as well as the installation of infrastructure to support pedestrian transportation, such as benches and crosswalks. This would be an effective and eco-friendly solution for short distances.",
    "If all roads disappeared, one could use a network of drones to move around the town or city. This would require the development of a comprehensive network of drone landing sites and the installation of drones and other infrastructure to support drone-based transportation. This would be a challenging solution, but it could be effective in areas with limited space and infrastructure."
