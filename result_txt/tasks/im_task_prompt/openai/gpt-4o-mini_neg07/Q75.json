    "**Customizable Sandwich Profiles**: Create a feature that allows users to save their favorite sandwich recipes and preferences. By using a touchscreen interface, users can select their preferred bread type, fillings, and desired crispiness level. The toaster assistant could then automatically adjust the cooking time and temperature for each specific profile, ensuring that every sandwich is made to perfection.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**: Integrate a small, refrigerated compartment that can store common sandwich ingredients like cheese, meats, and vegetables. The sandwich toaster assistant could dispense the right amount of each ingredient directly onto the bread, ensuring an even distribution. This would streamline the sandwich-making process and minimize mess.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design the toaster with a self-cleaning feature that uses steam and high heat to sanitize the cooking surfaces after use. This would eliminate the need for manual cleaning and ensure that the appliance remains hygienic and ready for the next use. The user could activate this feature with the push of a button or schedule it for a specific time.",
    "**Multi-Layer Toasting**: Introduce a multi-layer toasting system that allows users to create gourmet sandwiches with multiple layers of fillings. The toaster could have adjustable height settings, allowing for thicker sandwiches while ensuring that all layers are toasted evenly. This feature would enable users to experiment with more complex sandwich recipes.",
    "**Interactive Cooking Guide**: Implement an interactive cooking guide that uses augmented reality (AR) technology. Users could point their smartphones or tablets at the sandwich toaster, and the app would overlay instructions, tips, and even video tutorials on how to assemble and toast the perfect sandwich. This would be especially useful for novice cooks looking to improve their skills."
