    "Personalized Navigation: Self-driving cars can use GPS technology to navigate to a specific destination, but they can also use AI to learn the driver's preferred routes and suggest the most efficient and enjoyable options. This personalized navigation can save time and reduce stress, making the commute more enjoyable.",
    "Automated Parking: Self-driving cars can also use sensors and AI to find and park in available parking spaces. This can save time and reduce the hassle of parking in crowded areas, especially in cities with limited parking options.",
    "Autonomous Emergency Braking: Self-driving cars are equipped with sensors and AI that can detect potential hazards on the road, such as pedestrians or other vehicles, and automatically apply the brakes to prevent collisions. This can greatly reduce the risk of accidents and improve road safety.",
    "Predictive Maintenance: Self-driving cars can use sensors and AI to monitor their own systems and detect potential issues before they become major problems. This can help prevent breakdowns and extend the lifespan of the vehicle.",
    "Augmented Reality: Self-driving cars can use augmented reality technology to provide drivers with real-time information about the road ahead, such as speed limits, traffic patterns, and potential hazards. This can help drivers make more informed decisions and improve their overall driving experience."
