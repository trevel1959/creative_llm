    "**Interchangeable Nib System**: Design a fountain pen with an easy-to-use interchangeable nib system that allows users to switch between different nib sizes and styles (fine, medium, broad, stub, etc.) quickly. This would cater to various writing preferences and styles, making the pen versatile for calligraphy, sketching, or everyday writing.",
    "**Ergonomic Grip Design**: Create a fountain pen with an adjustable ergonomic grip that molds to the user's fingers. Utilizing a soft, memory foam-like material, the grip would conform to the shape of the hand for maximum comfort during extended writing sessions. This could help reduce hand fatigue and improve writing precision.",
    "**Refillable Ink Cartridges with Custom Blends**: Introduce a system where users can create their own ink blends by mixing different ink colors in a refillable cartridge. This would allow for personalized ink colors and shades, encouraging creativity and individual expression. A small mixing tool could be included to help achieve the desired blend.",
    "**Built-in Writing Assistant**: Incorporate a smart technology feature that pairs with a mobile app to offer writing suggestions, grammar checks, and style enhancements in real-time. The pen could have a small touch-sensitive screen that displays prompts and corrections, making it a powerful tool for students and professionals alike.",
    "**Multi-Function Cap**: Design the cap of the fountain pen to serve multiple purposes. It could include a built-in stylus for touchscreen devices, a small flashlight for writing in low-light conditions, and even a mini ruler along the side. This would make the pen not just a writing instrument but a multifunctional tool for various tasks."
