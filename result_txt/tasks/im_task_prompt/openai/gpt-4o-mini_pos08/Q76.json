    "**Multi-Function Hair Tie**: Design a hair tie that doubles as a mini accessory. This could include interchangeable decorative elements (like charms or beads) that snap onto the hair tie, allowing users to customize their look. The hair tie could also have a built-in clip or pin to secure small items like bobby pins or hair clips, making it a practical and stylish solution for on-the-go styling.",
    "**Temperature-Controlled Hair Tie**: Develop a hair tie made from thermoregulating materials that can help keep hair cool or warm depending on the weather. In hot conditions, it could absorb heat and provide a cooling effect, while in colder conditions, it could retain warmth, protecting the hair from harsh elements.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Tie**: Introduce a line of hair ties made from biodegradable or recycled materials, such as organic cotton or recycled plastics. These hair ties would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability. Additionally, they could come in compostable packaging, further reducing environmental impact.",
    "**Anti-Slip Hair Tie**: Create a hair tie with a unique texture or grip-enhancing material that prevents slippage during physical activities. This would be particularly beneficial for athletes or those with fine hair, ensuring that the hair tie stays in place without causing damage or discomfort.",
    "**Hair Tie with Built-in Mirror**: Design a hair tie that incorporates a small, foldable mirror within its band. This would allow users to quickly check their hair or makeup on the go. The mirror could be made from lightweight, shatterproof material, ensuring it remains practical and safe for everyday use."
