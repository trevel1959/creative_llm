    "**Incorporating Daylight into Bedtime Routines:** In a world without night, the human body might adjust its circadian rhythms to function continuously. To accommodate this change, one creative idea is to design a sleep environment that incorporates natural daylight. This could involve large windows or skylights that allow sunlight to fill the bedroom during daytime hours. Additionally, using blackout curtains that can be adjusted to let in varying amounts of light could help create a sense of nighttime within the daylit space.",
    "**Adapting Sleepwear for Continuous Light Exposure:** As humans adapt to living without darkness, they might develop new styles of sleepwear designed specifically for continuous light exposure. These garments could be made from materials that are breathable and comfortable in bright conditions, possibly incorporating features like built-in sunglasses or goggles to protect sensitive eyes. They might also include built-in UV filters to shield against harmful rays.",
    "**Innovative Sleep Technologies for Constant Light:** Technological advancements could lead to new sleep aids that help people sleep comfortably during the day. For instance, smart bedding systems could automatically adjust their temperature, lighting, and noise levels based on an individual's sleep patterns. These systems might use sensors to detect when someone is sleeping and then dim the lights, lower the temperature, and reduce ambient noise to ensure a restful sleep experience.",
    "**Developing New Sleep Positions for Continuous Light:** Traditional sleeping positions might need adaptation in a world without night. People could experiment with different sleeping positions that maximize comfort and minimize eye irritation from constant light exposure. For example, sleeping on oneâ€™s side with the eyes covered might become more popular. Specialized pillows and mattresses could be developed to support these new sleeping positions effectively.",
    "**Cultivating Sleep Cultures and Practices for Continuous Light:** Communities might develop unique sleep cultures tailored to the absence of night. Practices such as regular naps, meditation sessions, or mindfulness exercises could become integral parts of daily routines to promote better sleep quality during the day. Additionally, communal spaces like sleep cafes or wellness centers might emerge where people can gather, relax, and improve their sleep hygiene in a supportive environment. These spaces could offer guided sleep sessions, relaxation techniques, and other resources to help individuals adapt to continuous light conditions."
