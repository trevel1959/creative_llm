    "Smart Fan: Develop a ceiling fan with built-in sensors that can detect the room's temperature and humidity levels. The fan can then adjust its speed and direction accordingly to maintain a comfortable environment. Additionally, the fan could be equipped with a smart app that allows users to control it remotely and schedule its operation.",
    "Air Purification Fan: Create a ceiling fan that incorporates an air purification system, such as a HEPA filter, to remove pollutants and allergens from the air. This would provide a healthier and more comfortable environment for occupants.",
    "Dynamic Lighting Fan: Design a ceiling fan with LED lights that can change color and brightness based on the user's preferences. The fan could also be equipped with a timer or a smart sensor that adjusts the lighting levels based on the time of day or the amount of natural light in the room.",
    "Whisper-Quiet Fan: Develop a ceiling fan with advanced blade design and motor technology that allows it to operate at a near-silent level, making it ideal for bedrooms or other quiet spaces. This could be achieved through the use of specialized materials, such as noise-reducing coatings or optimized blade shapes.",
    "Interactive Fan: Create a ceiling fan that responds to voice commands or other interactive gestures, such as waving your hand in front of it. This could be achieved through the use of advanced sensors and AI technology, allowing users to control the fan without touching it. This could be especially useful for people with mobility or dexterity issues."
