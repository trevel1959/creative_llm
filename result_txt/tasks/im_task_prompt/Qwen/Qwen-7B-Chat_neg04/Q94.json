    "Customized Candles - Create candles that are personalized to a customer's liking by adding their name or initials on the candle. This could be done using a laser engraver or a heat transfer method.",
    "Scented Candles - Offer a variety of scents for customers to choose from, such as lavender, vanilla, or citrus. The scent could be infused into the wax during the manufacturing process or added later through fragrance oils.",
    "LED Candles - These candles emit light instead of flame, making them safe to use in areas where open flames are prohibited. They can be battery-powered or plugged into an outlet.",
    "Scented Candle Holders - In addition to selling candles, offer holders made of materials like wood, ceramic, or glass that can hold the candles. These holders not only provide a place to display the candles but also add to the overall decor of a room.",
    "DIY Candle Making Kits - Sell kits that include all the necessary ingredients and instructions to make candles at home. This would allow customers to create unique candles tailored to their preferences and save money compared to buying pre-made candles."
