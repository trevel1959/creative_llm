    "Use a combination lock: If all keys disappeared, you can still secure your belongings by using a combination lock. This lock requires a specific sequence of numbers to be entered to open it, so even if someone gains access to your belongings, they won't be able to open the lock without the correct combination.",
    "Use a fingerprint lock: Another option is to use a fingerprint lock. This type of lock uses your unique fingerprint to unlock it, so only you will be able to access your belongings.",
    "Use a smart lock: A smart lock can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app or other connected device. This means you can lock and unlock your belongings from anywhere, even if you don't have a physical key.",
    "Use a padlock: If you don't have a combination lock or fingerprint lock, you can still secure your belongings with a padlock. This type of lock requires a physical key to be inserted and turned, so only you will be able to access your belongings.",
    "Use a safe: If you have valuable belongings that need to be secured, you can use a safe. A safe is a secure container that is designed to protect your belongings from theft or damage. It can be bolted to a surface or to a wall, and it requires a combination or key to open it."
