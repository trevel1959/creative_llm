    "The \"Sail-O-Matic\": An automated sailboat navigation system that utilizes AI and computer vision to detect and adjust sail angles, course, and speed for optimal navigation. The system can analyze weather patterns, sea conditions, and even the boat's performance to make adjustments in real-time, ensuring a safe and efficient crossing.",
    "The \"WingSail\": A innovative sail design that incorporates wing-like structures on either side of the boat, allowing for more efficient and stable sailing. The wings can be adjusted to optimize lift and drag, making the boat faster and more maneuverable, even in rough seas.",
    "The \"SailBot\": A small, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can be deployed from the sailboat to scan the ocean floor and gather data on ocean currents, sea floor topography, and other important navigation information. The SailBot can also be used to detect and avoid hazards such as rocks, reefs, and other obstacles.",
    "The \"SailSphere\": A spherical, inflatable sail that can be deployed in place of traditional sails. The SailSphere has a larger surface area than traditional sails, allowing for more efficient sailing, and can also be adjusted to optimize lift and drag, making the boat faster and more maneuverable.",
    "The \"SailShark\": A sailboat design that incorporates shark-inspired features, such as a streamlined hull and fins, to improve stability and maneuverability in rough seas. The SailShark can also be equipped with a retractable \"shark fin\" that can be deployed in rough weather to provide additional stability and balance."
