    "**Self-Cleaning Lenses**: Develop sunglasses with a special coating that uses nanotechnology to repel dirt, dust, and water. This coating would activate when exposed to sunlight, using UV rays to break down organic materials and grime, keeping the lenses clear and smudge-free. This feature would be especially appealing for beachgoers or outdoor enthusiasts who often deal with sand and sweat.",
    "**Interchangeable Lens System**: Create a modular sunglasses design that allows users to easily swap out lenses for different conditions. For example, users could change to polarized lenses for fishing, photochromic lenses that adjust to light levels, or colored lenses for fashion. This system could be made even more user-friendly with a magnetic attachment, making it quick and easy to customize based on the environment.",
    "**Built-in UV Sensor and Alert System**: Introduce sunglasses that have a built-in UV sensor that monitors the levels of UV radiation in real-time. If the UV index becomes too high, the sunglasses would send an alert to the wearer via a connected app, suggesting when to seek shade or reapply sunscreen. This feature could promote skin health and awareness, particularly for individuals who spend a lot of time outdoors.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Design sunglasses using sustainable materials such as biodegradable plastics, recycled metals, or even plant-based materials. Additionally, the packaging could be made from recycled paper or materials that can be composted. This eco-conscious approach would attract environmentally aware consumers and promote sustainability in fashion.",
    "**Integrated Audio Technology**: Create sunglasses that have built-in bone conduction speakers, allowing users to listen to music or take calls without the need for earbuds. This design would keep the ears open to ambient sounds, making it safer for activities like cycling or walking in busy areas. The controls could be integrated into the arms of the sunglasses for easy access."
