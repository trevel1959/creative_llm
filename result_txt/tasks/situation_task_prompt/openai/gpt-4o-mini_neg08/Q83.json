    "**Circadian Rhythm Adjusters**: In a world without night, our biological clocks would need recalibrating. Scientists could develop wearable devices that monitor our circadian rhythms and emit gentle pulses of light or sound to signal when it’s time to rest. These devices could be synced with a global database to ensure that everyone is on a similar sleep schedule, promoting social harmony. Over time, these rhythms could be tailored to individual preferences, helping people to achieve optimal rest even in a constant daylight environment.",
    "**Nature’s Sleep Retreats**: With no night-time, outdoor sleep retreats could become popular. These retreats would be designed to create a natural night-like atmosphere during the day. They would utilize canopies of trees, sound barriers, and specialized lighting to simulate twilight. Guests could lay on hammocks or in secluded tents, surrounded by nature, as soft ambient sounds play to help them drift off. These retreats would also offer workshops on relaxation techniques, meditation, and yoga to promote healthy sleep habits.",
    "**Scented Sleep Aromatherapy**: Without the natural cue of nightfall, our bodies may struggle to wind down. To combat this, a line of aromatherapy products could be developed specifically for sleep in a daylight world. These products would include essential oil diffusers, sleep sprays, and scented pillows infused with calming fragrances like lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood. The scent would trigger relaxation responses in the brain, helping to signal that it’s time to rest, regardless of the time of day.",
    "**Cocooning Sleepwear**: To adapt to the lack of night, a new line of sleepwear could be designed that acts like a cocoon. This sleepwear would be made from lightweight, breathable fabrics that can regulate body temperature and block out light. With features like hoods and eye masks built into the design, wearers can create a personalized sleep environment wherever they are. The garments could also have built-in technology that releases calming scents or plays gentle sounds, promoting a sense of security and relaxation.",
    "**Social Sleep Zones**: In this new world, communal spaces could be designed as “sleep zones” where people gather to rest together. These zones would be equipped with comfortable loungers, soft lighting, and soundproofing to create a serene atmosphere. Users could book time slots to nap in these spaces, promoting social interactions and community bonding. Activities like guided group meditations or relaxation sessions could also be offered, encouraging a culture of mindfulness and restfulness in the absence of night."
