    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: One creative solution would be to use solar-powered lanterns that can provide light during the day. These lanterns use photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity, which can power LED bulbs or other light sources. They are eco-friendly, energy-efficient, and can be placed in various locations around the home or workplace.",
    "Mirror-Based Lighting: Another idea is to use mirrors to reflect light from a single source, such as a window or a lamp, to create a more diffused and brighter lighting environment. This can be achieved by placing mirrors strategically around the room to reflect light towards the areas that need illumination.",
    "Light-Emitting Plants: Some plants, such as the \"Glowing Plant\" or \"Glowing Mushroom,\" are naturally bioluminescent and can provide a soft, ambient light. These plants can be placed around the home or workplace to create a soft, natural lighting effect.",
    "Light-Reflecting Paint: A novel solution would be to use light-reflecting paint on walls, ceilings, or other surfaces to reflect light and create a brighter environment. This paint can be applied to any surface and can be mixed with different pigments to create different colors and hues.",
    "Holographic Displays: For a more futuristic solution, holographic displays could be used to project 3D images of light onto any surface. These displays use lasers and advanced optics to create a holographic image that can be manipulated and controlled using software. This technology is still in its infancy, but it could potentially provide an innovative solution to the problem of insufficient lighting."
