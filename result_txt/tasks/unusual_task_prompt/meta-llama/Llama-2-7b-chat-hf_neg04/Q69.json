    "Hairdryer with built-in aromatherapy: Create a hairdryer with a built-in aromatherapy diffuser that releases calming scents, such as lavender or peppermint, to help users relax and unwind while styling their hair. The diffuser could be located at the base of the hairdryer or incorporated into the nozzle.",
    "Smart hairdryer with AI-powered styling suggestions: Develop a hairdryer with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that analyze a user's hair type, face shape, and styling preferences to provide personalized styling suggestions. The AI could offer tailored recommendations for temperature, airflow, and styling time based on the user's hair type and desired look.",
    "Hairdryer with customizable heat and airflow: Design a hairdryer with interchangeable nozzles that allow users to customize the heat and airflow for different styling needs. For example, a nozzle with a wider airflow setting could be used for beachy waves, while a nozzle with a narrower airflow setting could be used for sleek and straight styles.",
    "Portable hairdryer with built-in UV light: Create a compact, portable hairdryer that also features a built-in UV light for added hair benefits. The UV light could help to damage hair cuticles, reduce frizz, and add shine to the hair. The portability of the hairdryer would make it easy to use on-the-go or while traveling.",
    "Hairdryer with integrated hair care products: Design a hairdryer with built-in hair care products, such as a heat protectant spray or a frizz-fighting serum. The products could be stored in a compartment at the base of the hairdryer and dispensed as needed for added convenience and styling benefits. This would eliminate the need for users to carry separate hair care products and streamline their styling routine."
