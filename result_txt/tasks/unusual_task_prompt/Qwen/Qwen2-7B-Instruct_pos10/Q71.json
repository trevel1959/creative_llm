    "**Tea-Time Theatre**: Design a teapot that doubles as a miniature stage where small figurines can perform plays or stories. The lid could be a door, the spout could have a light source for illumination, and the handle could be a lever to control the movement of the stage. This unique design allows for a blend of creativity and storytelling while enjoying a cup of tea.",
    "**Teapot as a Personalized Journal**: Create a teapot that opens like a book, revealing pages inside for writing. The exterior can feature a variety of designs, such as floral patterns, geometric shapes, or abstract art, which are personal to the owner. This not only provides a creative way to store and access personal notes or thoughts but also doubles as a decorative piece on a desk or shelf.",
    "**Teapot as a Solar-Powered Water Heater**: Develop a teapot that harnesses solar energy to heat water. It would consist of a reflective surface on the outside to collect sunlight, which heats up water stored inside the traditional teapot body. This innovative idea is environmentally friendly and practical for outdoor settings where traditional electric kettle might not be accessible.",
    "**Teapot as a Sound Amplifier**: Build a teapot that acts as a simple sound amplifier. The body of the teapot can be hollowed out and lined with materials that enhance sound quality, like wood or foam. The handle can serve as a microphone input, allowing users to amplify their voice or music when using it as a speaker. This is particularly useful for gatherings where clear sound is needed without using bulky speakers.",
    "**Teapot as a Smart Home Device**: Integrate a teapot with smart home technology. It could be equipped with sensors that monitor the temperature of the water and notify the user via a smartphone app when the water has reached boiling point or when it's time to add tea leaves. Additionally, it could learn user preferences over time, automatically adjusting the heating cycle to suit individual tastes. This modern twist makes tea preparation more convenient and efficient."
