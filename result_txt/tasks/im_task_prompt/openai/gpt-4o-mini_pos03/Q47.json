    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Develop a self-cleaning feature for the vacuum's filters and brushes. Using a combination of UV light and vibration, the vacuum could sanitize and dislodge dirt and debris from its components after each use. This would not only enhance performance but also reduce the need for regular maintenance by the user.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a vacuum cleaner with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their cleaning needs. For example, attachments could be designed for specific tasks like upholstery cleaning, car detailing, or even a mop attachment for hard floors. This versatility would cater to various cleaning scenarios without needing multiple devices.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Cleaning Assistant**: Integrate AR technology into the vacuum cleaner’s app. Users could point their smartphone camera at a room, and the app would overlay cleaning suggestions, highlighting areas that need attention or suggesting optimal cleaning paths. This would help users ensure they cover all areas effectively and efficiently.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Waste Disposal**: Innovate a waste disposal system that composts organic debris collected during vacuuming. By incorporating a small composter within the vacuum, users could convert food scraps and organic waste into compost while cleaning. This feature would not only reduce landfill waste but also promote sustainable practices among users.",
    "**Whisper Mode Technology**: Introduce a “whisper mode” that significantly reduces noise levels while maintaining suction power. This could be achieved through advanced sound-dampening materials and technology that minimizes motor noise. This feature would make vacuuming more pleasant, especially in homes with small children or pets who may be disturbed by loud sounds."
