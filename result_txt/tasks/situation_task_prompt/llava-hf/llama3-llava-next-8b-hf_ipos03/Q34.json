    "Implement a rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores rainwater from rooftops and gutters for later use in watering plants.",
    "Use a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants, reducing evaporation and runoff.",
    "Create a self-sustaining ecosystem in a greenhouse or indoor garden where plants can grow in a controlled environment with a water source.",
    "Develop a hydroponic system that uses nutrient-rich water to nourish the plants, eliminating the need for soil and reducing water usage.",
    "Utilize a fogging system that mists the plants with water to provide them with moisture, similar to the way fog provides moisture to plants in the wild."
