    "**Solar Power Grid**: A network of satellites orbiting the Earth, collecting and beaming solar energy back to the planet. This grid would provide a constant and clean source of power, eliminating the need for fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions. The satellites would be equipped with advanced solar panels and energy storage systems, ensuring a stable and efficient power supply.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: A system of towers or drones that capture and condense water vapor from the air, providing a sustainable source of clean drinking water. This technology would be particularly useful in arid regions, where access to clean water is scarce. The harvested water could also be used for irrigation, reducing the strain on local water resources.",
    "**Space-Based Solar Sails**: A fleet of spacecraft equipped with massive solar sails, which would harness the momentum of solar photons to propel the craft through space. This technology could be used for interplanetary travel, enabling faster and more efficient exploration of the solar system. The solar sails could also be used to stabilize the orbits of satellites or even create a solar-powered propulsion system for deep space missions.",
    "**Solar-Powered Artificial Photosynthesis**: A system that mimics the process of photosynthesis, using sunlight to convert CO2 into oxygen and organic compounds. This technology could help mitigate climate change by removing excess CO2 from the atmosphere and producing a sustainable source of biofuels. The artificial photosynthesis system could be integrated into buildings, vehicles, or even clothing, providing a scalable solution for carbon sequestration.",
    "**Solar-Driven Desalination**: A system that uses concentrated solar energy to desalinate seawater, providing a sustainable source of fresh water for coastal communities. This technology could be used in conjunction with the atmospheric water harvesting system, creating a closed-loop water cycle that reduces the strain on local water resources. The desalination process would also produce a byproduct of clean energy, which could be fed back into the grid or used to power local industries."
