    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Develop a toothbrush made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or biodegradable plastics, that decomposes after use. This toothbrush could come with replaceable heads, allowing users to keep the handle while reducing plastic waste. Additionally, it could feature natural bristles made from plant fibers, promoting a greener dental hygiene routine.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Innovate a toothbrush that includes a UV light sanitizing feature in the base. After brushing, users can place the toothbrush in its holder, which activates the UV light to kill bacteria and viruses on the bristles. This would ensure that each brushing session starts with a clean brush, improving oral hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Pressure Sensor and Vibrating Alerts**: Design a toothbrush that includes a pressure sensor to detect how hard the user is brushing. If excessive pressure is applied, the toothbrush would vibrate to alert the user to ease up. This would help prevent gum damage and promote gentler brushing techniques, making it especially beneficial for individuals with sensitive gums.",
    "**Toothbrush with Color-Changing Bristles**: Create a toothbrush where the bristles change color based on the effectiveness of the brushing. For example, the bristles could turn from blue to white if they are not cleaned properly or if plaque is present. This visual cue would encourage users to brush more effectively and could serve as a fun way to engage children in dental care.",
    "**Personalized Toothbrush Subscription Service**: Launch a subscription service that delivers customized toothbrushes tailored to individual dental needs. Users could take an online quiz about their oral health, preferences, and any specific issues (like sensitivity or braces) to receive a toothbrush that suits them best. The service could also include toothpaste and floss that align with their dental goals."
