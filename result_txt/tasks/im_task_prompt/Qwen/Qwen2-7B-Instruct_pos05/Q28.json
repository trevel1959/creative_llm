    "**Solar-Powered Bicycle Helmet**: This innovative idea involves integrating solar panels into the design of the helmet. The helmet would have a series of solar cells on its surface which can harness sunlight to charge a battery inside the helmet. This battery could then power LED lights for increased visibility during night rides, or perhaps even power small devices like smartphones or GPS devices. The helmet would also feature a built-in charging station for these devices, ensuring they stay powered up during long rides.",
    "**Smart Helmet Navigation System**: Design a bicycle helmet equipped with advanced sensors and an integrated navigation system. The helmet would use GPS technology to provide real-time directions to cyclists, eliminating the need for them to constantly check their phones. It could also include features such as speed tracking, heart rate monitoring for fitness enthusiasts, and even a built-in speaker for listening to music or receiving voice-guided instructions. ",
    "**Emergency Communication Capabilities**: In this concept, the bicycle helmet would come equipped with a distress beacon and emergency contact list. If a cyclist is involved in an accident, they could press a button on the helmet to trigger the beacon, alerting nearby emergency services and providing their location information. The helmet could also store important personal details, such as medical conditions or allergies, making it easier for first responders to provide appropriate care.",
    "**Adjustable Cooling System**: This idea focuses on creating a helmet that keeps the rider cool and comfortable during hot weather. The helmet could have a built-in air conditioning system, perhaps using mini fans and heat exchangers that work together to circulate cold air around the head. Alternatively, it could incorporate a water-based cooling system where the helmet is designed to hold a coolant, which is activated when exposed to heat, providing cooling relief to the rider.",
    "**Interactive Safety Warning System**: This helmet would be equipped with advanced AI technology that analyzes data from various sources, including the riderâ€™s behavior, road conditions, and environmental factors. It would predict potential hazards ahead and provide real-time warnings through auditory and visual signals on the helmet display. For example, if the AI detects an increase in traffic density or a sudden change in road conditions, it could alert the rider to slow down or take an alternative route. This proactive approach aims to enhance safety by preemptively addressing potential risks."
