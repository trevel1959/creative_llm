    "Grow-a-House: A self-sustaining, bioluminescent home that grows and adapts to its surroundings. The structure would be made of a unique blend of microorganisms and nutrients that would fuse together to form a durable, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly dwelling. As the microorganisms multiply and evolve, the house would change shape and size, allowing for natural ventilation and lighting.",
    "Air-O-House: A home that harnesses the power of air to provide shelter. The structure would be composed of a series of interconnected air sacs, each one filled with a different gas or mist that would provide insulation, lighting, and even entertainment. The air sacs would be connected by a network of air ducts, allowing for a constant flow of fresh air and creating a unique, ever-changing living space.",
    "Water-Wall House: A house that incorporates water as its primary building material. The structure would be composed of a series of interlocking water cells, each one serving as a different functional space, such as a bathroom, kitchen, or bedroom. The cells would be connected by a network of waterways, allowing for easy movement and creating a sense of fluidity and continuity throughout the home.",
    "Solar-Skin House: A house that utilizes photovoltaic skin technology to generate energy and regulate the internal climate. The structure would be covered in a thin, flexible layer of photovoltaic cells that would convert sunlight into electricity, providing power for lighting, heating, and cooling. The skin would also be capable of changing color and texture to adapt to different weather conditions, providing natural insulation and reducing the need for mechanical systems.",
    "Bio-Based Building Blocks: A house built using a combination of natural materials and biotechnology. The building blocks would be made of a combination of organic materials, such as wood, bamboo, or straw, and biotechnology, such as bacteria or yeast, that would work together to create a strong, durable, and sustainable structure. The blocks would be able to self-heal and adapt to different environmental conditions, creating a home that is both resilient and responsive to its surroundings."
