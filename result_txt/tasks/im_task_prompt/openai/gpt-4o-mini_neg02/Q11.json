    "**Integrated Water Filter**: Design the water bottle with a built-in filtration system that can purify tap water or water from natural sources. The filter could be replaceable and made from eco-friendly materials, allowing users to fill their bottles from various sources without worrying about impurities. This feature would be especially beneficial for hikers and travelers who need access to clean drinking water.",
    "**Smart Hydration Reminder**: Add a smart technology component that connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The app would track the userâ€™s water intake and send reminders to drink water throughout the day based on their activity level and personal hydration goals. The bottle could also light up or vibrate to alert the user when it's time to hydrate.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular water bottle that can be customized with interchangeable components. Users could add attachments such as a fruit infuser for flavored water, a protein powder compartment, or a collapsible cup for sharing. This would allow for a personalized experience, catering to different hydration needs and preferences.",
    "**Temperature Control Technology**: Develop a water bottle that uses thermoelectric technology to maintain the temperature of the beverage inside. Users could set their desired temperature through a digital display on the bottle, and the bottle would adjust to keep drinks cold or hot for extended periods. This would be ideal for those who enjoy their beverages at specific temperatures.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Reusability**: Innovate a water bottle made from biodegradable or recycled materials that decompose after a certain period. This would help reduce plastic waste. Additionally, the bottle could come with a rewards program where users earn points for every refill, encouraging sustainable practices and promoting the use of reusable bottles."
