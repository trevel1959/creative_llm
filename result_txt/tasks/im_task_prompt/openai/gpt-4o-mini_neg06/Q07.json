    "**Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Create a toothbrush made entirely from biodegradable materials such as bamboo or plant-based plastics. The handle could be designed to break down naturally after a certain period, and the bristles could be made from natural fibers. This would significantly reduce plastic waste and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Water Flosser**: Innovate a toothbrush that combines traditional brushing with a mini water flosser. This design could feature a small reservoir that releases a fine jet of water while brushing, effectively cleaning between teeth and enhancing overall oral hygiene. The user can control the water flow, making it an all-in-one tool for dental care.",
    "**Customizable Toothbrush Heads**: Introduce a toothbrush with interchangeable heads that cater to different dental needs, such as sensitive gums, orthodontic care, or whitening. Users could easily switch heads depending on their current dental requirements, making it a versatile tool that adapts to changing oral health needs.",
    "**Toothbrush with UV Sanitization**: Design a toothbrush that incorporates a UV light feature for sanitizing the bristles after each use. The UV light would eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring a cleaner brush. This feature could be activated by a button or automatically when the toothbrush is placed in its charging dock, promoting better oral hygiene.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Timer and Music**: Create a toothbrush that has a built-in timer and a speaker that plays music or sounds for the recommended two minutes of brushing. The toothbrush could sync with a mobile app to allow users to choose their favorite songs or sounds, making brushing more enjoyable and helping to establish a consistent routine."
