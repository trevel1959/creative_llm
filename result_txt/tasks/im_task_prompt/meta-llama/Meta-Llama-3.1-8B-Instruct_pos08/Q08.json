    "**Smart Fridge Assistant**: Design a smart refrigerator that comes equipped with an AI-powered assistant, allowing users to track their food inventory, receive personalized nutrition recommendations, and even order groceries online. The fridge would be equipped with cameras and sensors to monitor the contents and provide users with a virtual \"pantry\" view, making it easier to meal plan and reduce food waste.",
    "**Fridge-to-Table**: Develop a smart fridge that can automatically cook meals based on the ingredients stored within. Using machine learning algorithms, the fridge would analyze the contents and suggest recipes, then proceed to cook the meal to perfection. This would eliminate meal planning and cooking time, making it perfect for busy households.",
    "**Fridge Farm**: Create a vertical farming system within the refrigerator, allowing users to grow their own herbs and microgreens. This would not only provide a constant supply of fresh produce but also reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation and storage.",
    "**Fridge for the Future**: Design a refrigerator that incorporates cutting-edge technology, such as quantum computing and nanotechnology, to create a truly sustainable and self-sustaining appliance. This fridge would be able to recycle and reuse energy, reducing energy consumption and minimizing waste.",
    "**Fridge for the Environment**: Develop a refrigerator that is designed with the environment in mind. This fridge would be made from recycled materials, use eco-friendly insulation, and even have a built-in air purifier to reduce indoor pollution. The fridge would also come equipped with a \"carbon offset\" feature, allowing users to offset their carbon footprint by investing in renewable energy projects."
