    "Drip Irrigation System: Installing a drip irrigation system would be another solution. This system would deliver water directly to the roots of the plants using a series of small tubes or drippers, minimizing water loss through evaporation and runoff. This would allow for efficient water use and would help keep the plants healthy and well-nourished.",
    "Greywater Recycling: Greywater recycling is another option for watering plants. Greywater is the relatively clean wastewater that comes from sources like showers, sinks, and washing machines. Installing a greywater recycling system would allow for the recycling and reuse of this water for plant irrigation, reducing the need for fresh water.",
    "Water-efficient Plants: Choosing water-efficient plants that require less water would be a practical solution. These plants have adapted to survive in arid environments and require less water to thrive. By selecting plants that are well-suited to the local climate and water conditions, it would be possible to maintain a healthy garden without relying on rainfall.",
    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a sustainable method of growing plants using fish as a source of nutrients. In an aquaponic system, fish are raised in tanks, and their waste provides nutrients for the plants. This system can be set up indoors and would allow for the continuous production of plants without the need for rainfall.",
    "Solar-powered Irrigation System: Installing a solar-powered irrigation system would be an eco-friendly solution. This system would use solar panels to power a pump that delivers water to the plants. This would allow for a sustainable water supply without the need for rainfall or electricity."
