    "**Mood-Enhancing LED Bed Frame**: Design a bed frame that incorporates customizable LED lighting. Users can choose colors and intensities to match their mood or create a calming atmosphere for sleep. The lights could gradually dim to mimic sunset when itâ€™s time to sleep and brighten gently in the morning to simulate sunrise, helping regulate circadian rhythms naturally.",
    "**Adjustable Comfort Zones**: Create a bed with multiple adjustable comfort zones that can be tailored to different areas of the body. Using air or gel technology, each zone can be controlled separately to provide varying levels of firmness or softness, catering to individual preferences for each sleeper. This feature would be especially beneficial for couples who have different comfort needs.",
    "**Integrated Sleep Environment**: Build a bed that includes a sound system, aroma diffuser, and climate control features. The sound system could play white noise or nature sounds to promote relaxation, while the aroma diffuser could release calming scents like lavender. Climate control could adjust the temperature of the mattress to ensure a comfortable sleep environment, addressing common issues like overheating during the night.",
    "**Convertible Bed Design**: Innovate a bed that can easily transform into different configurations. For example, it could convert from a standard bed to a sofa, or even to a workspace with a fold-out desk. This multifunctional design would be perfect for small living spaces, allowing users to maximize utility without sacrificing comfort.",
    "**Built-in Sleep Hygiene Station**: Develop a bed with an integrated sleep hygiene station that includes features like a retractable toothbrush holder, a built-in water dispenser, and a drawer for sleep accessories like eye masks and earplugs. This station would encourage healthy nighttime routines and help users prepare for sleep in a more organized manner."
