    "**Dreamscape Architecture**: Imagine a world where buildings and structures are designed to adapt to the absence of night-time. The skyscrapers would be covered in a translucent, glow-in-the-dark material that absorbs and stores energy during the day, releasing it at night to create a soft, ethereal glow. This would allow people to sleep with the city still radiating a gentle light, making the concept of \"night\" obsolete. ",
    "**Chrono-Sleep Pods**: In a world without night-time, people would need to find alternative ways to recharge. Chrono-Sleep Pods would be designed to simulate the natural sleep-wake cycle, using advanced technology to regulate body temperature, heart rate, and brain activity. These pods would be equipped with soothing sounds, scents, and gentle vibrations to induce a deep, restorative sleep, ensuring that people wake up feeling refreshed and revitalized.",
    "**Bioluminescent Forests**: Envision a world where forests are infused with bioluminescent organisms that produce a soft, blue-green glow. This would create a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere, allowing people to sleep under the stars without the need for artificial light. The bioluminescent trees would also purify the air and produce oxygen, making the forest a haven for rest and relaxation.",
    "**Time-Traveling Sleepwalkers**: In a world without night-time, people would need to find creative ways to explore their subconscious. Time-Traveling Sleepwalkers would be individuals who can lucid dream and travel through time while asleep. They would be able to visit past or future versions of themselves, explore alternate realities, and even communicate with other sleepwalkers across different timelines.",
    "**Sleeping Cities**: Imagine a world where cities are designed to be a giant, sprawling sleep environment. Sleeping Cities would be built with sprawling, interconnected structures that resemble a giant, slumbering beast. The buildings would be designed to cradle the inhabitants, providing a sense of security and comfort. The city would be a living, breathing entity that adapts to the needs of its inhabitants, ensuring that everyone gets the restful sleep they need to thrive.
