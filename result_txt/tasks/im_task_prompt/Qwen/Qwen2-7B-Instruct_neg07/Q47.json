    "**Innovative Vacuum Cleaner Attachment for Pet Hair Removal:** Create an attachment that uses ultrasonic vibrations to loosen and remove pet hair from carpets and upholstery without causing damage. This attachment can also be equipped with a built-in sensor to detect the type of surface (carpet, furniture) and adjust its vibration intensity accordingly. The design would include a self-cleaning feature that removes hair from the attachment after use, making it easy to maintain.",
    "**Smart Vacuum Cleaner with AI Assistance:** Develop a vacuum cleaner that integrates artificial intelligence technology to optimize cleaning based on the specific needs of your home. It could analyze the layout of your home, learn the frequency and patterns of usage, and adjust its cleaning schedule and intensity accordingly. Additionally, it could provide real-time feedback on the cleanliness of various areas in your home, suggesting targeted cleaning when necessary.",
    "**Portable Vacuum Cleaner with Rechargeable Battery for Cleaning Hard-to-Reach Areas:** Design a compact, lightweight vacuum cleaner that is ideal for cleaning hard-to-reach areas such as under furniture, around corners, and in tight spaces. It should come with an extendable wand and a variety of attachments, including a small brush and a crevice tool. The device would have a rechargeable battery that lasts for several hours on a single charge, making it suitable for extensive cleaning tasks.",
    "**Vaccum Cleaner with Built-in Dust Analysis Sensor:** Introduce a vacuum cleaner equipped with a sensor that analyzes the dust and debris collected during cleaning. Based on the analysis, the device could suggest cleaning solutions or air purifiers that are tailored to your home's specific needs. For instance, if it detects high levels of allergens, it could recommend a specific type of filter or cleaning product.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Robot Vacuum Cleaner with Integrated Sanitization:** Create a robot vacuum cleaner that not only cleans but also sanitizes surfaces as it moves through your home. This could involve incorporating UV-C light technology to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces while vacuuming. Additionally, the robot could be designed to release antimicrobial agents into the air or onto surfaces, further enhancing the sanitization process. The device should be user-friendly, allowing homeowners to schedule cleaning and sanitization sessions according to their preferences."
