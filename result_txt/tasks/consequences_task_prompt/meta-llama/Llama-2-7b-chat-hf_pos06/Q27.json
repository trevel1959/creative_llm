    "Ecosystem collapse: Without photosynthesis, the Earth's ecosystem would collapse, leading to a significant decline in biodiversity and ecological balance. Plants are the primary producers in an ecosystem, converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. Without them, the food chain would be severely disrupted, and many species would struggle to survive. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Climate change: Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen. Without photosynthesis, the concentration of carbon dioxide would increase, leading to a severe greenhouse effect and catastrophic climate change. This would result in rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and a dramatic shift in weather patterns. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Loss of food sources: Photosynthesis is the primary source of food for many organisms, including humans. Without photosynthesis, food chains would be severely disrupted, and many species would struggle to find enough food to survive. This would lead to widespread famine and food insecurity, with severe consequences for human populations. Confidence score: 0.95",
    "Decline in atmospheric oxygen: Photosynthesis not only produces oxygen but also helps maintain the Earth's atmospheric oxygen levels. Without photosynthesis, oxygen levels would decline, leading to a significant impact on the Earth's ecosystem and the survival of many organisms. Confidence score: 0.85",
    "Shift in ocean currents: Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the Earth's ocean currents. Without photosynthesis, ocean currents would shift, leading to changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and nutrient distribution. This would have a significant impact on marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and other marine habitats. Confidence score: 0.8"
