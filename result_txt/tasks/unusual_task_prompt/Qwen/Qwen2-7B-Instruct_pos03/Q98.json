    "**Smart Power Strip**: This innovative idea involves creating a power strip that integrates smart technology. It can be connected to a Wi-Fi network, allowing you to control it via a smartphone app or voice commands. The strip could have features such as:    - **Energy Monitoring**: It could track and display the amount of electricity consumed by each outlet.",
    "**Wireless Charging Power Strip**: By incorporating wireless charging pads into the design, this power strip allows multiple devices to charge wirelessly. Each outlet could have a corresponding charging pad that supports Qi, Apple MagSafe, or other charging standards. This is particularly useful for smartphones, smartwatches, and other small electronics.",
    "**Multi-functional Power Strip**: In addition to standard AC outlets, this power strip could include USB ports, USB-C ports, and possibly even a Qi wireless charging pad. This makes it versatile enough for use in a variety of settings, from home offices to dorm rooms.",
    "**Automatically Dimming LED Lights**: A power strip could be designed with built-in dimmable LED lights. These lights would automatically adjust their brightness based on ambient light levels or user preferences, reducing energy consumption and enhancing aesthetics.",
    "**Emergency Power Backup**: Incorporating rechargeable batteries into the power strip, this idea provides an emergency backup source of power during outages. It could come with a portable battery pack that can be recharged via the power strip, ensuring that critical devices like a phone or a medical device remain powered during power failures."
