    "**Language Barriers**: Language differences could hinder effective communication among delegates. To address this issue, the summit could employ a diverse team of interpreters fluent in multiple languages. Additionally, organizers could provide translation apps or devices for delegates to use during discussions. This would ensure that everyone can express their ideas clearly and participate fully in the dialogue, promoting a more inclusive atmosphere.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Given the high-profile nature of an international peace summit, security threats could pose a significant challenge. Organizers could collaborate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to develop a comprehensive security plan. This plan might include background checks for attendees, controlled access to the venue, and the presence of security personnel. By prioritizing safety, the summit can proceed without disruptions and maintain a focus on its objectives.",
    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and transportation for delegates from various countries can be complex. To streamline logistics, organizers could partner with a dedicated event management company specializing in international conferences. This company could handle everything from booking flights and hotels to arranging local transportation and catering. By outsourcing these tasks, organizers can focus on the summit's content and outcomes rather than logistical details.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Management**: Different countries may have varying priorities and agendas, leading to potential conflicts during discussions. To address this, the organizing committee could create a flexible agenda that allows for breakout sessions focused on specific topics of interest to different groups. This would enable delegates to engage in meaningful conversations relevant to their countries while still contributing to the overall goals of the summit. Facilitators could also be assigned to ensure discussions remain constructive and on track.",
    "**Sustainability Initiatives**: Hosting a large international event can have a significant environmental impact. Organizers could implement sustainability initiatives, such as reducing single-use plastics, providing plant-based catering options, and promoting carbon offset programs. By prioritizing eco-friendly practices, the summit can set a positive example for global cooperation and commitment to environmental issues, aligning with the theme of peace and harmony."
