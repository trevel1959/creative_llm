    "**Urban Farming**: Plant vertical gardens in city spaces, such as rooftops and walls, to increase food production and provide green spaces in urban environments. This could improve air quality, provide insulation, and create opportunities for local agriculture.",
    "**Space Exploration**: Use your ability to grow plants in space, enabling astronauts to have a source of food and oxygen during long-duration missions. This could also help to establish a sustainable habitat for future space colonies.",
    "**Agricultural Efficiency**: Enhance crop yields by mentally manipulating plant growth rates, optimizing water usage, and adjusting nutrient intake. This could be particularly beneficial in regions with limited water resources or challenging growing conditions.",
    "**Artificial Photosynthesis**: Develop plants that can convert sunlight into electricity, creating a sustainable source of clean energy. This could be used to power homes, vehicles, and infrastructure, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "**Bioremediation**: Use your ability to grow plants that can absorb and break down toxic chemicals or pollutants, helping to clean up contaminated soil and water sources. This could be particularly useful in areas affected by industrial accidents or oil spills."
