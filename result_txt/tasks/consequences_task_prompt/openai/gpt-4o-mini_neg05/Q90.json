    "**Inflation Surge**: With the eradication of debt, consumer spending could skyrocket as people feel wealthier without the burden of repayment. This sudden increase in demand could outpace supply, leading to inflation. If businesses are unable to keep up with the heightened demand for goods and services, prices could rise rapidly. Central banks would face a difficult task in managing inflation, potentially leading to interest rate hikes that could stifle growth and investment.",
    "**Loss of Creditworthiness**: The global financial system is built on trust and creditworthiness. If all debt were erased, it could lead to a loss of faith in credit systems. Financial institutions may become more risk-averse, tightening lending standards and reducing access to credit for individuals and businesses. This could stifle innovation and growth, as access to capital becomes limited. Entrepreneurs and startups might struggle to secure funding, leading to a slowdown in economic progress.",
    "**Redistribution of Wealth**: The erasure of debt could result in a significant redistribution of wealth. Debtors, who are often lower-income individuals or nations, would find themselves relieved of financial burdens, while creditors, including banks and wealthier nations, would face substantial losses. This shift could lead to greater economic equality in the short term, but it could also create tensions between those who benefited from debt cancellation and those who suffered losses.",
    "**Geopolitical Tensions**: Countries that have lent substantial amounts to others would find themselves in a precarious position. The erasure of debt could lead to diplomatic fallout, with creditor nations feeling betrayed and seeking reparations or other forms of compensation. This could strain international relations and lead to geopolitical instability, as nations navigate the complexities of new power dynamics resulting from the financial reset.",
    "**Cultural Shift in Financial Attitudes**: The removal of debt could catalyze a cultural shift in how societies view borrowing and spending. With debt no longer a factor, people might adopt more sustainable financial practices, prioritizing savings and investment over consumption. This change in mindset could lead to a more responsible approach to personal finance, but it could also slow economic growth if consumers become overly cautious in their spending habits."
