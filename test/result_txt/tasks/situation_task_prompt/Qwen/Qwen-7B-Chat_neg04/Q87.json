    "Use a fork to create small cuts in the material you want to cut. This can be done by stabbing the fork into the material at different angles and depths to create a series of small holes that can then be connected together to form a larger cut.",
    "Use a clothespin or paperclip to hold down one end of the material you want to cut while using a pencil or pen to carefully draw out the shape you want to create. Once the outline is complete, use a pair of pliers or scissors to carefullyå‰ª along the lines you drew.",
    "Use a sharp stone or piece of glass to scrape away small sections of the material you want to cut until it becomes thin enough to easily cut through. Be sure to wear protective gloves and eye goggles to avoid injury.",
    "Use a dull knife or spoon to gently pry apart the edges of the material you want to cut. Apply pressure gradually to avoid tearing the material, and continue to work the edges until they are loose enough to separate without breaking.",
    "Use a piece of string or cord to tie around the material you want to cut, creating a makeshift \"hinge\" where the material will fold naturally. Then, use a pair of scissors or shears to carefully cut through the folded material, following the natural creases to create a clean and precise cut."
