    "The first idea is to create a virtual reality experience that allows the audience to be a part of the movie. The director can use this technology to guide the audience through the story and make them feel like they are a part of the action. This could be especially effective for action-packed blockbuster movies, allowing the audience to experience the excitement and danger firsthand.",
    "The second idea is to use a unique visual style to differentiate the movie from other blockbusters. For example, the director could use a hand-drawn animation style, or a low-key, gritty realism to create a unique look that sets the movie apart. This could also be used to create a more immersive experience for the audience, as they become more invested in the world of the movie.",
    "The third idea is to use a non-linear storytelling structure to keep the audience engaged. This could involve jumping back and forth in time, or telling the story from multiple perspectives. This would require careful planning and execution, but it could create a more dynamic and interesting experience for the audience.",
    "The fourth idea is to use social media and other online platforms to engage with the audience and build hype for the movie. This could involve creating behind-the-scenes content, releasing teasers and trailers, and hosting online events and Q&A sessions with the cast and crew. This could help to create a sense of community around the movie, and make the audience feel more invested in the story.",
    "The fifth idea is to use a unique location or setting to create a sense of wonder and excitement. For example, the director could choose to set the movie in a fantastical world, or a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This could help to create a more immersive experience for the audience, and make the movie stand out from other blockbusters."
