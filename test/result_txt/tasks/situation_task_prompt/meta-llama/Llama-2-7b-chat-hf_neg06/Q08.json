    "Build a desalination plant: One option for obtaining clean drinking water in a world where all water sources are polluted is to build a desalination plant. Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater, making it safe for drinking. This could be achieved through reverse osmosis, distillation, or other methods. By building a desalination plant near the coast or in an area with access to seawater, it would be possible to produce clean drinking water for the local population.",
    "Create a water filtration system: Another option for obtaining clean drinking water in a polluted world is to create a water filtration system. This could involve using a combination of activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light to remove impurities from the water. The filtration system could be installed in a central location, such as a community center or school, and could provide clean drinking water for the local population.",
    "Develop a water harvesting system: In areas with limited access to seawater or polluted water sources, a water harvesting system could be developed. This system would involve collecting and storing rainwater or snowmelt in a series of tanks or reservoirs. The water could then be treated using a filtration system or distillation process to make it safe for drinking. By harvesting and treating rainwater, it would be possible to provide clean drinking water for the local population without relying on polluted water sources.",
    "Create a hydroponic garden: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich solution rather than soil. By creating a hydroponic garden, it would be possible to grow crops that require less water than traditional farming methods. The nutrient-rich solution could be recycled and reused, reducing the amount of water needed to grow the crops. Additionally, the hydroponic garden could be located in a greenhouse or other sheltered area, providing a reliable source of fresh produce even in areas with limited access to clean water.",
    "Develop a water-collecting drone: In areas with limited access to clean water, a water-collecting drone could be developed. This drone would be equipped with a filtration system and a water collection device,"
