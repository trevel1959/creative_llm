    "You could create a new form of life by combining the genes of different organisms. For example, you could combine the genes of a dog and a cat to create a new breed of dog.",
    "You could also create a new form of life using genetic engineering. This is when you insert genes from one organism into the DNA of another organism. For example, you could add the gene for blue eyes to the DNA of a brown-eyed person.",
    "Finally, you could create a synthetic form of life by combining the genetic material of different organisms. You could also do this using a computer program.",
    "There are endless possibilities for what a new form of life could look like. There are many ways to combine different genes to create something entirely new. With genetic engineering, you could even create an entirely new species of animal, plant, or fungus.",
    "A new form of life could look very different from anything weâ€™ve seen before. It could be a new type of bacterium, plant, or animal."
