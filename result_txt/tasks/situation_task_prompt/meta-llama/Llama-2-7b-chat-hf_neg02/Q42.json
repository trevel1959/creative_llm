    "Utilize Natural Resources: To survive on a deserted island, I would first assess the surrounding environment to identify potential sources of food, water, and shelter. I would look for coconut trees, which are abundant in tropical islands, as they provide food, shelter, and a source of fresh water. I would use the leaves and branches to construct a lean-to shelter, while the coconut husks could be used as a fuel source for a fire. I would also hunt for fish and other sea creatures in the surrounding waters to supplement my diet.",
    "Create a Sustainable Food Source: To ensure a steady food supply, I would focus on cultivating edible plants that are easy to grow and require minimal maintenance. I would start by planting taro, a hardy root crop that can be grown in marshy areas and provides a good source of carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. I would also plant other crops like bananas, papayas, and citrus fruits, which are easy to grow and can be used for both food and medicine. To supplement my diet, I would also try to catch fish and other sea creatures in the surrounding waters.",
    "Build a Solar-Powered Water Filtration System: To purify water on a deserted island, I would use the sun's energy to create a solar-powered water filtration system. I would collect and cleanse rainwater or seawater using a combination of sand, charcoal, and other natural materials. The filtered water would then be stored in a large container for later use. This system would provide a reliable source of clean drinking water, which is essential for survival.",
    "Create a Signaling Device: To alert passing ships or planes of my presence on the island, I would create a signaling device using materials found on the island. I would use a combination of coconut shells, driftwood, and other flammable materials to create a fire signal during the day. At night, I would use a mirror or other reflective surface to reflect the light of the moon or stars towards any potential rescuers. This signaling device would increase the chances of being discovered and rescued.",
