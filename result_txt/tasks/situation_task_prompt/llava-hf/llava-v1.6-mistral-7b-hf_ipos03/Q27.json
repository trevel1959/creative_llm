    "**Insulation**: Another option is to improve the insulation of the building. Insulation helps to retain heat in colder months and keep the room cooler in warmer months, reducing the need for heating or cooling.",
    "**Thermal Mass**: Thermal mass refers to the ability of a material to absorb, store, and release heat. Incorporating materials with high thermal mass into the building design can help to regulate indoor temperature by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night.",
    "**Solar Panels**: Solar panels can be installed on the roof of the building to harness solar energy and convert it into electricity. This electricity can then be used to power an air conditioning system, providing a sustainable and renewable energy source.",
    "**Green Roofs**: A green roof, which is a roof covered with vegetation, can help to regulate indoor temperature by providing insulation and reducing the heat island effect. The plants on the roof can also absorb and dissipate heat, helping to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "**Passive Solar Design**: Passive solar design involves orienting the building to take advantage of the sun's energy. This can be achieved by designing windows and other openings to face the sun at the right angle, allowing sunlight to enter the building and heat it during the day, and providing shading to prevent overheating."
