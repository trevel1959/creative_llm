    "**Global Economic Boom:** If all world debt was suddenly erased, it would instantly inject a significant amount of capital into the global economy. This influx of funds could lead to a rapid increase in consumer spending, investment, and business expansion, potentially causing a global economic boom. Governments might use this opportunity to invest in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other public services, leading to long-term economic growth.",
    "**Reduction of Inequality:** Erasing world debt would directly impact the wealth distribution, significantly reducing income inequality across nations. This could lead to more equitable societies where resources are more evenly distributed, fostering social stability and reducing poverty. However, it might also create new forms of inequality as wealthier individuals and countries benefit more from the sudden economic stimulus.",
    "**Increased Global Cooperation:** With debt burdens lifted, countries might find themselves more willing to cooperate on international issues such as climate change, global health, and trade agreements. The absence of financial constraints could facilitate more collaborative efforts towards shared goals, enhancing diplomatic relations and potentially leading to the formation of new alliances.",
    "**Inflation and Currency Devaluation:** The sudden release of capital into the market could lead to inflationary pressures, especially if demand outstrips supply. This could cause the devaluation of certain currencies and lead to fluctuations in exchange rates. Central banks might need to adjust monetary policies to manage these effects, potentially affecting international trade dynamics and the value of assets held globally.",
    "**Debt Trap Diplomacy:** Countries that have been heavily indebted might experience a temporary relief but could fall into \"debt trap diplomacy\" if they engage in new borrowing or enter into unfavorable loan agreements with creditors. This could lead to situations where these countries are coerced into making political concessions or adopting policies favored by their creditors, potentially compromising national sovereignty."
