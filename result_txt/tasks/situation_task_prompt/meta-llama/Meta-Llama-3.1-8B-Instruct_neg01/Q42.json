    "**Island Innovation**: Utilize the island's natural resources to create innovative tools and shelter. For instance, use palm fronds to create a sturdy roof, and vines to craft a sturdy door. I'd also collect rainwater and create a solar still to purify water. To signal for help, I'd create a fire using dry leaves and twigs, and use the smoke to attract attention.",
    "**Fishing for Survival**: Focus on fishing as a primary source of food. I'd use makeshift fishing rods made from branches and create bait from island materials like crabs or shellfish. I'd also learn to identify edible fish species and avoid poisonous ones. To expand my fishing range, I'd create a makeshift net using island materials like vines and leaves.",
    "**Coconut Crafts**: Utilize coconuts as a versatile resource. I'd use coconut shells to create cups, bowls, and even a makeshift shelter. I'd also extract coconut oil for cooking and use the husks to create a rope or twine. To signal for help, I'd use the coconut shells to create a loud, attention-grabbing noise.",
    "**Island Gardening**: Create a sustainable food source by gardening on the island. I'd use island materials to create a makeshift garden bed, and plant seeds from the island's flora. I'd also use natural fertilizers like compost and learn to identify edible plants. To attract pollinators, I'd create a makeshift beehive using a hollow log and beeswax.",
    "**Survival Storytelling**: Use my time on the island to create a narrative that would be engaging and memorable for potential rescuers. I'd create a makeshift journal using island materials and write a compelling story about my survival, including my resourcefulness and determination. I'd also use the journal to keep track of my time on the island and create a map of the island's layout. To signal for help, I'd use the journal as a makeshift sign, highlighting key survival strategies and my determination to be rescued.
