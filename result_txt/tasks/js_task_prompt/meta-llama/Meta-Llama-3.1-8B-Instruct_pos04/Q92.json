    "**The Aurora Ring System**: In this reimagined solar system, the planets are arranged in a vast, luminous ring structure. The ring is composed of a thin, iridescent material that refracts and reflects light from the sun, creating a breathtaking display of colors and patterns. Each planet is embedded within the ring, with its own unique characteristics and orbital paths. The ring's edges are stabilized by a network of tiny, artificial satellites that maintain its shape and structure. This design allows for a constant, mesmerizing display of light and color, making the solar system a true marvel of celestial beauty.",
    "**The Gas Giant Moonsphere**: In this revised solar system, the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are surrounded by a massive, spherical structure composed of their own moons. Each moon is a miniature, self-sustaining world with its own atmosphere, geology, and potential for life. The Moonsphere is held together by a complex network of gravitational forces and tidal interactions between the gas giants and their moons. This design creates a vast, interconnected system of celestial bodies, each with its own unique characteristics and potential for exploration.",
    "**The Star-Planet Dyad**: In this reimagined solar system, each planet is paired with a smaller, companion star that orbits the primary star. These companion stars, known as \"dyad stars,\" are smaller and cooler than the primary star, but still emit a significant amount of light and heat. The dyad stars are positioned at a stable Lagrange point, where their gravitational influence on the planet is minimal, but their light and heat have a profound impact on the planet's climate and ecosystems. This design creates a diverse range of planetary environments, each with its own unique characteristics and potential for life.",
    "**The Asteroid Belt Habitat**: In this revised solar system, the asteroid belt is transformed into a vast, interconnected network of habitats and settlements. The asteroids are harvested for resources and reconfigured into self-sustaining, modular structures that provide habitats for a wide range of species. The asteroid belt is stabilized by a network of artificial gravity generators and solar sails, which maintain its shape and prevent it from fragmenting. This design creates a vibrant, thriving ecosystem within the asteroid belt, with opportunities for exploration, trade, and cultural exchange.",
    "**The Black Hole Solar System**: In this reimagined solar system, a supermassive black hole is placed at the center, rather than a traditional star. The black hole"
