    "DIY Dental Hygiene App: Create an app that provides personalized dental hygiene instructions and guides users through a step-by-step oral care routine. Include features like virtual brushing and flossing demonstrations, toothbrush tracking, and reminders to ensure users maintain good oral hygiene habits. Partner with dental professionals to offer expert advice and tips, and provide incentives for users who complete their daily oral care routines.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: Establish community-based dental cooperatives where members share resources and expertise to provide affordable dental care. These co-ops could offer group dental insurance plans, share equipment and supplies, and provide educational workshops on proper oral hygiene practices. By pooling resources and knowledge, members can access quality dental care at a lower cost.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: Develop a fleet of mobile dental clinics that travel to underserved communities, providing on-site dental services and education. These clinics could be equipped with state-of-the-art dental technology, including portable X-ray machines and dental chairs. By bringing dental care directly to those in need, these clinics can help reduce disparities in oral health and increase access to care.",
    "Virtual Dental Consultations: Utilize telemedicine technology to offer virtual dental consultations and remote monitoring. Patients can connect with dentists through video conferencing, allowing for real-time assessments and treatment planning. This can help reduce the need for in-person visits, making dental care more accessible and convenient. Additionally, remote monitoring systems can track patients' oral health progress and alert dentists to any changes or concerns.",
    "DIY Dental Devices: Design and manufacture affordable, user-friendly dental devices that can help individuals perform routine oral care tasks. Examples could include a portable toothbrush with built-in sensors that detect brushing technique and provide feedback, or a tongue scraper that helps remove bacteria and debris from the tongue. By providing users with these tools, they can maintain good oral hygiene practices without relying on dental professionals."
