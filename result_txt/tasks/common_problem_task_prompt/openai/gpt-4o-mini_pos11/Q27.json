    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Developing a vaccine is an expensive endeavor, often requiring millions or even billions of dollars in research, development, and clinical trials. Securing adequate funding can be a challenge, especially for new diseases that may not initially seem like a priority for governments or investors. This can lead to under-resourced projects that struggle to meet timelines or achieve necessary milestones.",
    "**Public Trust and Vaccine Hesitancy**: Even after a vaccine is developed, there may be significant public hesitancy regarding its safety and efficacy. Misinformation and previous negative experiences with vaccines can lead to skepticism among populations. This can result in lower vaccination rates, undermining herd immunity and prolonging the spread of the disease.",
    "**Manufacturing Challenges**: Scaling up vaccine production to meet global demand poses logistical challenges. This includes sourcing raw materials, ensuring quality control, and establishing efficient manufacturing processes. Any disruption in the supply chain—whether due to natural disasters, geopolitical issues, or shortages of key ingredients—can lead to delays in vaccine availability.",
    "**Distribution and Access Inequities**: Once a vaccine is developed, ensuring equitable distribution is crucial. There may be significant disparities in access between wealthy and low-income countries. This can lead to a situation where only a fraction of the global population is vaccinated, allowing the disease to persist and mutate, potentially rendering the vaccine less effective.",
    "**Clinical Trial Recruitment**: Recruiting a diverse and adequate number of participants for clinical trials can be a major hurdle. Factors such as location, awareness, and willingness to participate can affect enrollment rates. Moreover, ensuring that trial participants reflect the demographics of the broader population is essential for understanding the vaccine's effectiveness across different groups."
