    "**Smart Flashlight with App Connectivity**: Develop a flashlight that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. The app can provide features like battery life monitoring, light intensity adjustment, and different light modes (strobe, SOS, etc.). Users could also set reminders for when to recharge the flashlight or receive alerts if the flashlight is left on for too long, thus preventing battery drain.",
    "**Modular Flashlight System**: Create a flashlight with interchangeable modules that allow users to customize their flashlight according to their needs. Modules could include different types of lenses (wide beam, focused beam), a speaker for alerts or music, or even a small first-aid kit compartment. This versatility would cater to various activities such as camping, hiking, or emergency situations.",
    "**Built-in Power Bank Functionality**: Design a flashlight that doubles as a power bank for charging other devices, such as smartphones or tablets. This would be particularly useful in emergencies when access to power sources is limited. The flashlight could include multiple USB ports and a high-capacity battery, ensuring that it can provide adequate power for devices while still functioning as a reliable light source.",
    "**Dynamic Light Adjustment**: Implement a feature that automatically adjusts the brightness and beam focus based on the surrounding environment. For instance, the flashlight could sense ambient light levels and switch to a lower brightness in dark areas to conserve battery life or increase brightness in bright areas. This feature could enhance user experience by providing optimal lighting without manual adjustments.",
    "**Biometric Safety Lock**: Introduce a biometric safety lock system that only allows authorized users to operate the flashlight. This could be especially useful for children or in shared environments where accidental use might be a concern. Users would unlock the flashlight using a fingerprint or facial recognition, ensuring that it is secure and canâ€™t be turned on unintentionally."
