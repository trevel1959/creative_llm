    "Portable binoculars with built-in projector: Develop a pair of binoculars that have a built-in projector, allowing users to project images and videos onto a nearby surface. This could be useful for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or birdwatching, where users can project images of birds, plants, or landmarks onto a screen or wall for a more immersive experience.",
    "Smart binoculars with augmented reality: Create a pair of binoculars that utilize augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the user's view of their surroundings. The binoculars could display additional information on objects and landmarks, such as their names, distances, and other relevant details. This could be especially useful for tourists or travelers who want to learn more about the places they visit.",
    "Waterproof binoculars with underwater camera: Develop a pair of binoculars that can be used underwater, complete with a built-in camera to capture photos and videos of marine life. This would enable users to explore the underwater world without the need for a separate camera or housing. The binoculars could also have special features such as a zoom lens, night vision, and a depth gauge to help users navigate and explore the underwater environment."
