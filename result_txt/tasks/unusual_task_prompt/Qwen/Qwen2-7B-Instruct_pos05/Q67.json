    "**Innovative Emergency Power Generator**: Develop a flashlight that doubles as a small, portable power generator. The flashlight would have an integrated solar panel or kinetic energy generator (like a small turbine) which can charge the built-in battery when exposed to sunlight or moved. This flashlight can then power not only itself but also small electronic devices during power outages or emergencies.",
    "**Bioluminescent Flashlight**: Create a flashlight that uses bioluminescent organisms like jellyfish or fireflies as its light source. These organisms can be encapsulated in a safe, biodegradable gel within the flashlight. When activated, they emit light through a small window, providing a unique, eco-friendly lighting solution.",
    "**Thermal Imaging Flashlight**: Design a flashlight equipped with thermal imaging technology. This flashlight could detect body heat in the dark, allowing for use in rescue operations where visibility is low, such as finding survivors in disaster-stricken areas.",
    "**Smart Home Control Flashlight**: Incorporate a smart home control feature into the flashlight. It could act as a remote control for home appliances and devices. By scanning QR codes or NFC tags, the flashlight could switch lights on and off, adjust thermostats, and even play music, making it a versatile tool for everyday life.",
    "**Augmented Reality Flashlight**: Combine a flashlight with AR technology. The flashlight could project a virtual image of the surroundings onto the userâ€™s glasses or helmet. This would allow the user to see their environment in a new way, highlighting potential obstacles or paths, especially useful for hikers, cyclists, or anyone navigating unfamiliar terrain at night."
