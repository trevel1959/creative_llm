    "**Smart Helmet with Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Design a bicycle helmet with a built-in health monitoring system that tracks the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. The helmet would also include a GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope to monitor the rider's speed, distance, and G-force exposure. This data would be transmitted to a mobile app, providing the rider with real-time feedback and alerts for potential health risks. The helmet would also feature a built-in microphone and speaker for hands-free communication with other riders or emergency services.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Helmet Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a bicycle helmet made from 100% recycled materials, such as recycled plastic, aluminum, or carbon fiber. The helmet would be designed to be fully recyclable at the end of its life cycle, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The helmet would also feature a unique design that incorporates a built-in air filter, capturing pollutants and particulate matter from the air, providing a cleaner breathing experience for the rider.",
    "**Smart Helmet with Augmented Reality Display**: Design a bicycle helmet with a see-through augmented reality (AR) display that projects vital information, such as speed, distance, and navigation directions, onto the rider's field of vision. The helmet would use a high-resolution display and advanced computer vision algorithms to overlay relevant data onto the real-world environment, providing the rider with a seamless and immersive experience.",
    "**Helmets with Integrated Solar Panels**: Develop a bicycle helmet with integrated solar panels that generate electricity to power a built-in device, such as a GPS, Bluetooth speaker, or LED lights. The solar panels would be designed to be efficient and compact, allowing the helmet to be lightweight and aerodynamic. The helmet would also feature a built-in battery that stores excess energy generated by the solar panels, providing a backup power source for extended rides.",
    "**Helmet with Built-in Air Purification System**: Design a bicycle helmet with a built-in air purification system that captures pollutants and allergens from the air, providing a cleaner breathing experience for the rider. The helmet would feature a compact air filter that uses advanced nanotechnology to remove 99.9% of airborne pollutants, including particulate matter, bacteria, and viruses. The helmet would also include a built-in humidifier to maintain optimal air quality and comfort for the rider. </s> "
