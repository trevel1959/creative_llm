    "**Gesture Control Integration**: Incorporate gesture recognition technology into the mouse. This would allow users to perform specific actions—like scrolling, zooming, or switching applications—through simple hand movements in the air. A built-in camera would track these gestures, making the mouse more versatile and reducing reliance on physical buttons, which can sometimes be cumbersome.",
    "**Biometric Security Features**: Equip the mouse with biometric sensors that can read fingerprints or even heartbeat patterns. This would provide an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access their computers. The mouse could lock or log out if it detects an unauthorized fingerprint, making it an excellent tool for professionals handling sensitive information.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a mouse made entirely from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled components. This mouse could also include a solar panel on the top surface to charge itself when exposed to light, promoting environmental responsibility while providing a practical solution for energy conservation.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring**: Integrate health monitoring features into the mouse, such as sensors that track hand movements, grip strength, and even wrist angles. This data could be synced with a companion app to provide users with feedback on their posture and ergonomics, helping to prevent repetitive strain injuries and promoting healthier computing habits.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity**: Create a mouse that can seamlessly switch between multiple devices (like a computer, tablet, and smartphone) with a simple button press or gesture. The mouse would remember the last device used and connect automatically, making it easy for users to switch between work and personal devices without the hassle of reconnecting."
