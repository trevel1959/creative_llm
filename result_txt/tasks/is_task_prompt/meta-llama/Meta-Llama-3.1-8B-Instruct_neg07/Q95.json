    "In a forest, there lived a tiger named Raja who was afraid of mice. Yes, you read that right â€“ a tiger, the king of the jungle, was terrified of tiny creatures that could fit in the palm of his paw. Raja's fear was so intense that he would run away at the mere sight of a mouse. His fellow animals in the forest would often tease him, calling him \"Tiger Who Was Scared of Mice.\" Raja felt embarrassed and ashamed, and he began to question his own identity as a tiger.",
    "One day, a wise old owl named Hootie approached Raja and asked him about his fear. Raja explained how he was terrified of mice and how it made him feel ashamed. Hootie listened carefully and then said, \"Raja, you are not alone in your fear. Many animals in the forest are afraid of something. Even I, an owl, am afraid of the dark. But what makes you different from the others is not your fear, but how you choose to face it.\"",
    "Hootie told Raja that he should face his fear head-on. Raja was hesitant at first, but Hootie's words resonated with him. He decided to take Hootie's advice and started to confront his fear. Raja began to observe mice from a distance, watching how they scurried around and played with each other. He learned that mice were not as scary as he thought they were.",
    "As Raja continued to observe mice, he started to notice their unique characteristics. He saw how mice were quick and agile, how they could climb up trees and navigate through tight spaces. Raja realized that mice were not just tiny creatures, but also incredibly resourceful and intelligent.",
    "Raja's newfound understanding of mice helped him to overcome his fear. He no longer ran away at the sight of a mouse, and he even started to appreciate their company. Raja and the mice became unlikely friends, and they would often play together in the forest. The other animals, who had once teased Raja, were amazed by his bravery and began to respect him for facing his fear."
