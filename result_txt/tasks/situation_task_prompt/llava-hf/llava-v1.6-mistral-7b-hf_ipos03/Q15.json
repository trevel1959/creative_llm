    "**Learning new techniques**: I would explore new techniques and tools that can help me perform tasks more effectively with my non-dominant hand. For example, I might experiment with using a different grip on a pen or learning to type with a different finger configuration. I might also consider using assistive devices, such as a brace or splint, to help stabilize my hand and improve its function.",
    "**Simplifying tasks**: I would simplify tasks that require fine motor skills by using tools or devices that can perform them for me. For example, I might use a voice-activated assistant to control my computer or smartphone, or I might use a smartwatch to manage my calendar and emails.",
    "**Asking for help**: I would not hesitate to ask for help from others when necessary. This could include asking a friend or family member to perform tasks that are difficult for me to do with my non-dominant hand, or seeking the assistance of a professional, such as an occupational therapist or a hand specialist.",
    "**Prioritizing tasks**: I would prioritize tasks based on their importance and the level of dexterity required. For example, I might focus on tasks that can be performed with my non-dominant hand, such as eating or grooming, while delegating tasks that require more precision, such as cooking or sewing, to others.",
    "**Adapting my environment**: I would adapt my environment to make it more accessible and user-friendly. This could include using larger, easier-to-grip utensils, or arranging frequently used items within easy reach. I might also consider reorganizing my living and working spaces to minimize the need for fine motor skills."
