    "**Solar-Powered Umbrella**: Design a portable, wearable solar umbrella that not only provides shade but also captures and stores solar energy during the day. The umbrella's canopy would be made of a thin, transparent material that allows sunlight to pass through while also generating electricity. This energy would be stored in a compact battery pack, which could be used to power small devices or even charge a phone. The umbrella's frame would be lightweight and collapsible, making it easy to carry and deploy anywhere.",
    "**Luminescent Paint**: Develop a special type of paint that can absorb and store energy during the day, releasing it as a soft, ambient glow at night. This paint could be applied to buildings, roads, or even personal items like clothing or accessories. The paint would contain microcapsules filled with a luminescent material that reacts to light, allowing it to absorb energy during the day and release it at night. This would provide a sustainable and energy-efficient solution for lighting.",
    "**Bio-Luminescent Plants**: Create a new strain of bio-luminescent plants that can thrive in a variety of environments. These plants would absorb energy from the sun during the day and release a soft, blue-green glow at night. They could be used to illuminate public spaces, parks, or even personal gardens. The plants would be genetically engineered to be more efficient at energy production and to have a longer lifespan.",
    "**Glowing Fiber Optic Roadways**: Develop a network of glowing fiber optic cables that can be embedded in roadways, sidewalks, or buildings. These cables would absorb energy from the sun during the day and release a soft, blue light at night. The cables would be made of a durable, weather-resistant material and could be powered by a combination of solar panels and kinetic energy harvesting technology.",
    "**Smart Window Films**: Design a new type of window film that can absorb and store energy during the day, releasing it as a soft, ambient glow at night. The film would contain microcapsules filled with a luminescent material that reacts to light, allowing it to absorb energy during the day and release it at night. This film could be applied to windows, skylights, or even entire facades of buildings, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient solution for lighting. The film would also have the added benefit of reducing glare and UV radiation, making it a popular choice for homes and offices. [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST] [/INST"
