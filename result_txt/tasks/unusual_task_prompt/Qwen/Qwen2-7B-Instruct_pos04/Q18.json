The umbrella's frame can be extended to provide shade, while the canopy retracts or unfolds to cover the user from the rain. This design would offer versatility in weather conditions, making it suitable for both rainy days and sunny days.",
    "**Umbrella-Integrated Mobile Charger**: Create an umbrella that includes a built-in solar panel capable of charging mobile devices. This idea combines the functionality of an umbrella with the convenience of a portable charger, providing users with an eco-friendly solution for keeping their gadgets powered up on-the-go.",
