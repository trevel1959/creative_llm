    "**Hair Accessory**: A pen can serve as a makeshift hairpin or hair stick. If you have long hair, you can twist your hair into a bun and secure it with a pen. This can add a quirky style to your look and is a handy solution when you need to keep your hair out of your face.",
    "**Phone Stand**: In a pinch, a pen can be transformed into a phone stand. By placing it horizontally on a flat surface and leaning your phone against it at an angle, you can create a simple stand to watch videos or video call hands-free.",
    "**Emergency Lock Pick**: In an extreme situation, a pen can be modified to help unlock certain types of locks. By disassembling the pen and using the metal components, you can create a basic tool for picking locks, especially for simple pin tumbler locks (note: this should only be used in legal and ethical situations).",
    "**Personal Safety Alarm**: If you find yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, you can use a pen to create noise. By tapping it against a hard surface or even clicking it repeatedly, you can attract attention and deter an attacker. The bright color of some pens can also help signal for help in an emergency.",
    "**Stylus for Touchscreens**: If youâ€™re in need of a stylus for your tablet or smartphone, the rubber end of a pen can be repurposed as a touchscreen tool. Simply remove the ink cartridge and attach a small piece of conductive material (like a cotton swab) to the end, and you have a quick, DIY stylus."
