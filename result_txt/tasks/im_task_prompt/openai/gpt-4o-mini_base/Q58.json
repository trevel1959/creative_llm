    "**Multi-Functional Attachments**: Design interchangeable attachments that serve multiple purposes. For instance, a diffuser that can also be used as a volumizing brush, or a concentrator nozzle that doubles as a curling wand. This would allow users to switch between styles seamlessly without needing multiple tools.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Implement a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light to sanitize the inner components of the hair dryer. This would help maintain hygiene, especially for users with sensitive scalps or hair issues, and extend the lifespan of the device by preventing buildup of hair and dust.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Smart Grip**: Create a hair dryer with an ergonomic handle that has a smart grip technology. The handle could have a textured surface that adapts to the userâ€™s grip, reducing strain during prolonged use. It could also feature a built-in weight distribution system that balances the dryer, making it feel lighter.",
    "**Integrated Sound Therapy**: Add a sound therapy feature that plays soothing sounds or music while drying hair. This could help create a relaxing environment, turning the hair drying process into a self-care ritual. Users could choose from nature sounds, calming music, or even guided meditations to enhance their experience.",
    "**Cordless and Portable Design**: Develop a cordless version of the hair dryer that utilizes advanced battery technology for longer use. This would make it ideal for travel or on-the-go styling. The dryer could also include a compact charging station that doubles as a storage case, keeping everything organized and ready for use."
