    "**Portable Solar Panel Case**: Design a suitcase that doubles as a portable solar panel charger. This innovative idea allows travelers to charge their devices on the go without relying on electrical outlets. The suitcase can be equipped with a retractable solar panel, which unfolds when needed. Inside, there are charging ports and USB slots for various devices. The case could also include compartments for storing and organizing chargers, cables, and other travel accessories.",
    "**Smart Suitcase with AI Navigation**: Create a smart suitcase integrated with AI technology. This suitcase would use sensors, GPS, and machine learning algorithms to navigate through airports, automatically finding the most efficient routes and elevators. It could even predict flight delays or gate changes and adjust its path accordingly. The suitcase would have a companion app, allowing users to track it, lock/unlock it remotely, and even pay for baggage fees.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Suitcase Made from Recycled Materials**: Design a suitcase made entirely from sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, cork, or organic fabrics. This suitcase not only reduces waste but also has environmental benefits like being lightweight, durable, and water-resistant. It could come in various colors and designs, promoting eco-consciousness among consumers.",
    "**Customizable Suitcase with RFID Technology**: Offer a suitcase with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology that allows users to customize the exterior with stickers, patches, or even digital displays. Each suitcase could have a unique QR code, allowing owners to share their location, interests, or even connect with fellow travelers. The RFID system would ensure secure identification and tracking.",
    "**Inflatable Suitcase for Easy Storage**: Develop an inflatable suitcase that deflates into a compact size for easy storage and transportation. This suitcase would be ideal for people who live in small spaces or need to save room when traveling. When inflated, it would maintain its durability and strength, capable of carrying regular luggage. A built-in pump would allow users to inflate and deflate the suitcase quickly."
