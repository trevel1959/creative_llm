    "**Scent Infuser**: Fill a small cloth pouch with dried herbs or essential oils and place it under the iron's soleplate (make sure it’s on a low setting). The heat will release the fragrance into the air, effectively turning your iron into a scent infuser. This can be a great way to freshen up a room or even your linens.",
    "**Paperweight for Crafting**: Use the weight of the iron to hold down paper or fabric while you work on crafts like scrapbooking or quilting. It can help prevent shifting and ensure precision in your projects. Just be cautious about the heat if you’re using delicate materials.",
    "**Steam-Cleaning Small Items**: A clothes iron can double as a mini steam cleaner for small, hard-to-reach areas. Fill the water reservoir, turn it to the steam setting, and use it to clean items like jewelry, shoes, or even kitchen appliances. The steam can help lift dirt and grime without harsh chemicals.",
    "**Quick Sandwich Press**: If you're craving a warm sandwich but don’t have a panini press, use a clothes iron! Wrap your sandwich in aluminum foil and press it with the iron for a few minutes. This will toast the bread and melt the cheese, giving you a delicious, crispy treat.",
