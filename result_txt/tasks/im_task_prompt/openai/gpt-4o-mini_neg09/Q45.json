    "**Ceiling Fan with Integrated Lighting and Color Therapy**: Design a ceiling fan that includes adjustable LED lighting with color therapy options. Users can select different colors based on their mood or the time of day—soft blues for relaxation, bright whites for productivity, or warm yellows for comfort. The fan could also have a dimming feature to set the perfect ambiance, making it a versatile addition to any room.",
    "**Modular Ceiling Fan Blades**: Create a ceiling fan with interchangeable blades that allow users to customize the look and performance of their fan. Different blade designs could cater to various aesthetics—such as modern, rustic, or tropical—while also offering performance variations like increased airflow or quieter operation. Users could easily swap out blades based on their mood or seasonal decor.",
    "**Solar-Powered Ceiling Fan**: Develop a ceiling fan that can be powered by solar panels, making it an eco-friendly option for energy-conscious consumers. The solar panels could be integrated into the fan's design or mounted separately on the roof. This would reduce electricity costs and provide a sustainable cooling solution for outdoor patios, gazebos, or even indoor spaces with ample sunlight.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Built-in Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Introduce a ceiling fan that includes a built-in essential oil diffuser. Users can add their favorite essential oils to a designated compartment, and as the fan circulates air, it disperses the fragrance throughout the room. This feature could promote relaxation, focus, or energy, depending on the chosen scent, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the space.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Motion Detection**: Create a ceiling fan that utilizes motion detection technology to adjust its speed based on the presence of people in the room. When someone enters, the fan would automatically turn on and increase its speed, then slow down or turn off when the room is empty. This feature would not only save energy but also ensure comfort when needed."
