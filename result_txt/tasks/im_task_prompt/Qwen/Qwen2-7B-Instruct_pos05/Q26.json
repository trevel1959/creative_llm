    "**Interactive Recycling Game**: Design a trash can that becomes an interactive learning tool. It could have a touchscreen interface or a series of buttons that, when pressed, explain the recycling process for each type of waste. For example, pressing a button labeled \"plastic bottle\" could play a short animation explaining how plastic is recycled, or it could scan the barcode on the bottle to provide information about its recycling rate.",
    "**Biodegradable Trash Bag Integration**: Develop a trash can that integrates biodegradable bags as a part of its mechanism. When a user places their waste into the can, the door could automatically seal with a biodegradable film, preventing any leaks or odors while also ensuring the contents break down more quickly in a landfill environment.",
    "**Smart Sorting System**: Create a smart trash can equipped with sensors and AI algorithms that can sort waste into different categories (such as paper, plastics, food scraps) without human intervention. This would reduce the need for manual sorting at collection points, potentially saving time and resources for waste management services.",
    "**Composting Compactor**: Introduce a trash can that includes a composting feature, compacting organic waste into a smaller volume while converting it into nutrient-rich soil. This could be particularly useful in urban areas where space is limited, allowing for the efficient use of waste as a resource for gardening and community gardens.",
    "**Wearable Interface**: Develop a wearable device that pairs with a smart trash can. The device could monitor the amount of waste produced by the user over time, offering personalized feedback on waste reduction strategies, such as encouraging less frequent use or suggesting ways to recycle specific items. This could motivate individuals to adopt more sustainable habits by making waste management feel like a gamified experience."
