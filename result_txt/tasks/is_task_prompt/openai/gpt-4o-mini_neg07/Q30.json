    "In a lush valley, there lived a dragon named Ember, who was unlike any other. While his kin soared through the skies, breathing fire and lighting up the night, Ember trembled at the thought of flames. As a hatchling, he had singed his tail, leaving him with a deep-seated fear. One day, a wildfire threatened the valley, and the other dragons rallied to save it. Realizing he couldnâ€™t let fear hold him back, Ember took a deep breath and flew into the blaze. Instead of burning, he summoned a gust of wind, dousing the flames and proving that courage can shine brighter than fire.",
