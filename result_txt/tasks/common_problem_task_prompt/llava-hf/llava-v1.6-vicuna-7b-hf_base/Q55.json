    "Lack of public awareness and support: Establishing public support for a nature conservation park is crucial for its long-term success. A lack of awareness and public backing can lead to a shortage of funding and a struggle to secure resources for the park's maintenance and development.",
    "Land availability and acquisition: Adequate land for the park must be acquired in order to create suitable habitats for flora and fauna. Limited land availability or expensive land prices can create financial and resource-related challenges for park establishment.",
    "Balancing human and nature interaction: Balancing the needs of protecting the natural environment with the requirements of visitors and tourists can be challenging. Encroachment on park boundaries, increased human/wildlife conflict, and negative impacts on delicate ecosystems can arise if this balance is not effectively managed.",
    "Climate change and vulnerable ecosystems: Nature conservation parks are typically home to diverse ecosystems, including endangered or vulnerable species. Climate change can have significant effects on these ecosystems, threatening their survival and the conservation status of the species they support.",
    "Funding and management of maintenance and restoration efforts: Ensuring the ongoing maintenance and restoration of habitats and ecosystems within the park requires financial resources and dedicated staff. Inexhaustible funding and staffing issues can hinder the park's ability to address ongoing and future conservation needs."
