    "**Hyperinflation Risk**: With all debts erased, the money supply might be flooded with cash as governments seek to stimulate their economies. This could lead to hyperinflation, where the value of currency plummets due to excessive money in circulation. As prices soar, purchasing power would diminish, causing widespread hardship, particularly for those on fixed incomes or with limited financial resources.",
    "**Social Inequality**: The erasure of debt could disproportionately benefit wealthier individuals and corporations who hold significant assets. While the average person might see relief from personal debts, large companies might exploit the situation to acquire assets at a fraction of their value. This could exacerbate social inequality, leading to increased tensions and potential civil unrest as the wealth gap widens.",
    "**Disruption of Credit Systems**: The global financial system is heavily reliant on credit ratings and debt instruments. With all debts erased, credit systems would need to be entirely restructured. This could lead to a temporary freeze in lending, as financial institutions would struggle to assess risk and establish new criteria for borrowing. The disruption could hinder economic growth and innovation, as businesses would find it difficult to secure funding for expansion or new projects.",
    "**Moral Hazard and Behavioral Changes**: If all debts were forgiven, it might create a moral hazard where individuals and entities feel less responsible for their financial commitments. This could lead to reckless borrowing and spending habits, as people might believe that debts will be wiped clean again in the future. Such behavior could undermine the principles of fiscal responsibility and accountability, ultimately leading to further financial crises.",
    "**Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: The erasure of debt could shift global power dynamics significantly. Countries that are heavily indebted might suddenly find themselves with newfound freedom to invest in social programs, infrastructure, and public services. Conversely, creditor nations might experience a loss of influence, leading to geopolitical tensions. This could result in new alliances forming among nations that benefit from debt forgiveness, altering the landscape of international relations."
