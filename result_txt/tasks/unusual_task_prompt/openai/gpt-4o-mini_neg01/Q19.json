The wax will slowly release its fragrance over time, keeping your clothes smelling fresh and providing a pleasant aroma without the use of artificial fragrances.",
    "**DIY Lip Balm**: Melt down a few candles that are made from natural ingredients (like beeswax or soy) and mix them with essential oils and a bit of coconut oil to create a homemade lip balm. Pour the mixture into small containers or tubes and allow it to cool. You’ll have a moisturizing lip product that’s perfect for dry lips.",
    "**Candle Crayon**: For kids or art enthusiasts, leftover candle stubs can be melted down and mixed with a little bit of paraffin wax to create colorful candle crayons. Pour the mixture into molds or even old crayon molds to create unique, colorful wax crayons that can be used for drawing or coloring.",
    "**DIY Candle Holder**: Use a candle as a makeshift candle holder by melting a small amount of the bottom of the candle and pressing it into a dish or plate.

    "**Insect Repellent**: Certain candles, especially those made with citronella or eucalyptus scents, can be used to repel insects.
