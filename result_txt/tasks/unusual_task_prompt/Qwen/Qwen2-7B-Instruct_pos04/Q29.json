    "**Interactive Wake-up Experience:** Design an alarm clock that engages users in a fun and interactive way before waking them up. For instance, it could play a series of trivia questions or simple math problems that the user needs to answer correctly within a certain time frame to turn off the alarm. This not only wakes the person up but also stimulates their mind right from the start of the day.",
    "**Fitness-Driven Alarm Clock:** Create an alarm clock that integrates with fitness trackers or smartwatches. The alarm would gradually increase in volume or intensity based on the user's physical activity level detected overnight. For example, if the user has been active, the alarm might start softly and build up in volume, simulating a sunrise or a gentle stream of sounds, encouraging a more peaceful wake-up.",
    "**Customizable Mood Lighting:** Develop an alarm clock that includes a built-in LED light capable of emitting different colors and intensities. Users can customize the color and brightness of the light to match their mood or the time of day, helping to set the right ambiance for waking up or preparing for bed.",
    "**Dream Journaling Integration:** Integrate the alarm clock with a sleep-tracking app that logs dreams. The alarm could be set to wake the user at a specific point during a REM cycle (when most people are dreaming) and then prompt them to record their dream in a digital journal right after waking up. This feature could help users remember and analyze their dreams, enhancing their understanding of their subconscious thoughts.",
    "**Scented Wake-Up Spheres:** Incorporate a small, enclosed space inside the alarm clock where essential oils or fragrance diffusers can be placed. When the alarm goes off, the scent is released into the room, creating a pleasant and stimulating environment. Users can choose from various scents like lavender for relaxation, mint for energy, or vanilla for comfort, depending on their personal preference or the desired wake-up experience."
