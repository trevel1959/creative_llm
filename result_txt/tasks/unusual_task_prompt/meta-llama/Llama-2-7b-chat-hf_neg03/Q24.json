    "Smart Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that can connect to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their brushing habits, monitor their oral health, and receive personalized recommendations for improvement. The toothbrush could also include features like built-in Bluetooth speakers, a built-in timer, and a travel case.",
    "Gaming Toothbrush: Create a toothbrush that incorporates gameplay elements, such as a toothbrush that lights up, makes sounds, or has different colored bristles that change depending on the game being played. This would make brushing teeth more fun and engaging for children, encouraging them to brush for the full recommended 2 minutes.",
    "Customizable Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that allows users to customize the bristle hardness, shape, and color to suit their individual preferences. This would ensure that users are comfortable and effective in their brushing routine.",
    "Portable Toothbrush: Create a toothbrush that is small enough to be easily portable, allowing users to brush their teeth on the go. This would be ideal for people who are always on the move, such as athletes, musicians, or business travelers.",
    "Sonic Toothbrush: Develop a toothbrush that uses sonic technology to provide a more thorough and efficient cleaning experience. The toothbrush could vibrate at a high frequency, providing a more thorough cleaning than traditional toothbrushes. This would be especially beneficial for people with braces, implants, or other dental work."
