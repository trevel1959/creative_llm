    "Solar Powered Vehicles: One creative solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared would be to harness the power of the sun through solar panels integrated into the body of the vehicle. These panels could be made from advanced thin-film solar cells that are lightweight, flexible, and efficient enough to generate enough electricity to power an electric motor. This would eliminate the need for oil entirely, as the sun's energy would provide a clean and sustainable source of power.",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: Another option would be to convert vehicles to run on hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen can be extracted from various sources, including seawater, and when combined with oxygen in a fuel cell, it produces electricity and water as byproducts. The only emission from a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is water vapor, making it an extremely clean and environmentally friendly option. Additionally, the fuel cells could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to further reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "Electric Vehicles with Advanced Batteries: Electric vehicles could also be powered by advanced batteries that are more efficient and have a longer range than traditional batteries. For example, solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte in traditional lithium-ion batteries with a solid material, could offer higher energy density, faster charging times, and longer lifetimes. These advanced batteries could provide the necessary power for electric vehicles without the need for oil.",
    "Bio-Fuelled Vehicles: Another creative solution would be to convert vehicles to run on bio-fuels, such as algae-based fuels or converted plant waste. These bio-fuels could be produced sustainably and with minimal carbon emissions, providing a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Additionally, the production of these bio-fuels could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to further reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "Magnetic Levitation Vehicles: A more futuristic solution to power vehicles if all the world's oil disappeared would be to use magnetic levitation technology to propel vehicles. Magnetic levitation, or maglev, technology uses magnetic fields to suspend vehicles above a track, eliminating the need for wheels and reducing friction to almost"
