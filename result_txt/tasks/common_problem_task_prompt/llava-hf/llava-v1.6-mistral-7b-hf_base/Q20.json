    "Liability issues: In the event of an accident, determining liability can be difficult if the car is operating autonomously. Who is responsible for the accident - the manufacturer, the software developer, the owner, or the passenger? This raises questions about the legal and ethical implications of self-driving cars and the need for clear regulations and guidelines.",
    "Employment and job displacement: As self-driving cars become more prevalent, there is a risk of job displacement for drivers, particularly those who rely on driving as their primary source of income. This raises concerns about the impact on the economy and the need for retraining and upskilling programs for affected workers.",
    "Ethical considerations: Self-driving cars may face ethical dilemmas, such as whether to prioritize the safety of the passengers or other road users in the event of an accident. This raises questions about the moral and ethical principles that should guide the development and deployment of self-driving cars.",
    "Infrastructure and road design: Self-driving cars require specialized infrastructure, such as sensors and communication systems, which may not be available in all areas. This raises concerns about the need for investment in infrastructure and the potential for road design to be impacted by the deployment of self-driving cars.",
    "Accessibility and affordability: Self-driving cars may be more expensive than traditional cars, which could limit access to transportation for low-income individuals. This raises concerns about the affordability of self-driving cars and the need for subsidies or other support programs to ensure that everyone has access to safe and reliable transportation."
