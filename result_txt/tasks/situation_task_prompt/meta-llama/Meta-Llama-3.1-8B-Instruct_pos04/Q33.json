    "**Time Crystal Technology**: In a world without clocks, we could utilize time crystal technology to create a new way of measuring time. Time crystals are a state of matter that can oscillate at a fixed frequency, even in the absence of an external driving force. By harnessing this property, we could create a device that would emit a unique signal at a precise interval, allowing us to keep track of time.",
    "**Biological Rhythms**: We could use the natural biological rhythms of living organisms to measure time. For example, we could use the circadian rhythms of plants or animals to estimate the passage of time. This method would be more subjective and less precise, but it could provide a rough estimate of time.",
    "**Astronomical Observations**: We could use astronomical observations to keep track of time. By monitoring the movements of celestial bodies, such as the stars, planets, or moons, we could estimate the passage of time. This method would be more accurate for long periods, but less precise for short intervals.",
    "**Sound Waves**: We could use sound waves to measure time. By creating a device that produces a unique sound at a precise interval, we could use the echoes or reflections of this sound to estimate the passage of time. This method would be more precise for short intervals, but less accurate for long periods.",
    "**Geological Timekeeping**: We could use geological events, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, to measure time. By monitoring the frequency and intensity of these events, we could estimate the passage of time. This method would be more accurate for long periods, but less precise for short intervals."
