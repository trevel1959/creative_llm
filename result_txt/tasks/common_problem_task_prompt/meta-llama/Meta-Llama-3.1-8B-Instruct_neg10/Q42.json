    "**Collaborative Experiment Platform**: Develop a web-based platform that enables researchers from around the world to collaborate on large-scale scientific experiments. This platform would facilitate data sharing, real-time communication, and coordination among team members.",
    "**Automated Data Collection and Analysis**: Implement an automated system for collecting and analyzing data during the experiment. This could include sensors, drones, or other IoT devices that collect data in real-time, and AI-powered tools that analyze and interpret the data.",
    "**Crowdsourced Experiment Design**: Leverage crowdsourcing platforms to engage the public in the design and planning of the experiment. This could involve crowdsourcing ideas for experiment design, data collection methods, or even the actual experiment itself.",
    "**Portable and Modular Experiment Design**: Develop a portable and modular experiment design that can be easily set up and taken down, reducing the need for large-scale infrastructure and minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**In-Situ Experimentation**: Conduct the experiment in a natural or real-world setting, rather than in a controlled laboratory environment. This could involve deploying sensors or other equipment in the field to collect data."
