    "**Mood-Responsive Sleep Mask**: Create a sleep mask equipped with sensors that detect your sleep cycle. It would gradually brighten in the morning, simulating the natural light of dawn, and play soothing sounds that gradually increase in volume, such as ocean waves or a gentle breeze, to ease you into wakefulness.",
    "**Plant Awakening**: Introduce a set of \"alarm plants\" that are genetically modified to emit a pleasant fragrance at a designated time. These plants could release scents like lavender or citrus that stimulate your senses and help you wake up feeling refreshed and invigorated.",
    "**Haptic Bed Technology**: Develop a mattress that has built-in haptic feedback. At your designated wake-up time, the mattress would gently vibrate or roll you slightly to encourage you to wake up. This subtle movement mimics the feeling of being nudged awake, similar to how a bird might flutter nearby.",
    "**Pet Companion Alarm**: Train a pet, like a dog or a cat, to wake you up at a specific time. They could be conditioned to gently paw at you or snuggle closer to nudge you awake. This method combines companionship with a natural wake-up call, fostering a stronger bond with your pet.",
    "**Interactive Dream Journal**: Create a digital dream journal that uses AI to analyze your sleep patterns and suggest optimal wake-up times based on your REM cycles. It could also generate a personalized audio experience with motivational affirmations or stories that play softly to wake you up in a positive frame of mind."
