    "**Smart Leash with Emotional Feedback**: Develop a leash that incorporates emotional feedback technology. This smart leash can detect a dog's emotional state (e.g., stress, excitement, or calmness) through a built-in wearable device or a collar-mounted sensor. It can then provide real-time feedback to the owner through a connected app or a wearable device, allowing them to adjust their behavior to better suit their dog's emotional needs. For instance, if the leash detects that the dog is feeling anxious, it could send a notification to the owner's phone, suggesting they take a break or engage in a calming activity with their dog.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Leash**: Design a leash made from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based plastics, natural fibers, or recycled materials. This leash would not only reduce waste but also promote a more sustainable lifestyle for dog owners. The biodegradable materials could be sourced from local suppliers, supporting the local economy and minimizing carbon footprint. The leash could also be designed with a built-in composting mechanism, allowing owners to easily dispose of it at the end of its lifespan.",
    "**Leash with Integrated Safety Features**: Create a leash that incorporates advanced safety features, such as a built-in GPS tracker, a panic button, or a shock-absorbing mechanism. The GPS tracker could provide real-time location updates, allowing owners to keep track of their dog's whereabouts. The panic button could alert emergency services or the owner's emergency contacts in case of an emergency. The shock-absorbing mechanism could help reduce the impact of a sudden stop or a fall, protecting both the dog and the owner.",
    "**Adjustable Leash with Built-in Tension Sensor**: Develop a leash with an integrated tension sensor that can detect when the leash is being pulled too tightly or too loosely. This sensor could send a notification to the owner's phone, suggesting they adjust the leash to a more comfortable length. The leash could also be designed with adjustable lengths, allowing owners to customize the fit for their dog's specific needs. This feature could be particularly useful for dogs with mobility issues or those that require extra support.",
    "**Leash with Integrated Treat Dispenser**: Design a leash with a built-in treat dispenser that rewards good behavior and provides mental stimulation for dogs. The treat dispenser could be programmed to release treats at set intervals or in response to specific behaviors, such as sitting or walking calmly. This feature could help with training, reduce stress, and provide a fun and engaging experience for dogs"
