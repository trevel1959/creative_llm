    "**\"Garden of Reflections\"**: Create a sensory garden that caters to people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Incorporate plants with distinct scents, textures, and colors to stimulate their senses and encourage memories. For example, lavender for calming effects, rosemary for cognitive stimulation, and sunflowers for visual recognition. Incorporate pathways made of smooth stones or wood chips for easy navigation, and place benches or seating areas for relaxation.",
    "**\"Time-Traveling Garden\"**: Design a garden that takes visitors on a journey through different historical periods. Use plants and architectural elements from various eras, such as ancient Greece, the Victorian era, or the Roaring Twenties. Incorporate interactive elements like a \"talking tree\" that shares historical facts or a \"time-traveling\" tunnel that transports visitors to a different era. This garden would be an immersive experience that educates and entertains.",
    "**\"Mood Garden\"**: Create a garden that responds to visitors' emotions. Use color-changing LED lights, scented plants, and sound-emitting devices to create an immersive experience that adapts to the visitor's mood. For example, if a visitor is feeling stressed, the garden could shift to a calming atmosphere with soothing music and gentle lighting. This garden would be a unique therapy tool for mental health.",
    "**\"Garden of Wishes\"**: Design a garden where visitors can write down their wishes and tie them to a tree or a wind chime. As the wind blows, the wishes would be carried away, symbolizing the release of hopes and dreams. The garden could also feature a \"wish-granting\" tree with branches that appear to be made of sparkling fairy dust, adding a touch of magic to the experience.",
    "**\"Garden of Resilience\"**: Create a garden that celebrates the stories of people who have overcome adversity. Incorporate plants that represent resilience, such as the lotus flower, which grows in muddy waters, or the succulent, which thrives in harsh conditions. The garden could feature a \"Wall of Strength\" with quotes and stories of people who have overcome challenges, as well as a \"Resilience Tree\" that symbolizes growth and perseverance. This garden would be a powerful reminder of the human spirit's capacity for resilience.
