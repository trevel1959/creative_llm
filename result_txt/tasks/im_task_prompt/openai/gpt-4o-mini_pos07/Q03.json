    "**Multi-Function Interior**:    Design the interior of the microwave with modular, interchangeable trays that can be swapped out for different cooking methods. For instance, one tray could be for steaming vegetables, another for baking small items, and a third for grilling. This would allow users to cook multiple types of food simultaneously, maximizing efficiency and versatility.",
    "**Built-in Air Fryer**:    Combine microwave technology with air frying capabilities. By incorporating a convection fan and heating element, the microwave could not only reheat food quickly but also crisp and brown it, providing the texture of fried food without the need for oil. This would appeal to health-conscious consumers looking for quick meal options without sacrificing taste.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**:    Implement a self-cleaning mechanism using steam technology. Users could add water to a designated compartment, and the microwave would heat it to create steam, loosening food particles and stains from the interior. After the steam cycle, the user could simply wipe down the surfaces, making maintenance easier and promoting hygiene.",
    "**Enhanced Safety Features**:    Introduce a child-lock system that includes a biometric scanner, ensuring only authorized users can operate the microwave. Additionally, implement sensors that detect overheating or fire hazards, automatically shutting down the appliance and sending alerts to the userâ€™s smartphone for added safety.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**:    Create an energy-saving mode that reduces power consumption during standby and cooking. This mode could be activated during specific hours (e.g., night) or when the microwave is not in use for a certain period. The microwave could also provide users with energy usage statistics and tips for more efficient cooking practices, promoting sustainability."
