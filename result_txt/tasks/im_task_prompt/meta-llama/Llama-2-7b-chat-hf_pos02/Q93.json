    "Bowling Ball Designed for Better Grip: Create a bowling ball with a unique texture or pattern on the surface that provides better grip for the bowler's fingers. This could be achieved through a special coating or by incorporating small ridges or bumps into the ball's surface. This design would help bowlers maintain control and accuracy, especially for those with sweaty hands or for those who struggle with slippage during their delivery.",
    "Smart Bowling Ball: Develop a bowling ball that incorporates advanced technology to provide real-time data and feedback to the bowler. This could include sensors that track the ball's speed, spin, and trajectory, as well as provide tips and suggestions for improvement. This smart ball could be connected to a mobile app or other device, allowing bowlers to analyze their performance and make adjustments on the fly.",
    "Customizable Bowling Ball: Create a bowling ball that allows bowlers to customize the weight, balance, and surface texture to their preference. This could be achieved through a modular design, where different components can be swapped out to create a ball that is tailored to the individual bowler's needs. This would provide a more personalized experience for bowlers and help them find the perfect ball for their style of play.",
    "Bowling Ball with Built-In Drink Holder: Design a bowling ball with a built-in drink holder, allowing bowlers to enjoy their favorite beverage during their game. This could be a small compartment or tray located on the ball's surface, large enough to hold a can or bottle of water or soda. This design would provide a practical and convenient feature for bowlers, especially during long games or tournaments.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark Bowling Ball: Create a bowling ball that glows in the dark, providing an unique and eye-catching visual effect during gameplay. This could be achieved through the use of special materials or coatings that absorb and emit light, creating a glowing effect. This design would add an extra level of excitement and entertainment to the game of bowling, making it more enjoyable for both the bowlers and spectators."
