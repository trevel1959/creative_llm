    "Virtual Reality Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that immerses the driver in a virtual reality world. The wheel could be equipped with sensors that track the driver's hand movements, allowing them to steer the vehicle in the virtual world. This technology could be used for driving simulations, video games, or even training for autonomous vehicles.",
    "Steering Wheel with Built-In Entertainment: Design a steering wheel with built-in speakers, a touchscreen display, and wireless connectivity. This would allow drivers to listen to music, make hands-free calls, and access their favorite apps while on the go. The touchscreen display could also display important information such as navigation, traffic updates, and weather alerts.",
    "Adjustable Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that can be adjusted to fit the driver's comfort and preference. The wheel could be made of a flexible material that can be stretched or compressed to accommodate different hand sizes and shapes. This would ensure a comfortable driving experience for drivers of all sizes and ages.",
    "Steering Wheel with Impact Detection: Design a steering wheel that can detect the force and direction of impact in the event of a crash. This information could be used to alert emergency services or to provide important information to first responders. The wheel could also be equipped with sensors that monitor the driver's vital signs and provide real-time feedback to help them recover from the crash.",
    "Interactive Steering Wheel: Create a steering wheel that responds to the driver's emotions and mood. The wheel could be equipped with sensors that detect the driver's heart rate, facial expressions, and body language. Based on this information, the wheel could adjust its texture, temperature, or even its color to provide a more enjoyable and relaxing driving experience. This technology could also be used to provide a more immersive gaming experience or to enhance the driver's overall well-being."
