    "**Integrated Hair Care System**: Design a hair dryer that includes a built-in reservoir for hair care products such as leave-in conditioners or serums. As the user dries their hair, the device would mist these products evenly, ensuring that hair receives hydration and nourishment while drying, reducing the need for additional styling products afterward.",
    "**Multi-Function Attachments**: Create a series of interchangeable attachments that serve various purposes beyond just drying. For example, a diffuser attachment for curly hair, a volumizing nozzle for adding lift, and a styling comb for straightening. Each attachment could have its own smart features, such as heat sensors to optimize performance based on the style being achieved.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Develop a hair dryer with advanced sound-dampening materials and technology to significantly reduce the noise produced during operation. This could be especially appealing for early risers or those with sensitive hearing, making the hair drying experience more pleasant and less disruptive.",
    "**Portable and Foldable Design**: Innovate a hair dryer that can be easily folded and stored, making it perfect for travel. It could include a dual voltage feature for international use and a compact, lightweight design without sacrificing power. Additionally, a built-in battery option could allow for cordless operation, giving users the freedom to style their hair anywhere.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Features**: Introduce a hair dryer made from sustainable materials and equipped with energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption. The device could also have a recycling program for old hair dryers, encouraging users to send in their outdated models for responsible disposal or refurbishment."
