    "Bartering: In the absence of currency, people would have to rely on bartering to trade goods and services. This means that people would have to negotiate and agree on a fair exchange value for their goods or services before they could be traded. For example, if someone has a surplus of food, they could trade it for a service such as carpentry or cleaning.",
    "Gift Economy: In a gift economy, people would give and receive goods and services without expecting anything in return. This could be done through acts of kindness, generosity, and mutual aid. For example, someone could offer to fix a neighbor's car in exchange for a home-cooked meal.",
    "Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS): LETS are community-based systems that allow people to trade goods and services locally without using money. Members of a LETS system can trade goods and services with each other using a system of credits or tokens. For example, someone could trade their gardening services for a set of carpentry tools.",
    "Time Banking: Time banking is a system in which people can trade their time and skills with each other. For example, someone could offer to teach a cooking class in exchange for a massage.",
    "Cryptocurrency: While not a traditional form of currency, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin could be used as a means of exchange in the absence of traditional currency. People could use cryptocurrencies to buy and sell goods and services, and the value of the cryptocurrency could be determined by supply and demand."
