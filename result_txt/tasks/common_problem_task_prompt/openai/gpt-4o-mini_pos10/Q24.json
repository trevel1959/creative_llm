    "**Language Barriers**: Language can be a significant hurdle for both the host family and the exchange student. The student may struggle to communicate effectively in English, leading to frustration and isolation. Conversely, the host family may find it challenging to understand the student’s needs or emotions. To address this, families could create a supportive environment by using simple language, visual aids, and even learning a few phrases in the student’s native language to enhance communication and build rapport.",
    "**Homesickness and Emotional Adjustment**: The foreign exchange student may experience homesickness, especially if they are far from home for the first time. Feelings of loneliness and isolation can impact their overall well-being and adjustment to the new environment. To help ease this transition, host families can encourage the student to maintain contact with family back home through video calls and social media, while also involving them in family activities to create a sense of belonging.",
    "**Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: The exchange student may have specific dietary restrictions or preferences that differ from the host family’s usual meals. This could lead to discomfort or even health issues if not addressed. To avoid this problem, host families should have an open discussion about food preferences and dietary needs upon arrival. Involving the student in meal planning and preparation can also help them feel included and respected.",
    "**Different Educational Expectations**: The foreign exchange student may come from an educational system with different teaching methods, grading systems, or expectations. This discrepancy can lead to confusion or frustration regarding schoolwork and assessments. To bridge this gap, host families should communicate with the student’s teachers and help the student navigate the new academic environment by offering assistance with homework or study habits.",
    "**Integration with Local Peers**: The exchange student may struggle to make friends or integrate with local peers, leading to feelings of isolation. Host families can help by facilitating introductions to other students, encouraging participation in extracurricular activities, or hosting social gatherings. Creating opportunities for the student to engage with their peers can significantly enhance their experience and sense of belonging in the community."
