    "**Insect-Supporting Gardens**: Design gardens that mimic natural ecosystems where beneficial insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps can thrive. These insects prey on pests like aphids, caterpillars, and spider mites. This approach not only reduces pest populations but also enhances biodiversity.",
    "**Biological Pest Control**: Develop and release genetically modified insects that are sterile or have a reduced reproductive capacity. These insects can mate with wild pests, leading to a decline in pest population without harming other species.",
    "**Intelligent Insect Traps**: Create advanced traps using pheromone lures specific to certain pest insects. These traps can be programmed to collect and analyze data about the trapped insects, providing insights into pest populations and migration patterns. This information can help predict and manage pest outbreaks more effectively.",
    "**Bio-Engineering of Insects**: Use CRISPR technology to modify pest insects' genetic traits, making them less harmful or even beneficial. For example, engineers could create pest insects that feed on harmful weeds instead of crops, thus reducing crop damage.",
    "**Enhanced Predator Populations**: Increase the populations of natural predators like birds, spiders, and frogs by providing them with suitable habitats and food sources. This can significantly reduce the number of pests in the ecosystem."
