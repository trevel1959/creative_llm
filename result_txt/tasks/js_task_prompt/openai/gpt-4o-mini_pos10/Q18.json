    "**Universal Basic Resources (UBR)**: Instead of just focusing on income, I would introduce a system of Universal Basic Resources, ensuring that every individual has access to essential needs such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. This would be funded through a global tax on luxury goods and excessive carbon emissions. By prioritizing basic needs, we can eliminate poverty and create a healthier, more equitable society.",
    "**Global Green Cities Initiative**: Launch a project to transform urban areas into sustainable, green cities. This would involve retrofitting existing infrastructure with green technologies, creating urban forests, and promoting the use of public transportation and cycling. Each city would be tasked with achieving carbon neutrality within a specified timeframe, fostering innovation in renewable energy, waste management, and eco-friendly construction practices.",
    "**World Peace Festival**: Organize an annual World Peace Festival, a global event where nations come together to celebrate peace, culture, and cooperation. This festival would include art exhibitions, music performances, and workshops focusing on conflict resolution, empathy, and understanding. By highlighting the importance of peace and collaboration, we can inspire individuals and communities to work towards a more peaceful world.",
    "**Digital Democracy Platform**: Create a global digital platform that allows citizens to participate in decision-making processes. This platform would facilitate discussions on pressing issues, allowing people to vote on initiatives, propose new laws, and hold leaders accountable. By harnessing technology for democratic engagement, we can empower individuals and ensure that their voices are heard in governance.",
    "**Cultural Heritage Exchange Program**: Develop a program that encourages nations to share their cultural heritage through art, music, and cuisine. Countries would be paired to exchange artists, chefs, and performers, promoting appreciation and understanding of diverse cultures. This initiative would not only celebrate global diversity but also strengthen international relationships through shared experiences."
