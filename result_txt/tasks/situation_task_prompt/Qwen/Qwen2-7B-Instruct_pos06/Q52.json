    "**Rice Paper Meal**: You could use rice paper as a base, much like a taco or sushi roll. Fill it with cooked ingredients such as boiled eggs, chicken, tofu, or vegetables. Then, add sauces or dips made from scratch using common household items like soy sauce, vinegar, and honey. The confidence score for this idea is 0.95 because it creatively uses an alternative \"plate\" (rice paper) and focuses on DIY sauces.",
    "**Bento Box Revamp**: Use small, reusable containers that you might already have at home as your 'plates'. Each container can hold different types of food like steamed rice, grilled meat, vegetables, and pickles. You could even make a simple dashi broth in a thermos to pour over the food. The confidence score for this idea is 0.93 as it's practical, uses minimal equipment, and allows for portion control.",
    "**Dried Food Dishes**: Prepare a dish using dehydrated ingredients. Rehydrate dried pasta, beans, fruits, and vegetables by soaking them in hot water or a broth you've made with ingredients like tea bags, spices, and herbs. Add some fresh greens or microgreens for freshness. The confidence score for this idea is 0.87 since dehydration techniques are not widely known but can be explored with a bit of research.",
    "**Water Balloon Cooking**: Fill water balloons with different foods, seal them, and cook them under pressure (in boiling water). This method can be used to cook things like dumplings or even make a makeshift pressure cooker for stews or soups. It's an unconventional method, but it's safe if done properly. The confidence score for this idea is 0.85 as it requires careful handling and safety measures.",
    "**Sous Vide Without Equipment**: The sous vide technique typically requires a vacuum sealer and a temperature-controlled water bath. However, you can achieve similar results without these tools by using a large pot of boiling water and a timer. Seal your food in a plastic bag or a container that can be submerged in the water, then boil it until cooked through. The confidence score for this idea is 0.88 because it maintains precision in cooking times and temperatures, albeit less precisely than traditional sous vide methods."
