    "**Integration with Legacy Systems**: Many multinational companies operate with a mix of modern and legacy systems. A potential issue is the difficulty in integrating a new cybersecurity solution with outdated technology that may not support advanced security protocols. This could create vulnerabilities, as legacy systems may not receive the same level of security updates, leading to potential exploits by cybercriminals.",
    "**Cultural and Language Barriers**: When developing a cybersecurity solution for a diverse workforce, cultural and language differences can pose challenges in user training and awareness programs. Employees may interpret security protocols differently based on their cultural backgrounds, leading to inconsistent application of security practices. Additionally, language barriers may hinder effective communication about security policies, making it harder to foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness.",
    "**Scalability of the Solution**: As the company grows or enters new markets, the cybersecurity solution must be scalable to accommodate increased data and user loads. A potential issue could arise if the solution is not designed with scalability in mind, leading to performance bottlenecks or inadequate protection as the organization expands. This could leave the company vulnerable to attacks during critical growth phases.",
    "**Third-Party Vendor Risks**: Multinational companies often rely on third-party vendors for various services, which can introduce additional cybersecurity risks. A potential problem is ensuring that all third-party vendors adhere to the same cybersecurity standards as the company. If a vendor experiences a data breach, it could compromise the entire organizationâ€™s security posture, highlighting the need for robust vendor management and security assessments.",
    "**Insider Threats**: Employees within the organization can pose a significant cybersecurity risk, either intentionally or unintentionally. Developing a solution that effectively mitigates insider threats can be challenging, as it requires balancing security measures with employee privacy and trust. Failure to address this issue could lead to data leaks or sabotage, undermining the overall effectiveness of the cybersecurity strategy."
