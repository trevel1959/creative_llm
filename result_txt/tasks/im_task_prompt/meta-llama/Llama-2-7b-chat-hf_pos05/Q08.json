    "Smart Fridge: Create a refrigerator that can recognize and adapt to the user's preferences, automatically organizing and categorizing food items based on their expiration dates, nutritional value, and taste. The fridge could also suggest recipes and meal ideas based on the ingredients available, and even order groceries online for delivery.",
    "Temperature-Controlled Food Preservation: Design a refrigerator that can maintain optimal temperature conditions for preserving food, even when the power goes out. This could be achieved through the use of advanced insulation materials, thermoelectric cooling technology, and a backup power source such as a solar panel or battery.",
    "Automated Meal Preparation: Create a refrigerator that can automatically prepare meals based on the user's dietary preferences and schedule.

The fridge could also suggest healthy meal options based on the user's nutritional needs and food allergies.",
    "Virtual Food Storage: Develop a refrigerator that can virtually organize and display food items, allowing users to browse and purchase items without having to physically open the fridge door.
