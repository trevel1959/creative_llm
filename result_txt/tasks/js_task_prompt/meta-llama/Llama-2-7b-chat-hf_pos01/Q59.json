    "Change the law of gravity to allow for faster-than-light travel. Confidence Score: 0.7/1",
    "Wormholes: Another possibility is to create a stable wormhole that could connect two points in space-time, allowing for FTL travel. By manipulating the gravitational forces around a wormhole, we could create a \"shortcut\" through space-time, allowing spacecraft to travel vast distances in a relatively short period.",
    "Exotic matter: If we could create exotic matter with negative mass, we could potentially use it to create a \"warp bubble\" around a spacecraft. This would cause the space in front of the spacecraft to contract, effectively moving the spacecraft at faster-than-light speeds without violating the laws of relativity.",
    "Quantum gravity: Some theories suggest that at the quantum level, gravity is not a fundamental force of nature, but rather an emergent property of the collective behavior of particles. By manipulating the quantum properties of particles, we could potentially create a \"quantum gravity\" effect that would allow for FTL travel.",
    "Energy manipulation: Another approach could be to develop a technology that can manipulate energy at the quantum level. By creating a \"quantum battery\" that can store and release"
