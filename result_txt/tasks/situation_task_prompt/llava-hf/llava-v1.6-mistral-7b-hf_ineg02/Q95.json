    "Use a chair or a couch as a temporary pillow: Sitting up in a chair or on a couch with a backrest can offer support to the head and neck while sleeping. This can be a temporary solution if pillows are unavailable.",
    "Try a body pillow: A long, cylindrical pillow can provide support to the head and neck, mimicking the comfort of a traditional pillow. It can be especially helpful for side sleepers who need extra support to maintain proper spinal alignment.",
    "Use a rolled-up yoga mat or exercise ball: These can provide a firm yet comfortable surface to rest the head on. The yoga mat can be rolled up and secured in place with a band or strap, while the exercise ball can be placed against a wall for added support.",
    "Create a support structure: Using a combination of blankets, towels, and other soft materials, create a makeshift support structure around the head and neck. This can help maintain proper spinal alignment and provide comfort while sleeping.",
    "Invest in a pillow alternative: There are many alternatives to traditional pillows available on the market, such as ergonomic neck rolls, contoured pillows, or even inflatable pillows. These can be an excellent long-term solution for those who prefer not to use traditional pillows."
