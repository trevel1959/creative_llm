    "Wear a baseball cap: One of the simplest ways to protect your head from sunburn when you have lost all your hair is to wear a baseball cap. This will provide a barrier between your scalp and the sun's harmful rays, preventing sunburn. You can choose a cap made of lightweight, breathable material like cotton or mesh to keep you cool and comfortable.",
    "Use a sun umbrella: Another option is to use a sun umbrella to protect your head from the sun. These umbrellas are specifically designed to provide shade for your face and neck, and can be easily carried with you wherever you go. They come in various sizes and styles, so you can choose one that suits your needs and preferences.",
    "Apply sunscreen on your scalp: If you don't want to wear a hat or umbrella, you can apply sunscreen directly on your scalp to protect it from sunburn. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF to ensure maximum protection. You can also reapply it as needed throughout the day to keep your scalp protected.",
    "Wear a scarf or bandana: A scarf or bandana can be a stylish and effective way to protect your head from sunburn. You can tie it around your head or neck, providing coverage and protection from the sun. Look for one made of lightweight, breathable material like cotton or silk to keep you cool and comfortable.",
    "Try a sun-protective hat: If you want a more stylish and functional solution, consider a sun-protective hat. These hats are designed specifically to provide protection from the sun while still looking great. They often have a wide brim to shade your face and neck, and may be made of lightweight, breathable materials like cotton or straw. Look for one with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating to ensure maximum protection."
