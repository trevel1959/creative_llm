    "**Unpredictable Tides**: With two moons, the gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans would be stronger and more unpredictable. This would lead to chaotic and extreme tidal patterns, making coastal living and marine ecosystems even more challenging. The constant flux in water levels would also disrupt shipping lanes, fishing industries, and coastal infrastructure. (Confidence: 0.8)",
    "**Disrupted Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions**: The presence of a second moon would alter the Earth's rotation and axis, potentially leading to more frequent and intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The changed gravitational forces could trigger more seismic activity, causing widespread destruction and altering global geological patterns. (Confidence: 0.7)",
    "**Effects on Plant Life and Agriculture**: Two moons would introduce an additional lunar cycle, influencing plant growth, photosynthesis, and agricultural patterns. This could lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and altered seasonal patterns. Some plant species might adapt and thrive, while others could become extinct. (Confidence: 0.9)",
    "**Increased Meteoroid Impacts**: With a second moon, the Earth's gravitational field would be more complex, potentially attracting more meteoroids and asteroids. This could lead to a higher frequency of meteor showers, impacting events, and even asteroid collisions, posing a threat to human settlements and global ecosystems. (Confidence: 0.6)",
    "**Atmospheric and Climate Changes**: The additional moon would alter the Earth's rotation, leading to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, temperature gradients, and precipitation patterns. This could result in extreme climate fluctuations, affecting global weather patterns, and potentially leading to the formation of new climate zones or the disappearance of existing ones. (Confidence: 0.8)"
