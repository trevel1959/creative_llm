    "**Logistical Challenges**: Coordinating travel, accommodations, and transportation for a large number of international delegates can be complex. To streamline this process, the organizing committee could develop a centralized travel management system that allows delegates to book flights and accommodations through a single platform. This system would include features like real-time updates on travel restrictions, visa requirements, and personalized itineraries, ensuring that all participants have the necessary information and support for smooth travel.",
    "**Security Concerns**: Given the high-profile nature of a peace summit, there may be threats to the safety of delegates. Organizers should collaborate with local law enforcement and international security agencies to create a comprehensive security plan. This plan could involve pre-event threat assessments, on-site security personnel, and emergency response protocols. Additionally, implementing advanced technology, such as facial recognition and drone surveillance, could enhance security measures while ensuring a safe environment for discussions.",
    "**Diverse Agenda Priorities**: Different nations may have conflicting priorities and agendas, making it challenging to create a unified discussion framework. To address this, organizers could facilitate pre-summit consultations with key stakeholders to gather input on agenda items. This could involve online surveys or roundtable discussions to identify common ground and prioritize topics that resonate with a majority of participants. By establishing a collaborative agenda that reflects shared interests, the summit can foster more productive dialogue.",
    "**Language Barriers**: Communication can be hindered by language differences, potentially leading to misinterpretations of key messages. To overcome this issue, organizers could employ a team of professional interpreters fluent in multiple languages, ensuring that all participants can communicate effectively. Additionally, providing translation services for all written materials, including speeches and documents, would help create an inclusive atmosphere where everyone feels heard and understood.",
    "**Sustainability Concerns**: Hosting an international event often leads to significant environmental impacts, such as waste generation and carbon emissions. Organizers could prioritize sustainability by implementing eco-friendly practices, such as using digital materials instead of printed documents, sourcing local and organic catering options, and encouraging participants to use public transportation or carpooling. Furthermore, the summit could include discussions on global sustainability initiatives, reinforcing the importance of environmental stewardship in the context of peacebuilding."
