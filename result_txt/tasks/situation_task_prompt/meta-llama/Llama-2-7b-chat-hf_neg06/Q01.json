    "Carrier Pigeons: Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries as a reliable means of communication, particularly during times of war or when other forms of communication were unreliable. In the event of an electronic communication blackout, carrier pigeons could be trained to carry messages between countries. Each country could have a network of pigeon stations where the pigeons could be sent and received, ensuring that messages are delivered safely and efficiently.",
    "Semaphore Flags: Semaphore flags are a visual communication system that uses a series of flags to convey messages. This system has been used for centuries, particularly in coastal areas where visual communication was the only means of communication. In the event of an electronic communication blackout, semaphore flags could be used to send messages between countries. Each flag would represent a specific letter or symbol, and messages could be constructed by using a series of flags to form words and sentences.",
    "Homing Pigeons: Homing pigeons are trained to find their way back to their home location, even when released far away. In the event of an electronic communication blackout, homing pigeons could be used to send messages between countries. Each country could have a network of homing pigeon stations where the pigeons could be sent and received, ensuring that messages are delivered safely and efficiently.",
    "Optical Signals: Optical signals, such as laser beams or flashing lights, could be used to send messages between countries. This method would require a direct line of sight between the sender and receiver, but it could be a reliable means of communication in the event of an electronic blackout. Each country could have a network of optical signal stations where the signals could be sent and received, ensuring that messages are delivered safely and efficiently.",
    "Cryptography: Cryptography is the practice of secure communication by encoding messages so that only the intended recipient can read them. In the event of an electronic communication blackout, cryptography could be used to send messages between countries. Each country could have a network of cryptography stations where messages could be encoded and decoded, ensuring that messages are delivered safely and efficiently."
