    "**Plant Watering Aid**: Instead of using a traditional watering can, a hairbrush can be transformed into a makeshift watering tool for delicate plants. By dipping the brush into water and gently tapping it over the soil, the bristles can help distribute water evenly without disturbing the roots or splashing soil everywhere.",
    "**Scent Diffuser**: A hairbrush can be used as a DIY scent diffuser. By applying a few drops of essential oils to the bristles, the brush can be placed in a small space, such as a drawer or closet, to impart a pleasant fragrance. The bristles will slowly release the scent over time, creating a fresh environment.",
    "**Pet Grooming Tool**: While primarily designed for human hair, a hairbrush can also serve as a grooming tool for pets, especially for small animals like rabbits or guinea pigs. The soft bristles can help remove loose fur and debris, making it a gentle and effective way to keep pets clean and comfortable.",
    "**Crafting Tool for Creating Hair Accessories**: Hairbrushes can be used in crafting unique hair accessories. For example, by wrapping colorful yarn or ribbon around the bristles and then cutting the ends, you can create a bunch of vibrant pom-poms or tassels that can be used as hair clips or decorations.",
    "**Musical Instrument**: The hairbrush can be turned into a percussion instrument by tapping it against various surfaces. By varying the speed and intensity of the taps, you can create different rhythms and sounds. It can be a fun addition to jam sessions or impromptu musical performances."
