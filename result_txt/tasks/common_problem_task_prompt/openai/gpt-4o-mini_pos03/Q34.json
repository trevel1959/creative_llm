    "**Software Bugs and Glitches**: The complexity of programming a robot can lead to unexpected software bugs or glitches that affect its performance. These issues might cause the robot to misinterpret data or malfunction during tasks. To mitigate this, developers could implement a robust testing phase, utilizing simulation environments to identify and resolve bugs before deploying the robot in real-world scenarios.",
    "**Sensor Limitations**: Robots often rely on sensors for navigation and interaction with their environment. However, sensor limitations can result in poor performance. For instance, if the robot uses infrared sensors, it may struggle in bright light conditions. A solution could involve a multi-sensor fusion approach, combining various types of sensors (like ultrasonic, LiDAR, and cameras) to improve the robot's perception of its surroundings.",
    "**Physical Design Flaws**: The physical design of the robot may not be suitable for its intended tasks, leading to operational inefficiencies or even failures. For example, a robot designed for rough terrain might have a weak chassis that can easily break. A potential solution is to conduct thorough prototyping and testing, utilizing advanced materials and designs to ensure durability and adaptability to different environments.",
    "**User Interaction and Interface Challenges**: If the robot is intended for user interaction, a poorly designed interface can lead to user frustration and decreased usability. For instance, if the controls are too complex, users may struggle to operate the robot effectively. To address this, developers should focus on user-centered design principles, creating intuitive interfaces and providing clear instructions and feedback mechanisms.",
    "**Ethical and Safety Concerns**: As robots become more autonomous, ethical and safety concerns arise regarding their decision-making capabilities, especially in critical situations. For instance, if a robot must choose between two harmful outcomes, how it makes that decision can raise moral questions. To tackle this, developers could establish ethical guidelines for robot behavior and incorporate fail-safes that prioritize human safety in all scenarios."
