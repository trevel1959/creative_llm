    "Memory Mining: In a world without books, people could tap into their collective memories to gain knowledge. This could involve techniques like memory mapping, where individuals share and categorize their personal experiences and memories to create a collective database.",
    "Oral Storytelling: The art of storytelling could be revived, with people sharing their experiences, traditions, and wisdom through oral narratives. This would not only preserve knowledge but also foster community and cultural exchange.",
    "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Advances in neuroscience and technology could lead to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that allow people to access information directly from their brains. By decoding neural signals, BCIs could unlock a person's mental knowledge and experiences.",
    "Telepathy: With the help of advanced technologies like brain-computer interfaces or neurostimulation, people could develop the ability to communicate telepathically, sharing knowledge and ideas directly from one mind to another.",
    "Cosmic Navigation: If books are unavailable, people could turn to the stars for knowledge. By studying the movements and patterns of celestial bodies, ancient cultures had developed complex astronomical systems that could be used to predict weather, seasons, and even future events. This knowledge could be rediscovered and expanded upon in a post-book world."
