    "Incorporate a built-in water filter: Watering cans can be used to spray water from contaminated sources. Therefore, to improve the watering can, a built-in water filter could be added. This would ensure that water sprayed from the watering can is clean and safe for plants to consume.",
    "Develop a self-watering feature: One way to improve the watering can is to design it with a self-watering feature. This watering can would be equipped with a small reservoir that can be filled with water and would release water as needed, eliminating the need to pour water from a pitcher.",
    "Add a spill-proof lid: Watering cans can be frustrating to use because water tends to spill out. To solve this problem, a new design could be created that includes a spill-proof lid. This lid would have a mechanism that closes automatically when the watering can is not in use, preventing water from spilling out.",
    "Incorporate a plant attachment: Instead of a traditional reservoir of water, a watering can could be designed with a plant attachment. This attachment would have small plants that can pull water from the air, allowing the watering can to be used as an air-based irrigation system.",
    "Create a water-conserving feature: Watering cans typically use a large amount of water for each application. To improve this, a water-conserving feature could be added, such as a timer that limits the amount of water sprayed per use. This feature would help cut down on water usage and make the watering can more sustainable."
