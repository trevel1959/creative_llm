    "**Built-in Mosquito Netting**:    Design a sleeping bag with an integrated, retractable mosquito net that can be deployed easily when needed. This would be particularly useful for camping in areas with high insect activity. The netting could be stored in a pocket at the head of the bag and unfurled using a simple pull mechanism, providing a bug-free sleeping environment without the hassle of carrying a separate net.",
    "**Convertible Sleeping Bag**:    Create a sleeping bag that can be transformed into a portable hammock or a blanket. Using a series of zippers and snaps, the bag can be opened up and reconfigured for various uses. This multifunctionality would appeal to backpackers and campers who value versatility and lightweight gear, allowing them to adapt to different sleeping situations without carrying extra equipment.",
    "**Self-Inflating Base Layer**:    Incorporate a self-inflating layer at the bottom of the sleeping bag that uses a built-in air pump. This layer would provide additional cushioning and insulation, ensuring a comfortable sleep on hard ground. The pump could be activated with a simple button, making it easy to inflate or deflate as needed, and the added layer would help keep the user warmer by creating an air barrier.",
    "**Integrated Lighting System**:    Equip the sleeping bag with LED lights along the zipper or inside the bag, powered by a rechargeable battery. This would allow users to find items in the dark or read a book without needing a separate flashlight. The lights could be dimmable and have various color settings to suit different moods or situations, enhancing the overall camping experience.",
    "**Personalized Comfort Zones**:    Develop a sleeping bag with adjustable sections that allow users to customize the level of padding and insulation in different areas. For instance, some may prefer more cushioning under their head and less under their feet. Using removable inserts or adjustable baffles, users can modify their sleeping bag to fit their personal comfort preferences, making it ideal for diverse body types and sleeping positions."
