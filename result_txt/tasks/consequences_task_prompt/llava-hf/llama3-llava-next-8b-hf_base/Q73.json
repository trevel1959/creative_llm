    "Food chain disruption: The extinction of animals that are at the top of their food chains could have a ripple effect on predators lower in the food chain. The absence of these animals would leave food gaps and could potentially destabilize the entire predator-prey balance in an ecosystem.",
    "Human economy: Humans have both directly and indirectly rely on animals for various resources, such as food from hunting and farming, and for medicine and recreation. The sudden loss of many species due to extinction could cause economic disruptions and trade imbalances.",
    "Ecosystem services: Plants and animals work in delicate interdependence to perform various ecosystem services, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, and pest control. Large-scale animal extinctions could lead to breakdown in these services.",
    "Genetic diversity: The removal of a large number of animal species could lead to the loss of genetic diversity. This would affect the resilience and adaptability of other species, making them more vulnerable to disease, environmental change, and other threats.",
    "Cultural loss: Many traditional practices and customs are tied to the protection and management of animals as part of ceremonies, rituals, and cultural practices. These cultural practices may be at risk of disappearing due to animal extinctions, which could cause cultural degradation and loss."
