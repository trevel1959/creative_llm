    "The Law of Gravity: Every object in the universe will be attracted to each other with a force proportional to their mass, but with a unique twist - the strength of the gravitational pull will decrease as the distance between objects increases. This would create a universe where objects are drawn together but also have a lot of space to move around, leading to unique planetary formations and celestial phenomena. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "The Law of Time Dilation: Time will pass at different rates in different parts of the universe. For example, near a massive object like a star or black hole, time will slow down, while in open space, time will speed up. This would create a universe where different regions have different ages, and the passage of time would be unpredictable and dynamic. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Law of Phase Transitions: Every object in the universe will have the ability to change between different states of matter, such as solid, liquid, and gas, based on external conditions. For example, a planet could transform from a solid to a gas if it reaches a certain temperature, or a star could change from a solid to a liquid if it reaches a certain pressure. This would create a universe where the state of matter is constantly changing, leading to unique and dynamic celestial phenomena. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "The Law of Energy Conservation: Energy will be conserved in the universe, but with a twist - any energy that is created will have a unique property that it can only be used for a specific purpose. For example, a black hole could be created by gathering energy from a star and using it to create a singularity, but the energy could only be used to power a specific type of technology. This would create a universe where energy is precious and has to be used wisely, leading to unique technological advancements. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "The Law of Quantum Entanglement: Every object in the universe will be connected to every other object through a quantum entanglement, which means that the state of one object will be instantly affected by the state of another object, no matter how far apart they are. This would create a universe where the behavior of one object is instantly affected by the behavior of another, leading to unique and complex interactions between objects. Confidence Score: "
