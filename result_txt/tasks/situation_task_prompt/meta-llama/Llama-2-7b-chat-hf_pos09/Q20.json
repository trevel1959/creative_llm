    "Hovercrafts: With the absence of planes, hovercrafts could become the primary mode of transportation for intercontinental travel. Hovercrafts are air-cushioned vehicles that use fans to create lift and propulsion, allowing them to travel over land and water with minimal friction. They could be powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells, making them a more sustainable option than traditional gas-guzzling vehicles.",
    "Space Tourism: In a world without planes, space tourism could become the next big thing. With private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin leading the charge in space travel, it's only a matter of time before commercial spaceflight becomes a reality. Imagine traveling to the moon or even Mars in a luxury spacecraft, experiencing weightlessness, and gazing at the Earth from a distance.",
    "Submarines: Submarines could become the new mode of transportation for long-distance travel. With advanced technology, submarines could travel through the ocean at incredible speeds, reaching destinations across the globe in a matter of days. They could be powered by nuclear reactors or even advanced solar panels, making them a sustainable and efficient option.",
    "Maglev Trains: Maglev trains, which use magnetic levitation to float above the tracks, could become the preferred mode of transportation for intercontinental travel. These trains could travel at incredible speeds, reaching destinations in a fraction of the time it would take by air or sea. They could be powered by electricity or even nuclear reactors, making them a sustainable and efficient option.",
    "Tunnel Networks: In a world without planes, tunnel networks could become the new norm for intercontinental travel. Advanced tunnel boring machines could create a network of tunnels connecting continents, allowing for fast and efficient travel. These tunnels could be powered by electricity or even nuclear reactors, making them a sustainable and efficient option."
