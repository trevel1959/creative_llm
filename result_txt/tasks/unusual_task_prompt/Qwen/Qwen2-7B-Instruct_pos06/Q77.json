    "**Innovative Educational Tool**: Create a hands-on magnet learning station for schools or homeschooling environments. The station could include various magnetic materials like metal letters, numbers, geometric shapes, and magnets of different strengths. Children can use these elements to create words, solve math problems, or build magnetic circuits. Confidence Score: 0.9 - This idea is innovative, educational, and directly utilizes the concept of magnets in an engaging way.",
    "**Smart Magnetic Wall System**: Develop a smart wall system where users can install their personal items (like keys, notes, reminders) using magnets. The system can have built-in sensors that allow the user to track the location of items through an app on their smartphone. Confidence Score: 0.85 - While it might not be a groundbreaking invention, this application offers convenience and utility, making it likely to appeal to tech-savvy consumers.",
    "**Portable Magnetic Speaker**: Design a compact speaker that uses magnetic fields to enhance audio quality. This speaker could be particularly useful in outdoor settings where traditional speakers might not perform well due to wind interference. Confidence Score: 0.8 - This idea combines two technologies—audio and magnets—in a novel way, which could attract tech enthusiasts.",
    "**Magnetic Fitness Equipment**: Introduce a new line of fitness equipment that utilizes magnetic resistance. For example, a magnetic rowing machine or a magnetic weight system that adjusts its resistance based on the strength of the magnetic field. Confidence Score: 0.75 - This could appeal to fitness enthusiasts looking for innovative workout solutions, although competition in the fitness industry is high.",
    "**Interactive Magnetic Art Panels**: Create interactive art panels that respond to magnetic inputs from pens or brushes. Artists could use these panels to create digital paintings that are then saved as physical prints or shared digitally. Confidence Score: 0.7 - This idea combines creativity with technology, offering a unique experience for artists and art lovers alike."
