    "DIY Dental Care: With no more dentists, people could take matters into their own hands and learn how to properly clean and maintain their teeth. This could involve creating homemade toothpaste and floss, and practicing good oral hygiene habits like brushing and flossing regularly.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: Neighborhoods could come together to form dental co-ops, where members share the cost of dental care and equipment. This would allow people to receive professional dental care without relying on individual dentists.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: Non-profit organizations could set up mobile dental clinics that travel to different communities, providing free or low-cost dental care to those in need. These clinics could be staffed by volunteer dentists and hygienists.",
    "Online Dental Consultations: With the rise of telemedicine, it's possible to conduct dental consultations remotely through video conferencing. Patients could consult with dentists via phone or computer, and receive recommendations for at-home care and treatment.",
    "DIY Dental Implants: For those who have lost teeth due to injury or decay, DIY dental implants could be a viable option. Using 3D printing technology, patients could create custom dental implants that are tailored to their specific needs. These implants could be made from biocompatible materials and attached to the jawbone using a special adhesive."
