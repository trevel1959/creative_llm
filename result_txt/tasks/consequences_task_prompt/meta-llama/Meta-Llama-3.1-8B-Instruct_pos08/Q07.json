    "**Global Economic Collapse**: The internet is the backbone of modern commerce, and its sudden disappearance would lead to a global economic collapse. Businesses would struggle to function without online transactions, supply chains would be severely disrupted, and trade would come to a grinding halt. This would result in widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest.",
    "**Loss of Access to Critical Information**: The internet is the primary source of information for many people. Without it, access to critical information, such as news, research, and educational resources, would be severely limited. This would hinder scientific progress, stifle innovation, and make it difficult for people to make informed decisions.",
    "**Disruption of Critical Infrastructure**: The internet is used to control and monitor critical infrastructure, such as power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare services. Without it, these systems would be vulnerable to failures, leading to power outages, transportation disruptions, and healthcare crises.",
    "**Social Isolation and Mental Health Issues**: The internet is a primary means of communication for many people. Without it, social connections would be severely disrupted, leading to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression. Mental health issues would skyrocket, and social services would be overwhelmed.",
    "**Return to Pre-Internet Era**: The internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact. Without it, we would be forced to return to a pre-internet era, where communication was slower, information was harder to access, and commerce was more laborious. This would be a significant setback for humanity, and it would take years, if not decades, to recover."
