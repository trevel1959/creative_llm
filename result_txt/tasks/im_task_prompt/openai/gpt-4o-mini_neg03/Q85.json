    "**Modular Bread Box Design**: Create a modular bread box with interchangeable compartments that allow users to store different types of bread (loaves, rolls, baguettes) separately. Each compartment could have adjustable ventilation to cater to the specific needs of the bread type, preserving freshness and texture while also preventing odors from mixing.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Bread Box**: Develop a bread box that incorporates UV-C light technology to sanitize the interior surfaces automatically at set intervals. This feature would help eliminate bacteria and mold, ensuring that the bread stays fresher for longer while also maintaining a hygienic storage environment.",
    "**Bread Box with a Built-in Slicer**: Design a bread box that includes a built-in, retractable slicer. Users could simply pull a lever or press a button to reveal a slicing mechanism that neatly cuts the bread into even slices. This feature would make it easier to serve fresh bread while reducing the risk of crumbs and mess.",
    "**Bread Box with Humidity Control**: Create a bread box that features adjustable humidity settings. Users could select the desired humidity level depending on the type of bread stored. For instance, crusty breads might benefit from a drier environment, while softer breads may need more moisture. This would help maintain the ideal texture and prevent staleness.",
    "**Personalized Bread Box with Recipe Book**: Develop a customizable bread box that comes with a built-in recipe book and a small digital screen. Users could input their favorite bread recipes or select from a library of options, and the box could provide step-by-step baking instructions. It could also include a storage compartment for baking tools like measuring cups and spoons."
