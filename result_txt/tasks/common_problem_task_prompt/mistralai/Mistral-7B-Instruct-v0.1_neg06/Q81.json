    "\"Why don't you try a new approach to organizing the film festival? Perhaps collaborate with a local film school or production company to showcase student and alumni work alongside established filmmakers.\"",
    "\"Consider hosting the festival in a unique location, such as an abandoned movie theater or a rooftop, to add an extra element of excitement and intrigue for attendees.\"",
    "\"Why not host a virtual film festival, where attendees can watch films from the comfort of their own homes and participate in virtual Q&A sessions with filmmakers?\"",
    "\"Incorporate interactive elements into the festival, such as workshops, panel discussions, and networking opportunities, to create a more engaging and immersive experience for attendees.\"",
    "\"Why not partner with a local restaurant or food truck to offer a unique culinary experience for attendees, such as a film-themed menu or a food truck serving dishes inspired by the films being shown.\""
