    "**Natureâ€™s Embrace**: Inspired by the great outdoors, this concept involves using natural materials like dried lavender, buckwheat hulls, or even soft moss to create a headrest. Users could create their own custom headrest by filling a breathable pouch with these materials, which would not only provide comfort but also offer aromatherapy benefits. The gentle scent of lavender would promote relaxation, while the buckwheat hulls would provide a supportive, contouring effect that cradles the head.",
    "**Neck-Supporting Hammocks**: This innovative design would feature a hammock-like structure suspended from the bed frame or ceiling, designed specifically for head and neck support. Made from a stretchy, breathable fabric, the hammock would cradle the head while allowing for a gentle rocking motion that mimics being rocked to sleep. The hammock would be adjustable in height and tension, enabling users to find their perfect sleeping position, while also reducing pressure points and promoting spinal alignment.",
    "**Memory Foam Rollers**: Instead of traditional pillows, users could opt for a series of memory foam rollers that can be arranged in various configurations to support the head, neck, and spine. These rollers would come in different sizes and densities, allowing individuals to create a personalized sleep setup that adapts to their sleeping position. They could be used under the neck for back sleepers, between the knees for side sleepers, or even as a gentle incline for those who prefer a slight elevation.",
    "**Soundwave Sleep Pods**: This futuristic concept involves a small, portable device that emits sound waves to create a soothing environment for sleep. Users would rest their heads on a specially designed surface that vibrates gently in response to the sound waves, providing a comforting sensation while promoting relaxation. The device would have customizable settings, allowing users to choose from various soundscapes, such as ocean waves or gentle rain, while the vibrations help ease tension and lull them into a deep sleep.",
    "**Body-Contouring Sleep Mats**: Instead of pillows, these sleep mats would be designed to contour to the body's shape, providing support without the need for a traditional pillow. Made from a combination of high-density foam and softer layers, the mat would cradle the head and neck while distributing weight evenly. Users could also choose from different firmness levels and even add a cooling gel layer for enhanced comfort. The mat would be portable, making it easy to use at home or while traveling."
