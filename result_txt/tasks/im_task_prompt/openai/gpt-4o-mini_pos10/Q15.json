    "**Adjustable Ergonomic Support System**:    - Design a backpack with an adjustable ergonomic support system that can be tailored to the userâ€™s body shape and size. This system would include adjustable lumbar support, shoulder straps with customizable padding, and a hip belt that redistributes weight effectively. This feature would help reduce strain on the back and shoulders, making it more comfortable for long periods of wear.",
    "**Integrated Anti-Theft Technology**:    - Equip the backpack with anti-theft features such as lockable zippers, cut-resistant straps, and a built-in GPS tracker. Users could connect the GPS to their smartphones, allowing them to track their backpack's location in real-time. Additionally, the backpack could have a fingerprint lock system to ensure that only the owner can access its contents.",
    "**Modular Storage System**:    - Create a modular backpack design that allows users to customize the internal compartments based on their needs. This could include detachable pouches for electronics, clothing, or snacks, which can be rearranged or removed entirely. Users could easily switch between configurations for different activities, such as school, work, or travel.",
    "**Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Materials**:    - Use innovative materials made from recycled plastics or biodegradable fabrics to construct the backpack. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability. Additionally, the backpack could feature a built-in water filtration system, allowing users to fill it with water from natural sources and have access to clean drinking water on outdoor adventures.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**:    - Develop a backpack that integrates AR technology through a companion app. Users could point their smartphone at the backpack to access features such as an interactive map, tutorials for packing efficiently, or information about nearby landmarks while traveling. This would enhance the user experience and provide practical assistance during adventures."
