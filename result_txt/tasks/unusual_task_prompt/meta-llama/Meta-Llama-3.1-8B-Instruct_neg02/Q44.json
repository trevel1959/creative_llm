    "**Smart Ice Cube Tray with Temperature Control**: Design an ice cube tray that can be controlled remotely through a mobile app, allowing users to set the desired temperature and ice density. The tray would use thermoelectric cooling to freeze the water at the optimal temperature, ensuring that the ice cubes are crystal clear and perfect for mixing cocktails or cooling beverages. The app would also track the tray's usage, providing insights on energy consumption and suggesting the best ice cube settings for specific drinks.",
    "**Edible Ice Cube Tray with Flavor Infusion**: Create an ice cube tray that can infuse flavors into the water as it freezes, eliminating the need for ice cube molds or flavorings. The tray would feature a patented technology that releases flavor particles into the water as it freezes, creating unique and refreshing flavor combinations. Users could choose from a variety of pre-programmed flavors or create their own custom blends using the accompanying app.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Ice Cube Tray with UV Technology**: Develop an ice cube tray that uses UV light to sanitize and clean itself after each use. The tray would feature a built-in UV light that kills bacteria and other microorganisms, ensuring that the ice cubes are not only clean but also free from contaminants. This feature would be especially useful for people with weakened immune systems or those who prioritize food safety.",
    "**Smart Ice Cube Tray with Integrated Measuring Cup**: Design an ice cube tray that doubles as a measuring cup, making it easy to measure and mix ingredients for cocktails or other recipes. The tray would feature a built-in scale and a digital display that shows the exact amount of liquid being measured. This feature would be a game-changer for bartenders and home mixologists who need to precision-measure ingredients.",
    "**Ice Cube Tray with Integrated LED Lighting**: Create an ice cube tray that features a built-in LED light strip that changes color and pattern to match the occasion or mood. The tray would be equipped with a sensor that detects the surrounding environment and adjusts the lighting accordingly, creating a unique and immersive experience. This feature would be perfect for parties, special events, or even just a fun way to add some ambiance to a home bar. [/INST] Assistant: I hope these ideas meet your expectations!
