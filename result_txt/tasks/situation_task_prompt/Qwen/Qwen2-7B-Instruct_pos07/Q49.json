    "**Water Filtration System as a Fire Suppression Tool**: Install a large water filtration system in your home that can be activated when smoke detectors are triggered. This system could release filtered water directly onto potential fire sources, like electrical outlets or cooking appliances. The filtered water prevents the spread of harmful contaminants while still extinguishing fires effectively.",
    "**Smart Home Fireproofing**: Utilize advanced technology to create a smart home that automatically responds to the presence of fire. This involves installing sensors throughout the house that detect high temperatures, smoke, and unusual sounds (like cracking or popping noises). When a fire is detected, these sensors trigger an automated response, such as shutting off electrical power, opening windows, and activating a gas mask distribution system for occupants. Additionally, a drone could be deployed from a secure location to survey the situation and assist firefighters.",
    "**DIY Fire Extinguisher Kits**: Develop a set of DIY fire extinguisher kits using common household items like baking soda, salt, and sand. These substances can be effective at smothering small fires and can be easily stored in strategic locations around the house. For larger fires, teach yourself and family members basic techniques for using wet towels or blankets to smother flames until professional help arrives.",
    "**Biodegradable Fire Retardant Coatings**: Create a non-toxic, biodegradable coating that can be applied to furniture, curtains, and other flammable materials. This coating would act as a barrier against fire, reducing the risk of combustion. It could be made from natural ingredients like clay, borax, and coconut oil, which are both effective at preventing fire spread and safe for use in homes.",
    "**Emergency Escape Ladder and Water-based Fireproofing**: Install an emergency escape ladder on a second-story window for quick exit during a fire. In addition, apply a water-based fireproofing solution to wooden structures like stairs, railings, and door frames. This solution, when exposed to heat, turns into a gel-like substance that thickens and forms a protective layer, making it more difficult for fire to spread through the structure. This would provide time for everyone to evacuate safely."
