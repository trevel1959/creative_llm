    "\"Revolutionary Mailbox\": Create a smart mailbox that uses AI to sort and prioritize mail based on the recipient's preferences. The mailbox could use facial recognition technology to identify the sender and categorize the mail accordingly. For example, important bills and packages could be automatically sorted into a \"High Priority\" folder, while junk mail and promotional materials could be sorted into a \"Junk Mail\" folder.",
    "\"Mailbox with a Twist\": Design a mailbox that doubles as a miniature garden. The mailbox could have a built-in planter that allows users to grow small plants or herbs, such as basil or rosemary. The mailbox could also have a built-in irrigation system, ensuring that the plants receive the right amount of water. This unique mailbox would not only provide a creative solution to the traditional mailbox, but it would also allow users to enjoy a bit of nature in their daily lives.",
    "\"Mailbox with a Purpose\": Create a mailbox that also serves as a community bulletin board. The mailbox could have a large, blank surface area where neighbors could post notes, flyers, or other messages for each other. This would provide a convenient and accessible way for neighbors to communicate and stay informed about local events or issues.",
    "\"Mailbox for the Modern Age\": Design a mailbox that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the mail-opening experience. The mailbox could use AR to display additional information about the contents of the mail, such as the sender, the date, or any relevant promotions or discounts. This would make the mail-opening experience more engaging and interactive, and could potentially reduce the amount of time spent sorting through junk mail.",
    "\"Mailbox with a Sustainable Twist\": Create a mailbox made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic or bamboo. The mailbox could also have a built-in compost bin, allowing users to compost any biodegradable materials from their mail, such as packaging or junk mail. This would provide a creative solution to the problem of wasteful mail and would promote sustainability in the daily lives of users."
