    "Develop a system to purify water from non-potable sources: One possible solution could be to develop a system that can purify water from non-potable sources such as wastewater, seawater, or even rainwater. This could involve using advanced filtration and purification techniques to remove contaminants and bacteria, making the water safe for consumption.",
    "Implement rainwater harvesting systems: Another solution could be to implement rainwater harvesting systems in areas where water is scarce. This involves collecting and storing rainwater in tanks or cisterns, which can then be used for non-potable purposes such as irrigation or cleaning. By treating the water with purification techniques, it can also be made safe for drinking.",
    "Develop new water sources: Another solution could be to explore new sources of water, such as deep wells or underground aquifers. These sources may not be polluted and can provide a reliable source of clean drinking water.",
    "Implement desalination plants: Desalination plants can be used to remove salt and other minerals from seawater, making it safe for consumption. This technology is becoming more advanced and cost-effective, making it a viable solution for obtaining clean drinking water from non-potable sources.",
    "Promote water conservation: Finally, promoting water conservation efforts can help to reduce the demand for water, making it easier to obtain clean drinking water from existing sources. This can involve implementing water-saving technologies, such as low-flow toilets and showerheads, as well as educating people on the importance of water conservation and how to reduce their water usage."
