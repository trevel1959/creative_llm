    "**Smart Sound Adjustment**:    Integrate an AI-driven sound adjustment feature that analyzes the surrounding environment and automatically tunes the speaker’s sound output. For instance, if the speaker is placed in a small, enclosed space, it could adjust to provide clearer vocals, while in a larger, open area, it could boost bass and overall volume. This would ensure optimal sound quality regardless of the setting, making the speaker versatile for any occasion.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Charging Options**:    Introduce solar charging capabilities into the Bluetooth speaker. A built-in solar panel could allow users to charge the speaker outdoors during the day, making it perfect for camping trips or beach outings. Additionally, incorporating kinetic energy technology that charges the speaker while it’s being moved could appeal to eco-conscious consumers and provide a sustainable energy source.",
    "**Integrated Smart Home Hub**:    Transform the Bluetooth speaker into a central smart home hub. With built-in compatibility for various smart home devices, users could control their lights, thermostat, and security system directly from the speaker. This feature would streamline home automation and enhance the speaker’s functionality beyond just audio playback, making it a multifunctional device in any household.",
    "**Interactive Visual Display**:    Add a small interactive touchscreen display on the speaker that can show album art, notifications, or even visualizations that sync with the music being played. Users could navigate through playlists, see incoming calls, or adjust settings directly from the screen. This would enhance the user experience by providing a visual component that complements the audio.",
    "**Portable Water Purifier**:    Design a Bluetooth speaker that also functions as a portable water purifier. Utilizing UV-C light technology, the speaker could purify water while simultaneously playing music. This feature would be particularly appealing for outdoor enthusiasts, allowing them to enjoy their favorite tunes while ensuring they have access to clean drinking water during hikes or camping trips."
