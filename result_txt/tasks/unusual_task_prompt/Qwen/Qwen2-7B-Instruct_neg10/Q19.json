    "**Candle-based Plant Growing Medium**: Use candle wax as a medium to grow plants in. Melt down old candles and pour them into molds designed for plant growth. Add soil, nutrients, and seeds inside the mold before allowing the wax to harden. This would create a unique and visually interesting way to grow plants, potentially using only recycled materials.",
    "**Personalized Scented Candles**: Offer a service where customers can customize their own scented candles. Allow them to choose from a wide range of essential oils or fragrances, and blend them in specific ratios to create unique scents. Customers could name their candles and even design custom labels or packaging.",
    "**Emergency Candles with Built-in Whistle**: Create candles with a built-in whistle mechanism inside the wax. When the candle is burned down, the wax reaches a certain point, triggering the whistle to sound. This could serve as an emergency alert system, useful during power outages or other situations where loud alarms might not be heard.",
    "**Scented Candles for Different Moods**: Develop a series of scented candles designed to evoke specific emotions or moods. For example, lavender for relaxation, peppermint for focus, and vanilla for comfort. Include tips on how to pair scents with activities or environments to enhance the mood they aim to create.",
    "**Interactive Storytelling Candles**: Incorporate QR codes or RFID tags into the wick of the candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts away from the wick, revealing the code. Scanning the code with a smartphone would unlock a digital story, game, or activity related to the candle's scent or theme."
