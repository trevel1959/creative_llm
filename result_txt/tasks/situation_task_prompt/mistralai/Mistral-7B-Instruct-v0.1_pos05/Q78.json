    "If all toys disappeared, children would have to use their imagination to create their own playthings. They could use natural materials like sticks, leaves, and rocks to make their own toys or games. This would encourage them to be more creative and resourceful, and would also teach them valuable problem-solving skills.",
    "Children could play with household items like paper clips, rubber bands, and tin foil. They could create their own games and puzzles using these items, or use them to build structures and forts. This would teach them to think outside the box and to find new ways to use everyday objects.",
    "Children could play with each other, using their bodies and movements to create games and activities. They could have dance parties, play tag, or create their own sports. This would encourage physical activity and social interaction, and would also teach them valuable teamwork and communication skills.",
    "Children could play with their pets, using their toys and treats to interact with their furry friends. They could also create their own pet-friendly games and activities, like playing fetch or tug-of-war. This would teach them about animal behavior and care, and would also encourage them to be more empathetic and compassionate.",
    "Children could play with technology, using their devices to create their own games and apps. They could use coding and programming to create their own interactive toys and games, or use augmented reality and virtual reality to create immersive play experiences. This would teach them valuable tech skills and would also encourage them to be more innovative and creative."
