    "Floating National Park: Create a national park that floats on water, allowing visitors to explore the park from a unique perspective. The park could be designed with a series of interconnected floating islands, each with its own distinct ecosystem and attractions. Visitors could travel between the islands via a network of canals and waterways, or take a scenic boat tour to experience the entire park.",
    "Time-Traveling National Park: Develop a national park that allows visitors to explore different eras of history. The park could be divided into different zones, each representing a different time period, from prehistoric times to modern day. Visitors could use special time-travel devices, such as time-portals or temporal tunnels, to move between zones and experience the park in a unique and immersive way.",
    "Interactive National Park: Create a national park that utilizes cutting-edge technology to create an interactive and immersive experience for visitors. The park could be filled with interactive exhibits, virtual reality experiences, and augmented reality displays, allowing visitors to learn about the park's history, geology, and wildlife in a fun and engaging way. Visitors could also use special wearable technology, such as smart glasses or bracelets, to receive real-time information and guidance as they explore the park.",
    "Shiftable National Park: Develop a national park that can be easily reconfigured and adapted to meet the needs of different visitor groups. The park could be designed with modular components, such as interchangeable exhibits, trails, and facilities, that can be easily moved and rearranged to accommodate different types of visitors. For example, a group of schoolchildren could have a different experience than a group of senior citizens.",
    "Glow-in-the-Dark National Park: Create a national park that glows at night, using special lighting technology to create an otherworldly and magical atmosphere. The park could be filled with glowing plants, animals, and landmarks, allowing visitors to experience the park in a completely new and unique way after dark. Visitors could also use special glow-in-the-dark technology, such as glow sticks or night vision goggles, to enhance their experience and explore the park in a whole new light."
