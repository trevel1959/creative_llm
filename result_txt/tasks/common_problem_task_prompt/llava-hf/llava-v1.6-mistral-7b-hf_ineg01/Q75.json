    "Overcrowding: With more visitors to the park, there may be increased littering and pollution, which can harm the local ecosystem. To mitigate this, implementing ecotourism policies, like limiting the number of visitors, providing waste disposal facilities with public announcements, and encouraging responsible tourism practices would minimize negative impacts on the environment.",
    "Infrastructure: Managing a national park often involves developing and maintaining infrastructure, such as campgrounds, restrooms, walking trails, and facilities for educational programs. With growth in the park's size, there may be a need for expanding these facilities while still maintaining the park's natural beauty. Solving this could require creative planning to integrate infrastructure with the park's ecosystem without detracting from its wilderness charm.",
    "Erosion Control: The influx of increased foot traffic can cause soil erosion, compromising the stability and integrity of natural structures like cliffs or riverbanks. Incorporating erosion control measures such as stabilizing stream banks, replacing damaged trails with erosion-resistant materials, and implementing a visitor education program to promote Leave No Trace principles could help mitigate erosion and protect the park's landscape.",
    "Water quality preservation: A growing park could lead to water quality issues due to increased water usage, waste, or even increased runoff from impervious surfaces. A solution might include constructing water treatment plants, implementing green infrastructure, and creating educational programs to minimize pollution and maintain pristine waters in the park's ecosystem.",
    "Biodiversity Monitoring: As the park's size expands, it may bring in invasive plant or animal species that could pose a threat to the native wildlife. Implementing a comprehensive biodiversity monitoring plan with efforts to control invasive species and promote the native flora and fauna can help protect the park's ecosystem and maintain a healthy balance."
