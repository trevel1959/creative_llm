    "**Hyperloop Hubs**: Implement Hyperloop technology to connect distant neighborhoods and suburbs to the city center, reducing travel time and increasing efficiency. This would involve building Hyperloop tubes and stations, as well as integrating them with existing public transportation systems.",
    "**Smart Bike-Sharing**: Develop a bike-sharing system that utilizes AI-powered smart bikes. These bikes would be equipped with GPS, sensors, and solar panels, allowing riders to easily locate and reserve bikes, track their route, and even receive real-time traffic updates.",
    "**Autonomous Shuttles**: Introduce autonomous shuttles that can navigate through the city, providing a convenient and efficient mode of transportation for short distances. These shuttles would be equipped with sensors, cameras, and AI to ensure safe and smooth operation.",
    "**Floating Bus Terminals**: Design floating bus terminals that can be placed on waterways, reducing congestion on land and providing a unique transportation experience. These terminals would be equipped with solar panels, wind turbines, and green roofs to minimize their environmental impact.",
    "**Vertical Farming Stations**: Establish vertical farming stations near public transportation hubs, providing fresh produce to passengers and reducing the carbon footprint of food transportation. These stations would utilize hydroponics, aeroponics, or other forms of sustainable agriculture to maximize space and minimize waste."
