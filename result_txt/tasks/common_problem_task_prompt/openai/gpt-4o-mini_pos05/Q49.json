    "**Technical Scalability Issues**: As the technology gains traction, it may struggle to scale effectively. This could be due to limitations in infrastructure, server capacity, or software architecture that was not designed to handle a large volume of users. To mitigate this risk, developers should prioritize scalability during the initial design phase, possibly by using cloud services and modular architecture that can grow with user demand.",
    "**Regulatory and Compliance Challenges**: New technologies often face regulatory scrutiny, especially in sectors like healthcare, finance, or data privacy. The development team must navigate a complex landscape of laws and regulations that can vary significantly by region. Engaging with legal experts early in the development process can help ensure compliance and avoid costly setbacks or fines.",
    "**Intellectual Property Issues**: Protecting the unique aspects of a game-changing technology is crucial. However, there is a risk of infringing on existing patents or having one's own intellectual property stolen or copied. To counter this, the team should conduct thorough patent research and consider filing for patents early in the development process. Additionally, they could establish non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with collaborators and partners to safeguard sensitive information.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Developing groundbreaking technology often requires significant investment. Securing funding can be a challenge, especially if investors are skeptical about the market viability of the innovation. To address this, the team could create a detailed business plan that outlines the technology's potential market impact, revenue projections, and a phased approach to funding that demonstrates milestones and returns on investment.",
    "**Integration with Existing Systems**: Many industries rely on established technologies and workflows. A new technology may face integration challenges with these legacy systems, leading to potential disruptions or inefficiencies. To tackle this issue, the development team should prioritize creating APIs and interoperability features that allow seamless integration with existing platforms, ensuring a smoother transition for users."
