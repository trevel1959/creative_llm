    "**Personalized Soundscapes**: Instead of a traditional alarm sound, allow users to create their own soundscapes that blend nature sounds, white noise, and gentle music. The alarm clock could feature a companion app where users can mix different sounds to create a calming environment that gradually increases in volume to gently wake them up, rather than a jarring beep.",
    "**Mood-Boosting Aromatherapy**: Incorporate a built-in aromatherapy diffuser that releases calming scents like lavender or invigorating scents like citrus at the set wake-up time. This multisensory approach can enhance the waking experience, making it more pleasant and helping to energize or relax the user as needed.",
    "**Interactive Wake-Up Routine**: Develop an alarm clock with a touchscreen interface that allows users to customize their morning routine. The clock could display the weather, news headlines, and reminders for the day while also offering interactive elements like a mini meditation session or a short workout routine to help users start their day positively.",
    "**Light Therapy Feature**: Implement a gradual sunrise simulation with customizable light colors and intensities. The alarm clock could mimic the natural progression of sunrise, gradually illuminating the room to help users wake up more naturally. Users could choose different light settings to match their mood or energy levels, with options for energizing colors in the morning and calming colors for evening relaxation.",
    "**Social Wake-Up Call**: Allow users to schedule \"wake-up calls\" from friends or family members. This feature could enable loved ones to record short motivational messages or fun wake-up reminders that the alarm clock plays instead of a standard alarm sound. This personal touch could make waking up feel more connected and engaging."
