    "**Reusable Bags**: Use reusable bags to collect trash instead of disposable ones. These bags can be made from repurposed materials like old t-shirts, plastic bags, or even fabric. You can label them with a date and a symbol to indicate what can and cannot be disposed of in each bag.",
    "**DIY Trash Cans**: Create a makeshift trash can from items you have around the house. For example, you can use a large plastic container with a lid or a wooden crate with a metal pan inside. This not only reduces waste but also adds a personal touch to your home.",
    "**Compostable Waste**: Instead of throwing away food waste, start composting it. You can set up a small compost pile in your backyard or use a composting system that fits on your balcony or patio. This not only reduces the need for a trash can but also helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.",
    "**Recycling Programs**: Look into local recycling programs that pick up recyclable waste at your home. Some programs offer curbside pick-up, while others may require you to drop off your recyclables at a designated location.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Trash Cans**: Consider investing in an eco-friendly trash can made from recycled materials or with a composting feature. These cans often have a separate section for food waste, which can be composted instead of thrown away."
