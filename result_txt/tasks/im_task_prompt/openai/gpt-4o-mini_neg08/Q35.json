    "**Modular Bed Design**: Design a bed that can be customized with modular components. For instance, the headboard could include built-in storage, adjustable shelves for books or devices, and even a charging station. The mattress could be designed with interchangeable layers to accommodate different firmness preferences, allowing users to modify their bed to suit their needs without purchasing a whole new mattress.",
    "**Multi-Functional Bed**: Develop a bed that serves multiple purposes, such as a fold-out desk for working from home, a hidden gym setup with resistance bands and weights, or a built-in reading nook. This would be especially useful in small living spaces where maximizing functionality is key, transforming the bed into a versatile piece of furniture.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bed Materials**: Innovate a line of beds made entirely from sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood, organic cotton, and natural latex. Additionally, the manufacturing process could incorporate eco-friendly practices, like zero waste and renewable energy sources, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Therapeutic Bed Features**: Introduce beds with therapeutic features, such as built-in massage functions, heated surfaces for soothing aches, or adjustable firmness that can be tailored for specific body areas. These beds could be particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic pain or mobility issues, promoting better sleep and overall well-being.",
    "**Interactive Bedside Assistant**: Imagine a bed with an integrated AI assistant that can help users with bedtime routines. This assistant could remind users to wind down, read a story, play calming music, or even perform guided meditation sessions. It could also have voice-activated controls for adjusting lighting, temperature, and even entertainment options, making bedtime a more engaging experience."
