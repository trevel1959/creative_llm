    "Greenhouse-inspired Thermal Mass Design: Create a building structure that mimics a greenhouse, utilizing thermal mass materials like concrete, brick, or stone to absorb and release heat during the day. This design would take advantage of the natural temperature fluctuations, storing heat during the day and releasing it at night, maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature.",
    "Phase Change Materials: Incorporate phase change materials (PCMs) into interior walls, floors, or ceilings. These materials can absorb and release heat as they change phase from solid to liquid, providing a consistent temperature buffer. PCMs can be made from various materials, such as paraffin wax, salt hydrates, or even plant-based materials.",
    "Passive Ventilation Systems: Design a building with passive ventilation systems that utilize natural airflows to regulate indoor temperature. This can include large windows, operable windows, or even a green roof with vegetation to create a natural chimney effect. By using the surrounding environment to circulate air, the building can maintain a consistent temperature without relying on mechanical systems.",
    "Radiant Cooling Systems: Implement radiant cooling systems that circulate chilled water through pipes embedded in the floor or walls to cool the interior space. This method can be more energy-efficient than traditional HVAC systems, as it avoids the heat gain associated with heating and cooling the air. By using the surrounding soil or water for cooling, radiant cooling systems can also provide a more consistent temperature.",
    "Solar-Powered Cooling: Harness the power of the sun to cool the building through solar-powered evaporative cooling systems. These systems use a fan to blow hot air through a wet pad, causing the water to evaporate and cool the air. By strategically positioning the system's solar panels and wet pad, the building can maintain a comfortable temperature without relying on any external energy sources."
