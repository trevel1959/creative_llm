    "**Modular Wheelchair Design**: Create a modular wheelchair that allows users to customize their chair according to their needs. This could include interchangeable components like armrests, footrests, and seat cushions that can be easily swapped out. This adaptability would cater to users with varying physical needs and preferences, ensuring maximum comfort and usability.",
    "**Energy-Generating Wheels**: Design wheels that generate energy through movement. As the user propels the wheelchair, kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy, which could power devices like smartphones, lights, or even small cooling fans. This feature would provide added convenience and sustainability for users who are often on the go.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring System**: Incorporate health monitoring technology into the wheelchair. Sensors could track vital signs like heart rate, oxygen levels, and even posture. This data could be relayed to a connected app, allowing users and caregivers to monitor health metrics and receive alerts for any concerning changes, promoting proactive health management.",
    "**All-Terrain Capabilities**: Develop a wheelchair with advanced all-terrain capabilities, featuring larger, more rugged wheels and a suspension system that can adapt to various surfaces. This would enable users to navigate outdoor environments more easily, from parks to beaches, and encourage exploration and physical activity outside traditional settings.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Interface**: Integrate an AR interface into the wheelchair that provides users with real-time information about their surroundings. This could include navigation prompts, points of interest, or alerts about nearby obstacles. The AR system could be displayed on smart glasses or a small screen mounted on the wheelchair, enhancing the userâ€™s awareness and interaction with their environment."
