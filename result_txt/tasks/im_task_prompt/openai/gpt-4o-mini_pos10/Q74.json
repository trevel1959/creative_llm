    "**Adjustable Flow Nozzle**: Design a watering can with an adjustable nozzle that allows users to switch between different spray patterns (e.g., mist, shower, jet) and flow rates. This would enable users to cater to different plant types and watering needs, from delicate seedlings to established garden plants, ensuring optimal hydration without overwatering.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Comfort Grip**: Revamp the shape of the watering can to include an ergonomic handle that conforms to the user's grip, reducing strain on the wrist and fingers. Additionally, include a lightweight, balanced design that makes it easier to carry and pour, especially when filled with water.",
    "**Built-in Water Filter**: Incorporate a simple water filtration system within the watering can that can filter out impurities and chlorine from tap water. This feature would provide plants with cleaner water, promoting better growth and health, and could be especially useful for indoor plants that are sensitive to chemicals.",
    "**Self-Watering Feature**: Create a watering can that can also function as a self-watering system. By adding a reservoir at the bottom with a wick system, the can could slowly release water into the soil as needed. This would allow for consistent moisture levels and reduce the frequency of manual watering, making it ideal for busy gardeners.",
    "**Color-Coded Measurement System**: Design the interior of the watering can with color-coded measurement markings that indicate how much water to use for different types of plants. For example, blue could indicate water for succulents, green for leafy plants, and red for flowering plants. This visual cue would help novice gardeners water their plants more accurately."
