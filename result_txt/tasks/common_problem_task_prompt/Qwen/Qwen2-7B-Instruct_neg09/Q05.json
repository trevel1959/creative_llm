    "**Eco-Friendly Tree House**: Create a tree house that is entirely sustainable and eco-friendly. Use natural materials like bamboo, recycled wood, and solar panels for power. The design can include rainwater harvesting systems to collect and reuse water, insulation made from local plant materials to maintain a comfortable temperature, and plants growing on the roof to provide shade and improve air quality.",
    "**Themed Adventure Tree House**: Design your tree house as a part of an adventure theme, such as a pirate ship, a medieval castle, or a futuristic spaceship. This concept would involve using creative architectural elements and decorations inspired by these themes. For instance, a pirate-themed tree house could have a treasure chest entrance, a flagpole, and a lookout tower, while a medieval castle might feature drawbridges, towers, and battlements.",
    "**Tree House Classroom**: Transform your tree house into a mini classroom where you can study or teach in a unique setting. Incorporate elements like desks and chairs made from tree branches, shelves for books carved into the trunk, and a whiteboard painted onto a tree bark. Add features like a projector screen that unfolds from a hidden compartment or a sound system powered by a portable solar charger.",
    "**Observatory Tree House**: Combine your love for astronomy with your tree house by building it near a clear sky and installing a telescope or other astronomical equipment. Design the space with dark, light-blocking curtains for stargazing, and possibly include a cozy seating area where you can relax and observe the night sky. Consider adding a star chart or constellation guide for educational purposes.",
    "**Multigenerational Family Retreat**: Create a tree house that serves as a retreat for the whole family, including grandparents, parents, and children. The design could incorporate separate living spaces, each tailored to accommodate different age groups. For example, one section could be designed for children with a play area, while another might offer a comfortable lounge for adults. Include amenities like a small kitchenette, bathrooms, and recreational activities such as board games or a small library."
