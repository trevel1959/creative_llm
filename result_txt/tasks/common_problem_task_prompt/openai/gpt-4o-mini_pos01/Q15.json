    "**Pest Infestation**: Gardens can attract various pests that may harm plants, such as aphids, caterpillars, or beetles. This can lead to significant damage and loss of crops. To combat this issue, gardeners can implement companion planting, which involves growing certain plants together to naturally deter pests, or use organic pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap to minimize chemical exposure.",
    "**Inadequate Sunlight**: Many plants require full sun (6-8 hours of direct sunlight) to thrive. If a garden is planted in a shaded area, it may lead to poor growth or failure to produce fruit or flowers. Gardeners should assess the sunlight exposure throughout the day and select plants that are shade-tolerant if the area receives limited sunlight.",
    "**Watering Challenges**: Overwatering or underwatering can both be detrimental to plant health. Too much water can lead to root rot, while too little can cause plants to wilt and die. Gardeners should consider installing a drip irrigation system or using self-watering planters to maintain consistent moisture levels. Additionally, understanding the specific water needs of each plant type is crucial.",
    "**Seasonal Timing**: Planting at the wrong time of year can result in poor growth or complete failure of the garden. Each plant has its ideal planting season, and if gardeners are not aware of frost dates or the growing season in their region, they may plant too early or too late. To avoid this, researching local climate conditions and using a planting calendar can help ensure timely sowing.",
    "**Competition from Weeds**: Weeds can quickly take over a garden, competing with cultivated plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight. This can lead to reduced yields and increased maintenance efforts. To prevent weed growth, gardeners can use mulch to suppress weeds, regularly check for and remove them, and consider planting cover crops during the off-season to maintain soil health and prevent weed establishment."
