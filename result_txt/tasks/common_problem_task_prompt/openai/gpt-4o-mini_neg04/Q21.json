    "**Cyberbullying**: The anonymity of the internet can foster bullying behavior among children. Parents may find it difficult to monitor their child's online interactions, making it challenging to identify when their child is being bullied or is a bully themselves. This can lead to severe emotional distress for the child, requiring parents to educate themselves and their children about online safety and encourage open conversations about their online experiences.",
    "**Digital Footprint Awareness**: Children often do not understand the permanence of their online actions. They may post inappropriate content without realizing it can affect their future opportunities, such as college admissions or job prospects. Parents must teach their children about the importance of maintaining a positive digital footprint and the potential long-term consequences of their online behavior.",
    "**Information Overload**: The internet provides an overwhelming amount of information, which can be both beneficial and detrimental. Children may struggle to discern credible sources from unreliable ones, leading to confusion and misinformation. Parents can help by guiding their children on how to research effectively, evaluate sources, and understand the difference between opinion and fact.",
    "**Addiction to Technology**: With the rise of engaging apps and games, children can develop an unhealthy dependency on technology. This can lead to issues such as decreased physical activity, poor academic performance, and disrupted sleep patterns. Parents need to establish healthy tech habits and encourage alternative activities, such as outdoor play or hobbies that donâ€™t involve screens.",
    "**Social Skills Development**: Excessive reliance on digital communication can hinder the development of essential social skills in children. They may struggle with face-to-face interactions, emotional recognition, and conflict resolution. Parents should promote in-person interactions and encourage participation in group activities to help their children build strong interpersonal skills."
