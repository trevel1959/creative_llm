    "**Charging Challenges**: Without electricity, one cannot charge electronic devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and smart home appliances, leading to a disconnect from modern communication methods and the inability to use digital tools for work or entertainment.",
    "**Replacement of Perishable Food**: Refrigerators, ovens, and microwaves require electricity to maintain their functions. Without electricity, perishable food may spoil quickly or be inaccessible while cooking, possibly leading to food waste and a lack of nutrition.",
    "**Heating and Cooling**: Heating and air conditioning systems rely on electricity to function, leading to discomfort in extreme weather situations. Access to clean and warm water becomes limited if the water heater (which also depends on electricity) is not operational.",
    "**Electrical Safety Hazards**: The absence of electricity can lead to unintentional short circuits if there were electrical outlets or devices in the living space before the outage. The risk of electrical hazards, such as shock or fire, increases due to improperly managed or exposed wiring.",
    "**Security Concerns**: The absence of light and electronic security systems leaves residents vulnerable to potential theft, break-ins, or criminal activities. Surveillance cameras and motion detectors, which detect unusual activity, are typically reliant on electric power."
