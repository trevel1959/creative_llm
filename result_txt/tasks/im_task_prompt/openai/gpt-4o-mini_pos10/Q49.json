    "**Eco-Friendly Replaceable Heads**: Introduce a line of electric toothbrushes with biodegradable or recyclable brush heads. These heads could be made from sustainable materials like bamboo or plant-based plastics. Users could subscribe to a service that delivers new heads at regular intervals, encouraging sustainability and reducing plastic waste. The brush handle could also be designed to last a lifetime, minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Integrated Mouthwash Dispenser**: Create an electric toothbrush that features a built-in mouthwash dispenser. Users could fill a reservoir with their favorite mouthwash, and the toothbrush would dispense a small amount while brushing. This would enhance oral hygiene by combining brushing with rinsing, promoting fresh breath and reducing the need for separate mouthwash bottles.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Light Therapy**: Incorporate mood-enhancing LED lights into the design of the electric toothbrush. These lights could change colors based on the time of day or the user's mood, providing a calming or energizing effect while brushing. For example, soft blue lights could promote relaxation in the evening, while bright yellow lights could energize users in the morning, turning brushing into a more enjoyable experience.",
    "**Personalized Brush Settings via Facial Recognition**: Utilize facial recognition technology to customize brushing settings based on the user's unique oral health needs. When the user picks up the toothbrush, it could scan their face and adjust the intensity, duration, and cleaning mode accordingly. This would ensure that each user receives a tailored brushing experience, addressing specific areas of concern like gum sensitivity or plaque buildup.",
    "**Gamified Brushing Experience for Kids**: Design an electric toothbrush specifically for children that incorporates augmented reality (AR) and gamification. Kids could point their toothbrush at a mobile device or a special mirror that displays fun characters and games. As they brush, they could earn points for brushing for the full recommended time, cleaning all areas of their mouth, and achieving good technique. This interactive approach would make brushing fun and encourage lifelong healthy habits."
