    "**Smart Temperature Regulation**: Create a helmet with a built-in climate control system. Utilizing lightweight, flexible thermoelectric materials, the helmet could adjust its temperature based on external conditions and the cyclist's body heat. For instance, it could cool down on hot days or provide warmth during colder rides, enhancing comfort and performance.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Incorporate an augmented reality (AR) visor that can display vital information such as speed, distance traveled, navigation, and even incoming messages. The visor could also include a rear-view camera feed, giving cyclists a broader awareness of their surroundings without needing to turn their heads.",
    "**Customizable Safety Lights**: Integrate LED lights that can be customized for visibility and safety. Cyclists could select from various colors and patterns for both the front and back of the helmet, which would enhance visibility during night rides. The lights could also include turn signals that activate when the cyclist gestures with their arms, providing clear communication to drivers.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Technology**: Develop a helmet that utilizes advanced materials like D3O or similar shock-absorbing substances that harden upon impact. This technology would enhance safety by better protecting the head during accidents. Additionally, the helmet could feature a modular design that allows for easy replacement of damaged parts instead of discarding the entire helmet.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Innovate a helmet made from sustainable, biodegradable materials that do not compromise safety. This could include using recycled plastics or natural fibers that provide adequate protection while being environmentally friendly. A program could also be established for recycling old helmets, promoting a circular economy."
