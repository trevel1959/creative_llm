    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Safety Glasses**: Create AR glasses that overlay real-time information about the user's surroundings. These glasses could use computer vision to detect potential hazards, such as sharp objects, open flames, or uneven terrain. The glasses would provide audible warnings or visual cues, guiding the user away from danger. This would allow them to navigate their environment safely without relying on physical sensations.",
    "**Environmental Mapping and Alerts**: Develop a mobile app that maps the userâ€™s environment and identifies potential hazards based on their location. The app could use GPS and user input to create a personalized safety map, highlighting areas to avoid or cautioning against certain activities. For instance, if the user is near a construction site, the app could alert them to the risks and suggest safer routes.",
    "**Smart Home Integration**: Integrate smart home technology that can monitor the user's movements and provide alerts in case of potential dangers. For example, smart floor sensors could detect if the user has fallen or is at risk of slipping. The system could then automatically alert emergency contacts or activate safety measures, such as locking doors or turning on lights to guide the user to safety.",
    "**Customized Safety Gear**: Design specialized clothing or gear that incorporates protective features. For instance, gloves with built-in sensors could detect pressure and temperature changes, providing feedback through a connected app. This gear could also include padding or reinforced materials in vulnerable areas, ensuring that even if the user cannot feel pain, they are physically shielded from injury.",
    "**Companion Robot Assistant**: Create a robotic companion that follows the user and acts as a safety monitor. This robot could use advanced sensors to detect hazards in real-time and provide verbal warnings or physical guidance to steer the user away from danger. For example, if the user approaches a busy street, the robot could gently pull them back or create a barrier to prevent them from stepping into traffic."
