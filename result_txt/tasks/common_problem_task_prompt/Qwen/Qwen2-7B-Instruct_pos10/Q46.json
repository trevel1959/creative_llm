    "**Incorporating Sustainable Technologies**: Introduce electric buses or hybrid vehicles to significantly reduce carbon emissions and air pollution. Additionally, integrate solar panels on bus shelters or top of buses to generate electricity. This initiative would not only improve the environmental impact but also provide an opportunity for the city to generate its own power from renewable sources.",
    "**Smart Transit Integration**: Develop a comprehensive mobile application that integrates all modes of public transport into one platform. This app should include real-time tracking of buses, trains, and other transit options, allowing passengers to plan their routes efficiently. It could also include features like predictive analytics to anticipate high-demand periods, enabling better resource allocation.",
    "**Enhanced Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Focus on improving accessibility by adding more wheelchair ramps, low-floor buses, and audio-visual announcements in stations. Collaborate with disability organizations to ensure that the new system meets the needs of all users, including those with visual or hearing impairments. This not only improves inclusivity but also enhances the city's reputation as a progressive and caring community.",
    "**Community Engagement Programs**: Implement programs that involve local communities in decision-making processes regarding the transportation system. For example, organize workshops where residents can provide feedback on routes, schedules, and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, consider offering incentives for regular users who contribute suggestions or participate in maintenance activities, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.",
    "**Promoting Active Commuting Options**: Integrate bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and possibly a bike-sharing program into the transportation network. Encourage the use of these active commuting options by providing secure parking facilities, lockers, and changing rooms at key transit hubs. This not only reduces congestion on public transport but also promotes healthier lifestyles and reduces reliance on personal vehicles."
