    "**DIY Jewelry Organizer**: Use an ice cube tray to organize small jewelry items like earrings, rings, and bracelets. Each compartment can hold a different type of jewelry, preventing tangles and making it easy to find what you need. You can also customize the tray by painting it or covering it with decorative paper to match your room's aesthetic.",
    "**Paint Palette for Kids**: Turn an ice cube tray into a colorful paint palette for childrenâ€™s art projects. Fill each compartment with different colors of paint, and the small sections make it easy for kids to mix colors without making a mess. Plus, when they're done, you can easily cover it with plastic wrap and save any leftover paint for future use.",
    "**Candle Making Mold**: Use an ice cube tray as a mold for making mini candles. Melt wax and pour it into the compartments, adding wicks and any desired scents or colors. Once the wax hardens, you can pop out the candles for use as decorative pieces or gifts. The small size is perfect for creating sample sizes of different scents.",
    "**Snack Portion Control**: For those looking to manage their snacking, use an ice cube tray to pre-portion healthy snacks like nuts, dried fruits, or cut-up vegetables. Fill each compartment with a different snack and store it in the fridge. This way, you can easily grab a healthy portion when you're hungry without overindulging.",
    "**Scented Sachets**: Create your own scented sachets using an ice cube tray. Fill each compartment with a mix of dried herbs, flowers, and essential oils, such as lavender or chamomile.
