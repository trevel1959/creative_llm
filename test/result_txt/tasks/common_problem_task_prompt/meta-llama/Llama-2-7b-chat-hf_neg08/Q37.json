Visitors are encouraged to wander through the exhibition and interact with the artworks, which are designed to evoke feelings of envy and insecurity.",
    "\"The Jealousy Game\": Develop an interactive art installation that invites visitors to confront their own feelings of jealousy. The exhibition space is divided into several rooms, each representing a different aspect of jealousy.
