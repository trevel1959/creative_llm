    "**Smart Parking System with Augmented Reality**: Implement an AI-powered smart parking system that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to guide drivers to available parking spots. The system would use sensors and cameras to detect vacant parking spaces and display them on a driver's smartphone or in-car display using AR. This would eliminate the need for drivers to search for parking, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Car-Sharing Platform with Gamification**: Develop a car-sharing platform that incentivizes users to adopt eco-friendly driving habits through gamification. Users would earn rewards and badges for driving electric or hybrid vehicles, using public transportation, or carpooling. The platform would also provide real-time feedback on their carbon footprint and suggest ways to reduce it.",
    "**AI-Powered Vehicle Maintenance Predictive Analytics**: Create an AI-powered predictive analytics system that analyzes vehicle data to predict maintenance needs, reducing the likelihood of breakdowns and extending the lifespan of vehicles. The system would use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in vehicle performance, alerting owners to potential issues before they become major problems.",
    "**Autonomous Vehicle Safety Escort Service**: Develop an autonomous vehicle safety escort service that provides a secure and safe transportation option for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. The service would use self-driving vehicles equipped with advanced safety features, such as collision avoidance systems and emergency response protocols, to ensure the well-being of passengers.",
    "**Virtual Reality Driver Training Simulator**: Design a virtual reality (VR) driver training simulator that provides a realistic and immersive driving experience, reducing the risk of accidents and improving driver skills. The simulator would use VR technology to recreate various driving scenarios, allowing drivers to practice and improve their skills in a safe and controlled environment."
