It is a sustainable way to manage waste and reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills.",
    "Reusing: People could reuse items instead of throwing them away. For example, plastic bags could be used to carry groceries or as a makeshift shopping bag. Glass jars could be used to store food or as a vase for flowers.",
    "Recycling: People could recycle more. Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials. It is a sustainable way to manage waste and reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills.",
    "Burning: People could burn their waste. Burning is a process of heating waste materials until they are reduced to ash. It is a quick and easy way to manage waste, but it is not sustainable and can contribute to air pollution.",
