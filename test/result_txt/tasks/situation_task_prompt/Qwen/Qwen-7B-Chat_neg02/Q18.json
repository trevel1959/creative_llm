    "Urban gardening: With limited space, urban dwellers can turn their balconies or rooftops into mini-farms by growing vegetables, herbs, and fruits. They can also use hydroponics or vertical farming techniques to maximize space. This way, they can produce fresh produce for themselves and their families without relying on traditional farming methods.",
    "Community sharing: In a world where farming has ceased, people may need to rely on each other for food. One idea could be to create community gardens where everyone contributes and shares the harvest. This could be done through a rotating system where each household takes turns maintaining the garden and harvesting the crops.",
    "Food preservation: Another option is to learn how to preserve food. By canning, pickling, and fermenting foods, people can store them for longer periods of time and ensure that they have access to nutritious meals even during times of scarcity.",
    "Hunting and fishing: If traditional farming methods are no longer possible, people may need to turn to hunting and fishing as sources of protein. This could involve learning new skills and techniques for hunting game and catching fish in rivers and lakes.",
    "Learning from past civilizations: Finally, people could study the practices of past civilizations that were able to survive without modern technology. For example, the Incas developed sophisticated irrigation systems that allowed them to farm in harsh environments. By learning from these ancient practices, people may be able to find new ways to feed themselves and their families in a world without farming."
