You can also add shelves on the side for books or a lamp for reading.",
    "**Sleep Lab**: Invest in sleep technology to optimize your sleep quality. This could include a smart mattress that tracks your sleep patterns, a white noise machine to drown out external noises, and an ambient light sensor that adjusts the room's lighting according to your circadian rhythm.",
