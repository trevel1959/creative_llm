    "**Smart Robotic Exoskeleton**: Picture a lightweight, fully adjustable robotic exoskeleton that enables mobility for those unable to stand. This exoskeleton would be designed with a seated position in mind, featuring a comfortable seat and support for the upper body. It would use advanced robotics to allow users to navigate their environment with ease, whether it’s gliding along flat surfaces or climbing stairs with built-in stair-climbing technology.",
    "**Personal Mobility Pod**: Envision a compact, personal mobility pod that resembles a futuristic, self-driving vehicle. Users would sit inside this pod, which would be equipped with AI for navigation and obstacle detection. The pod would have a sleek design, allowing it to maneuver through tight spaces and busy environments. With voice-activated controls, users could choose their destination and let the pod take them there while they enjoy the scenery from a comfortable seat.",
    "**Mobile Furniture System**: Consider a system of furniture that can transform into mobile units. For instance, a sofa that can detach into a wheeled platform, allowing users to be transported from room to room. This system could include a set of stylish chairs that can roll around the house, making it easy to move between spaces without standing. Each piece would be designed to blend seamlessly with home decor while providing functionality.",
    "**Wearable Drone Technology**: Imagine a personal drone system that allows users to be lifted and transported around. This wearable technology would consist of a lightweight harness and drone-like propellers that could lift the user gently into the air. With safety features and a control system that responds to the user’s movements, it would provide a unique way to navigate indoor and outdoor spaces without needing to stand.",
    "**Automated Mobility Chair**: Visualize a sophisticated automated chair that follows the user around their home or office. This chair would be equipped with sensors to detect the user's location and preferences, moving autonomously to keep up with their activities. It would have features like voice commands, a built-in mini-fridge, and even a work desk that can be adjusted for comfort, making it the ultimate multitasking mobility solution."
