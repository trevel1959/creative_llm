    "Nature's Rhythm: Harness the natural rhythm of the earth and its celestial bodies to keep track of time. Use the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and stars to mark the passage of time. For example, you could divide the day into 12 equal parts based on the position of the sun, with each part representing an hour.",
    "Sun Dials: Create sundials that use the shadow of a vertical stick or object to indicate time. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow will move on the sundial, allowing you to tell the time. This method would be most accurate during the daytime and less accurate at night.",
    "Water Clocks: Develop water clocks that use the flow of water to measure time. These clocks would be calibrated to measure the time it takes for a certain amount of water to flow from one container to another. As the water flows, it will indicate the passage of time.",
    "Time Stones: Create a system of stones or pebbles that represent different time intervals. For example, you could have a stone for each hour, with each stone having a different color or shape to represent the different time intervals. As the stones are moved around a designated area, you can keep track of the time.",
    "Time Tattoos: Develop tattoos that change color or design as time passes. These tattoos could be applied to the skin and would allow you to keep track of time without the need for any additional tools. The tattoos could be calibrated to change color or design at specific intervals, such as every hour or every day."
