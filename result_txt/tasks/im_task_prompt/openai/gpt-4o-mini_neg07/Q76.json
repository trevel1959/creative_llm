    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Tie with Plant-Based Materials**: Create a line of hair ties made entirely from biodegradable and sustainable materials, such as natural rubber or organic cotton. These hair ties would not only reduce plastic waste but also be gentle on hair, preventing breakage and damage. The packaging could be compostable, and the brand could promote an initiative where customers can return used hair ties for recycling or repurposing.",
    "**Modular Hair Tie System**: Design a modular hair tie that allows users to customize their hair tie with interchangeable accessories. Users could snap on different colors, patterns, or decorative elements (like charms or beads) to match their outfits or moods. This would provide a fun and creative way to express personal style while keeping hair secure. The modular components could be made from flexible, durable materials that are easy to clean.",
    "**Hair Tie with Built-In Tracker**: Introduce a hair tie that features a small, discreet tracking device. This could help users keep track of their hair ties, which often get lost in bags or around the house. The tracker could connect to a mobile app that alerts users when they are getting too far from their hair tie, helping to prevent loss. Additionally, it could include a feature that helps locate other items in the vicinity, creating a multi-functional accessory.",
    "**Hair Tie with Aromatherapy Infusion**: Develop a hair tie that has a small compartment for essential oils or scented beads. This hair tie would release a subtle fragrance as it is worn, providing aromatherapy benefits throughout the day. Users could choose from a variety of scents, such as lavender for relaxation or citrus for an energy boost. The scent would be adjustable, allowing users to refill or change the aromatic elements based on their preferences.",
    "**Hair Tie with Integrated Scrunchie Technology**: Create a hybrid hair tie that combines the functionality of a traditional hair tie with the comfort of a scrunchie. This product would have a strong elastic core for secure hold, surrounded by a soft, fabric scrunchie exterior. This design would reduce hair damage while providing a stylish look. The scrunchie cover could be removable and washable, allowing for easy maintenance and customization with different fabrics and patterns."
