    "**Smart Tape Dispenser with Integrated Scissors and Measuring Tool**: Design a tape dispenser that not only dispenses tape but also comes equipped with built-in scissors and a measuring tool. The scissors would be retractable, allowing users to easily cut the tape to the desired length. The measuring tool would be a digital display that shows the exact length of the tape used, helping users to accurately measure and record their work.",
    "**Tape Dispenser with Built-in Level and Pencil Holder**: Create a tape dispenser that includes a built-in level and pencil holder. The level would be a small, digital display that shows whether the surface is perfectly level or not, helping users to ensure their work is accurate. The pencil holder would be a small, detachable compartment that can hold a pencil or pen, allowing users to mark important measurements or notes.",
    "**Automatic Tape Dispenser with Sensors and Alerts**: Design an automatic tape dispenser that uses sensors to detect when the tape is running low or when the user needs to replace the tape roll. The dispenser would also come equipped with alerts, such as a flashing light or a beeping sound, to notify the user when the tape is running low or when the tape roll needs to be replaced.",
    "**Ergonomic Tape Dispenser with Adjustable Angle and Rotation**: Create a tape dispenser that is designed with ergonomics in mind. The dispenser would have an adjustable angle and rotation, allowing users to customize the position of the dispenser to fit their needs. This would reduce strain on the user's hand and wrist, making it easier to use the dispenser for extended periods.",
    "**Tape Dispenser with Integrated USB Charging Port and Cable Management**: Design a tape dispenser that includes an integrated USB charging port and cable management system. The charging port would allow users to charge their devices while they work, and the cable management system would keep cables organized and untangled, reducing clutter and making it easier to find the right cable when needed."
