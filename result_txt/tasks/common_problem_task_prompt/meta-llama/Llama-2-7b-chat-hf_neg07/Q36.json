    "Solar-Powered Neighborhood Hubs: Create designated neighborhood hubs with communal solar panels that can be accessed by all residents. These hubs could include community centers, libraries, or other public spaces. Each hub would have its own energy storage system, allowing neighbors to charge their devices, power their homes, and even share excess energy with one another.",
    "Solar-Powered Bike Sharing: Create a bike-sharing program that utilizes solar-powered stations to charge electric bikes. These stations could be placed throughout the city, providing a convenient and sustainable transportation option for residents. The bike-sharing program could also include electric scooters and other forms of personal transportation, further reducing the city's carbon footprint.",
    "Solar-Powered Street Lighting: Replace traditional street lighting with solar-powered lights that can be easily installed on existing light poles. These lights would be powered by solar panels during the day and could provide continuous lighting at night, reducing energy consumption and maintenance costs. Additionally, the solar panels could be designed to provide Wi-Fi connectivity, creating a smart city infrastructure that can monitor and manage energy usage.",
    "Solar-Powered Water Purification: Develop a solar-powered water purification system that can be placed in public parks or other community spaces. The system would use solar panels to power a filtration system, providing clean drinking water to residents. This would not only reduce the city's carbon footprint but also provide a reliable source of clean water for those in need.",
    "Solar-Powered Community Gardens: Create community gardens that use solar panels to power irrigation systems, lighting, and other gardening needs. These gardens could be placed throughout the city, providing a space for residents to grow their own food and connect with their community. The solar panels could also be used to power small businesses, such as community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, further supporting local food systems."
