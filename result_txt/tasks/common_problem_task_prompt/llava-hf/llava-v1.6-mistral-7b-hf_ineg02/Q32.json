    "Funding: Music festivals require a substantial amount of funding to cover costs such as venue rental, artist fees, security, and marketing. Organizers may have difficulty securing sponsorships or attracting enough ticket sales to cover the expenses.",
    "Event logistics: Coordinating multiple acts, vendors, and other logistical aspects of a festival can be challenging. Coordinating travel and accommodation, ensuring the stage is set up for each act, and coordinating with volunteers and staff can be time-consuming and create potential problems if not handled efficiently.",
    "Weather: Unpredictable weather can cause delays, cancellations, or disruptions during the festival. Organizers should have a plan for accommodating sudden changes in weather, such as setting up tents or providing wet/dry zones.",
    "Crowd control: Large crowds at music festivals can lead to issues with crowd control and public safety. Proper planning, security measures, and crowd management strategies are necessary to ensure the attendees' safety.",
    "Sound issues: Sound is a major factor at music festivals, and sound issues such as feedback, poor quality, or sound interference can detract from the festival experience. Organizers should invest in high-quality sound equipment and plan for multiple sound engineers to manage the sound at several stages."
