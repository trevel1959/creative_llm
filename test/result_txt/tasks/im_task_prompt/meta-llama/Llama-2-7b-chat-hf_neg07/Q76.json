    "Hair Tie with Built-in Scale: Create a hair tie with a built-in scale that allows users to track their weight and body fat percentage. The scale could be hidden within the hair tie itself, with a small display screen showing the user's weight and body fat percentage. This would provide an easy and convenient way for users to monitor their weight and stay on top of their fitness goals.",
    "Hair Tie with UV Protection: Develop a hair tie that provides UV protection for the user's hair and scalp. The hair tie could be made with a special UV-blocking material, such as a special type of fabric or a clear plastic material with UV-blocking properties. This would provide an added layer of protection for users who spend a lot of time outdoors or who have sensitive skin.",
    "Hair Tie with Heat and Cooling Functions: Create a hair tie that can heat or cool the user's hair and scalp. The hair tie could be made with a heating or cooling element, such as a small heating coil or a thermoelectric device, that can be activated by a button or switch. This would provide an added level of comfort for users who experience hair loss or scalp irritation.",
    "Hair Tie with Built-in Brush: Design a hair tie that includes a built-in brush. The brush could be made with soft, flexible bristles that are gentle on the hair and scalp, and could be used to detangle and style the user's hair. This would provide an added convenience for users who want to keep their hair looking great without having to carry around a separate brush.",
    "Hair Tie with Smart Features: Develop a hair tie that includes smart features, such as a built-in microchip that can detect when the user's hair is in need of a wash. The microchip could be programmed to detect changes in the user's hair, such as an increase in oil or dirt buildup, and could trigger an alert or notification to the user when it's time to wash their hair. This would provide an added level of convenience and hygiene for users who tend to forget to wash their hair."
