    "**Budget Constraints and Funding**: Film festivals often rely on a combination of ticket sales, sponsorships, and grants to fund their operations. If the festival does not secure enough funding, it may struggle to cover costs such as venue rental, marketing, and filmmaker hospitality. Unexpected expenses, such as equipment failures or higher-than-anticipated catering costs, can also lead to budget overruns. This could result in cutting corners or scaling back the festival, ultimately affecting the quality of the event.",
    "**Film Selection and Curation**: The process of selecting films to be featured at the festival can be fraught with challenges. Issues may arise if the selection committee fails to reach a consensus, leading to conflicts over which films to include. Additionally, if the chosen films do not resonate with the target audience, it could result in low attendance and negative feedback. There may also be logistical challenges in securing screening rights, especially for popular or critically acclaimed films.",
    "**Marketing and Audience Engagement**: Effectively marketing the film festival is essential to attract attendees. However, problems can arise if the marketing strategy is poorly executed or if the target audience is not clearly defined. A lack of engagement on social media or insufficient outreach to local communities can lead to low ticket sales. Additionally, if the festival does not have a strong online presence or website, potential attendees may struggle to find information about the event, further impacting attendance.",
    "**Logistical Challenges on the Day of the Event**: On the day of the festival, various logistical issues can arise, such as technical difficulties with projection equipment, delays in the schedule, or problems with seating arrangements. Inadequate staffing or volunteer training can lead to confusion and frustration for both attendees and filmmakers. Additionally, issues related to crowd control and safety can become problematic if the event draws a larger audience than anticipated.",
    "**Guest and Filmmaker Relations**: Maintaining positive relationships with filmmakers and special guests is crucial for the success of a film festival. Problems may arise if guests are not provided with adequate hospitality, such as accommodations, transportation, or meals. If filmmakers feel undervalued or disrespected, they may choose not to attend or promote the festival, leading to negative word-of-mouth. Moreover, miscommunication regarding schedules and expectations can lead to dissatisfaction among guests."
