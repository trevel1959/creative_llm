    "**Self-Winding Leash**: Create a leash that automatically retracts when the dog is close to the owner and extends when they are exploring. This could be powered by a small motor that senses the tension in the leash. It would eliminate the hassle of manually winding the leash back after walks, making it easier for owners to manage their dogs without tangling or getting caught on objects.",
    "**Multi-Functional Leash with Built-in Storage**: Design a leash that features a small, waterproof compartment for storing essentials like dog treats, waste bags, or keys. This would be especially handy for dog owners who enjoy long walks or hikes, allowing them to carry everything they need without additional bags or pockets.",
    "**Leash with Integrated LED Lights**: Equip the leash with LED lights that can be activated for nighttime walks. The lights could be adjustable in brightness and color, making the dog and owner visible to oncoming traffic and other pedestrians. This feature could also include reflective strips for added safety, making nighttime walks much safer.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Develop a leash with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for comfort based on the ownerâ€™s grip style. The handle could have interchangeable grips that cater to different hand sizes and preferences, ensuring that walks remain comfortable, even during long durations.",
    "**Training Leash with Feedback Mechanism**: Create a leash that incorporates a feedback mechanism to help train dogs. This could include a gentle vibration or sound alert when the dog pulls too hard or deviates from the desired path. The leash would connect to an app that provides training tips and tracks progress over time, helping owners to train their dogs more effectively."
