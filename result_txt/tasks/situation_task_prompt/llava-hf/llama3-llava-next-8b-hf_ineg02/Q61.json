    "Pollination drones: A fleet of small, lightweight drones equipped with specialized sensors and pollination mechanisms. They would be sent to areas with a high concentration of plants to collect and transfer pollen.",
    "Pollination towers: Tall structures that utilize wind and gravity to transport pollen between flowers. The towers would be strategically placed in areas with high plant density.",
    "Pollination satellites: Satellites in orbit around the Earth, equipped with specialized sensors and pollen dispensers. They would be programmed to collect pollen from one plant and deposit it onto another.",
    "Pollination drones with air currents: Drones equipped with air currents that create a turbulence that mimics the movement of pollinators. These drones would be designed to carry pollen between flowers.",
    "Pollination via microorganisms: Using microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to facilitate pollination. These organisms would be engineered to transfer pollen from one flower to another."
