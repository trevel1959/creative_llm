    "Kinetic energy devices: Another solution could be the use of kinetic energy devices, which harness the energy generated by motion to power devices. These devices could be used to charge smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices. For example, a bicycle-powered charger could be used to charge a smartphone while cycling.",
    "Hydroelectric power: Hydroelectric power, generated by the movement of water, could also be used to power devices. Small hydroelectric generators could be set up near water sources to provide a constant source of electricity.",
    "Thermoelectric devices: Thermoelectric devices could be used to convert heat energy into electricity. These devices could be used to power electronic devices in hot environments, such as deserts or tropical regions.",
    "Nuclear-powered devices: In the event of a global battery failure, nuclear-powered devices could be used to generate electricity. Small nuclear reactors could be used to power homes, cities, and even vehicles. However, this solution would require strict safety protocols and regulations.",
    "Fuel cells: Fuel cells could be used to generate electricity from hydrogen gas. These cells convert hydrogen gas into electricity, which could be used to power devices. However, the production of hydrogen gas would require a significant amount of energy and resources."
