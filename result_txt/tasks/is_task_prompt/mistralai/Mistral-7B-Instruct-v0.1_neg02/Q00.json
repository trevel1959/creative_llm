    "The dog was not afraid: The dog may not have been afraid of the stimulus, which could have caused it to not bark as it normally would. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the dog being well-behaved or having been trained to not bark in certain situations.",
    "The dog was not present: The dog may not have been present when the stimulus occurred, which could have caused it to not bark as it normally would. This could have been due to the dog being in a different room or area, or it could have been due to the dog being asleep or otherwise occupied."
