    "**Multi-Sensory Feedback**: Integrate haptic feedback technology into the mouse, allowing it to provide tactile sensations in response to different actions. For instance, the mouse could vibrate lightly when hovering over clickable elements or provide resistance when scrolling through long documents. This sensory feedback would enhance user engagement and improve navigation accuracy.",
    "**Smart Surface Technology**: Develop a mouse that can function on any surface by incorporating advanced sensor technology. This would allow the mouse to recognize the texture and material of the surface it's on and adjust its tracking settings accordingly. Users could work seamlessly on glass, fabric, or even their skin, making it ideal for on-the-go scenarios.",
    "**Personalized Button Mapping**: Create a mouse with customizable buttons that can change their function based on the software being used. For instance, in a graphic design program, one button could become a color picker, while in a gaming scenario, it could serve as a macro key. This feature would be controlled via an intuitive app that learns user preferences over time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Innovate a mouse made entirely from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. Furthermore, it could be powered by solar energy or kinetic energy generated from movement. This environmentally conscious approach would appeal to eco-aware consumers and reduce electronic waste.",
    "**Integrated Wireless Charging**: Design a mouse that can wirelessly charge when placed on a special mouse pad that doubles as a charging station. The pad would use resonant inductive charging technology, allowing users to keep their mouse powered without the hassle of cords or batteries. This feature would ensure that the mouse is always ready for use without interruptions."
