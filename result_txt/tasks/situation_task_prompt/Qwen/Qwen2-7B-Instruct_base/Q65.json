    "**Solar-Powered Light Plants**: Create a garden of illuminated plants that can be placed around the room. The leaves or stems of these \"light plants\" could be made from transparent or translucent materials filled with a solar-powered LED light source. This creates an eco-friendly and aesthetically pleasing way to light up a space. At night, they would absorb sunlight during the day and emit light when it's dark.",
    "**Inflatable Lanterns**: Design large, inflatable lanterns made from translucent fabric or silicone. These could be filled with a small battery-operated LED light inside, allowing them to float in the air or hang from the ceiling like traditional lanterns. They would provide a soft, ambient glow throughout the room.",
    "**Interactive Luminous Paint**: Use special luminous paint that absorbs light during the day and glows at night. Apply this paint to walls, furniture, or even create intricate designs on the floor. The paint could be activated by direct sunlight or artificial light sources, offering a dynamic visual experience.",
    "**Fiber-Optic Ceiling**: Install a fiber-optic lighting system in the ceiling, which would channel light from a central source to numerous points around the room. This would create a star-like effect, providing indirect yet uniform illumination without any traditional lighting fixtures. The system could be controlled to adjust brightness and color.",
    "**Reclaimed Glass Ornaments**: Collect various types of glass ornaments such as vases, bowls, and jars, and fill them with small LED lights. Attach them to the ceiling using wire or string, or place them on shelves, tables, or the floor to create a unique, artistic lighting setup. The glass pieces would diffuse the light, casting a warm, inviting glow throughout the room."
