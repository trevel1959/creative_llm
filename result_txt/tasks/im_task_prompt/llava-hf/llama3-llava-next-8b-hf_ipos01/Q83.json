    "Cart Chatbot: Implement a voice-activated assistant on the shopping cart that can answer questions about products, provide recommendations, and offer personalized deals. This could be particularly useful for customers who prefer not to interact with staff or want to explore the store independently.",
    "Auto-Fill: Equip the shopping cart with an auto-fill feature that uses the customer's shopping history or preferences to suggest products they might be interested in, reducing the time spent searching for items.",
    "Energy Harvesting: Incorporate solar panels or other energy-harvesting technology into the shopping cart's design, allowing it to recharge its batteries or power its electronic components using clean, renewable energy.",
    "Cart Security: Add GPS tracking and geofencing capabilities to the shopping cart, which would help prevent theft by alerting store security if a cart is taken outside the premises without the customer's consent.",
    "Smart Cart Routing: Implement an algorithm that directs the shopping cart to the most efficient route within the store, taking into account factors such as product location, aisle layout, and customer preferences. This could save time and reduce the amount of physical effort required by customers."
