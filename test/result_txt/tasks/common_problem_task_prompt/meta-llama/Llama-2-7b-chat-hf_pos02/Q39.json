    "\"Income Innovation Hubs\": Create designated areas in cities where individuals can access resources and services to help them manage their basic income. These hubs could offer financial literacy courses, job training programs, and mental health support. They could also provide a space for people to connect and collaborate with others who are also receiving a basic income, fostering a sense of community and support.",
    "\"Robot-Friendly Benefits\": Implement a system where people receiving a basic income are eligible for additional benefits, such as discounts on essential items, access to affordable housing, or priority access to job training programs. This would help ensure that the basic income is not just a handout, but a stepping stone to a better life.",
    "\"Income-Sharing Communities\": Create intentional communities where people receive a basic income in exchange for contributing to the community in some way. This could be through volunteering, working in a shared space, or participating in community events. This would provide an opportunity for people to connect with others and build a sense of purpose and belonging.",
    "\"Skill-Swap Networks\": Create online platforms where people receiving a basic income can connect with others who have complementary skills. This could be a way for people to learn new skills, gain new experiences, and build connections with others.",
    "\"Income-Based Crowdfunding\": Create a crowdfunding platform where people can raise money for specific goals or projects. The platform could be designed to prioritize funding for people who are receiving a basic income, providing them with the resources they need to pursue their passions and interests. This would help to create a more equitable and supportive funding ecosystem."
