    "**Smart Bike Bell**: A bicycle bell that doubles as a smart device, equipped with sensors and AI-powered technology to detect and alert drivers of approaching cyclists. The bell would emit a unique sound or light pattern to signal the cyclist's presence, while also transmitting the cyclist's location and speed to nearby drivers through a mobile app.",
    "**Bike-to-Phone**: A wearable device that attaches to the cyclist's wrist or handlebars, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit audio cues and vibrations to the cyclist's phone. This device would provide real-time alerts for hazards, such as potholes, road debris, or approaching vehicles, allowing the cyclist to stay focused on the road while receiving critical information.",
    "**Eco-Alert**: A smart bicycle bell that incorporates environmental sensors to detect air quality, noise pollution, and other environmental factors. The bell would emit a unique sound or light pattern based on the detected conditions, alerting drivers and pedestrians to potential environmental hazards. This feature could also provide cyclists with real-time feedback on their own environmental impact.",
    "**CycleCompanion**: A wearable device that attaches to the cyclist's helmet or handlebars, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect and track nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and other hazards. The device would provide audio and visual alerts to the cyclist, while also transmitting information to nearby drivers and pedestrians through a mobile app.",
    "**SoundScout**: A smart bicycle bell that incorporates 3D audio technology to create a unique sound experience for cyclists. The bell would emit a customizable sound pattern based on the cyclist's speed, direction, and surroundings, allowing them to navigate through crowded areas with greater confidence and awareness. This feature could also provide a fun and engaging way for cyclists to express themselves and stand out on the road.
