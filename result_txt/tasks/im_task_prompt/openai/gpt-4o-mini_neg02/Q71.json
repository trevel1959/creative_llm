    "**Modular Design**: Create a modular sleeping bag that can be adjusted in size and shape. Users could attach or detach sections based on their needs, such as adding extra insulation for colder nights or removing sections for a lighter pack. This would cater to different camping styles, from solo backpacking to family outings, and provide flexibility for various weather conditions.",
    "**Integrated Sleep Tracker**: Incorporate smart technology that tracks sleep patterns and provides feedback through a companion app. The sleeping bag could have sensors that monitor temperature, movement, and heart rate, allowing users to optimize their sleep environment. The app could offer personalized recommendations for improving sleep quality based on collected data.",
    "**Waterproof and Breathable Layers**: Develop a sleeping bag with an innovative dual-layer system that features a waterproof outer layer and a breathable inner layer. This would prevent moisture from seeping in while allowing sweat and humidity to escape, keeping the user dry and comfortable. The materials could be eco-friendly and lightweight, making it suitable for various outdoor activities.",
    "**Built-in Pillow and Blanket System**: Design a sleeping bag with an integrated pillow and detachable blanket that can be stored in a hidden compartment. The pillow could be adjustable in height and firmness, while the blanket could provide extra warmth on colder nights. This all-in-one solution would eliminate the need for additional sleeping gear, making it easier for users to pack and carry.",
    "**Personalized Color and Pattern Options**: Offer customizable sleeping bags where users can choose colors, patterns, and even add personal designs. This would appeal to campers who want to express their individuality or find their bag easily in a crowded campsite. A user-friendly online platform could allow customers to visualize their designs before ordering."
