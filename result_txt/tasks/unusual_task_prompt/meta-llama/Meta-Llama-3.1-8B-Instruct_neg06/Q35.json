    "**\"Lost and Found\" Wallet**: Design a wallet with a built-in GPS tracker and a \"lost\" mode that activates when the wallet is separated from its owner. The GPS tracker sends the wallet's location to the owner's phone, allowing them to track it down. The \"lost\" mode also includes a feature that displays a message on the wallet's screen, such as \"I'm lost, please return me to [owner's name]\". This feature can be activated remotely through a mobile app.",
    "**\"Smart\" Wallet with Personalized Recommendations**: Develop a wallet that comes with a built-in AI-powered assistant. The assistant learns the owner's spending habits and provides personalized recommendations for budgeting, saving, and investing. The wallet could also include features like automatic expense tracking, bill reminders, and alerts for sales or discounts on items the owner frequently purchases.",
    "**\"Secure\" Wallet with Advanced Biometric Authentication**: Create a wallet with advanced biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition scanner. The wallet would require a unique biometric scan to open, providing an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. The wallet could also include features like encryption, secure storage for sensitive documents, and alerts for suspicious activity.",
    "**\"Sustainable\" Wallet made from Recycled Materials**: Design a wallet made from 100% recycled materials, such as repurposed plastic, fabric scraps, or recycled paper. The wallet would not only reduce waste but also promote eco-friendliness. The wallet could be made from a durable, water-resistant material that can withstand daily use.",
    "**\"Social Impact\" Wallet with Integrated Donations**: Develop a wallet that allows users to make donations to their favorite charities with each purchase. The wallet would include a feature that automatically rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and donates the change to a selected charity. The wallet could also include a social impact tracker, showing the total amount donated and the positive impact it's making.
