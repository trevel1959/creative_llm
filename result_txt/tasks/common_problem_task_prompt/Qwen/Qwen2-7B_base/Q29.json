    "Communication Breakdown: Another potential problem that may arise is communication breakdown. If the team loses communication with each other, they may not be able to coordinate their activities and may end up getting lost or hurt.",
    "Water Pressure: A potential problem that may arise is excessive water pressure that can damage the equipment used in the deep-sea exploration mission. It can also cause internal injuries to the divers' bodies due to the pressure differences between the surface and the deep oceans.",
    "Environmental Hazards: One potential problem that may arise is the presence of environmental hazards such as underwater currents, sharks, and other marine animals. These hazards can cause accidents and endanger the divers' lives.",
    "Water Temperature: A potential problem that may arise is extreme water temperature variations, which can cause skin burns, hypothermia, or other dangerous health issues for the underwater explorers.",
    "Lack of Resources: Another potential problem that may arise is lack of resources. The deep-sea exploration mission is very expensive to execute, and there's always the possibility that the initial budget may be insufficient to cover all the costs and expenses, resulting in a breakdown of the mission."
