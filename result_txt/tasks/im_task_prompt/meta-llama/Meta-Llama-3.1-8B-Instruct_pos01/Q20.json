    "**Smart Coffee Maker with Flavor Profiling**: This coffee maker would have a built-in flavor profiling system that uses AI to learn the user's coffee preferences over time. It would ask the user to rate the flavor of their coffee after each brew, and use that data to adjust the brewing parameters (e.g., water temperature, coffee-to-water ratio, grind size) to optimize the flavor. The system would also allow users to save and share their flavor profiles with friends, creating a community of coffee enthusiasts.",
    "**Coffee Maker with Integrated Coffee Grinder and Scale**: This coffee maker would have a built-in coffee grinder that can grind the beans to the perfect consistency for the brewing method being used. It would also have a built-in scale that allows users to measure out the exact amount of coffee needed for the brew. This would eliminate the need for a separate grinder and scale, making the brewing process more convenient and streamlined.",
    "**Coffee Maker with Automated Coffee Bean Selection**: This coffee maker would have a built-in coffee bean selection system that uses a robotic arm to select and grind the perfect coffee beans for the brew. The system would use AI to analyze the user's coffee preferences and select the optimal coffee beans from a library of beans. This would ensure that users always get the perfect cup of coffee, without having to worry about selecting the right beans.",
    "**Coffee Maker with Integrated Coffee Brewing and Espresso Machine**: This coffee maker would have a built-in espresso machine that can make both brewed coffee and espresso shots. It would use a dual-boiler system to heat the water and steam to the perfect temperature for both brewing and espresso making. This would allow users to make a variety of coffee drinks, from lattes to cappuccinos, without having to use separate machines.",
    "**Coffee Maker with Automated Cleaning and Maintenance**: This coffee maker would have a built-in cleaning and maintenance system that uses a combination of water jets and UV light to clean the machine and remove any buildup of old coffee oils and residue. It would also have a self-diagnostic system that can detect any issues with the machine and alert the user to perform maintenance tasks. This would ensure that the machine always performs at its best and minimizes the risk of clogs and other issues."
