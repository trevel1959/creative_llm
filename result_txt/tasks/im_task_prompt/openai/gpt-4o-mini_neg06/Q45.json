    "**Ambient Lighting Integration**: Design a ceiling fan that includes customizable LED lights that can change color and brightness based on the time of day or user preference. This could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to set the mood for different activitiesâ€”bright white for working, soft yellow for relaxing, or colorful for parties.",
    "**Air Purification System**: Incorporate an air purification system within the ceiling fan. Using HEPA filters and UV-C light technology, the fan could not only circulate air but also filter out dust, allergens, and bacteria, improving indoor air quality. This would be especially beneficial for allergy sufferers or in homes with pets.",
    "**Sound System Integration**: Equip the ceiling fan with built-in Bluetooth speakers, allowing it to serve as a sound system for the room. Users could stream music or podcasts directly from their devices while enjoying the cooling effect of the fan, creating a more immersive and enjoyable atmosphere.",
    "**Remote Control and Voice Activation**: Develop a ceiling fan that can be controlled via a dedicated remote or voice-activated devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This would allow users to adjust fan speed, lighting, and even set timers without needing to get up, enhancing convenience and accessibility.",
    "**Seasonal Mode Settings**: Introduce a feature that allows the fan to switch between summer and winter modes with a simple toggle. In summer, the fan would spin counterclockwise to create a cooling breeze, while in winter, it would spin clockwise at a lower speed to circulate warm air that accumulates near the ceiling, improving heating efficiency."
