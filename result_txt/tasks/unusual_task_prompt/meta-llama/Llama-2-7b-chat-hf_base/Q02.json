    "Interactive Virtual Reality Experience: Create an immersive virtual reality experience where users can put on a VR headset and interact with a virtual rubber hand. Users can manipulate the virtual hand, stretch it, bend it, and even give it a virtual massage. The goal of this experience is to help users understand the concept of body ownership and the relationship between their physical body and their sense of self.",
    "Mindfulness App: Develop a mobile app that uses augmented reality to create a virtual rubber hand that users can interact with. Users can place their real hand on a flat surface and the app will superimpose a virtual rubber hand on top of it. Users can then manipulate the virtual hand, and the app will track the movements of their real hand, creating a sense of synergy between the two. The app can also include guided meditations and mindfulness exercises that encourage users to focus on the sensations in their real hand and cultivate a greater sense of body awareness.",
    "Sensory Deprivation Tank: Design a sensory deprivation tank that simulates the sensation of having a rubber hand. The tank would be filled with water and Epsom salt, and users would be able to float on their backs with their hands and arms immersed in the water. The tank would be designed to block out all sensory input, including light, sound, and touch, allowing users to focus solely on the sensations in their hands and arms. The goal of this experience is to help users understand the role of sensory input in shaping their sense of body ownership and self-awareness.",
    "Haptic Feedback Gloves: Create a pair of haptic feedback gloves that provide users with tactile sensations that mimic the sensation of having a rubber hand. The gloves would be equipped with tiny motors that vibrate in response to the user's movements, providing a sense of resistance and weight to the user's hand movements. Users can wear the gloves while performing everyday tasks, such as typing or playing video games, and the haptic feedback will help them develop a greater sense of body awareness and control.",
    "Virtual Reality Dance Party: Create a virtual reality experience where users can attend a virtual dance party with their virtual rubber hand. Users can dance"
