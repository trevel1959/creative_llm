    "**Integrated Light Indicator**: Design a bicycle bell that incorporates LED lights that flash in conjunction with the ringing. The light could serve as a visual alert for both pedestrians and other cyclists, especially in low-light conditions. Cyclists could choose from different light patterns (steady, blinking, or alternating colors) based on their preference or the urgency of the situation.",
    "**Customizable Sound Options**: Create a bicycle bell that allows users to select from a variety of sounds or melodies. This could be done through a smartphone app, where users can choose traditional bell sounds, animal sounds, or even fun tunes. This feature would add a personal touch and could make cycling more enjoyable, especially for children.",
    "**Safety Alert Integration**: Develop a bicycle bell that can be connected to a cyclist's smartphone via Bluetooth. When the cyclist approaches a busy intersection or a designated hazard zone, the bell could automatically sound an alert, reminding the cyclist to be cautious. This feature could also send notifications to the cyclist's phone about nearby traffic conditions or potential hazards.",
    "**Solar-Powered Rechargeable Bell**: Design a bicycle bell that is powered by solar energy. Equipped with small solar panels, this bell would charge during the day while the bike is parked in the sun. It would eliminate the need for batteries, making it an eco-friendly option. Additionally, the bell could have a small backup battery for use during cloudy days or at night.",
    "**Voice Command Activation**: Introduce a bell that can be activated by voice commands. This hands-free option would allow cyclists to ring the bell without needing to reach for a button, which can be especially useful in situations where they need to keep both hands on the handlebars. The bell could respond to customizable phrases like “ring bell” or “alert,” providing a modern twist on traditional bicycle bells."
