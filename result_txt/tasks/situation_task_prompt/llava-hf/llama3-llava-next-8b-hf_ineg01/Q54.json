    "Submarine Tunnels: A network of underwater tunnels could be built to connect different parts of the world. These tunnels could be designed to accommodate a variety of vehicles, including trains, cars, and even pedestrians.",
    "Seaplanes: Seaplanes are aircraft that can take off and land on water. They could be used to travel across large bodies of water, especially if the water is too deep for traditional ships or boats.",
    "Magnetic Levitation: Magnetic levitation technology could be used to create levitating platforms that could be suspended above bodies of water, allowing for smooth and efficient travel.",
    "Floating Islands: In a world without ships and boats, floating islands could become a new form of transportation. These islands could be designed to be self-sufficient, with their own power generation, food production, and waste management systems.",
    "Hovercraft: Hovercraft are vehicles that use a cushion of air to float above the ground. They could be adapted for use on water, allowing for fast and efficient travel across large bodies of water."
