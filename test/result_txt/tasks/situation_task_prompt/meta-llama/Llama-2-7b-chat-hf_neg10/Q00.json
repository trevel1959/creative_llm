    "Bicycle-powered highways: Build dedicated bike lanes on major highways, allowing cyclists to travel long distances while generating their own power. This would provide a healthy, eco-friendly, and cost-effective mode of transportation.",
    "Air-inflated vessels: Develop inflatable boats or airships that can travel long distances using wind power. These vessels could be powered by a combination of wind and solar energy, making them a sustainable and efficient option for inter-city travel.",
    "Maglev trains: Utilize magnetic levitation technology to create trains that float above the tracks, eliminating friction and allowing for faster travel times. This would reduce travel time between cities and provide a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.",
    "Personal flight devices: Design and manufacture personal flight devices, such as jetpacks or hoverboards, that allow individuals to travel short distances quickly and easily. This would revolutionize the way people move around cities and reduce reliance on traditional transportation methods.",
    "Underwater tunnels: Build networks of underwater tunnels that connect cities, allowing for travel between them without the need for surface transportation. These tunnels could be powered by renewable energy sources, such as tidal or wave power, making them both sustainable and efficient."
