    "**Global Brain Surge**: With everyone suddenly possessing genius-level intellect, the world would experience an unprecedented collective intelligence explosion. People would rapidly develop innovative solutions to pressing global problems, such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. This collective genius would lead to a new era of rapid progress, where breakthroughs in science, technology, and the arts would become the norm. However, the sheer magnitude of this cognitive shift could lead to information overload, making it challenging for individuals to keep up with the pace of innovation.",
    "**Cognitive Overload and Mental Health**: The sudden influx of genius-level intellect could lead to a mental health crisis. As individuals struggle to cope with the demands of their newfound cognitive abilities, they may experience anxiety, depression, and even cognitive overload. This could result in a significant increase in mental health disorders, as people struggle to manage the pressure of being a genius. Additionally, the stigma surrounding mental health issues might worsen, as society places unrealistic expectations on individuals to perform at an exceptional level.",
    "**Social Hierarchy and Power Dynamics**: The emergence of a global genius population would likely disrupt traditional social hierarchies. As people with exceptional intellects become the norm, the value placed on traditional markers of status, such as wealth and education, would decrease. This could lead to a shift in power dynamics, where individuals with genius-level intellects hold more influence and respect. However, this could also result in a new form of elitism, where those who are not geniuses feel left behind or marginalized.",
    "**Economic and Resource Implications**: The sudden increase in collective intelligence would likely lead to significant economic and resource implications. As people develop innovative solutions to complex problems, the demand for traditional resources, such as energy and raw materials, might decrease. This could lead to a shift in the global economy, where new industries and markets emerge to support the needs of a genius population. However, this could also result in widespread unemployment, as traditional jobs become obsolete.",
    "**Philosophical and Existential Implications**: The emergence of a global genius population would raise fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and human existence. As people possess exceptional cognitive abilities, they may begin to question the limits of human potential and the purpose of life. This could lead to a reevaluation of societal values,"
