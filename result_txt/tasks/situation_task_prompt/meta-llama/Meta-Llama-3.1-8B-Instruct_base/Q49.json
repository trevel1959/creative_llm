    "**DIY Fire-Resistant Materials**: Create a fire-resistant barrier using everyday materials like clay, sand, or even water. Mix these materials with a binding agent like flour or cornstarch to create a paste. Apply this paste to windows, doors, and any other vulnerable areas to prevent flames from spreading. You can also use old CDs or DVDs to create a makeshift fire-resistant shield by gluing them to the walls and windows. The reflective surface can help deflect heat and flames.",
    "**Fire-Extinguishing Garden**: Plant a garden with fire-extinguishing plants like aloe vera, mint, or chamomile. These plants have natural oils that can help smother fires or reduce their intensity. You can also use a fire-resistant mulch like gravel or sand to prevent embers from igniting nearby flammable materials.",
    "**Fire-Resistant Curtains**: Use old fire-resistant blankets or create your own by sewing together layers of fire-resistant fabric like cotton or polyester. Hang these curtains in front of windows and doors to create a fire-resistant barrier. You can also use a fire-resistant tape to seal any gaps between the curtains and the window frames.",
    "**Fire-Drill Preparedness**: Develop a fire-drill plan with your family, including evacuation routes and a meeting spot outside the home. Practice this plan regularly to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of a fire. This will help you stay calm and respond quickly in an emergency.",
    "**Fire-Safe Storage**: Store flammable materials like gasoline, paint, or chemicals in a fire-safe area like a metal cabinet or a fire-resistant container. Keep these materials away from heat sources like stoves or heaters, and never leave them unattended. You can also use a fire-resistant sealant to prevent any leaks or spills from igniting nearby flammable materials."
