    "**Built-in Infuser**: Design an electric kettle with a built-in infuser that can steep tea or herbal blends directly within the kettle. Users could simply add loose leaf tea or herbs into a designated compartment, and the kettle would heat the water and steep the ingredients simultaneously. This would eliminate the need for separate teapots or infusers, streamlining the brewing process.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning function that utilizes ultrasonic cleaning technology. By sending high-frequency sound waves through the water, the kettle could dislodge mineral buildup and other residues. This feature would make maintenance easier and prolong the life of the kettle, ensuring that users always enjoy clean, great-tasting water.",
    "**Dual Power Source**: Create a dual power source kettle that can operate on both electricity and battery power. This would allow users to boil water in situations where an electrical outlet isn't available, such as camping trips or during power outages. The kettle could feature a detachable battery that can be charged separately, providing convenience and versatility.",
    "**Interactive LED Display**: Integrate an interactive LED display on the kettle that provides real-time information about the water temperature, estimated time to boil, and even recipes for different beverages. Users could touch the display to select their desired beverage, and the kettle would automatically adjust settings for optimal results. The display could also show notifications, such as when the water is ready or when itâ€™s time for descaling.",
    "**Personalized Voice Assistant**: Embed a voice assistant within the kettle that can respond to user commands. Users could ask the kettle to boil water, provide reminders for when to start brewing, or even suggest recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. This feature would enhance user interaction and make the kettle more intuitive and user-friendly."
