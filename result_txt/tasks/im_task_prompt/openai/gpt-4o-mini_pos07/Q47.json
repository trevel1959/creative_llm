    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature for the vacuum cleaner's filter and brush rolls. This mechanism could use a combination of UV light and high-frequency vibrations to eliminate dust and debris buildup, ensuring that the vacuum maintains optimal suction power without requiring frequent manual maintenance. This would enhance the user experience and reduce the hassle of upkeep.",
    "**Adaptive Floor Mapping Technology**: Implement advanced AI-driven mapping technology that allows the vacuum cleaner to create a detailed 3D map of the home. This would enable it to identify high-traffic areas that require more frequent cleaning and adjust its cleaning patterns accordingly. The vacuum could also learn the layout of the home over time, avoiding obstacles and optimizing cleaning routes for efficiency.",
    "**Multi-Functionality Design**: Create a vacuum cleaner that can easily transform into a handheld device for versatile cleaning. This design could include detachable components, such as a mini vacuum for upholstery or car interiors, and a flexible hose attachment for reaching tight spaces. The vacuum could also include specialized brushes for different surfaces, making it a one-stop solution for all cleaning needs.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Features**: Develop a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable materials and designed for energy efficiency. It could incorporate a rechargeable battery that uses solar power or kinetic energy to extend its runtime. Additionally, the vacuum could feature a built-in recycling system that collects and compacts debris, allowing users to easily dispose of waste without needing disposable bags.",
    "**Health Monitoring System**: Equip the vacuum cleaner with sensors that monitor indoor air quality and provide real-time feedback to users. This feature could alert users to high levels of allergens, dust, or pollutants in the air, prompting them to vacuum more frequently. The vacuum could also provide suggestions for improving indoor air quality, such as opening windows or using air purifiers."
