    "**DIY Fabric Softener Ball**: Create a reusable fabric softener ball for your laundry basket using a clean, used tennis ball covered in wool or cotton yarn. The fibers will absorb a vinegar and water solution you spray on it, releasing the scent as you toss clothes into the basket. This idea not only reduces plastic waste but also makes the clothes smell fresh.",
    "**Laundry Basket Garden**: Transform your laundry basket into a small indoor garden by planting succulents or air plants. Use a breathable fabric liner to prevent soil from spilling out. This adds a touch of greenery and freshness to your home, creating a calming environment while your laundry is being sorted.",
    "**Customized Laundry Basket Labels**: Design custom labels for different types of clothing (e.g., \"Darks\", \"Whites\", \"Delicates\") to make sorting easier and quicker. Attach them to your laundry basket handles with strong adhesive or hook-and-loop fasteners. This helps family members understand which section of the laundry to place their items, reducing the need for constant reminders.",
    "**Foldable Laundry Basket Organizer**: Build or purchase a foldable laundry basket that includes compartments or dividers for different types of clothing. This allows for easy separation of items without having to move everything each time you do laundry. Itâ€™s particularly useful for families with children who need their clothes sorted by size or type.",
    "**Laundry Basket with Built-in Ironing Board**: For those who prefer to iron clothes immediately after washing, design a laundry basket with a built-in ironing board that can be folded down when not in use. This eliminates the need for extra space for an ironing board, making it more convenient for busy households. Attach wheels to the bottom of the basket to ensure it's easy to move around."
