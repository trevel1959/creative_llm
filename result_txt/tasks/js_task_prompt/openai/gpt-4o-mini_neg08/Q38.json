    "**Political Accountability**: I would apply this ability in the realm of politics. During debates or public addresses, politicians would be compelled to speak the truth about their policies, intentions, and past actions. This would not only hold them accountable but also empower voters to make informed decisions based on factual information. It could lead to a more transparent political environment, reducing corruption and fostering trust in government institutions.",
    "**Corporate Transparency**: In the business world, I would utilize this power to ensure that CEOs and corporate leaders tell the truth about their company’s practices, including labor conditions, environmental impact, and financial health. This would promote ethical business practices and allow consumers to make choices aligned with their values. Companies would be pressured to prioritize integrity over profit, leading to a more sustainable and responsible marketplace.",
    "**Therapeutic Sessions**: In therapeutic settings, I would implement this ability to help clients uncover the root causes of their issues. By compelling individuals to express their true feelings and thoughts, therapists could facilitate breakthroughs that might otherwise take years to achieve. This would not only expedite healing processes but also empower individuals to confront their pasts and work towards personal growth more effectively.",
    "**Education and Learning**: I would use this power in educational environments to ensure that students, teachers, and administrators communicate honestly about their experiences and challenges. This could lead to more tailored educational approaches, where students feel safe to share their struggles without fear of judgment. It would create a culture of openness, where educators can better understand their students’ needs and adapt their teaching methods accordingly.",
    "**Conflict Resolution**: In situations of conflict, such as mediation between parties in a dispute, I would apply this ability to reveal the underlying truths that often get lost in arguments. By compelling each party to articulate their genuine concerns and feelings, misunderstandings could be resolved more swiftly, paving the way for collaborative solutions. This would promote a culture of dialogue and empathy, rather than adversarial confrontation."
