    "**Garden Tool Organizer**: Instead of using it indoors, place your coat rack in a shed or garage to hang gardening tools. The hooks can hold trowels, pruners, and gloves, while the top can hold a small shelf for pots or seeds. This keeps your tools organized and easily accessible when you need them.",
    "**Accessory Station**: Repurpose your coat rack into a chic accessory organizer for jewelry, scarves, and hats. By hanging necklaces, bracelets, and scarves on the hooks, you can create a visually appealing display that also keeps your accessories untangled and easy to find.",
    "**Pet Leash Holder**: Use the coat rack as a dedicated space for your pet's leashes and collars. This not only keeps them organized but also serves as a visual reminder for dog walks. You can even add a small shelf on top for treats or a container for waste bags.",
    "**Seasonal DÃ©cor Stand**: Create a rotating seasonal decoration display by using the coat rack to hang themed decorations for holidays or special occasions.
