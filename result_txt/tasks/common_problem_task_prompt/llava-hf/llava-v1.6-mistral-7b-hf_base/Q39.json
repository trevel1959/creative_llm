    "Inflation: With an influx of money into the economy, there may be inflationary pressures as the demand for goods and services increases without a corresponding increase in supply. This could lead to higher cost of living for everyone, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals who can least afford the increase.",
    "Fiscal Strain: The cost of the UBI would be a significant financial burden on the government, leading to long-term fiscal strain and increased government debt. It may also result in increased taxes for future generations.",
    "Inadequate Funding: The government may struggle to fund the UBI, leading to insufficient payments that fail to provide enough support to those in need. This could result in hardship and continued poverty for many individuals.",
    "Demotivation: The introduction of a UBI could demotivate recipients to seek out education or job training, leading to a lack of incentive to improve their skills or seek better opportunities. This could result in a stagnant workforce and decreased economic growth in the long run.",
    "Disincentive to Work: A UBI could discourage individuals from seeking full-time employment, leading to a misallocation of labor and reduced productivity. It could also discourage entrepreneurship and innovation."
