    "Candle Art: Create a candle that doubles as a canvas for artistic expression. The candle can have a unique shape or design that allows the user to paint or draw on it while it burns. This can be a fun and creative way to enjoy the ambiance of a candle while also creating a one-of-a-kind piece of art.",
    "Scented Candle Carrier: Develop a candle that can hold multiple scented candles within its structure. This could be achieved through the use of interchangeable candle pods or a modular design that allows users to easily swap out different scented candles. This would be a convenient and space-saving way to enjoy a variety of scents without having to purchase multiple candles.",
    "Interactive Candle: Create a candle that responds to touch or movement. This could be achieved through the use of sensors or other technology that detects when the candle is touched or moved and adjusts the light or scent accordingly. This could be a fun and engaging way to enhance the ambiance of a room or create a unique sensory experience.",
    "Solar-Powered Candle: Develop a candle that harnesses the power of the sun to provide a clean and renewable source of light. This could be achieved through the use of a solar panel or other renewable energy source that powers a small LED light or other illumination source within the candle. This would be a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional candles.",
    "Multi-Functional Candle: Create a candle that serves multiple purposes. For example, the candle could have a built-in clock, thermometer, or even a small storage compartment. This would be a practical and convenient addition to any room, providing a variety of functions in one convenient package."
