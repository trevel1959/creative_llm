    "**Ergonomic Adjustable Handles**: Design scissors with handles that can be adjusted to fit the userâ€™s grip size. This could involve a sliding mechanism or interchangeable grips that can be swapped out based on the user's comfort. This would help reduce strain during prolonged use and cater to users with varying hand sizes or disabilities.",
    "**Self-Sharpening Blades**: Create scissors with a self-sharpening mechanism that sharpens the blades every time they are opened and closed. This could involve a small ceramic or diamond sharpening strip embedded in the handle, ensuring that the scissors remain sharp without the need for manual sharpening, thus enhancing efficiency and longevity.",
    "**Multi-Function Scissors**: Develop scissors that incorporate additional tools such as a ruler, a bottle opener, a small screwdriver, or even a mini flashlight within the handle. This would make the scissors a versatile tool for various tasks, ideal for DIY enthusiasts, students, or anyone who appreciates having multiple tools in one handy device.",
    "**Magnetic Blade Guards**: Introduce magnetic blade guards that can be attached to the scissors when not in use. These guards would prevent accidental cuts and protect the blades from damage. They could also be designed with a fun, colorful aesthetic, making them appealing to children and encouraging safe handling.",
    "**LED Light for Precision Cutting**: Integrate an LED light at the tip of the scissors to illuminate the cutting area. This would be particularly useful for intricate projects or in low-light conditions, allowing users to see exactly where they are cutting. The light could be powered by a small rechargeable battery and have an adjustable brightness setting."
