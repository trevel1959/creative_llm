    "Bartering: In the absence of currency, people would need to rely on bartering to trade goods and services. This would involve directly exchanging one item or service for another, with no middleman or exchange of money involved. For example, a farmer could trade fresh produce for a tailor's services, or a carpenter could trade a piece of furniture for a haircut.",
    "Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS): LETS are community-based systems that allow people to exchange goods and services without using money. In a LETS system, members of the communityearn credits by providing goods or services, which can then be used to purchase other goods or services from other members of the community.",
    "Gift Economy: In a gift economy, people give and receive goods and services without any expectation of reciprocation or payment. This could be done through the act of giving gifts, volunteering time or skills, or providing free goods or services to others.",
    "Cryptocurrency: While not technically currency, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could be used as a form of exchange in the absence of traditional currency. These digital currencies can be bought, sold, and traded like any other commodity, and could be used to purchase goods and services.",
    "Commodity-based exchange: In a commodity-based exchange, goods and services are traded directly for other goods and services, without the use of money. This could involve using physical goods like food, clothing, or tools as currency, or using services like cleaning, repair, or transportation as currency."
