    "Build a Solar-Powered Generator: Create a portable and easy-to-assemble solar-powered generator that can provide electricity for essential needs such as lighting, charging devices, and powering small appliances. The generator could be made using a combination of solar panels, batteries, and a compact inverter.",
    "Create a Wind-Powered Turbine: Design a wind-powered turbine that can generate electricity through the use of a small, portable turbine that can be placed in a window or on a rooftop. The turbine would use the wind to generate electricity, which could then be stored in batteries or used directly to power devices.",
    "Develop a Hydroelectric Power System: Utilize the energy of running water to generate electricity through the use of a small, portable hydroelectric power system. This could involve using a small turbine to generate electricity from the flow of water, which could then be stored in batteries or used directly to power devices.",
    "Use a Thermoelectric Generator: Develop a thermoelectric generator that can convert heat into electricity. This could involve using a small, portable generator that can be powered by a variety of heat sources, such as a candle, a small stove, or even body heat. The generator could be used to power small devices, such as a flashlight or a radio.",
    "Create a Kinetic Energy Harvester: Develop a kinetic energy harvester that can convert the motion of an object into electricity. This could involve using a small, portable device that can be attached to a moving object, such as a bicycle or a car, to generate electricity as the object moves. The electricity could then be stored in batteries or used directly to power devices."
