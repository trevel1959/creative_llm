    "**Ineffective Marketing Strategy:** A coffee shop in a highly competitive market needs a strong and unique marketing strategy to stand out. If the coffee shop relies on generic marketing tactics or fails to effectively communicate its unique selling points, it may struggle to attract customers and generate foot traffic.",
    "**Pricing Strategy:** In a competitive market, pricing can be a significant challenge. If the coffee shop sets prices too high, it may price itself out of the market, while if it sets prices too low, it may struggle to cover costs and generate profits.",
    "**Quality and Consistency of Products:** To compete with established coffee shops, a new entrant must ensure that its products meet high standards of quality and consistency. If the coffee shop fails to maintain these standards, it may damage its reputation and lose customers.",
    "**Lack of Unique Offerings:** To attract customers, a coffee shop must offer unique products or experiences. If the coffee shop simply replicates the offerings of its competitors, it may struggle to differentiate itself and gain a loyal customer base.",
    "**Location and Visibility:** The location of the coffee shop can significantly impact its visibility and accessibility. If the coffee shop is located in a poorly visible or hard-to-reach location, it may struggle to attract customers and generate foot traffic."
