    "\"Sky Dashers\" - A high-flying, intergalactic sport that combines elements of basketball, parkour, and zero-gravity simulation. Players would wear special suits that allow them to float and maneuver in mid-air, scoring points by dunking on opponents' baskets or completing trick jumps. The game would take place in a massive, enclosed arena with a dome-shaped ceiling, providing a truly weightless experience for players and spectators alike.",

    "\"Quantum Tag\" - A high-speed, high-tech version of tag that incorporates elements of parkour and hacking. Players would wear special suits that allow them to move at superhuman speeds and jump long distances, while also granting them the ability to hack into the game's AI system and manipulate the environment to gain an advantage. The game would take place in a massive, virtual environment that changes and evolves based on the players' actions, providing a constantly changing and challenging experience.",
    "\"Gravity Shifters\" - A sport that combines elements of gymnastics, dance, and zero-gravity simulation. Players would wear special suits that allow them to manipulate their body's gravity, allowing them to perform incredible acrobatic feats and defy the laws of physics. The game would take place in"
