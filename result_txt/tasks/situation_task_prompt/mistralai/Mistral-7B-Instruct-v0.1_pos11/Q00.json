    "Walk or cycle: If all cars were to suddenly stop working, one of the most straightforward ways to travel from one city to another would be to walk or cycle. While this may seem like a tedious and time-consuming option, it is a viable way to get from one place to another. You could pack a bag with essentials, such as food, water, and a map, and set off on your journey. If you need to cover a long distance, you could break your journey into smaller sections and rest along the way.",
    "Take public transportation: If you have access to public transportation, such as buses or trains, you could use these services to travel from one city to another. While this may not be the most convenient option, it is still a viable way to get around. You could check the schedules of the buses or trains and plan your journey accordingly.",

    "Rent a bike: If you have access to bike-sharing services, you could rent a bike to travel from one city to another.
