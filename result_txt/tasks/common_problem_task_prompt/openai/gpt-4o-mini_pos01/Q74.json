    "**Technical Malfunctions**: There is always the risk of technical malfunctions during the launch process. This can include failures in the rocket's engines, issues with the satellite's systems, or even problems with ground support equipment. Such malfunctions can lead to catastrophic failures, resulting in the loss of the satellite and the financial investment involved.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Launching a satellite requires compliance with various national and international regulations. This includes obtaining licenses from governmental bodies, ensuring adherence to safety protocols, and coordinating with air traffic control. Failure to navigate these regulatory hurdles can result in legal issues, fines, or delays in the launch schedule.",
    "**Space Debris Collision**: As the number of satellites in orbit increases, the risk of collision with space debris also rises. A satellite could be damaged or destroyed by colliding with defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, or other debris. This poses a significant risk to the satellite's operational integrity and can also contribute to the growing problem of space debris.",
    "**Communication Failures**: Once the satellite is in orbit, maintaining communication with it is crucial for its operation. Problems can arise due to issues with ground stations, signal interference, or unexpected satellite behavior. If communication is lost, it can hinder the satellite's ability to perform its functions, gather data, or respond to commands, potentially rendering it useless.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: The cost of launching a satellite can be significantly higher than initially anticipated due to unforeseen challenges, such as technical issues, delays, or changes in regulatory requirements. Budget overruns can strain resources and impact other projects, leading to difficult decisions about funding and priorities."
