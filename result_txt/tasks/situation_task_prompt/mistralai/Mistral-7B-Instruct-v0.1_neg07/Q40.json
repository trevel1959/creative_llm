    "Solar-Powered Devices: If all batteries stopped working, one of the most effective ways to power your devices would be to use solar panels. These panels can be attached to your devices and placed in direct sunlight to charge them. This would require some initial setup, but it would be a sustainable and eco-friendly solution.",
    "Kinetic Energy: Another option would be to use kinetic energy to power your devices. This could be done by attaching a small generator to your device that converts the energy generated by movement into electricity. This would require some initial setup as well, but it would be a useful solution for devices that you use frequently and often move around.",
    "Hand-Crank Generator: A hand-crank generator is a simple and effective way to generate electricity. You could attach one to your device and use it to power it when needed. This would require some initial setup, but it would be a useful solution for devices that you use infrequently.",
    "Wind Turbine: If you have access to a small wind turbine, you could use it to generate electricity to power your devices. This would require some initial setup, but it would be a useful solution for devices that you use frequently and often have access to a wind source.",
    "Thermoelectric Generator: A thermoelectric generator converts heat into electricity. You could attach one to your device and use it to power it when needed. This would require some initial setup, but it would be a useful solution for devices that you use frequently and often generate heat, such as laptops or smartphones."
