    "Use everyday objects: Musicians could experiment with objects commonly found in their environment, such as pots, pans, wooden objects, or metal items, to create percussive or melodic sounds. They might use these objects in unconventional ways to produce novel sounds.",
    "Vocal harmonies: In the absence of instruments, vocalists could create rich harmonies and melodies by singing in various styles, including a cappella, choral arrangements, or even beatboxing. This could lead to a focus on the human voice as the primary instrument.",
    "Electronic music: Musicians could turn to technology to create music. They could use software synthesizers, drum machines, or even create their own instruments using microcontrollers and sensors to create a wide range of sounds.",
    "Collaborate with dancers: Dancers could create music through movement, using the rhythm of their bodies to create a soundscape. They could use body percussion, vocalizations, or even use instruments like the didgeridoo, which is played by blowing into a pipe.",
    "Improvisation: Musicians could focus on improvisation, using their skills and creativity to invent new sounds and melodies on the spot. This could lead to a more spontaneous and unique form of music-making."
