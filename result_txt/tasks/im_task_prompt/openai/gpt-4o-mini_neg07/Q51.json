    "**Modular Design with Interchangeable Features**: Create a table assistant with a modular design where users can customize and swap out different components based on their needs. For example, one module could include a digital recipe book, while another could have a food scale, and another could serve as a Bluetooth speaker. This flexibility allows users to adapt the assistant to various activities, whether cooking, entertaining, or working.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop an AR-enabled table assistant that projects recipes, cooking instructions, or dining setups directly onto the table surface. Users could wear AR glasses or use a smartphone to visualize how to prepare a dish step-by-step, with virtual overlays guiding them through the process. This immersive experience would enhance cooking skills and make the process more engaging.",
    "**Health Monitoring and Nutrition Assistant**: Equip the table assistant with sensors that can analyze food items placed on it. This feature could provide nutritional information, suggest healthier alternatives, or even track dietary habits over time. Users could scan their meals to receive personalized health insights, helping them make informed choices about their eating habits.",
    "**Interactive Meal Planning and Grocery List Feature**: Introduce a meal planning function that allows users to input their dietary preferences, allergies, and available ingredients. The table assistant could then generate weekly meal plans and automatically create grocery lists based on those plans. This would streamline meal preparation and ensure users always have the necessary ingredients on hand.",
    "**Sustainable Waste Management Integration**: Design the table assistant to include a built-in composting system that encourages users to dispose of food scraps responsibly. The assistant could provide information on composting practices, track the amount of waste being composted, and even suggest recipes that utilize leftovers to minimize food waste. This feature would promote sustainability in the kitchen."
