    "**Interactive Trash Can Recycling System**: Create a smart trash can that uses AI to sort recyclables. The trash can could have sensors that detect the type of waste thrown in it (paper, plastic, glass, etc.) and sort them automatically into the appropriate bins. This system would reduce the workload for cleaning staff and encourage proper recycling by making it convenient.",
    "**Composting Trash Can**: Develop a composting trash can that breaks down organic waste using microorganisms. It could be designed with a vented lid to control the temperature and humidity necessary for decomposition. This idea promotes sustainable waste management by turning food scraps into nutrient-rich soil, reducing landfill waste, and potentially providing plants with beneficial nutrients.",
    "**Trash Can as a Personalized Reminder System**: Design a trash can with a digital display or smart app integration that reminds users to clean or empty it at specific times. It could also provide information on how full the can is, or alert users when it's time to replace a bag. This idea improves efficiency by keeping the environment cleaner and reminding people to manage their waste responsibly.",
    "**Smart Trash Can with Data Collection**: Create a smart trash can that collects data on the types and amounts of waste thrown away. This data could be used to inform environmental policies, monitor trends in waste production, and identify areas for waste reduction. It would also allow facilities managers to optimize waste collection schedules based on usage patterns.",
    "**Trash Can as a Community Engagement Hub**: Develop a trash can that serves as a community engagement tool. For example, it could have a slot where users can insert waste items for recycling or composting, and receive rewards points, discounts, or coupons for local businesses. This idea encourages community participation in waste management and promotes local commerce. Additionally, the trash can could have a digital screen displaying community news, events, or educational content about waste reduction and recycling."
