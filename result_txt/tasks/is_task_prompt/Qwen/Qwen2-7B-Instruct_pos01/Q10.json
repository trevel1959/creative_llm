    "**Invisible Architectural Structures**: Imagine a city where buildings are not just invisible but also dynamically change their shape and size based on the user's needs or environmental conditions. These structures could be created using advanced nanotechnology that allows materials to transform from one state to another, becoming invisible when needed and visible when required. For example, office buildings could expand during peak hours and contract at night to conserve space and energy. The confidence score for this idea is high (0.9) because it combines existing technologies (like nanomaterials) with creative urban planning concepts.",
    "**Invisible Public Services**: In this scenario, public services such as garbage collection, sewage treatment, and even street cleaning are conducted invisibly through the use of autonomous drones and robots. These machines operate silently and efficiently without human intervention, ensuring that the city remains clean and functional while being virtually unseen by the public. This idea has a moderate confidence score (0.7) due to the current technological limitations in creating fully autonomous and silent operations on a large scale.",
    "**Invisible Transportation Network**: Develop a city where transportation systems like subways, buses, and trains are completely hidden underground or within the building infrastructure, making them invisible to pedestrians and vehicles above. Passengers would enter through secret portals and be transported via high-speed tubes or tunnels. This concept is highly innovative and futuristic, with a confidence score of 0.8. It requires significant advancements in technology and infrastructure, which might not be feasible in the near future.",
    "**Invisible Educational Institutions**: Picture a city where schools and universities are not physically present but exist solely as digital platforms, allowing students to learn from anywhere in the world. This setup could enhance global collaboration and access to education, making learning more efficient and inclusive. The confidence score for this idea is medium-high (0.85) considering the ongoing digital transformation of education, although the complete elimination of physical classrooms presents challenges related to social interaction and community building.",
    "**Invisible Energy Infrastructure**: Envision a city powered entirely by invisible renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines embedded in the ground, solar panels hidden in the cityscape, and hydroelectric plants integrated into the cityâ€™s water supply system. This concept aims to create a sustainable and self-sufficient city with no visible signs of energy production. The confidence score for this idea is relatively low (0.6) because it requires significant technological innovation in energy storage and distribution, as well as the development of new materials that can efficiently capture and convert energy without being seen"
