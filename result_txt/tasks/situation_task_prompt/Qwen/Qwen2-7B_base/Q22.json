    "Water transportation: If roads were gone, water transportation could be a common way to move around. Barges, boats, and ferries could be used to transport people and goods between different parts of the city.",
    "Transportation on bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles: If roads were gone, people would have to turn to alternative forms of transportation. Bicycles and non-motorized vehicles could be used to move around the city, and special lanes could be created to make it easier for them to move around.",
    "Teleportation: If roads were gone, teleportation could be a way to move quickly between different places. People could be teleported to different locations using a device that utilizes a combination of quantum mechanics and other advanced technologies.",
    "Elevators and escalators: If roads were gone, elevators and escalators could be used to move people between different floors of tall buildings. This would be especially useful for moving people between high-rise buildings."
