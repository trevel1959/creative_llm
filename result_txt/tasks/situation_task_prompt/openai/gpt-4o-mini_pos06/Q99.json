    "**Shape and Silhouette Recognition**: Emphasize the importance of shapes and silhouettes to identify objects. Designers could create a catalog of silhouettes for commonly used items. For example, the silhouette of a chair is distinct from that of a table. Additionally, an augmented reality app could be developed that scans the environment and highlights the shapes of objects, helping people recognize them based on their outlines.",
    "**Pattern and Design**: Encourage the use of distinct patterns or designs on objects to aid recognition. For example, a polka-dotted mug could be differentiated from a striped one. This idea could be extended to clothing, where different fabrics and patterns become the primary means of identifying individuals and their belongings.",
    "**Sound Identification**: Create a system where objects produce unique sounds when interacted with. For instance, a metal object could have a distinct ringing sound, while a wooden object might produce a dull thud. This could be integrated into everyday items, with embedded sound-producing technology that activates upon touch or movement, helping individuals identify objects through auditory cues.",
    "**Height and Size Indicators**: Use size and height as a primary means of differentiation. Develop a standardized measurement system where objects are categorized by their dimensions. For instance, a short, wide object could be labeled differently than a tall, narrow one. This could be especially useful in environments like warehouses or libraries, where objects are often stacked or shelved.",
    "**Spatial Arrangement and Context**: Rely on the spatial arrangement of objects and their context to identify them. For example, if a fork is placed next to a plate, one can infer it is part of a dining set. Creating a system that educates people on contextual clues could enhance their ability to identify objects based on their surroundings and typical placements."
