    "**Interactive LED Candles**: Create candles that incorporate LED lights that mimic the flickering of a real flame. These candles could be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing users to adjust the brightness, color, and flicker speed to match their desired ambiance. They could also include a timer function to automatically turn on and off, simulating the look of a burning candle without the fire hazard.",
    "**Candle with Embedded Seeds**: Design eco-friendly candles that contain seeds embedded within the wax. Once the candle has burned down, users can plant the leftover wax and seeds in soil, allowing them to grow flowers or herbs. This not only adds a sustainable aspect to candle use but also provides a rewarding experience of nurturing plants after enjoying the candle.",
    "**Multi-Use Candle Holders**: Create candle holders that can be transformed into other useful items after the candle has burned down. For example, a candle holder could be designed to convert into a decorative vase or a small storage container. This encourages users to keep the holder long after the candle is gone, reducing waste and adding value to the product.",
    "**Mood-Reflecting Color Candles**: Develop a line of candles that change color based on the mood of the user. Using sensors that can detect heart rate or body temperature, the candle would shift colors to reflect emotionsâ€”calming blues for relaxation, energizing yellows for happiness, or deep reds for passion. This innovative feature can create a more personalized and immersive experience.",
    "**Sound-Enhancing Candles**: Introduce candles that are equipped with small speakers that play soothing sounds or music as they burn. These candles could have a selection of sounds such as crackling fire, ocean waves, or soft instrumental music, enhancing the sensory experience of candlelight. Users could connect their devices via Bluetooth to customize the soundscape according to their preference."
