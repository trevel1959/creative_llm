    "**Mood-Based Alarm Sounds**: Instead of a standard beep, the alarm clock could offer a selection of ambient sounds tailored to the user's mood or preferences. Users could choose from nature sounds, soft music, or even personalized playlists. The clock could also analyze the userâ€™s sleep patterns and suggest the best sounds to wake up to based on how restful their night was.",
    "**Interactive Sleep Coach**: Incorporate an AI-driven sleep coach into the alarm clock that provides personalized advice on improving sleep quality. The clock could track sleep patterns using built-in sensors and give recommendations on bedtime routines, optimal sleep durations, and even relaxation techniques, helping users to wake up more refreshed.",
    "**Wake-Up Yoga or Stretch Routine**: Transform the waking experience by integrating guided morning yoga or stretching routines into the alarm clock. At the set wake-up time, the clock could play a video or audio guide that encourages users to engage in a brief, invigorating session, promoting physical activity right from the start of the day.",
    "**Dual-Location Alarm**: For individuals who travel frequently or live in multiple locations, a dual-location alarm feature would allow users to set alarms for two different time zones. This could be particularly useful for those with work commitments in different regions, ensuring they wake up at the correct time without having to constantly adjust their alarm settings.",
    "**Sleep-Friendly Materials**: Design the alarm clock using sleep-friendly materials that minimize blue light exposure. Incorporating an ambient display that only emits warm, soft light during the night would help reduce eye strain and promote better sleep hygiene. Additionally, the clock could be covered in materials that absorb sound, reducing any disruptive noise during the night."
