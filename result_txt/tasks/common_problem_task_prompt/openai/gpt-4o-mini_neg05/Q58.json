    "**Integration with Existing Systems**: Multinational companies often have legacy systems and diverse IT environments. A common issue is the integration of the new cybersecurity solution with these existing systems. If the solution does not seamlessly integrate, it could create vulnerabilities or operational disruptions. This requires careful planning and possibly custom development to ensure compatibility and minimize risks.",
    "**Employee Training and Awareness**: A significant challenge in cybersecurity is the human factor. Employees may not be adequately trained to recognize phishing attempts or other cyber threats. If the solution does not include a comprehensive training program tailored to different regions and cultures, it may lead to a lack of awareness, increasing the risk of security breaches due to human error.",
    "**Resource Allocation Across Regions**: Different regions may have varying levels of cybersecurity resources and expertise. A potential problem could arise if the solution does not allocate resources effectively, leading to some regions being overprotected while others remain vulnerable. This imbalance can create a false sense of security and expose the company to risks in less-protected areas.",
    "**Incident Response and Recovery Plans**: In the event of a cyber attack, having a robust incident response plan is crucial. A common issue is that these plans may not be uniformly developed or tested across all regions. If one area has a well-defined response plan while another does not, the company could face significant delays and challenges in addressing incidents, leading to greater damage and loss.",
    "**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Multinational companies often rely on a complex network of suppliers and partners. A potential problem is that the cybersecurity solution may not adequately address vulnerabilities within the supply chain. If third-party vendors have weak security practices, it can expose the entire organization to risks. A comprehensive assessment of all partnersâ€™ cybersecurity measures is essential to mitigate this issue."
