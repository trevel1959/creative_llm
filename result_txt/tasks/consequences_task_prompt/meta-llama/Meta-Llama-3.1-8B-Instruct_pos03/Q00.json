    "**Mass Hysteria and Chaos**: Without sleep, people would be perpetually fatigued, leading to a significant decrease in productivity and cognitive function. This would result in a massive breakdown of societal structures, including the economy, healthcare, and emergency services. The constant exhaustion would also lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and mood swings, causing widespread conflict and social unrest. As people become more desperate and frustrated, they might turn to extreme measures, such as violence or self-destructive behavior, to cope with their circumstances.",
    "**Unprecedented Scientific Breakthroughs**: On the other hand, the sudden loss of sleep could lead to an explosion of scientific discoveries and innovations. Without the constraints of a traditional sleep schedule, scientists and researchers might work around the clock, fueled by caffeine and determination. This could result in groundbreaking discoveries in fields like medicine, physics, and technology, as the constant pressure to innovate drives individuals to push the boundaries of human knowledge.",
    "**Evolutionary Adaptation**: As humans struggle to cope with the loss of sleep, natural selection might kick in, driving the evolution of new adaptations to help the species survive. For example, humans might develop larger eyes to compensate for the constant need for visual stimulation, or their brains might undergo changes to optimize energy efficiency and reduce the need for sleep. This could lead to a new generation of humans with unique physical and cognitive characteristics, better suited to their sleepless environment.",
    "**Shift in Cultural and Social Norms**: The loss of sleep would require a fundamental shift in how society operates. Traditional notions of work-life balance, social etiquette, and personal relationships would need to be reevaluated. New norms and customs would emerge, such as designated \"rest\" areas or \"sleep pods\" where individuals could recharge, and a new appreciation for the value of sleep would be developed. This could lead to a more efficient and productive society, but also one that values individuality and creativity over traditional notions of rest and relaxation.",
    "**Global Pandemic and Mass Migration**: Without sleep, people would be more susceptible to illness and infection, as their weakened immune systems would struggle to fight off diseases. This could lead to a global pandemic, as the lack of sleep would make people more vulnerable to disease transmission. As a result, mass migration and refugee crises might occur as people flee areas with high disease rates, leading to social, economic, and humanitarian crises on a global scale. The sudden loss of sleep would also exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities,"
