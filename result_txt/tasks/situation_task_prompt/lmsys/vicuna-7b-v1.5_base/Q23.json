    "Write with a stylus pen: A stylus pen is a small, handheld pen that is designed to be used with touch screens. If all pens and pencils disappeared, one could use a stylus pen to write on electronic devices, such as tablets or smartphones. Stylus pens are available in a variety of sizes and styles, and can be easily stored in a notebook or pouch.",
    "Write with a chalkboard marker: If all pens and pencils disappeared, one could use a chalkboard marker to write on a chalkboard or whiteboard. Chalkboard markers are similar to regular markers, but are designed to work on chalkboard or whiteboard surfaces. They provide a bold and vibrant writing experience, and are easy to erase with a damp cloth or eraser.",
    "Write with a laser pointer: A laser pointer is a small, handheld device that emits a beam of light. If all pens and pencils disappeared, one could use a laser pointer to write by projecting the beam of light onto a surface. This method would require a stable surface to write on, such as a table or wall, and would not be practical for long-form writing.",
    "Write with a crayon: If all pens and pencils disappeared, one could use a crayon to write. Crayons are available in a variety of colors and sizes, and provide a simple and fun writing experience. They are ideal for drawing and coloring, but may not be the best choice for long-form writing, as they can be difficult to control and may smudge.",
    "Write with a pencil eraser: If all pens and pencils disappeared, one could use a pencil eraser to write. Pencil erasers are designed to erase pencil marks, and can be used to write by rubbing them against the surface. This method would require a stable surface to write on, and may not be practical for long-form writing, as it can be difficult to control the eraser and may leave marks on the surface."
