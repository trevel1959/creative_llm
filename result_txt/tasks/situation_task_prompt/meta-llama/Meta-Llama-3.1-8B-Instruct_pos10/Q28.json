    "**Digital Canvas**: I'd utilize a digital canvas, such as a large touchscreen display or a virtual whiteboard, to record important information. This would allow me to create digital notes, sketches, and diagrams, which could be easily shared and accessed across devices. I could also use digital tools like styluses, tablets, or even voice-to-text functionality to capture information.",
    "**Smart Glass**: I'd employ smart glass technology, which would enable me to write or draw on a transparent surface using a special stylus. This would allow me to create digital notes that could be easily erased and reused, while also providing a seamless and intuitive experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Markers**: I'd use AR markers, such as QR codes or NFC tags, to record and store information. By scanning these markers, I could access digital content, notes, or even 3D models, providing a unique and interactive way to capture and share information.",
    "**Holographic Displays**: I'd utilize holographic displays to record and display information in a 3D environment. This would enable me to create holographic notes, diagrams, or even 3D models, which could be viewed from multiple angles and perspectives, providing a more immersive and engaging experience.",
    "**Neural Interface**: I'd explore the use of neural interfaces, which would allow me to record and store information directly in my brain. This would enable me to capture and recall information with unprecedented speed and accuracy, while also providing a seamless and intuitive experience."
