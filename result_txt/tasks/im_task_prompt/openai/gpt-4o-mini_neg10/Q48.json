    "**Interactive LED Key Feedback**: Integrate LED lights into the keys of the piano that illuminate in different colors based on the notes being played or the rhythm of the music. This feature could help beginners learn to play by visually guiding them through songs. Advanced players could use it for practice, as the lights could change based on tempo or even highlight areas that need improvement, creating a dynamic and engaging practice environment.",
    "**Piano with Adaptive Learning System**: Create a piano that incorporates AI to adapt to the player’s skill level. As the player practices, the piano could analyze their performance and adjust the difficulty of the songs or exercises presented. It could suggest specific practice routines tailored to the player's strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that every practice session is productive and engaging.",
    "**Mood-Responsive Piano**: Design a piano that can change its sound and style based on the player's mood or the ambiance of the room. Using sensors that detect heart rate or voice tone, the piano could switch between different presets—classical, jazz, ambient, etc.—to match the emotional state of the player. This feature could encourage creativity by allowing musicians to explore different genres without changing instruments.",
    "**Piano with Built-in Composition Tools**: Develop a piano that includes a touchscreen interface for composing music directly on the instrument. Users could drag and drop musical elements, create loops, and layer sounds. The piano could also offer a variety of virtual instruments to experiment with, enabling users to compose complex pieces without needing extensive music theory knowledge.",
    "**Portable Mini-Piano with Recording Capabilities**: Create a compact, lightweight mini-piano that can be easily transported. This piano would have built-in recording features, allowing musicians to capture their performances on the go. Users could sync their recordings to a mobile app for editing, sharing, or collaboration with other musicians. This portable option would cater to busy individuals who want to practice and create music anywhere."
