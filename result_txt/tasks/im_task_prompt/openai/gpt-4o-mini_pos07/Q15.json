    "**Modular Compartment System**: Design a backpack with interchangeable compartments that can be easily swapped out depending on the user's needs. These compartments could be specialized for different activitiesâ€”like a tech compartment with padded slots for electronics, a gym compartment with a waterproof pocket for sweaty clothes, or a travel compartment with organized space for toiletries and travel documents. Users could customize their backpack for specific outings.",
    "**Solar Charging Panels**: Incorporate lightweight solar panels into the exterior of the backpack that can charge devices on the go. This feature would be particularly beneficial for hikers, campers, or students who spend long hours outdoors or away from power sources. The panels could be flexible and foldable, ensuring they don't add significant weight or bulk to the backpack.",
    "**Built-in Safety Features**: Equip the backpack with safety features such as reflective strips for visibility at night, a built-in alarm system that can be activated if the bag is tampered with, and a GPS tracker that connects to a smartphone app. This would provide peace of mind for users in urban environments or when traveling alone.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Dynamic Support**: Create a backpack with an ergonomic design that includes a dynamic support system. This could involve adjustable straps that conform to the user's body shape and weight distribution, reducing strain on the back and shoulders. Additionally, it could feature a built-in lumbar support that adjusts based on the load and the user's posture.",
    "**Hydration Integration**: Develop a backpack that includes a built-in hydration system with a detachable water reservoir and a flexible tube for easy sipping while on the move. The reservoir could be insulated to keep water cool for longer periods. Additionally, a small compartment could be included for hydration tablets or flavorings, encouraging users to stay hydrated without the hassle of carrying separate bottles."
