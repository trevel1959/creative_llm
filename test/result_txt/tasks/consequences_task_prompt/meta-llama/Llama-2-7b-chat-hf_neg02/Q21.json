    "Resource-based economy: Without money, people would rely on bartering and trading goods and services. This could lead to a more efficient allocation of resources as people would only produce and consume what they need, rather than producing and consuming more than they need to accumulate wealth.",
    "Alternative forms of currency: Communities could create their own local currencies, tied to the value of local resources, like food, shelter, or labor. This would encourage local economic activity and reduce the need for long-distance trade.",
    "Time banking: People could trade time and skills rather than money. This would promote mutual aid and community support, as people would be more likely to help each other out in exchange for their own needs being met.",
    "Gift economies: People could give goods and services to each other without expectation of payment or reciprocity. This would foster a sense of generosity and community, as people would be motivated by a desire to help each other rather than a need for financial gain.",
    "Resource-based gift economies: A combination of time banking and gift economies, where people trade goods and services without expectation of payment, but also without the need to reciprocate. This would create a system where resources are shared freely and everyone's needs are met."
