    "**Evolutionary Shift**: With the ability to regenerate limbs like starfish, humans might undergo a significant evolutionary shift. Our species could adapt to a more resilient and dynamic form, leading to a reevaluation of traditional societal structures, such as healthcare and education. We might prioritize regenerative biology over traditional medicine, and our concept of \"disability\" could be redefined.",
    "**Economic and Social Impact**: Regenerative limbs could revolutionize industries such as manufacturing, construction, and emergency services. People could work in hazardous environments without fear of injury, leading to increased productivity and reduced costs. However, this could also lead to a surplus of labor, potentially causing economic instability and social unrest.",
    "**Psychological and Emotional Effects**: The ability to regenerate limbs could profoundly impact our emotional and psychological well-being. People might feel invincible, leading to reckless behavior and a decrease in empathy for those who are not able to regenerate. On the other hand, it could also foster a sense of community and support, as people would be more willing to help others in need.",
    "**Ethical and Moral Implications**: Regenerative limbs would raise complex ethical and moral questions. For instance, would it be morally justifiable to regenerate limbs for cosmetic purposes, or would it be considered a form of vanity? Additionally, who would have access to this technology, and would it exacerbate existing social inequalities?",
    "**New Forms of Art and Expression**: The ability to regenerate limbs could inspire new forms of art, music, and performance. People might use their regenerative abilities to create innovative and dynamic forms of self-expression, blurring the lines between art and technology. This could lead to a new era of creative exploration and innovation."
