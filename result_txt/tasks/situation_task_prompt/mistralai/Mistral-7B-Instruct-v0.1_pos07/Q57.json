    "Underwater Cities: With the rise of ocean levels, it may become necessary to build underwater cities. These cities could be designed with advanced technology to withstand the pressure of the ocean and provide a sustainable living environment. People could live in these cities and work in the underwater industries, such as aquaculture, mining, and engineering.",
    "Floating Islands: Another option could be to create floating islands in the ocean. These islands could be built using advanced materials and technology, and they could be designed to be self-sustaining and environmentally friendly. People could live on these islands and work in the surrounding ocean, such as fishing and marine biology.",
    "Oceanic Tunnels: Another idea could be to build tunnels under the ocean floor to create a network of underground cities. These cities could be designed to be self-contained and self-sufficient, with their own power and water supplies. People could live in these cities and work in the surrounding ocean, such as mining and oil exploration.",
    "Underwater Habitats: Another option could be to create underwater habitats for people to live in. These habitats could be designed to mimic the natural environment of the ocean and provide a sustainable living environment. People could live in these habitats and work in the surrounding ocean, such as fishing and marine biology.",
    "Oceanic Farming: Another idea could be to use the ocean as a platform for farming. This could involve building large underwater farms to grow crops and raise livestock in the ocean. People could live in nearby cities and work in the ocean, such as fishing and marine biology."
