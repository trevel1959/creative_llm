    "**Self-Driving Car Experience Platform**: Develop a subscription-based platform that allows users to rent self-driving cars for a day or a weekend. This platform would provide a unique experience for those who want to test the technology without committing to buying a self-driving car. The platform could include various packages, such as a \"city tour\" or a \"road trip\" package, with different self-driving cars available for each experience. This would allow users to explore the capabilities of self-driving cars in a safe and controlled environment.",
    "**Autonomous Vehicle Racing League**: Create a professional racing league where self-driving cars compete against each other in a series of high-speed tracks. This would be a thrilling spectator sport, with real-time data and analytics displayed on screens around the track. The league could also include a \"driverless driver\" challenge, where human drivers are paired with self-driving cars to see who can navigate the track the fastest.",
    "**Self-Driving Car Taxi Service**: Develop a taxi service that uses self-driving cars to transport passengers. This would be especially useful in areas with heavy traffic or limited parking. The service could also include a \"shared ride\" option, where multiple passengers are transported together in the same self-driving car, reducing the number of vehicles on the road.",
    "**Autonomous Delivery Service**: Create a delivery service that uses self-driving cars to transport packages and groceries. This would be especially useful for elderly or disabled individuals who may have difficulty shopping or receiving deliveries. The service could also include a \"same-day delivery\" option, where packages are delivered within a few hours of ordering.",
    "**Self-Driving Car Tour Company**: Develop a tour company that offers guided tours of cities and attractions using self-driving cars. This would provide a unique and safe way for tourists to explore new places without worrying about driving or parking. The company could also include special packages, such as a \"foodie tour\" or a \"history tour,\" with self-driving cars equipped with special features and amenities to enhance the experience.
