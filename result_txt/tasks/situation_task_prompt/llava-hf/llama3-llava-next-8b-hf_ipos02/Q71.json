    "Vertical Gardening: Implement vertical gardening techniques, where plants are grown upwards on walls or other structures, utilizing the space above the hard ground. This method can help maximize space and make use of otherwise unused areas. It can also be aesthetically pleasing and can provide a natural barrier or windbreak.",
    "Geodesic Domes: Build geodesic domes or similar structures on stilts to create a raised growing space. These structures can be made from materials like wood, metal, or plastic, and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the plants and the climate.",
    "Tower Gardens: Construct tower gardens, where multiple levels of growing space are stacked vertically, allowing for a greater volume of soil and plants in a smaller footprint. These structures can be made from materials like PVC pipes, and can be designed to include a water reservoir at the bottom.",
    "A-frame Planters: Build A-frame planters that can be placed on the hard ground, providing a raised growing space for plants. These planters can be made from materials like wood or metal, and can be designed to include drainage systems and water reservoirs.",
    "Inverted Growing: Create inverted growing spaces, where plants are grown upside down on a support structure. This method can help with soil erosion and can provide better access to sunlight and air circulation for the roots. It can also help with pest control, as pests may find it more difficult to access plants grown in this manner."
