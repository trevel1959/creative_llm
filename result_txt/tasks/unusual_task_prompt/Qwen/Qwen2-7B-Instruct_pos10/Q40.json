    "**Personalized Cookie Jar Molding Workshop**: Offer a hands-on workshop where participants can create their own unique cookie jars. Use clay or polymer clay to mold the jars into various shapes, such as animals, cartoon characters, or even abstract designs. Each participant will get to decorate their jar using paint or other artistic materials. The event could include a professional baker who demonstrates how to bake cookies that fit perfectly into the custom-made jars.",
    "**Cookie Jar Time Capsule**: Organize an event where people bring in their old cookie jars and fill them with cookies baked for the occasion. These jars then become time capsules, sealed with messages about the event and the year it took place. Attendees receive new cookie jars to take home, which they can use for storing cookies or other treats, and also serve as a reminder of the shared experience. This activity fosters a sense of community and nostalgia.",
    "**Cookie Jar Art Competition**: Host a competition where participants submit their most creative cookie jars. Entries can be judged based on originality, craftsmanship, and overall aesthetic appeal. The winner receives a grand prize, such as a gift card to a gourmet bakery or kitchenware store. This encourages creativity and artistic expression, while also promoting local businesses.",
    "**Cookie Jar Recipe Book**: Collaborate with local bakers and chefs to create a cookbook featuring recipes specifically designed to be baked in cookie jars. Include instructions on how to customize the recipes to fit different types of jars. The book could be sold at the event, and proceeds could go towards a charity of choice. This idea combines culinary skills with DIY projects, offering a useful product for attendees.",
    "**Cookie Jar Scavenger Hunt**: Create a scavenger hunt where participants must find hidden cookie jars around a specific area (like a park, mall, or town square). Each jar contains clues leading to the next one, ultimately revealing a secret location or event. Along the way, participants collect cookies from the jars they find. This interactive event is perfect for families and groups, promoting teamwork and exploration."
