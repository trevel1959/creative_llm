To address this, the organizing committee could establish a dedicated logistics team that creates a detailed travel plan and has contingency measures in place, such as backup transportation options and a 24/7 help desk.",
    "**Security Concerns**: High-profile events often attract attention, which can pose security risks. Threats may range from protests to targeted attacks. To enhance safety, a comprehensive security plan should be developed, involving local law enforcement and private security firms, as well as thorough vetting of all attendees and staff.",

To overcome this, pre-summit consultations could be held to gather input from all stakeholders, allowing for a more balanced agenda that addresses the most pressing issues for all parties involved.",

Organizers should prepare by conducting thorough technical rehearsals and having backup systems in place, such as printed materials and alternative communication methods, to ensure the summit runs smoothly.",
