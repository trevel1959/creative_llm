    "Duality-based daily routine: To adapt to only using my non-dominant hand for a month, I would create a daily routine that incorporates both hands. For example, I would brush my teeth with my left hand in the morning and my right hand at night. This would allow me to maintain good oral hygiene while still challenging myself to use my non-dominant hand.",
    "Mindfulness through arts and crafts: To cope with the frustration of not being able to use my dominant hand, I would engage in various creative activities like drawing, painting, or knitting. These activities would help me develop a sense of mindfulness and focus, which could be therapeutic in nature. I could also create art pieces that represent my journey and the challenges I face.",
    "One-handed cooking classes: To adapt to cooking with only one hand, I would organize cooking classes that cater to people with disabilities. These classes would focus on teaching individuals how to prepare simple meals using their non-dominant hand. This would not only help me adapt to my new situation but also provide a platform for others to learn and grow.",
    "One-handed sports training: To stay physically active while adapting to only using my non-dominant hand, I would seek out sports training programs that cater to individuals with disabilities. These programs would focus on teaching me new sports techniques that can be performed with one hand, such as wheelchair basketball or hand cycling. This would not only help me stay active but also provide a sense of accomplishment and community.",
    "Virtual reality rehabilitation: To adapt to my new reality, I would explore the use of virtual reality (VR) technology for rehabilitation. VR can provide a simulated environment that mimics real-world situations, allowing me to practice daily tasks and activities without the limitations of my physical body. For example, I could use VR to practice cooking, cleaning, or even using a computer with my non-dominant hand. This would help me regain lost skills and build confidence in my abilities."
