    "**Innovative Eco-Lodging**: Create a series of eco-friendly accommodations within the park that are designed to minimize their environmental impact. These could include treehouses made from sustainable materials, geodesic domes powered by renewable energy sources, or even underwater bungalows in nearby lakes or rivers. This idea would attract eco-conscious tourists and create an immersive experience that educates visitors about sustainable living.",
    "**Interactive Education Trails**: Develop a series of interactive trails that incorporate augmented reality (AR) technology. At each station along the trail, visitors can use their smartphones or AR glasses to learn more about the flora and fauna, engage in virtual reality experiences, or participate in interactive games that teach them about conservation efforts and the importance of preserving biodiversity.",
    "**Sustainable Food and Beverage Offerings**: Establish a farm-to-table restaurant that sources ingredients directly from local farmers within the park and its surrounding areas. This initiative would not only provide fresh, organic meals but also support the local economy. Additionally, offer cooking classes where visitors can learn how to prepare traditional dishes using locally sourced ingredients, further promoting sustainable eating habits.",
    "**Nature-based Wellness Retreats**: Launch a series of retreats that focus on health and wellness activities inspired by nature. These could include yoga sessions in the forest, meditation by a serene lake, guided hikes through the park, and workshops on natural healing practices like herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Participants would leave feeling rejuvenated and with a deeper connection to nature.",
    "**Conservation Research Station**: Partner with universities or research institutions to establish a station within the park where students and scientists can conduct research on various ecological issues. This station could host internships, volunteer opportunities, and public lectures to educate the community about ongoing conservation efforts and the scientific methods used to protect endangered species and ecosystems."
