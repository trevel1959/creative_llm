    "**Inflatable Pillow**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be inflated to your desired comfort level. It can be made from durable, lightweight material like nylon or polyester, and come with a small pump for easy inflation. This pillow can be rolled up and carried around, making it perfect for camping trips, long flights, or even office naps.",
    "**Customizable Pillow**: Create a pillow with multiple compartments where you can add or remove stuffing based on your preference. It could have varying densities for different parts of the head and neck, providing targeted support. This way, if you are uncomfortable, you can adjust the pillow to suit your needs.",
    "**Heated Pillow**: Develop a pillow with built-in heating elements that can be controlled by a remote or a smartphone app. This is particularly useful during colder months when traditional pillows may not provide enough warmth. The heat can help relax muscles and promote better sleep.",
    "**Pillow with Earphones**: Combine a comfortable pillow with a set of earphones or headphones. This pillow would have a compartment where you can place your device, and the earphones would be integrated into the pillow fabric. This way, you can listen to music or podcasts without having to worry about cords or disturbing others.",
    "**Airflow Pillow**: Design a pillow with breathable materials that allow air to flow through, keeping your head cool during the night. This could involve using mesh fabrics or perforated foam that promotes ventilation. Additionally, it could include a cooling gel or other temperature-regulating technologies to ensure optimal comfort throughout the night."
