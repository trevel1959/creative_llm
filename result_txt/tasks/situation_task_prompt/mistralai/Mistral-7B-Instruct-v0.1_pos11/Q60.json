    "Bartering: Without currency, people would need to find alternative ways to exchange goods and services. One possible solution is to revert to a bartering system, where people trade goods or services directly with each other. This could involve negotiating a fair exchange value for each item or service, and then completing the trade.",
    "Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS): LETS are community-based systems that facilitate the exchange of goods and services without the use of money. Members of a LETS network can trade goods and services with each other, and settle the accounts using a local currency that is not tied to the wider economy.",
    "Cryptocurrency: While not a traditional form of currency, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum could still be used as a means of exchange. These digital currencies are decentralized and operate independently of traditional financial systems, making them a potential alternative to traditional currency.",
    "Gift Economy: In a gift economy, people give and receive goods and services without expecting any payment or exchange of value. This could be a viable solution in a world without currency, as people could still contribute to the community by sharing their skills and resources.",
    "Time Banking: Time banking is a system where people can exchange skills and services with each other, based on the amount of time they spend helping each other. This could be a useful way to trade goods and services in a world without currency, as people could offer their time and skills in exchange for goods or services they need."
