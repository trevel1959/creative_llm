    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Create a hair dryer made from sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics or recycled metals. Additionally, incorporate energy-efficient technology that reduces power consumption while maintaining high performance. The dryer could feature a \"green mode\" that limits energy use during operation, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Dual Functionality**: Design a hair dryer that doubles as a styling tool. The nozzle could be interchangeable with different styling attachments like curling wands or straightening plates. This would eliminate the need for multiple devices, saving space and making it easier for users to achieve various hairstyles with one tool.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Implement advanced noise-canceling technology to create a quieter hair dryer. This could involve using sound-dampening materials and innovative fan designs to minimize operational noise. A quieter dryer would enhance the user experience, particularly for those who use it early in the morning or late at night.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Feature**: Introduce a self-cleaning mechanism that uses UV light or a specialized cleaning solution to disinfect the internal components of the hair dryer. This would not only maintain the performance of the device but also ensure that it remains hygienic over time, addressing concerns about dust and bacteria accumulation.",
    "**Portable and Travel-Friendly Design**: Develop a compact, foldable hair dryer with a built-in power converter for international use. This would allow travelers to pack it easily without taking up much space in their luggage. The dryer could also include a dual voltage setting, making it suitable for use in different countries without needing additional adapters."
