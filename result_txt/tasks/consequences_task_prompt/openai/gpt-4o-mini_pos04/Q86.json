    "**Ecosystem Collapse**: With the absence of sunlight, photosynthesis would cease, leading to the collapse of ecosystems dependent on plants. This would trigger a chain reaction affecting herbivores, carnivores, and the entire food web. Many species would struggle to adapt to the sudden darkness and extreme cold, leading to biodiversity loss and potential extinction events.",
    "**Psychological Impact on Humans**: The sudden disappearance of the sun would have profound psychological effects on humanity. The darkness and cold would create a sense of despair and fear, leading to panic and chaos in cities as people struggle to adapt. Mental health issues could spike, with increased anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation as the world becomes a cold, dark place.",
    "**Technological and Energy Crisis**: A month without the sun would cause a massive energy crisis. Solar power systems would become inoperative, and reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy would surge. However, the lack of sunlight would also disrupt many technological systems that rely on solar energy, leading to blackouts and failures in communication systems, transportation, and food supply chains.",
    "**Changes in Weather Patterns**: The absence of solar energy would drastically alter weather patterns. Without the sun's heat, atmospheric circulation would change, potentially leading to extreme weather phenomena once the sun returned. This could include violent storms, prolonged winters, or other unpredictable climate changes, as the Earth would need time to stabilize after the month-long absence of solar energy.",
    "**Impact on Agriculture**: Agriculture would face catastrophic consequences as crops would die off without sunlight. Farmers would be unable to grow food, leading to food shortages and potential famine. This would force societies to rethink their agricultural practices, possibly leading to a greater reliance on indoor farming and artificial light sources, which could become a new norm in post-sun disappearance society."
