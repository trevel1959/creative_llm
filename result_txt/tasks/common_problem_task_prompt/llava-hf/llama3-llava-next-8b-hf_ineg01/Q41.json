    "Life Support Systems: Ensuring that the spacecraft has a reliable and efficient life support system is crucial. This includes air, water, and food supplies, as well as waste management systems. Any failure in the life support system could lead to the death of the crew.",
    "Navigation and Communication: A reliable navigation and communication system is essential for the safe and successful operation of the spacecraft. Any malfunction or loss of communication could lead to disorientation and isolation.",
    "Radiation Protection: Space is filled with radiation, and the spacecraft must be designed to protect its occupants from harmful radiation. This can be achieved through the use of shielding materials or by designing the spacecraft to rotate or move to minimize exposure.",
    "Environmental Factors: The spacecraft must be designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and lack of gravity. This can be achieved through the use of specialized materials and design techniques.",
    "Emergency Procedures: The spacecraft must be equipped with emergency procedures and equipment in case of any unforeseen incidents or accidents. This includes emergency escape pods, first aid kits, and emergency communication systems."
