    "Create a line of Snoring Sun-themed merchandise, such as t-shirts, mugs, and phone cases, with funny slogans like \"Wake me up when it's sunny\" or \"The Snoring Sun: Bringing light to your slumber.\"",
    "Develop a mobile app that uses the Snoring Sun as a metaphor for life, with levels and challenges that help users overcome obstacles and stay motivated. For example, users could \"wake up\" from a level by completing a task or challenge, and the app could offer rewards and encouragement along the way.",
    "Host a \"Snoring Sun Festival\" where people can come together to celebrate the quirky side of life. The festival could include activities like a \"Snore-a-thon\" where participants try to see who can snore the loudest, a \"Sun-themed\" costume contest, and games and activities that incorporate the idea of the Snoring Sun.",
    "Create a series of short animations or comics that feature the Snoring Sun as a character, exploring different scenarios where it helps people overcome challenges or find inspiration. For example, one animation could show the Snoring Sun helping a student stay awake during a boring lecture, while another could show it motivating an athlete to push through a tough workout.",
    "Develop a \"Snoring Sun\"-themed escape room where participants have to solve puzzles and challenges to \"wake up\" the Snoring Sun and escape the room. The room could be decorated to resemble a cozy bedroom, with elements of sunlight and warmth incorporated into the design. As participants progress through the room, they could encounter different challenges that require them to think creatively and work together to overcome."
