    "**Natural Ingredients Approach**: I would create my own grooming products using natural ingredients that are safe and effective. For instance, using coconut oil for moisturizing skin and hair, baking soda as a gentle exfoliant, and essential oils like lavender or tea tree for their soothing and antibacterial properties. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**DIY Grooming Tools**: Instead of relying on store-bought products, I would use DIY tools for grooming tasks such as shaving, facial hair trimming, and nail care. For example, using a safety razor for shaving, electric beard trimmers for maintaining facial hair, and homemade sugar scrubs for exfoliating skin. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Adopting Traditional Techniques**: I would incorporate traditional grooming methods used in different cultures into my routine. This could include using herbs and spices (like turmeric or coffee) for skincare, learning about traditional barber techniques, or practicing ancient practices like Ayurvedic hair care rituals. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Minimalist Approach**: By simplifying my grooming routine, I would reduce the need for products. This could involve focusing on a few essential items like a high-quality brush for styling hair, a good quality toothbrush and toothpaste for oral hygiene, and perhaps a natural deodorant. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Community Sharing**: I would collaborate with others who have also stopped using cosmetic products to share tips, recipes, and DIY solutions for grooming. This community might offer support, resources, and new ideas, helping to innovate and refine my own approach. Confidence Score: 0.8"
