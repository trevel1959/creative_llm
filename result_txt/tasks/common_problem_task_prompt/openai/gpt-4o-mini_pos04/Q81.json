    "**Budget Constraints**: Organizing a film festival can be costly, and staying within budget is crucial. Problems may arise from unexpected expenses, such as higher-than-anticipated venue rental fees, equipment rental costs, or promotional expenses. Additionally, if ticket sales do not meet expectations, the festival may struggle to cover its costs, leading to potential cancellations or a scaled-down event.",
    "**Film Submission Issues**: Managing film submissions can be a logistical nightmare. Problems could include a lack of quality films submitted, late submissions, or films that do not meet the festival's criteria. Furthermore, if there are too many submissions, the selection committee may face challenges in adequately reviewing and choosing films, leading to delays in the announcement of the official lineup.",
    "**Scheduling Conflicts**: Creating a screening schedule that accommodates all selected films while avoiding overlaps can be challenging. Potential issues include conflicts with other local events, which could affect attendance, or scheduling films of similar genres back-to-back, leading to audience fatigue. Additionally, accommodating filmmaker Q&A sessions can complicate scheduling further.",
    "**Marketing and Promotion Difficulties**: Effectively promoting the festival is vital for attracting attendees and filmmakers. Problems may arise from insufficient marketing strategies, limited budget for advertising, or competition with other events. Additionally, failure to engage with the target audience through social media or community outreach can result in low ticket sales and poor attendance.",
    "**Technical Glitches During Screenings**: Technology can be unpredictable, and problems such as equipment malfunctions, software issues, or power outages can disrupt screenings. Ensuring that all technical aspects are functioning properly before the event is essential, but last-minute glitches can still occur, potentially frustrating both filmmakers and attendees."
