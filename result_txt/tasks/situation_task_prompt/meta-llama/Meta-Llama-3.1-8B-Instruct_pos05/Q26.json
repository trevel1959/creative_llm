    "**Innovation of a Self-Sustaining Compass**: Develop a wristwatch-like device that utilizes a miniature gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometers to create a self-sustaining compass. This device would be powered by a long-lasting battery and could be recharged wirelessly. The compass would be able to detect the Earth's magnetic field and provide directional guidance, even in areas with high levels of magnetic interference. The device could also be integrated with a map app, allowing users to navigate through unfamiliar territories.",
    "**Utilizing Plant Life for Navigation**: Study the unique properties of certain plant species that grow in a specific direction, such as sunflowers that grow towards the sun. Develop a device that can detect these properties and use them as a navigation aid. This device could be a small, portable sensor that attaches to a plant and provides directional guidance based on the plant's growth pattern.",
    "**Crowdsourced Navigation**: Develop a social navigation app that relies on crowdsourced information. Users would report their location and provide directions to nearby landmarks or points of interest. The app would use machine learning algorithms to create a comprehensive map of the area, allowing users to navigate through unfamiliar territories. The app could also include features such as user reviews and ratings to help users make informed decisions about their route.",
    "**Infrared Navigation**: Develop a device that uses infrared sensors to detect the unique thermal signatures of buildings and landmarks. This device would be able to detect the thermal signature of a building and provide directional guidance, even in areas with dense foliage or heavy fog. The device could be integrated with a map app, allowing users to navigate through unfamiliar territories.",
    "**Biometric Navigation**: Develop a device that uses biometric data, such as heart rate and skin conductance, to detect a user's emotional state and provide navigation guidance. For example, the device could detect when a user is feeling anxious or lost and provide a calming message or a suggested route to a nearby landmark. The device could also be integrated with a map app, allowing users to navigate through unfamiliar territories while also monitoring their emotional state."
