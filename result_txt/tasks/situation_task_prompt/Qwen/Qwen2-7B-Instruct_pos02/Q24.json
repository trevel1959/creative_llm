    "**Enhanced Augmented Reality (AR) Technology**: With glasses and contact lenses disappearing, people could adapt using advanced AR technology. This involves developing a device that could be worn on the head like a headset or be integrated into existing eyewear. The device would use sophisticated cameras to capture the environment around the user, and then overlay virtual images on the real world. For those with poor vision, this could involve larger text sizes, clearer fonts, and enhanced color contrast, making it easier for them to read signs, menus, or even recognize faces.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses**: Another innovative solution could be the development of smart contact lenses. These lenses would be equipped with tiny sensors and microchips that can directly interface with the brain. They could detect visual information and convert it into neural signals that are transmitted to the brain, essentially bypassing the eyes. This would allow users to see with high clarity without the need for physical lenses. ",
    "**Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Environments**: People with poor vision could immerse themselves in VR environments designed specifically for enhancing visual perception. These environments could adjust the resolution, contrast, and color depth based on individual needs. Users could \"walk\" through these digital worlds, effectively seeing objects and spaces they couldn't perceive in the real world due to their vision problems.",
    "**Neural Prosthetics for Vision**: Similar to the smart contact lens idea, neural prosthetics could provide a more direct method for those with severe vision loss. These devices would implant electrodes in the brain's visual cortex, allowing users to perceive images by stimulating the relevant neural pathways. This would enable individuals to see again, albeit in a different form, and might require extensive training to interpret the new sensory input.",
    "**Advanced AI-Driven Personal Assistants**: For everyday tasks, AI-driven personal assistants could become crucial companions for those with poor vision. These assistants could utilize voice commands, text-to-speech features, and machine learning algorithms to navigate, communicate, and perform daily activities. They could be programmed to recognize patterns, understand context, and predict user needs, significantly improving the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals."
