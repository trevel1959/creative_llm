    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop shoes made from biodegradable materials, such as mycelium or recycled plastics, that break down naturally after disposal. This could also include a take-back program where consumers can return old shoes for recycling, promoting sustainability and reducing landfill waste.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Surface**: Utilize a special nanotechnology coating that makes the shoe's surface resistant to dirt and stains. This could involve hydrophobic materials that repel water and mud, allowing wearers to easily wipe off any debris without damaging the shoe's appearance.",
    "**Interchangeable Components**: Design shoes with modular parts that allow users to swap out different components such as soles, insoles, and even upper materials. This would enable customization based on activity (running, casual wear, formal events) and personal style, making each pair unique and versatile.",
    "**Integrated Cooling System**: Create shoes with built-in cooling technology that uses breathable materials and a micro-ventilation system to regulate temperature. This could involve a small fan powered by a rechargeable battery that keeps feet cool during exercise or hot weather, enhancing comfort and performance.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Develop an accompanying mobile app that uses AR to allow users to visualize how different shoe styles and colors would look on their feet before purchasing. This could include virtual try-ons, customization options, and recommendations based on personal style and foot measurements."
