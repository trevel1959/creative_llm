    "Increased atmospheric escape: With less gravity, the atmospheric pressure would decrease, causing gases to escape into space more quickly. This could lead to a significant loss of atmospheric gases, including oxygen and nitrogen, which could have severe consequences for life on Earth.",
    "Reduced ocean tides: With less gravity, the ocean tides would be significantly reduced, which could have a profound impact on marine ecosystems. Many species rely on the daily tidal cycles for food and habitat, and a decrease in these cycles could lead to a decline in their populations.",
    "Altered weather patterns: Halving the Earth's gravity would lead to a change in the planet's weather patterns. The atmosphere would expand, causing the jet stream to slow down and become more zonal (meaning it would flow from west to east). This would result in more persistent weather patterns, such as longer-lasting high-pressure systems and longer-lasting low-pressure systems.",
    "Increased asteroid impacts: With less gravity, asteroids and comets would have less resistance when entering Earth's atmosphere. This could lead to an increase in the number of impacts, potentially causing significant damage to the planet.",
    "Changes in the Earth's rotation: With less gravity, the Earth's rotation would slow down, leading to longer days and longer years. This could have a significant impact on the planet's climate, as the changed rotation patterns could lead to more extreme weather events and changes in the distribution of heat around the globe."
