    "**DIY Herb Garden**: An ice cube tray can be used to create a mini herb garden at home. Each section of the tray is filled with soil and a seed or two. Once the seeds germinate, you have a personal herb garden that can be used for cooking. This idea encourages sustainability and self-sufficiency in the kitchen.",
    "**DIY Lip Balm Molds**: Using melted beeswax and essential oils, you can create customized lip balms using an ice cube tray. Simply pour the mixture into each section of the tray, let it cool and harden, then pop out your custom lip balms. This project allows for creativity in scent and color choices.",
    "**Furniture Leg Protectors**: To protect floors from scratches caused by furniture legs, cover each leg with an ice cube tray filled with silicone. Once hardened, place the tray under the furniture leg. The silicone will prevent damage while still allowing the furniture to move smoothly.",
    "**Customized Ice Cubes**: For special occasions like parties or weddings, create custom ice cubes using an ice cube tray. Fill each section with different colored food dye mixed with water. This adds a unique aesthetic to drinks and keeps them chilled longer due to the irregular shapes.",
    "**Garden Seed Starters**: Instead of traditional seed trays, use an ice cube tray to start seeds indoors before transplanting them outside. This provides a structured way to keep track of which seeds are in which sections, making it easier to manage multiple types of plants simultaneously. The individual compartments help prevent seeds from getting mixed up as they grow."
