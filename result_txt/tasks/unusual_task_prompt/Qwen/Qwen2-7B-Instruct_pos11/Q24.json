    "**Smart Toothbrush with AI**: Develop a toothbrush that connects to a smartphone app through Bluetooth. The brush uses AI to track brushing habits, providing real-time feedback on technique and duration. It could also suggest improvements based on dental health goals set in the app.",
    "**Heated Toothbrush for Cold Weather**: Create a toothbrush that warms up when exposed to cold temperatures. This innovation would be particularly useful in colder climates where traditional toothbrushes can be uncomfortable to use due to their cold handles. The warmth helps relax muscles, making brushing more comfortable.",
    "**Biodegradable Toothbrush**: Design a toothbrush made from biodegradable materials like corn starch or bamboo. This would significantly reduce plastic waste and is eco-friendly. The bristles could be made from plant-based materials as well, ensuring the entire product decomposes naturally.",
    "**Portable Oral Care Kit**: Introduce a compact, rechargeable toothbrush that includes all necessary oral care tools - toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash - in a single, easy-to-carry package. This idea is perfect for travel, camping, or emergency situations where access to bathroom facilities might be limited.",
    "**Dental Hygiene Reminder App**: Pair a toothbrush with an app that reminds users to brush at specific intervals throughout the day. The app could also track the user's brushing routine over time, sending notifications if someone hasn't brushed in a while. This encourages consistent dental hygiene practices, promoting better overall oral health."
