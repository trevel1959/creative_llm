    "**The Day Children Ruled the World**",
    "On a bright spring morning, a mysterious comet streaked across the sky, casting a glow that enchanted every child on Earth. With a collective giggle, they found themselves imbued with the power to make their wildest dreams come true. Ice cream flowed from fountains, playgrounds replaced traffic, and schools transformed into adventure parks. Parents, bewildered yet amused, watched as their children led with laughter and imagination. Instead of rules, joy became the guiding principle. They held meetings in treehouses, discussing fairness and fun. For one glorious day, the world thrived under the rule of innocence, reminding everyone of the magic of childhood.",
