    "**Artistic Canvas**: Instead of using traditional canvases, artists can use old keyboards as a unique base for mixed media art. By painting, gluing, or attaching various materials to the keys and casing, artists can create textured pieces that play with the concept of technology and nature. This could also include creating functional art pieces like wall hangings or sculptures.",
    "**Musical Instrument**: With a bit of creativity, a keyboard can be transformed into a DIY musical instrument. By connecting the keyboard to a computer or synthesizer, each key can trigger different sounds, allowing users to compose music or create soundscapes. Alternatively, keys can be removed and repurposed as percussion instruments or used in sound art installations.",
    "**Home for Small Creatures**: Old keyboards can be cleaned and transformed into habitats for small creatures like hermit crabs or insects. The gaps between keys can serve as hiding spots, while the casing can provide a secure environment. This not only recycles the keyboard but also provides an educational opportunity for observing and learning about small ecosystems.",
    "**Unique Coaster Set**: Individual keys from a keyboard can be repurposed as quirky coasters. Each key can be cleaned, sanded, and treated to withstand moisture, making for a conversation starter at parties. They can be customized with paint or labels to represent different drinks, adding a personalized touch to any gathering.",
    "**Interactive Wall Decor**: Create a wall installation using a collection of old keyboards. By mounting them on a wall and connecting them to a microcontroller, you can make an interactive art piece that lights up or plays sounds when keys are pressed. This not only serves as a creative decor item but also engages guests in a playful way."
