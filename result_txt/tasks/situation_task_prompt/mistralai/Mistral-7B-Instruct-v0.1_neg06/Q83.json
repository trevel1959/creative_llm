    "Adapt to a new sleep schedule: If there were no more night-time, we would have to adapt to a new sleep schedule. We could start sleeping earlier in the day and wake up earlier. This would help us adjust to the new schedule and ensure that we get enough sleep.",
    "Use natural light to regulate sleep: We could use natural light to regulate our sleep. We could sleep in a room with large windows that allow natural light to enter. This would help us regulate our sleep cycle and ensure that we get enough sleep.",
    "Try a new type of sleep: If there were no more night-time, we could try a new type of sleep. We could try a technique called polyphasic sleep, which involves sleeping in several short bursts throughout the day. This would help us get enough sleep without having to sleep at night.",
    "Use sound or vibration to sleep: We could use sound or vibration to sleep. We could sleep with a white noise machine or a vibration pad that vibrates gently to help us fall asleep. This would help us get enough sleep without having to sleep in darkness.",
    "Use a different type of bedding: If there were no more night-time, we could use a different type of bedding. We could sleep in a bed with a built-in fan that circulates cool air throughout the room. This would help us stay comfortable and fall asleep quickly."
