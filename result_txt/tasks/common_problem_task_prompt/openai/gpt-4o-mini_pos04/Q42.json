    "**Data Management**: Large-scale experiments generate vast amounts of data, which can be overwhelming to manage. Issues may arise related to data storage, organization, and retrieval. There is also the challenge of ensuring data quality and consistency, as well as developing effective protocols for data analysis. Inadequate data management can lead to errors in results interpretation and hinder reproducibility.",
    "**Funding and Resource Allocation**: Securing adequate funding is often a significant hurdle for large-scale experiments. Researchers may face difficulties in budgeting for all necessary resources, including personnel, equipment, and materials. Additionally, unexpected expenses can arise, such as equipment malfunctions or the need for additional supplies, leading to financial strain and potential project delays.",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: Large-scale experiments, especially those involving human subjects or environmental impacts, require careful consideration of ethical implications. Issues may arise related to informed consent, potential risks to participants, and the environmental consequences of the experiment. Failing to address these ethical concerns can result in public backlash, legal challenges, or the invalidation of research findings.",
    "**Team Dynamics and Collaboration**: Conducting a large-scale experiment often involves a diverse team of researchers from various disciplines. Differences in communication styles, work ethics, and conflict resolution approaches can lead to misunderstandings and tensions within the team. Effective collaboration is essential for success, and poor team dynamics can jeopardize the experiment's outcomes.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the nature of the experiment, researchers may need to navigate complex regulatory frameworks. This includes obtaining necessary permits, adhering to safety standards, and complying with institutional and governmental guidelines. Failure to meet these regulatory requirements can result in project delays, fines, or even the shutdown of the experiment."
