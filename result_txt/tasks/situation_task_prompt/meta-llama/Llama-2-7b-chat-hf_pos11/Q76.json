    "Carrier Pigeons: In the event of a global phone outage, pigeons could be trained to carry small notes or messages between locations. This method would be slower than traditional phone communication but could be an effective way to send messages over long distances.",
    "Morse Code Flares: Similar to carrier pigeons, flares could be used to send Morse code messages via smoke signals. This method would require a clear line of sight between the sender and receiver, but it could be an effective way to communicate in a pinch.",
    "Homing Pigeons with GPS: In this modern twist on the classic carrier pigeon method, homing pigeons could be trained to carry GPS tracking devices with their messages. This would allow the sender and receiver to track the pigeon's location and retrieve the message upon arrival.",
    "Satellite Phones: In areas with access to satellite technology, satellite phones could be used to communicate long distance without the need for traditional cellular networks. These phones use satellites to transmit and receive signals, allowing for communication in remote or isolated areas.",
    "Semaphore Flags: Semaphore flags are a visual communication method that uses flags to spell out messages. This method would require a clear line of sight between the sender and receiver, but it could be an effective way to communicate over long distances in areas without other forms of communication."
