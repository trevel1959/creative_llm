    "Customizable Weight Distribution: Design a bowling ball with a unique weight distribution system that allows players to adjust the weight of the ball according to their preference. This could be achieved through a modular design, with removable weights that can be added or removed to customize the ball's balance. This would provide a more personalized experience for bowlers of all skill levels, and could also be marketed as a training tool for professional bowlers.",
    "Smart Ball Technology: Develop a bowling ball with embedded sensors that track the ball's performance in real-time, providing feedback on factors such as spin, speed, and accuracy. This could be achieved through the use of small sensors embedded in the ball's core, which could transmit data to a companion app on a bowler's smartphone or tablet. This technology could be marketed as a tool for improving bowling technique and tracking progress over time.",
    "Interactive Gaming Experience: Create a bowling ball with a built-in game controller, allowing players to interact with virtual objects and environments on the bowling lane. This could be achieved through the use of a joystick or button layout on the ball, which could be used to control virtual objects such as pins, obstacles, or power-ups. This would provide a unique and engaging gaming experience for bowlers, and could also be marketed as a fun and interactive way to practice bowling.",
    "Customizable Designs: Offer a line of bowling balls with customizable designs, allowing players to personalize their ball with their name, initials, or favorite colors. This could be achieved through the use of a durable, UV-resistant coating that can be printed with high-quality graphics. This would provide a unique and personalized touch for bowlers, and could also be marketed as a way to show off one's personality on the bowling lane.",
    "Energy-Generating Technology: Develop a bowling ball with a built-in generator that captures kinetic energy from the ball's motion and converts it into usable power. This could be achieved through the use of a small turbine or flywheel embedded in the ball's core, which could generate electricity as the ball rolls down the lane. This technology could be marketed as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way to"
