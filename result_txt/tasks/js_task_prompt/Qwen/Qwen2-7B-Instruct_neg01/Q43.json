    "**Crime Prevention and Investigation:** Imagine using your wall-seeing ability to help law enforcement agencies. You can monitor suspicious activities from a distance without being detected. This would be especially useful in preventing crimes like theft, espionage, or even terrorism by identifying potential threats before they occur.",
    "**Urban Planning and Architecture:** Architects and urban planners could benefit greatly from your power. You could visualize the layout of buildings and infrastructure without physically being there. This would help in planning new developments, assessing construction sites, or even in historical preservation projects where seeing inside old structures is crucial for understanding their original design and layout.",
    "**Medical Diagnosis:** In the medical field, your ability could be used for non-invasive diagnostic procedures. Doctors could peer into patients' bodies to detect diseases, tumors, or other abnormalities without surgery. This could significantly enhance the accuracy of diagnoses and potentially save lives by allowing early detection of health issues.",
    "**Environmental Conservation:** Environmental scientists and conservationists could use your power to assess habitats and ecosystems. By seeing through walls and barriers, you could evaluate the health of forests, coral reefs, or other natural environments that are otherwise inaccessible. This would aid in conservation efforts, helping to identify areas in need of protection or restoration.",
    "**Educational Purposes:** In schools, your ability could be utilized as an educational tool. Teachers could show students how different parts of a building function or demonstrate complex scientific concepts that require a 3D visualization. For example, you could reveal the inner workings of a machine, the structure of a cell, or even the architecture of the human body, making learning more engaging and interactive."
