    "**Eco-Friendly Ink Cartridges**: Create biodegradable or refillable ink cartridges that minimize environmental impact. These cartridges could be made from sustainable materials and designed for easy refilling at home, allowing users to reduce waste and save money in the long run. Additionally, they could incorporate smart technology that alerts users when they are running low on ink.",
    "**Multi-Function Printer with Built-In Scanner and Shredder**: Design a printer that combines printing, scanning, and shredding functionalities into one compact unit. This all-in-one device would streamline office tasks, save space, and reduce the need for multiple devices. Users could scan documents directly to their computers or print documents straight from the shredder's memory, enhancing workflow efficiency.",
    "**Augmented Reality Printing**: Introduce a feature that allows users to visualize printed documents in augmented reality (AR) before printing. Using a mobile app, users could point their device at a designated area to see a 3D representation of the printed material. This would help users make better decisions about what to print and how it would look in their space, reducing unnecessary printing.",
    "**Voice-Activated Printing**: Integrate voice recognition technology into printers, allowing users to issue commands and print documents using voice control. This feature would enhance accessibility for individuals with disabilities and streamline the printing process in busy environments, such as offices or classrooms, where hands-free operation can be beneficial.",
    "**Customizable Print Templates**: Offer a library of customizable print templates that users can access through a companion app or website. Users could design flyers, posters, or reports with drag-and-drop functionality, choosing from a variety of fonts, colors, and layouts. This would make it easier for individuals and businesses to create professional-looking materials without needing graphic design skills."
