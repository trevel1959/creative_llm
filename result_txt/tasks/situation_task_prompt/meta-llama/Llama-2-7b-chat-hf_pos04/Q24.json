    "Magnifying Glasses: One possible solution for people with poor vision without glasses or contact lenses is to use magnifying glasses. These glasses can be held up to objects or materials to magnify them, making them easier to see. For example, a person with poor vision could use a magnifying glass to read a book or to see the details of a craft project.",
    "Smart Contact Lenses: Another solution could be the development of smart contact lenses that can display digital information directly onto the wearer's field of vision. These lenses could be equipped with tiny displays and tiny cameras that can capture and display information, such as text messages, emails, or even virtual displays of objects. This would allow people with poor vision to see information in a more accessible way.",
    "Virtual Reality Glasses: Virtual reality (VR) glasses could be used to create a virtual world that is optimized for people with poor vision. These glasses could display a virtual environment that is designed to be easier to see, with larger text and brighter colors. This could be especially helpful for people who have difficulty reading or recognizing objects in the real world.",
    "Artificial Intelligence-Powered Glasses: Glasses with artificial intelligence (AI) built-in could be programmed to assist people with poor vision in various ways. For example, the glasses could use computer vision algorithms to recognize objects and provide audio or visual cues to help the wearer identify them. The glasses could also be equipped with sensors that can detect the wearer's gaze and automatically zoom in or out on objects based on their distance.",
    "Bionic Eye Implants: For people with severe vision loss, bionic eye implants could be a viable solution. These implants use a camera to capture images and a microprocessor to interpret them, then transmit them to the brain through a wireless connection. This would allow people to see the world in a way that is similar to how they would see it with normal vision. The implants could also be programmed to enhance certain aspects of vision, such as contrast or color, to make it easier for people to see and recognize objects."
