    "**Savory Candy**: This candy combines the sweet with the savory, creating an unexpected yet delicious taste sensation. It can have flavors inspired by global cuisines, such as teriyaki, spicy chilies, or creamy garlic. The texture might range from crispy to chewy, adding another dimension to this unique candy experience.",
    "**Memory-Enhancing Candy**: This candy contains natural ingredients that are known for their memory-boosting properties, like ginkgo biloba, blueberry extract, and omega-3 fatty acids. The flavor could be fruity, such as raspberry or blueberry, to make the product more appealing. This idea is perfect for students, professionals, or anyone looking to enhance their cognitive function.",
    "**Temperature-Responsive Candy**: The candy changes its taste based on temperature. For example, when it's cold, it could taste like mint chocolate, but when it's warm, it turns into a creamy vanilla flavor. This could be achieved through using temperature-sensitive polymers that release different flavors at varying temperatures.",
    "**Emotional Candy**: Each flavor is associated with a specific emotion or mood. For instance, lemon could represent happiness, while lavender might symbolize relaxation. This concept could help people manage their moods by eating the corresponding flavor when they need a specific emotional response.",
    "**Sound-Activated Candy**: This candy releases a pleasant sound when bitten, perhaps a soft \"crunch\" or a subtle \"pop\". This could be achieved through the use of small, edible capsules filled with air or a light explosive substance (safe for consumption). The idea is to create a multi-sensory experience that engages not just taste, but also auditory senses, enhancing the overall enjoyment of the candy. "
