    "**Swimming**: If you're an excellent swimmer, you could consider swimming across the river. You'd need to ensure that the water isn't too deep or fast-flowing, but if it's manageable, this could be a viable option. It might not be the fastest or safest method, especially in cold water or during strong currents.",
    "**Building Rafts**: Gather materials from the surrounding area (logs, branches, etc.) and create a raft. This can be done using simple tools like ropes or sticks to tie everything together. Once constructed, the raft could carry people or goods across the river. However, this would require some time and effort to build, and the stability of the raft would depend on the quality of the materials used.",
    "**Creating a Human Chain**: If there are enough people available, they could form a human chain, with each person holding onto the next person's waist or shoulders. This would allow people to cross the river safely as long as the chain holds. It's a very slow process, but it ensures safety and can accommodate multiple individuals.",
    "**Using Inflatable Boats**: If there are any inflatable boats or life rafts lying around, they could be used to cross the river. These typically provide better buoyancy and safety than a makeshift raft. They might also have oars or paddles for maneuverability, making them more efficient for crossing.",
    "**Aerial Bridge**: In the case where the collapse was recent, it might be possible to construct a temporary aerial bridge using ropes, pulleys, and a sturdy foundation like trees or large rocks. The bridge would be anchored securely on both banks and could be walked across, although it might require additional support for heavy loads or long distances."
