    "**Self-Watering Mechanism**: Design a watering can with a built-in self-watering mechanism that can draw water from a reservoir or a connected water source. This feature would allow the can to automatically water plants at set intervals, ensuring that they receive the right amount of moisture even when the gardener is busy or away.",
    "**Ergonomic and Adjustable Handle**: Create a watering can with an adjustable handle that can be set to different angles for improved ergonomics. This would make it easier for users of all heights and abilities to carry and pour water without straining their wrists or arms, enhancing comfort during use.",
    "**Color-Coded Watering Spouts**: Develop a watering can with interchangeable spouts that are color-coded based on the type of plant being watered (e.g., delicate flowers, vegetables, succulents). Each spout would have a different flow rate and pattern, allowing users to customize their watering technique according to the specific needs of their plants.",
    "**Integrated Fertilizer Dispenser**: Incorporate a compartment within the watering can for adding liquid fertilizers. The can could feature a mixing mechanism that blends water with the fertilizer before dispensing, ensuring that plants receive nutrients every time they are watered, without the need for separate applications.",
    "**Built-in LED Light Indicator**: Add an LED light indicator to the watering can that changes color based on the water level inside. For example, a green light could indicate that the can is full, yellow could mean it’s half full, and red could signal that it needs to be refilled. This would help users keep track of their watering can’s status at a glance."
