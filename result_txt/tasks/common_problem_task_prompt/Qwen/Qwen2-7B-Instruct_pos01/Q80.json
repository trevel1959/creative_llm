    "**Eco-Friendly Wedding Venue**: Consider hosting your wedding at a venue that is known for its sustainable practices. This could be a botanical garden, a nature reserve, or a venue with solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and composting facilities. The cost of renting such a venue might be higher, but it's offset by the environmental benefits. **Confidence Score**: 0.9",

These items not only reduce waste but also encourage guests to engage with nature. **Confidence Score**: 0.85",
