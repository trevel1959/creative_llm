    "**Meritocratic Technocracy**: A government that selects its leaders based on merit and technical expertise, rather than political connections or wealth. This would involve the establishment of a rigorous selection process for public officials, where candidates are evaluated based on their skills, achievements, and experience in relevant fields. The selected leaders would then serve as a technocratic council that makes decisions based on data-driven analysis and best practices.",
    "**Participatory Monarchy**: A form of government where a monarch serves as the head of state, but is advised by a diverse council of elected representatives from various sectors of society. This council would be responsible for making key decisions, while the monarch would provide a unifying figurehead and act as a symbol of national identity.",
    "**Economic Democracy**: A government that seeks to maximize economic equality and social welfare by redistributing wealth and resources through a combination of public ownership, progressive taxation, and universal basic income. This would involve the establishment of worker-owned cooperatives, public utilities, and a robust social safety net to ensure that all citizens have access to essential services and opportunities.",
    "**Environmental Federation**: A government that prioritizes environmental sustainability and ecological balance. This would involve the creation of a federal system where each state or province is given a mandate to protect and preserve its natural resources, while also working collaboratively with neighboring regions to address shared environmental challenges.",
    "**Digital Democracy**: A government that leverages digital technologies to increase transparency, accessibility, and participation in the democratic process. This would involve the development of online platforms for citizen engagement, such as virtual town halls, e-voting systems, and open data portals, to make government more responsive to the needs and interests of the population."
