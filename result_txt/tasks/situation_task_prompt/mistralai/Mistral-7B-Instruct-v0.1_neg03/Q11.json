    "Use a typewriter: If all computers crashed, I would switch to using a typewriter to continue my work or studies. This would allow me to continue typing out documents, emails, and other tasks without the use of a computer.",
    "Use a mobile device: I could use a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, to continue my work or studies. While these devices may not have the same capabilities as a computer, they would still allow me to access some basic functions and resources.",
    "Use a manual typewriter: If I don't have access to a typewriter, I could use a manual typewriter to continue my work or studies. This would require me to slow down my work process and be more deliberate in my typing, but it would still allow me to continue working.",
    "Use a pen and paper: I could use a pen and paper to continue my work or studies. This would require me to be more organized and plan out my tasks in advance, but it would still allow me to continue working.",
    "Use a chalkboard: If I don't have access to a pen and paper, I could use a chalkboard to continue my work or studies. This would require me to be more creative in my approach to problem-solving and brainstorming, but it would still allow me to continue working."
