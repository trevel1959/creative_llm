    "Theing Effect: Theing Effect is a theory that suggests that theing effect is a phenomenon that occurs when something is constantly in a state of being poured or filled, such as a puddle.

This could be applied to theing Effect in aing Effecting Effect.",
    "The Hydra Effect: The Hydra Effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a system or entity is constantly regenerating or replenishing itself, such as a puddle. The theory suggests that the more water is poured into the puddle, the more water it will continue to absorb, resulting in a never-ending cycle.

    "The Osmosis Effect: The Osmosis Effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a substance is constantly being pulled towards a region of higher concentration. In the case of a puddle, the more water is poured into it, the more water it will continue to absorb, resulting in a never-ending cycle. This could be applied to the Osmosis Effect in an Osmosis Effect Puddle.",
    "The Self-Sustaining Effect: The Self-Sustaining Effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a system or entity is able to maintain itself without the need for external inputs. In the case of a puddle, the more water is poured into it, the more water it will continue to absorb, resulting in a never-ending cycle. This could be applied to the Self-Sustaining Effect in a Self-Sustaining Puddle."
