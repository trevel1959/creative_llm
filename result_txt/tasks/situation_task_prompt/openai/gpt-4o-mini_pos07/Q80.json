    "**Barter System Revival**: In the absence of physical money, communities might revert to a barter system where goods and services are exchanged directly. This could be organized through local barter networks or community marketplaces where people can list what they have to offer and what they need. Digital platforms could facilitate these exchanges, allowing users to connect with others in their area. For example, a graphic designer could offer design services in exchange for fresh produce from a local farmer, creating a sense of community and reducing reliance on monetary systems.",
    "**Time Banking**: A time banking system could emerge, where individuals exchange hours of work instead of money. Each person’s time would be valued equally, regardless of the type of service provided. For instance, one hour of gardening could be exchanged for one hour of tutoring. This concept encourages community involvement and supports skill-sharing, allowing people to access services without monetary transactions. Digital platforms could track time credits and facilitate connections between users.",
    "**Subscription-Based Services**: Many businesses might shift to a subscription model, where customers pay a recurring fee for access to goods and services. This could apply to everything from groceries to entertainment. For example, a grocery store could offer a subscription that allows customers to receive a weekly delivery of essential items. This model could simplify transactions, as customers would only need to manage their subscriptions digitally, eliminating the need for cash or coins.",
    "**Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)**: LETS are community-based networks that allow members to trade goods and services using a local currency or credit system. In a cashless society, communities could create their own digital currencies that are accepted locally. Members would earn credits by providing services or goods, which they could then spend within the network. This fosters local economies and encourages sustainable practices, as members would prioritize trading with their neighbors.",
    "**Smart Contracts on Blockchain**: Smart contracts could revolutionize transactions by automating agreements between parties without the need for intermediaries. These self-executing contracts would be stored on a blockchain and would automatically enforce terms when conditions are met. For example, if someone provides a service, the smart contract would release payment from the payer’s digital wallet once the service is confirmed as completed. This technology could enhance trust and transparency in transactions."
