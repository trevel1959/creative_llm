    "Customizable Holding Capacity: Design a tape dispenser with interchangeable tape holders that can accommodate various sizes and types of tape. This will allow users to easily switch between different tape types without having to purchase multiple dispensers.",
    "Ergonomic Grip: Create a tape dispenser with an ergonomic grip that provides comfort and control during use. The grip could be made of a soft, cushioned material that fits the user's hand, reducing fatigue and discomfort during long periods of use.",
    "Tape Measure Integration: Develop a tape dispenser that includes a built-in tape measure, allowing users to measure distances and lengths without the need for a separate tool. This feature would be particularly useful for crafting, construction, and DIY projects.",
    "Automatic Cutting: Design a tape dispenser with an automatic cutting mechanism that can detect the length of tape being used and cut it to the desired length. This would save time and effort, as users would no longer need to manually cut the tape.",
    "Compact Size: Create a miniature tape dispenser that can be easily carried in a purse, backpack, or pocket. This would be ideal for on-the-go use, such as when working on projects in a remote location or in a small workspace."
