    "**Eco-Friendly Blades**:    Design the fan blades using sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. These eco-friendly blades would not only reduce the carbon footprint but could also be aesthetically pleasing with natural textures and colors. Additionally, the blades could be coated with a UV-resistant finish to prolong their lifespan and maintain their appearance over time.",
    "**Built-In Air Purifier**:    Incorporate a compact air purification system within the ceiling fan. As the fan circulates air, it would also filter out dust, allergens, and pollutants. This dual functionality would provide a healthier indoor environment, making it especially beneficial for allergy sufferers. The air purifier could feature replaceable filters and an indicator light to alert users when it's time for a change.",
    "**Customizable LED Lighting**:    Equip the ceiling fan with customizable LED lights that can change colors and brightness levels. Users could select different lighting modes for various activitiesâ€”soft white for relaxation, bright white for reading, or vibrant colors for parties. This feature could be controlled via a remote or app, allowing for easy adjustments based on mood or occasion.",
    "**Artistic Design Elements**:    Collaborate with local artists to create limited-edition ceiling fan designs that serve as statement pieces in a room. These fans could feature unique paint jobs, artistic blade shapes, or even integrated sculptures. By transforming a functional item into a work of art, homeowners can express their personality and enhance their interior decor.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    Develop a self-cleaning mechanism that utilizes UV-C light and a gentle rotating brush system to keep the fan blades free of dust and grime. This feature would ensure that the fan operates efficiently and maintains good air quality without the need for regular manual cleaning. The self-cleaning process could be activated automatically on a schedule or manually through a remote."
