    "Adjustable Spray: Another way to improve a watering can is to make it adjustable. This can be done by adding a valve that allows the user to control the flow of water from the can. This would allow gardeners to adjust the spray to different plants and soil types, ensuring that the plants receive the right amount of water.",
    "Compact Design: A watering can with a compact design would be more convenient for gardeners who have limited space in their gardens. This can be achieved by making the can smaller and lighter, while still maintaining its functionality.",
    "Multiple Nozzles: Adding multiple nozzles to a watering can would allow gardeners to choose the type of spray they want to use, depending on the plant they are watering. For example, a fine mist nozzle can be used for delicate plants, while a larger spray nozzle can be used for thirstier plants.",
    "Self-Cleaning: A self-cleaning watering can would be more hygienic and reduce the risk of disease in the garden. This can be achieved by adding a filter to the can that removes any debris or contaminants from the water before it is sprayed on the plants.",
    "Reusable: A watering can that can be reused multiple times would be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. This can be achieved by making the can from durable materials that can withstand repeated use and cleaning."
