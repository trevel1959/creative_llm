    "**Liability and Insurance Challenges**: Determining liability in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car can be complicated. Questions arise regarding whether the manufacturer, software developer, or the car owner is responsible for damages. This could lead to disputes over insurance coverage and higher premiums, complicating the existing insurance landscape.",
    "**Ethical Dilemmas in Decision-Making**: Self-driving cars may face situations where they must make split-second decisions that involve ethical considerations, such as choosing between the safety of passengers versus pedestrians. Programming these ethical algorithms poses a challenge, as societal values and moral frameworks can vary widely.",
    "**Job Displacement**: The widespread adoption of self-driving cars could lead to significant job losses in industries reliant on human drivers, such as trucking, taxi services, and public transportation. This raises economic concerns and necessitates discussions about retraining and supporting displaced workers.",
    "**Regulatory and Legal Framework**: The integration of self-driving cars into existing traffic systems poses regulatory challenges. Governments must establish new laws and regulations to govern the operation of autonomous vehicles, including standards for safety, testing, and road usage, which may vary significantly across regions.",
    "**Public Acceptance and Trust**: For self-driving cars to become mainstream, the public must trust their safety and reliability. Concerns about accidents, technical failures, and the loss of human control can hinder acceptance. Education and transparent communication about the technologyâ€™s capabilities and limitations will be crucial in addressing these fears."
