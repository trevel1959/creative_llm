    "Another potential problem is the dog not responding well to commands during the competition. This can be addressed by practicing and rehearsing the commands and routines with the dog beforehand, so they are familiar with the expectations and can perform well under pressure.",
    "A third potential problem is the dog becoming overly aggressive or protective of its owner or other dogs during the competition. This can be addressed by training the dog to be more relaxed and socialized with other dogs and people, as well as teaching them appropriate behaviors for different situations.",
    "A fourth potential problem is the dog not being in good enough physical condition to compete. This can be addressed by providing the dog with regular exercise and a balanced diet, as well as taking them to the vet for regular check-ups to ensure they are healthy and ready for the competition.",
    "A fifth potential problem is the dog not being able to perform certain tricks or routines due to a lack of natural ability or physical limitations. This can be addressed by finding alternative tricks or routines that the dog can perform, and working with a trainer to develop a routine that showcases the dog's strengths.",
    "A sixth potential problem is the dog becoming overly attached to its owner or handler, which can cause them to become overly protective or clingy during the competition. This can be addressed by gradually separating the dog from its owner or handler during training, and teaching the dog to trust other people and be comfortable in different situations."
