    "**Smart Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket that integrates technology to improve efficiency and convenience. The basket could have a built-in scale to weigh clothes, indicating the correct amount of detergent to use. It might also feature a moisture sensor that sends an alert when the load is too damp or too dry, helping users optimize their drying cycles. An integrated smart speaker could provide tips on sorting laundry and suggest eco-friendly washing practices based on the fabric type.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket that can clean itself. This could involve a small motor that shakes out excess dirt and debris, and perhaps a small vacuum system that removes any remaining particles. Additionally, the basket could be lined with a material that repels water, allowing it to rinse clean with just a few sprays from a connected water bottle or faucet.",
    "**Personalized Laundry Sorting System**: Create a laundry basket that uses artificial intelligence to sort clothes by fabric type, color, and even brand. Using image recognition technology, the basket can scan the clothes as they are placed inside, then sort them into specific compartments for different wash settings. This would significantly reduce the time spent sorting laundry and ensure that each item receives the care it needs.",
    "**Interactive Laundry Basket App**: Develop an app that works in conjunction with a smart laundry basket. The app could provide real-time updates on the status of the laundry, such as when the load is ready to be transferred to the dryer or when there's a special sale on laundry detergents. Users could also receive personalized suggestions for laundry care based on their preferences and the items being washed.",
    "**Sustainable Laundry Basket**: Design a laundry basket made from eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastic. This basket would not only be kinder to the environment but also serve as a statement piece for environmentally conscious individuals. To enhance its functionality, it could include features like a foldable design for easy storage when not in use, or a handle made from biodegradable materials that doubles as a label holder for sorting purposes."
