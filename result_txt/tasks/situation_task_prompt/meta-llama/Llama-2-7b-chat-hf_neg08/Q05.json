    "Install Solar-Powered Lights: One creative solution to ensure enough light during the day without the sun's rays is to install solar-powered lights in strategic locations. These lights can be placed in windows, courtyards, or even on rooftops to provide ample illumination. Solar panels can be installed to charge the lights during the day, ensuring they continue to shine brightly even without the sun.",
    "Mirrors as Reflectors: Another idea is to use mirrors as reflectors to bounce light around the space. By placing mirrors opposite windows or in areas where light is entering, the reflected light can illuminate the space even without direct sunlight. This can be especially useful in larger spaces or areas with limited natural light sources.",
    "Glowing Plants: Incorporating glowing plants into the space can provide a unique and sustainable lighting solution. Plants such as glowing mushrooms, luminous flowers, or even genetically engineered plants can emit a soft, ambient light that can illuminate the space without the need for artificial light sources.",
    "Light-Emitting Paint: A more artistic approach to lighting is to use light-emitting paint on walls or ceilings. This paint can be charged with a small amount of electricity to emit a soft, warm glow, providing ample light without the need for traditional light sources. This can add an extra layer of aesthetic appeal to the space, making it feel cozier and more inviting.",
    "Flexible LED Strips: Finally, flexible LED strips can be used to create a customizable lighting solution. These strips can be placed in various areas of the space, such as under furniture or along baseboards, to provide a soft, diffused light. They can also be cut to fit into unique shapes or designs, allowing for a more personalized lighting experience."
