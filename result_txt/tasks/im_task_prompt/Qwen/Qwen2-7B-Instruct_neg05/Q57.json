    "**Interactive History Timeline:** Create a computer mouse that allows users to navigate through a historical timeline. The cursor moves along a large, interactive screen or table where various events are represented by different objects or holograms. Users can click on an event to get more information, hear audio clips, or even watch videos related to that specific historical moment.",
    "**Artistic Expression Tool:** Develop a specialized computer mouse that incorporates pressure-sensitive technology and color-changing LED lights. As the user scrolls or clicks, the mouse detects the force applied and adjusts the brush strokes accordingly, allowing for dynamic painting and drawing experiences. The color-changing lights can also mimic the colors of the artwork being created, enhancing the visual experience.",
    "**Multilingual Translation Aid:** Design a mouse with integrated AI translation capabilities. It features a microphone and speakers that allow users to speak into the mouse, which then translates the spoken words into another language in real-time. The translated text appears on the screen as the user navigates through documents, websites, or applications, making communication across languages seamless.",
    "**Accessibility and Inclusion Device:** Create a computer mouse specifically designed for individuals with disabilities, particularly those who have limited hand mobility. This device could be controlled using voice commands, eye movements, or head gestures. It would offer customizable settings, such as varying cursor speeds and sensitivity, to cater to diverse user needs.",
    "**Fitness and Health Monitoring System:** Integrate a computer mouse with sensors and biometric data trackers. As the user interacts with their computer, the mouse collects data on physical activity, such as the number of mouse clicks, scrolling movements, and duration spent sitting. This information can be used to encourage healthier habits, provide fitness tips, or even sync with other health and wellness apps to monitor overall well-being."
