    "**Emergency Phone Stand**: In a pinch, a pen can be used to prop up your smartphone. By placing the pen at an angle against a flat surface and resting the phone against it, you can create a makeshift stand for video calls, watching movies, or following a recipe while cooking.",
    "**Stylus for Touchscreens**: If you find yourself without a stylus for your tablet or smartphone, a pen can be repurposed by wrapping a small piece of damp sponge or cotton at the tip. This creates a conductive surface that can mimic a finger's touch, allowing you to navigate your device easily.",
    "**Bookmark with a Twist**: A pen can serve as a creative bookmark by sliding it into the pages of a book. The pen's clip can hold the place securely, and you can even use it to jot down notes or thoughts about the book as you read, keeping everything in one place.",
    "**Artistic Tool for Texturing**: Artists can use the tip of a pen to create unique textures in their artwork. By pressing the tip onto paper or canvas, you can create dots, lines, or patterns that add depth and interest to paintings or drawings, especially in mixed media projects.",
    "**DIY Music Maker**: Use a pen as a percussion instrument by tapping it on various surfaces, such as a table or a cardboard box. You can create a simple rhythm or beat, turning it into a fun and spontaneous music-making session. Pair it with clapping or singing for a full jam session!"
