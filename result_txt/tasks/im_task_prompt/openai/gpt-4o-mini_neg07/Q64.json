    "**Integrated Environmental Sensors**: Expand the alarm system to include environmental sensors that monitor air quality, temperature, and humidity. If the system detects hazardous conditions, such as a gas leak or extreme temperature changes, it could alert the homeowner and automatically contact emergency services, providing an additional layer of safety beyond traditional security measures.",
    "**Personalized Voice Assistant**: Create a customizable voice assistant feature that allows users to set personalized responses for different situations. For example, if the alarm is triggered, the assistant could say, “It’s just the cat,” or “There’s an intruder,” depending on the type of threat detected. This feature would help reduce panic and provide clarity during stressful situations.",
    "**Community Alert Network**: Develop a community-based alert system that allows users to share real-time information about suspicious activities or incidents in their neighborhood. When a user’s alarm is triggered, it could send a notification to nearby users, allowing them to be vigilant and report any unusual behavior to local authorities, fostering a sense of community safety.",
    "**Visual Deterrent Technology**: Integrate visual deterrents, such as flashing LED lights or holographic projections, that activate when the alarm is triggered. These lights could simulate the presence of law enforcement or security personnel, potentially scaring off intruders before they even attempt to enter the property.",
    "**Biometric Access Control**: Incorporate biometric technology, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, into the alarm system for access control. This would ensure that only authorized individuals can disarm the system or enter the home, adding an extra layer of security and convenience. Additionally, the system could log entries and exits, providing valuable data for the homeowner."
