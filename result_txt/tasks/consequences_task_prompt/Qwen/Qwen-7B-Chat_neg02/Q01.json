    "\"Imagine a world where everyone rides a bicycle instead of driving a car. How would it change our cities? Our transportation systems? Our daily lives?\"",
    "\"What if all cars were banned completely? Would that solve any of the problems we're facing today, or would it create new ones?\"",
    "\"If all cars were powered by renewable energy sources, what kind of impact would that have on the environment and our economy?\"",
    "\"What if all cars were designed to be more efficient and sustainable, and were required to meet strict emissions standards?\"",
    "\"How would our cities change if they were designed around bicycles rather than cars? What kinds of infrastructure would be necessary to support a bike-friendly urban environment?\""
