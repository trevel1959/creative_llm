    "**Craft Beer Subscription Service**: Create a subscription service that sends unique and exclusive craft beers directly to customers' doorsteps on a monthly basis.

    "**Craft Beer Festival Events**: Host or participate in local craft beer festivals, offering a chance to showcase your brand alongside other breweries.
