    "**Water Collection System**: Water is essential for survival, so I would devise a rainwater collection system. I would create a makeshift funnel using large leaves or hollowed-out bamboo to direct rainwater into a container made from coconuts or any other available materials. Additionally, I would dig a shallow pit near a freshwater source to collect water and use stones to filter it. This would ensure I have a consistent supply of drinking water.",
    "**Foraging and Food Preservation**: I would spend time learning about the local flora and fauna, identifying edible fruits, nuts, and plants. I would also look for shellfish along the shore and consider fishing if I can create a simple spear or fishing line using vines. To preserve food, I would use the sun to dry any excess fish or fruits, creating jerky or dehydrated snacks to sustain me during leaner times.",
    "**Signal for Rescue**: To increase my chances of being rescued, I would create large signals on the beach using rocks, driftwood, or sand. I could arrange these materials to form an SOS signal visible from the air. Additionally, I would create smoke signals by building a controlled fire with green leaves to produce smoke, which would attract the attention of any passing ships or aircraft.",
    "**Wildlife Observation and Adaptation**: I would observe the local wildlife to learn about their habits and behaviors. This could help me identify which animals are safe to approach for food and which ones to avoid. I could also study their nesting and foraging patterns to find additional food sources. By adapting my diet to include both plant and animal life, I would ensure a more balanced nutritional intake.",
    "**Building Tools and Fire Creation**: Using sharp stones and sticks, I would craft basic tools for cutting and hunting. I would also focus on creating fire, which is vital for cooking, warmth, and signaling. I would use the friction method, such as a bow drill, to generate heat and create an ember, then carefully transfer it to a nest of dry leaves and twigs to start a fire."
