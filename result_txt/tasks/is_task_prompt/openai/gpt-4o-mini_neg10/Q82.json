    "Once upon a time, in a hidden valley, flowed a river of rich, dark chocolate. The villagers adored it, using its sweet waters to make delectable treats. One day, a curious child named Mia dipped her fingers into the river, discovering that it granted wishes! Excited, she wished for endless chocolate, but soon the village was flooded with sweets, causing chaos. Realizing her mistake, Mia bravely dove into the river and wished for balance. Instantly, the flood receded, and the river returned to its original flow. From then on, the villagers learned to enjoy the chocolate in moderation, cherishing each delightful drop.",
