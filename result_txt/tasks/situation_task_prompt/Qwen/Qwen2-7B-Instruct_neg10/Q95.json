    "**Inflatable Pillow Alternative**: Design an inflatable pillow that can be easily inflated before bed and deflated during the day for storage. It could be made from lightweight, durable material like nylon or polyester. The pillow could have a valve for easy inflation and deflation, and could come in various sizes and shapes to suit different sleeping positions. This way, you'd have a comfortable pillow to rest your head when needed, but it wouldn't take up space when not in use.",
    "**Eggshell Pillow**: Inspired by the natural shape and softness of eggshells, create a pillow made of a soft, flexible material that mimics the curve of an eggshell. This pillow would conform to the shape of your head and neck, providing support without the need for traditional stuffing. It could be designed with adjustable compartments filled with small, soft beads or foam pieces to allow users to customize the firmness and shape according to their preferences.",
    "**Scented Pillow Liners**: Develop a series of pillow linings infused with calming or stimulating scents such as lavender, peppermint, or eucalyptus. These linings can be easily inserted into any existing pillowcase to provide an aromatherapy experience during sleep. The scent could be released through a slow-release mechanism, ensuring a soothing aroma throughout the night without overpowering the user.",
    "**Smart Pillow with Temperature Regulation**: Create a smart pillow equipped with sensors and micro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) that can adjust its temperature based on your body's needs. The pillow would monitor your core body temperature and adjust its surface temperature accordingly, keeping you cool when you're hot and warm when you're cold. This would enhance comfort and potentially improve the quality of your sleep.",
    "**Adaptive Pillow with Memory Foam Layers**: Design a pillow with multiple layers of memory foam that can adapt to different sleeping positions. Each layer could have varying degrees of firmness, allowing the pillow to conform to the shape of your head and neck more effectively depending on whether you're sleeping on your back, side, or stomach. The adaptive nature of this pillow would provide tailored support for each sleeping position, enhancing comfort and reducing the likelihood of waking up with a stiff neck or back."
