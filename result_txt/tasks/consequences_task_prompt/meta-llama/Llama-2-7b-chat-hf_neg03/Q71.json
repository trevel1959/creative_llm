    "Overpopulation: If immortality were to be discovered, the population of the world would increase significantly. People would live indefinitely, and their reproductive rates would not slow down, leading to a rapid increase in the global population. This would put a strain on resources, leading to food and water shortages, and causing environmental degradation.",
    "Social and Economic Upheaval: Immortality would challenge traditional social structures and economic systems. People would no longer have to worry about retirement, and the concept of a \"working life\" would change. The lack of a natural end to life would also lead to changes in inheritance laws, property rights, and social security systems.",
    "Psychological Impact: Living forever would have a profound psychological impact on individuals. They would have to come to terms with the fact that they would never age, grow old, or die. This could lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and boredom, as well as a loss of purpose and meaning in life.",
    "Ethical Concerns: Immortality would raise significant ethical concerns. For example, would immortal individuals have more rights than non-immortal individuals? Would they be seen as a burden on society? How would immortality affect issues like organ donation, organ harvesting, and the allocation of scarce medical resources?",
    "The Unknown Long-Term Consequences: While immortality would have a profound impact on society, the long-term consequences of immortality are impossible to predict. It's possible that immortal individuals could experience unforeseen health problems or psychological issues, or that they could develop new forms of cancer or other diseases that are not currently known to exist. The long-term effects of immortality on the human body and mind would be a mystery, and it would be difficult to prepare for them."
