    "**Smart Suitcase with Built-in Technology**: Design a suitcase that comes equipped with advanced features like built-in locks, GPS tracking, and an integrated power bank for charging electronic devices. The built-in locks ensure the safety of the contents, while the GPS tracking allows users to easily locate their luggage in crowded airports or on public transport. The power bank can charge smartphones, tablets, and other small gadgets, making it ideal for long trips where access to power outlets may be limited.",
    "**Expandable Suitcase with Built-in Storage**: Create a suitcase that can expand to accommodate more items when needed, but still compress down to a compact size when not in use. This design includes internal dividers and pockets for organizing clothing, shoes, and other essentials. Additionally, there could be a built-in compression bag that helps to further maximize space without damaging delicate items.",
    "**Sustainable Suitcase from Recycled Materials**: Develop a suitcase made entirely from eco-friendly materials such as recycled plastic bottles, bamboo fibers, or reclaimed wood. These materials not only reduce waste but also make the suitcase lightweight yet durable. To enhance its appeal, you could also incorporate solar panels into the design, allowing the suitcase to charge itself when exposed to sunlight.",
    "**Personalized Suitcase with Customizable Designs**: Offer a suitcase that allows customers to customize the exterior with their own designs or choose from a variety of unique patterns and colors. This could include options for monogramming, laser engraving, or even 3D printing personal artwork onto the suitcase's surface. This feature adds a personal touch and helps customers easily identify their luggage among similar-looking bags.",
    "**Portable Power Station Suitcase**: Combine the functionality of a traditional suitcase with that of a portable power station. This suitcase is equipped with multiple USB ports, a battery capacity to charge devices, and possibly even a mini-inverter to provide AC power. It would be perfect for business travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone who needs a reliable source of power on the go. The design should prioritize portability and convenience, ensuring that the power station can easily fit inside the suitcase and be carried comfortably."
