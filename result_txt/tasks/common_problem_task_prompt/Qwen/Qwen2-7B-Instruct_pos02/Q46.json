    "**Incorporating Electric Vehicles**: One creative idea is to replace the current fleet of vehicles with electric buses and trains. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also enhances the city's image as environmentally conscious. The city can invest in charging infrastructure, like solar-powered charging stations, to further boost its green credentials. Additionally, integrating renewable energy sources into the transportation system could create jobs in the green technology sector.",
    "**Smart Traffic Management System**: Develop an advanced traffic management system that utilizes data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. This system could include real-time traffic monitoring, predictive routing algorithms, and dynamic traffic signal control. It would require collaboration with technology companies and may involve significant investments in infrastructure.",
    "**Integrating Bike-Sharing and Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure**: Enhance the city's public transportation system by integrating bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure such as wider sidewalks, dedicated bike lanes, and improved crosswalks. This would encourage more sustainable modes of transportation and improve quality of life for city residents. Partnering with local businesses and community groups could help in promoting this initiative.",
    "**On-Demand Public Transportation**: Implement a flexible on-demand transportation service that allows passengers to request rides through a mobile app. This system could use ride-sharing platforms or autonomous vehicles to provide personalized services, reducing wait times and improving accessibility. The city can work with private tech companies to pilot this service and refine it based on user feedback.",
    "**Promoting Multi-Modal Travel Options**: Encourage the use of multiple modes of transportation by creating seamless integration between different systems (e.g., buses, trains, bike-sharing, and walking). This could involve developing a comprehensive public transport app that provides information on all available options, schedules, and routes. The city can collaborate with transportation agencies and technology providers to ensure that this platform is user-friendly and accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities."
