    "**Space Debris Collision**: As the satellite ascends through the atmosphere and into orbit, there is a risk of collision with existing space debris. This is a growing concern as the number of defunct satellites and fragments from previous launches increases. To tackle this, mission planners can utilize advanced tracking systems to predict potential collisions and adjust the satellite's trajectory if necessary. Incorporating debris mitigation strategies into the satellite's design, such as deorbiting capabilities, can also help reduce future risks.",
    "**Regulatory and Compliance Issues**: Launching a satellite involves navigating a complex landscape of international regulations and compliance requirements. Issues can arise from obtaining the necessary permits, frequency allocations, and ensuring that the satellite does not interfere with other satellites or services. To address this, it is essential to engage with regulatory bodies early in the planning process and ensure that all legal requirements are met before the launch.",
    "**Budget Overruns**: Launching a satellite can be an expensive endeavor, and budget overruns can occur due to unforeseen technical challenges, delays, or increased costs of materials and labor. To prevent this, it is crucial to establish a realistic budget with contingency funds for unexpected expenses. Regular financial reviews and updates can help keep the project on track and within budget.",
    "**Launch Window Timing**: The timing of the launch is critical, as it must align with specific orbital mechanics and mission objectives. Delays due to weather conditions, technical issues, or logistical challenges can result in missed launch windows, potentially pushing the mission back significantly. To mitigate this, careful planning and scheduling, along with alternative launch dates, should be established to accommodate any potential delays.",
    "**Public Relations and Communication**: The launch of a satellite often garners public interest and media attention. Miscommunication or negative incidents, such as a launch failure, can lead to public backlash or loss of stakeholder confidence. To address this, a comprehensive communication strategy should be developed, including regular updates, transparency about challenges, and proactive engagement with the media and public to foster trust and understanding."
