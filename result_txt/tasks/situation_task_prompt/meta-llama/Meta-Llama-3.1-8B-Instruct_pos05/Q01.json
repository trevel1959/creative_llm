    "**Raven Communication Network**: Establish a network of trained ravens that can be sent to different countries with pre-written messages attached to their legs. The ravens would fly back to their respective homes, carrying the messages with them, allowing for cross-country communication. To ensure accuracy, the messages would be encoded in a simple yet secure way, such as using a combination of colors and symbols.",
    "**Global Kite Network**: Design and manufacture a series of high-altitude kites with attached communication devices. These kites would be released into the jet stream, allowing them to travel long distances while carrying messages. The kites would be equipped with GPS tracking and solar-powered communication devices, ensuring that messages are delivered efficiently and accurately.",
    "**Underwater Messenger Fish**: Develop a species of fish that can be trained to carry small, waterproof messages between different locations. These fish would be equipped with a special implant that allows them to communicate with each other through a complex system of clicks and whistles, ensuring that messages are delivered accurately and efficiently.",
    "**Solar-Powered Balloon Network**: Create a network of high-altitude balloons that are equipped with solar-powered communication devices and GPS tracking. These balloons would be released into the stratosphere, allowing them to travel long distances while carrying messages. The balloons would be designed to stay aloft for extended periods, ensuring that messages are delivered consistently and accurately.",
    "**Homing Pigeon 2.0**: Develop a modern, high-tech version of the traditional homing pigeon. These pigeons would be equipped with advanced navigation systems, GPS tracking, and solar-powered communication devices. They would be trained to fly between specific locations, carrying messages with them, and would be able to communicate with each other through a complex system of sounds and visual cues. [/INST] "
