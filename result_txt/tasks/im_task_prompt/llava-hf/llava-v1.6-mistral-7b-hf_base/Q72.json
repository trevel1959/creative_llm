    "Surfboard with Integrated Training Tools: The surfboard could be designed with built-in sensors and training tools to help athletes track their performance and provide real-time feedback. This would allow surfers to monitor their balance, wave selection, and carving techniques while they're riding.",
    "Modular Surfboard: The surfboard could be designed to be modular, with interchangeable fins, rockers, and rails. This would allow surfers to customize the board to suit their needs and preferences.",
    "Surfboard with a Hydrofoil: The surfboard could be equipped with a hydrofoil, which would lift the board out of the water and reduce drag, making it easier to catch waves and improve the overall surfing experience.",
    "Surfboard with a Drone Camera: The surfboard could be equipped with a high-quality drone camera that would follow the surfer around, providing an aerial view of their wave-riding experience. This would allow surfers to capture amazing footage and share it with others.",
    "Surfboard with a Water Cannon: The surfboard could be designed with a water cannon, which would allow the surfer to create their own waves on demand. This would be especially useful in locations with limited wave access."
