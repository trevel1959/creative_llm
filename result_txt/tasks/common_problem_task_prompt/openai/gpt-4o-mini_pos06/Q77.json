    "**Sustainability Challenges**: While aiming for an eco-friendly image, the hotel may struggle with sourcing sustainable materials and practices. For example, using reclaimed wood for decor might be difficult to procure in sufficient quantities, or the hotel might face challenges in implementing effective waste management systems, leading to higher operational costs and potential negative environmental impacts.",
    "**Unique Amenities vs. Guest Expectations**: The hotel plans to offer unique amenities (like a rooftop garden or a silent disco), but these may not align with guest expectations for comfort and convenience. If guests prioritize traditional amenities (like a standard gym or business center), the hotel may struggle to meet their needs, leading to dissatisfaction and negative reviews.",
    "**Staff Training and Retention**: With a focus on personalized guest experiences, the hotel will require highly trained staff who can embody the boutique ethos. However, recruiting and retaining such talent can be challenging. High turnover rates or insufficient training can lead to inconsistent service quality, negatively impacting guest experiences.",
    "**Market Positioning and Branding Confusion**: The hotelâ€™s unique concept may not be easily communicated to potential guests. If the branding is unclear, it can confuse the target audience about what the hotel offers, resulting in lower occupancy rates. An unclear brand identity can also lead to misalignment in marketing strategies, further complicating the hotel's positioning in a competitive market.",
    "**Regulatory Compliance**: The hotel may face challenges with local regulations, especially if it incorporates unconventional features (like treehouses or tiny homes). Zoning laws, safety regulations, and permits can create significant hurdles. Non-compliance can lead to fines, delays in opening, or even the need for costly renovations to meet legal standards."
