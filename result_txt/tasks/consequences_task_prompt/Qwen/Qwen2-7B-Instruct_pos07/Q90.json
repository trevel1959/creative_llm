    "**Economic Boom**: Erasing all world debt would instantly release a significant amount of capital from debt repayment obligations to consumers and businesses worldwide. This sudden influx of capital could lead to an economic boom as people and businesses would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, leading to increased demand and potential growth.",
    "**Inflation**: The sudden increase in the money supply could potentially lead to inflation if not managed properly. Central banks might need to implement policies to control inflation, such as adjusting interest rates or implementing quantitative easing measures to ensure prices remain stable.",
    "**Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: Countries heavily indebted might see their economic leverage diminish significantly, while those who had maintained a lower debt-to-GDP ratio could experience a boost in their global standing. This could lead to changes in trade relationships, alliances, and geopolitical dynamics.",
    "**Sustainable Development**: With the burden of debt removed, countries might have more resources to invest in sustainable development projects like renewable energy, infrastructure, and education. This could lead to a more environmentally conscious and economically resilient global community.",
    "**Social Impact**: Erasing debt could have profound social implications. It could reduce poverty levels by lifting millions out of financial distress. Improved access to healthcare, education, and basic necessities could follow as a result of this financial relief. However, it might also lead to a sudden increase in spending, which could potentially exacerbate existing social inequalities if not distributed fairly. "
