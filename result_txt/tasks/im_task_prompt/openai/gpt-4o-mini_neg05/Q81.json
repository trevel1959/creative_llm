    "**Multi-Functional Spatula with Interchangeable Heads**: This spatula could come with various interchangeable heads designed for different cooking tasks, such as flipping, spreading, or scooping. Each head would be easily attachable and made from different materials (silicone, metal, etc.) to cater to specific needs. This would reduce the number of utensils needed in the kitchen and increase the spatula's versatility.",
    "**Spatula with Built-in Measuring System**: Incorporate a measuring system directly into the spatula that allows users to measure ingredients while cooking. This could include markings for tablespoons and teaspoons along the edge of the spatula, or even a digital scale that weighs ingredients as they are added. This would streamline the cooking process, especially for recipes that require precise measurements.",
    "**Ergonomically Designed Spatula with Grip Enhancements**: Develop a spatula with an ergonomic design that includes a contoured handle and textured grip to reduce strain on the wrist and improve comfort during use. This spatula could be particularly beneficial for those with arthritis or limited hand strength, making cooking more accessible for everyone.",
    "**Spatula with Integrated LED Light**: Design a spatula with an integrated LED light at the edge of the spatula head. This feature would illuminate the cooking surface, making it easier to see food while cooking, especially in low-light environments. The light could also change colors based on the temperature of the food, providing a visual cue for doneness.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Spatula**: Introduce a spatula made from materials that can self-clean or have a built-in cleaning mechanism. For example, the spatula could be designed with a retractable cleaning brush that, when activated, scrubs the spatula head clean after use. This would be especially useful for those who dislike washing dishes or have busy schedules."
