    "**Interactive Workspace Organizer**: Design a computer mouse that can project a virtual workspace onto any flat surface, eliminating the need for physical desk clutter. The mouse would allow users to create virtual folders, documents, and notes, which they could manipulate with simple gestures or voice commands. This idea leverages the mouse's movement capabilities to provide an intuitive interface for managing digital files in a clean, paperless environment.",
    "**Health and Wellness Integration**: Develop a computer mouse that integrates health monitoring features. It could include sensors for tracking hand movements, heart rate, and even stress levels. By analyzing these metrics, the mouse could provide personalized suggestions for ergonomic adjustments, exercises to prevent strain, or mindfulness techniques to reduce stress during prolonged use. This innovation combines technology with health promotion, offering a more holistic user experience.",
    "**Multitasking Enhancement Tool**: Create a smart mouse that supports multiple devices simultaneously. It would allow users to switch between computers, tablets, or smartphones with a single click or gesture. This feature is particularly useful for professionals who frequently move between different devices during work or study, enhancing productivity by reducing switching time and improving workflow efficiency.",
    "**Virtual Reality Controller**: Design a computer mouse specifically for VR environments. The mouse would have haptic feedback and motion sensors to provide tactile sensations and precise control within VR applications. Users could interact with virtual objects using natural hand movements, making VR experiences more immersive and engaging. This idea expands the traditional role of a mouse into new dimensions, offering a versatile tool for gaming, training simulations, and creative applications.",
    "**Accessibility and Inclusivity Enhancer**: Develop an accessible computer mouse that caters to users with disabilities. It could feature customizable settings such as increased sensitivity, larger buttons, and adjustable weight, allowing individuals with limited mobility or sensory impairments to operate their computers more easily. Additionally, integrating voice recognition and AI assistants could enable hands-free operation, making technology more inclusive for people with various abilities. This innovation aims to bridge the gap between accessibility and mainstream computing, ensuring that everyone has equal access to digital tools."
