    "**Eco-Friendly Urban Farming Pods**: Design and develop self-sustaining, compact urban farming pods that can be integrated into cityscapes, providing fresh produce to local communities while minimizing environmental impact. Each pod would utilize hydroponics, aeroponics, or vertical farming techniques to optimize space and resources. The pods would be made from recycled materials, have a built-in water management system, and be powered by renewable energy sources. This innovative approach would not only increase food security but also enhance urban biodiversity and aesthetics.",
    "**Smart Contact Lenses for Vision Therapy**: Develop a pair of smart contact lenses that incorporate micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide real-time vision therapy and correction. These lenses would detect eye movements, pupil dilation, and other visual cues to adapt to the user's needs. They would also offer personalized vision correction, tracking progress, and providing feedback to optimize treatment outcomes. This technology would revolutionize the treatment of vision disorders, such as amblyopia and strabismus.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting for Sustainable Cities**: Create a network of bioluminescent organisms that can be integrated into urban infrastructure, providing a sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solution. This would involve cultivating specific species of glowing bacteria, algae, or fungi and embedding them into streetlights, building facades, or public art installations. The bioluminescent organisms would harness the power of photosynthesis, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions while creating a unique, mesmerizing ambiance.",
    "**Personalized 3D-Printed Prosthetics for Amputees**: Develop a system that uses AI-driven design and 3D printing to create customized prosthetic limbs tailored to individual amputees' needs. This would involve scanning the user's residual limb, analyzing their movement patterns, and generating a personalized prosthetic design. The prosthetic would be printed using advanced materials, such as carbon fiber or titanium, and would be equipped with sensors and motors to provide a seamless, intuitive experience.",
    "**Neurofeedback-Enabled Mindfulness Training for Mental Health**: Design a non-invasive, wearable device that uses electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time neurofeedback and mindfulness training. This device would help individuals develop self-awareness, manage stress, and"
