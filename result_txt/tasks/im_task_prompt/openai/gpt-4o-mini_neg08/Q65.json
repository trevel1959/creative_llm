This feature could be linked to a smart home system, enabling seamless integration with other devices.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Functionality**: Design a self-cleaning mode that uses a combination of steam and high-frequency vibrations to remove mineral buildup and other residues. Users could activate this mode periodically to maintain the kettle's performance without needing to manually scrub or use harsh chemicals, ensuring longevity and hygiene.",

This feature could also educate users on the importance of using clean water for optimal taste and health.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Mode**: Introduce an energy-saving mode that allows the kettle to operate on a lower power setting when boiling small amounts of water. This mode could be activated by a simple toggle, reducing energy consumption and making it more environmentally friendly, appealing to eco-conscious consumers."
