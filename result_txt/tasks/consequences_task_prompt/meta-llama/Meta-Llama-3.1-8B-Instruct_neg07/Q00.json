    "**Global Productivity Collapse**: Without sleep, humans would be unable to recharge, leading to a significant decline in productivity. This would have a ripple effect on the economy, causing widespread job losses, and potentially even global economic collapse. Companies would struggle to maintain their operations, and the lack of sleep would lead to a decrease in innovation and problem-solving skills.",
    "**Mental Health Crisis**: Sleep deprivation would lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. People would become irritable, and their emotional regulation would be severely impaired. This would result in a massive mental health crisis, with a significant increase in hospitalizations and a strain on mental health resources.",
    "**Increased Accidents and Fatalities**: Drowsy driving and workplace accidents would skyrocket, leading to a significant increase in fatalities and injuries. This would put a massive strain on emergency services, and the economy would suffer from the loss of human capital.",
    "**Social and Relationship Breakdown**: Sleep-deprived individuals would struggle to maintain relationships, leading to a breakdown in social structures. Family and friend relationships would suffer, and social cohesion would begin to fray. This would have long-term consequences for community stability and social harmony.",
    "**Evolutionary Consequences**: Without sleep, the human body would undergo significant changes to adapt to the new environment. This could lead to the evolution of new sleep-related disorders, and potentially even new species of humans. The human brain would have to adapt to function without sleep, leading to changes in cognitive function, memory, and learning abilities."
