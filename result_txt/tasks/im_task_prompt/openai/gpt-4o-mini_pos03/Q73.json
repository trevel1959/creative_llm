    "**Keyless Entry with Biometric Authentication**: Introduce a keyless entry system that uses biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to unlock the car. This system would eliminate the need for physical keys altogether, enhancing security and convenience. Users would simply need to place their finger on a scanner or look at a camera to gain access to their vehicle, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain entry.",
    "**Solar-Powered Key Fob**: Design a solar-powered key fob that charges itself using sunlight. This eco-friendly option would reduce the need for battery replacements and provide a sustainable energy source for the key fob. The key fob could also have a small LED screen that displays notifications, such as the car's battery status or upcoming maintenance reminders, making it more informative.",
    "**Customizable Key Fob Covers**: Create a line of customizable key fob covers that allow users to personalize their car keys. These covers could be made from various materials (silicone, leather, fabric) and come in different colors and patterns. Users could also design their own covers using an online tool, adding their names, favorite quotes, or images, making their keys unique and easily identifiable.",
    "**Integrated Remote Start and Climate Control**: Innovate a key fob that integrates remote start functionality with climate control settings. Users could program their key fob to start the engine and set the air conditioning or heating to their preferred temperature before they even enter the car. This feature would be especially useful in extreme weather conditions, providing comfort as soon as the driver gets in.",
    "**Emergency SOS Feature**: Equip car keys with an emergency SOS feature that can be activated in case of an emergency. Pressing a specific button on the key fob would send a distress signal to emergency services or designated contacts, providing them with the car's GPS location. This feature could be invaluable for personal safety and would enhance the key's functionality beyond just unlocking the car."
