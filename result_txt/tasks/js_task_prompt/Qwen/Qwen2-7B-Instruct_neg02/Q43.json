    "**Crime Prevention**: As a crime prevention specialist, using the ability to see through walls can help detect potential criminal activities before they happen. This could be used in conjunction with advanced AI algorithms that analyze patterns and predict crimes based on historical data. By identifying suspicious movements or activities, law enforcement agencies could be alerted in advance to prevent crimes, ensuring public safety.",
    "**Urban Planning**: With the ability to see through walls, urban planners could visualize infrastructure beneath the ground without needing invasive excavation processes. This would greatly expedite the planning process, reducing costs and environmental impact. It could also aid in discovering valuable resources like water sources, underground structures, or historical artifacts, enriching the planning process.",
    "**Medical Research and Treatment**: Medical professionals could use this power for non-invasive diagnostic procedures. They would be able to see internal organs, blood vessels, and other critical body parts without the need for surgery. This would allow for early detection of diseases, more precise surgeries, and potentially save lives by providing faster, less invasive treatment options.",
    "**Underwater Exploration**: The ability to see through walls would be incredibly useful in underwater exploration and archaeology. It would enable divers and researchers to map underwater terrain, locate shipwrecks, and discover submerged ancient civilizations without the need for costly and time-consuming excavation. This could lead to significant advancements in our understanding of human history and marine biology.",
    "**Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental scientists could use this power to monitor ecosystems and natural disasters more effectively. They would be able to see through layers of soil, rock, and even ice to study geological formations, track the movement of groundwater, and monitor changes in the environment caused by climate change or pollution. This could lead to better conservation strategies and more accurate predictions of natural disasters, helping communities prepare and mitigate their impacts."
