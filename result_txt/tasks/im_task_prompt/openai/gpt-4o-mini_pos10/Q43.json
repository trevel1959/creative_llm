    "**Modular Oven Design**:    Develop a modular oven system that allows users to customize their cooking experience. Users could add or remove different cooking modules, such as a steam oven, air fryer, or dehydrator, depending on their needs. This would enable individuals to create a multi-functional cooking space without requiring multiple appliances, thus saving space and reducing clutter in the kitchen.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Technology**:    Introduce advanced self-cleaning technology that goes beyond the traditional pyrolytic cleaning. This could involve a combination of ultrasonic cleaning and eco-friendly cleaning agents that break down grease and food residues without the need for high temperatures. Users could simply select a cleaning mode, and the oven would handle the rest, saving time and effort.",
    "**Built-in Recipe Library**:    Equip the oven with a built-in touchscreen interface that includes a vast library of recipes. Users could browse, select, and send recipes directly to the oven, which would automatically adjust its settings accordingly. The library could include video tutorials and tips from professional chefs, enhancing the cooking experience and encouraging users to try new dishes.",
    "**Energy Monitoring System**:    Implement an energy monitoring system that tracks the energy consumption of the oven in real-time. Users could receive notifications via a mobile app about energy usage, efficiency tips, and alerts when the oven is left on for too long. This feature would promote energy conservation and help users save on utility bills while also being environmentally friendly.",
    "**Customizable Interior Lighting**:    Add customizable LED lighting inside the oven that can change colors based on cooking modes or temperatures. For example, blue could indicate baking, red for broiling, and green for warming. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also allows users to visually monitor the cooking process without having to open the door, thus maintaining heat."
