    "**Smart Toothbrush with Personalized Oral Care Plans**: Develop a toothbrush that comes with a built-in AI-powered companion app. The app would track the user's brushing habits, provide personalized oral care plans based on their dental history, and offer real-time feedback on brushing technique. The toothbrush would also include sensors to detect plaque, tartar, and gum health, sending alerts to the user and their dentist if any issues arise. This smart toothbrush would help users develop better brushing habits, prevent oral health issues, and even detect potential health problems early on.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Design a toothbrush with a built-in UV sanitizer that kills bacteria and germs on the bristles and handle. This feature would provide an additional layer of protection against the spread of oral diseases and infections.

This feature would cater to users who struggle with bad breath or tongue issues, providing a comprehensive oral care solution.",
    "**Toothbrush with Adjustable Bristle Hardness and Color-Changing Bristles**: Develop a toothbrush with adjustable bristle hardness and color-changing bristles that indicate when they need to be replaced. The bristle hardness would be adjustable using a simple mechanism, allowing users to switch between soft, medium, and hard bristles depending on their oral care needs. The color-changing bristles would use a temperature-sensitive material that changes color when exposed to high temperatures, indicating when the bristles have reached their optimal cleaning performance and need to be replaced.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in Whitening Strips and Gum Massager**: Design a toothbrush with built-in whitening strips and a gum massager. The whitening strips would be infused with a gentle, non-abrasive whitening agent that helps remove surface stains and whiten teeth.
