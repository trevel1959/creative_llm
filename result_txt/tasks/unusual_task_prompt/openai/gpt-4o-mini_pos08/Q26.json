    "**Pet Toy**: Beyond their traditional use in tennis, tennis balls can serve as engaging toys for pets. For dogs, they can be used for fetch or tug-of-war. You can also cut a small slit in the ball and fill it with treats, creating a puzzle toy that challenges your pet to figure out how to get the treats out.",
    "**Garden Tool**: A tennis ball can be transformed into a garden tool by cutting a slit into it and using it as a seed planter. The ball can help distribute seeds evenly when rolled along the soil. Additionally, you can attach a tennis ball to the end of a garden rake or hoe to prevent it from slipping out of your hands while gardening.",
    "**Dryer Ball**: Instead of purchasing expensive dryer balls, you can use tennis balls in your dryer to help fluff and separate laundry. They reduce static cling and can help dry clothes faster by preventing them from clumping together. Plus, the tennis balls can add a fresh scent if you add a few drops of essential oil to them.",
    "**Cushioning for Furniture**: Tennis balls can be cut in half and attached to the bottom of furniture legs to protect floors from scratches. This is especially useful for heavy furniture that is frequently moved, such as couches or chairs. The rubber material provides a soft cushion that absorbs impact and reduces noise.",
    "**Pencil Holder**: A fun and quirky way to organize your desk is by turning a tennis ball into a pencil holder. Simply cut a slit in the ball, and it can hold pens, pencils, or markers upright. This not only keeps your writing instruments organized but also adds a playful touch to your workspace."
