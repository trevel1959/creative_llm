    "**Ergonomic Grip**: Design a pencil with an ergonomic grip that fits comfortably in the hand, reducing fatigue and discomfort during extended writing sessions. The grip could be made of a soft, flexible material that conforms to the user's hand shape.",
    "**Color-Changing Pencil**: Create a pencil with a temperature-sensitive tip that changes color in response to changes in temperature. This could be useful for artists who want to create unique, temperature-dependent effects in their work.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Light**: Develop a pencil with a built-in LED light that illuminates the writing surface, allowing users to write in low-light environments without straining their eyes. The light could be adjustable in brightness and color temperature.",
    "**Smart Pencil Tip**: Design a pencil tip that can detect and adapt to different writing surfaces, such as paper, wood, or fabric. The tip could adjust its pressure and angle to optimize writing performance on each surface.",
    "**Pencil with Built-in Audio**: Create a pencil that can record audio, allowing users to capture voice notes, dictations, or even create music. The audio could be stored on the pencil or synced with a mobile device."
