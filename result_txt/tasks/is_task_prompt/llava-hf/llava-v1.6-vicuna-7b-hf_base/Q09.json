    "An assistant appears, a small, friendly bird who offers to help.",
    "The assistant perches on the giraffe's head and, with its beak, pulls down the leaves for the giraffe to eat.",
    "The giraffe is grateful and, in return, offers the assistant a ride on its back.",
    "As they soar through the air, the giraffe and the assistant become fast friends.",
    "They spend their days exploring the savanna together, with the giraffe using its long neck to reach the tallest trees and the assistant using its beak to pull down leaves."
