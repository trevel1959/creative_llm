    "**Smart Environment Adaptation**: Incorporate sensors that detect the surrounding environment and adjust the sound output accordingly. For example, if the speaker is placed in a noisy environment, it could automatically increase its volume or switch to a noise-cancellation mode. Additionally, it could adjust its EQ settings based on the acoustics of the room, providing an optimized listening experience regardless of the location.",
    "**Solar-Powered Option**: Integrate solar panels into the design of the Bluetooth speaker to allow for solar charging. This would make the speaker more sustainable and ideal for outdoor use, reducing reliance on electrical outlets. The solar panels could be positioned on the top surface, and the speaker could come with an indicator that shows the battery level and charging status from sunlight.",
    "**Interactive Touch Controls**: Replace traditional buttons with a touch-sensitive surface that allows for gestures. Users could swipe to adjust volume, tap to play/pause, or use multi-touch for additional features. This would create a sleek and modern interface, making the speaker more intuitive to use while also reducing mechanical wear on buttons.",
    "**Built-in Smart Assistant with Personalization**: Equip the speaker with an advanced AI-driven smart assistant that learns the user's preferences over time. It could suggest playlists based on the time of day, mood, or activity (e.g., workout, relaxation). Users could also set personalized voice commands that trigger specific actions, making the speaker a more integrated part of their daily routine.",
    "**Integrated Health Monitoring**: Add health monitoring features, such as heart rate or stress level tracking, using sensors built into the speaker. It could analyze the user's voice and provide feedback on stress levels or suggest calming music during high-stress periods. This would transform the speaker into a wellness companion, blending entertainment with health monitoring."
