    "**Educational Toy Development**: Create an interactive educational toy called \"Rubber Duck Scholar\". This toy could be designed to help children learn various subjects like math, science, and language through play. The rubber duck would come with detachable question cards, each corresponding to a different educational topic. For example, a math card might ask, \"How many rubber ducks can fit in this bathtub?\" while a science card might pose, \"What happens if we add vinegar to baking soda inside the duck?\" The child would solve the problem and receive feedback from the duck, which could include a fun sound or animation to make learning engaging.",
    "**Personalized Greeting Card**: Design a line of personalized greeting cards featuring rubber ducks. Each card could be tailored to specific occasions such as birthdays, thank you notes, or congratulations messages. The inside of the card could contain a custom message, and the exterior could feature a rubber duck in various costumes or settings (e.g., a graduation cap, a tuxedo, a pirate hat). The unique design could cater to a wide range of personalities and preferences, making it a thoughtful and memorable gift.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Product Packaging**: Develop a new packaging solution for eco-conscious companies by using rubber ducks as a sustainable alternative to traditional foam or plastic packing materials. These rubber ducks could be made from recycled materials and designed to mold around fragile items during shipping, protecting them without the need for excessive padding. This would not only reduce waste but also provide a playful touch to the product's presentation upon arrival.",
    "**Artistic Sculpture Installation**: Create a large-scale public art installation consisting of a series of rubber ducks arranged in a dynamic sculpture. The ducks could vary in size, shape, and color, forming a visually striking piece that encourages interaction and contemplation. This could be placed in a city park, on a college campus, or near a waterway, inviting people to engage with the artwork and perhaps even participate in its creation by adding their own rubber duck to the installation.",
    "**Therapeutic Tool for Stress Relief**: Develop a line of rubber ducks designed specifically for stress relief. Each duck could have a unique texture or feature, such as a soft, plush material or a small pocket filled with lavender or other calming scents. Users could squeeze the ducks when feeling stressed, providing tactile comfort and potentially helping to reduce anxiety. The ducks could also be used as a meditation aid, where the act of gently rubbing or squeezing the duck helps center the mind and promotes relaxation."
