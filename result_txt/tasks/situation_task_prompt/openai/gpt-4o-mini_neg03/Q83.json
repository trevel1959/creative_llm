    "**Adaptive Circadian Masks**: To combat the absence of night, people could wear adaptive circadian masks. These masks would feature advanced technology that monitors the user's biological clock and adjusts the light and sound exposure accordingly. They would emit specific wavelengths of light that promote melatonin production, mimicking twilight and night-time. Additionally, the masks could play soft, ambient sounds that resemble nighttime nature, such as crickets chirping or distant waves, creating an atmosphere conducive to sleep.",
    "**Virtual Reality Sleep Experiences**: Virtual reality (VR) technology could be harnessed to create immersive sleep experiences. Users could don VR headsets that transport them to serene night-time environments, such as a tranquil forest under a starry sky or a quiet beach with gentle waves. These experiences would include calming sounds and visuals designed to help users relax and drift off to sleep. The VR system could even incorporate guided meditations or storytelling, further enhancing the sleep experience in this perpetual daylight.",
    "**Scented Sleep Environments**: To enhance sleep in a world without night, scented sleep environments could be developed. These would be specially designed rooms that utilize aromatherapy to create a calming atmosphere. Scents like lavender, chamomile, or sandalwood could be released gradually as the user prepares for sleep, signaling to the brain that it's time to wind down. The rooms could also feature sound machines that replicate nighttime sounds, combining scent and sound to create a multi-sensory sleep environment.",
    "**Dynamic Color-Changing Walls**: Homes and sleep spaces could be equipped with dynamic color-changing walls that mimic the natural transition of day to night. These walls would gradually shift colors throughout the day, from bright yellows and blues to soft pinks and deep blues, ultimately settling into a calming dark hue. This gradual change would help signal to the brain that it's time to rest, promoting a sense of tranquility and preparing the body for sleep despite the absence of a traditional night.",
    "**Personalized Sleep Schedules**: In a world without night, individuals could use advanced technology to create personalized sleep schedules based on their unique biological needs. Smart wearables would track sleep patterns, energy levels, and overall health, allowing users to determine their optimal sleep windows. The technology could then suggest tailored sleep times, complete with reminders to engage in relaxing pre-sleep rituals, ensuring that everyone gets the rest they need, regardless of the absence of nighttime."
