    "**Modular Design with Customizable Attachments**: Imagine a coat rack that allows users to add or remove different components based on their needs. For example, users could attach shelves for hats, hooks for bags, or even small drawers for gloves and scarves. This modular approach would allow for personalization and adaptability, making it suitable for various spaces and user preferences.",
    "**Scent-Infusing Coat Rack**: This coat rack could incorporate a built-in scent diffuser that releases pleasant fragrances when coats are hung or removed. Users could choose from a variety of essential oils or scents, creating a welcoming atmosphere in their entryway. The rack could have a refillable compartment for the scent oils and a timer to control the diffusion schedule.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Coat Rack Made from Recycled Materials**: Create a coat rack that emphasizes sustainability by using recycled wood, metal, or plastic. This design could also include a small plant holder or a vertical garden feature, allowing users to incorporate greenery into their entryway. The natural elements would not only beautify the space but also contribute to air purification.",
    "**Interactive Coat Rack with Digital Display**: A high-tech coat rack could feature a digital screen that displays useful information, such as the weather forecast, reminders, or even a family calendar. The display could be touch-sensitive, allowing users to navigate through different features. This would turn a simple coat rack into a multifunctional hub for family organization.",
    "**Convertible Coat Rack with Built-in Seating**: This design would combine a coat rack with a bench or seating area, perfect for entryways where space is limited. The seating could fold down when not in use, and the coat rack could be designed to accommodate hanging items above the bench. This would create a functional space for putting on or taking off shoes while keeping coats organized."
