    "3D Holographic Mouse: Create a computer mouse that projects a 3D hologram of the mouse surface, allowing users to interact with virtual objects in mid-air. This technology would revolutionize the way we interact with computers, enabling more intuitive and immersive experiences. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Shape-Shifting Mouse: Develop a mouse that can change its shape to accommodate different grip styles and preferences.

    "Gesture-Controlled Mouse: Create a mouse that uses gesture recognition technology to allow users to control the cursor without touching the mouse. Users could use hand or body gestures, such as waving their hand or tilting their head, to navigate and interact with the computer. This would be particularly useful for people with disabilities or limited mobility. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "Haptic Feedback Mouse: Develop a mouse that provides tactile feedback to users through vibrations, heat, or other sensations. This could enhance the user experience by providing a more intuitive and immersive way of interacting with the computer. For example, the mouse could vibrate when the user scrolls or clicks, or provide a gentle warmth when the user touches a hotspot on the screen. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "Augmented Reality Mouse: Create a mouse that overlays virtual objects and information onto the real world, using augmented reality (AR) technology. Users could use the mouse to interact with virtual objects and information, such as virtual buttons, menus, or maps, while still being able to see and interact with the physical world around them. This would provide a more immersive and interactive computing experience. Confidence Score: 0.9"
