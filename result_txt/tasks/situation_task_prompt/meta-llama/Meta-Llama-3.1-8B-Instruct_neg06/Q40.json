    "**Solar-Powered Backpack**: Design a wearable backpack with built-in solar panels that can harness energy from the sun to charge devices. The backpack would have a flexible, water-resistant solar panel that can be adjusted to face the sun for optimal energy absorption. It would also feature a built-in battery pack, a USB port, and a power bank to store excess energy. This innovative solution would allow individuals to stay connected and powered up on-the-go, even in areas with limited access to electricity.",
    "**Kinetic Energy Harvesting Shoes**: Develop a line of shoes that capture and convert kinetic energy into electrical energy. The shoes would feature built-in piezoelectric sensors that detect the wearer's movements and convert them into electrical energy. This energy would be stored in a small battery pack, which could be used to charge devices or power small appliances. The shoes would also have a sleek, futuristic design that would appeal to fashion-conscious individuals.",
    "**Bioluminescent Lighting**: Harness the power of bioluminescent organisms to create sustainable, self-sustaining lighting solutions. Bioluminescent bacteria or fungi could be engineered to produce a glowing effect, eliminating the need for electricity. This technology could be applied to streetlights, home lighting, or even wearable devices. The bioluminescent organisms would require minimal maintenance and would provide a unique, ethereal glow.",
    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting**: Develop a device that can extract water from the air, even in arid environments, and use it to generate electricity. The device would utilize a condenser to collect water vapor from the air, which would then be used to drive a turbine or generator. This technology could provide a reliable source of clean water and electricity in areas where both are scarce.",
    "**Thermoelectric Roadways**: Design a network of roads that incorporate thermoelectric materials to harness the heat generated by vehicles and convert it into electricity. The roads would feature a specialized surface that captures the heat from vehicle tires and converts it into electrical energy. This energy would be stored in a grid or used to power nearby buildings and infrastructure. The thermoelectric roadways would provide a sustainable and innovative solution for urban energy needs."
