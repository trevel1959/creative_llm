    "**Biomass Fuels**: One creative idea could be utilizing biomass fuels as an alternative energy source for vehicles. Biomass includes organic materials like agricultural waste, forestry residues, and municipal solid waste that can be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel and biogas. These biofuels can be used in existing diesel engines or modified engines designed for them. The process of conversion might involve the use of anaerobic digestion to produce biogas or converting cellulose from agricultural waste into sugars which are then fermented to produce ethanol. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Electric Vehicles (EVs) Expansion**: Given the global shift towards electric vehicles, this could become more critical if the world's oil disappears. Increasing the infrastructure for charging stations, promoting EVs, and investing in battery technology could ensure vehicles continue to operate without fossil fuels. Governments and private sectors could invest in creating an extensive network of charging points, incentivizing car manufacturers to produce more EVs, and developing longer-lasting batteries. Confidence Score: 0.85",
    "**Nuclear Power**: Another innovative approach would be to harness nuclear power for transportation. Small modular reactors (SMRs) could provide a decentralized, portable source of electricity that could be used to charge electric vehicles. SMRs have the potential to be safer, cheaper, and easier to construct than traditional nuclear plants, making them more feasible for widespread deployment. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Solar-Powered Vehicles**: The development of solar-powered vehicles that can harness sunlight directly to power their engines could be another solution. These vehicles would have integrated solar panels that can recharge the battery while driving. While they may not offer the same range as traditional EVs, they can significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels, especially in sunny regions. Confidence Score: 0.75",
    "**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: Hydrogen fuel cells could serve as a viable alternative to gasoline or diesel. These systems convert hydrogen into electricity, producing water vapor as a byproduct. To make hydrogen, various renewable energy sources like wind or solar could be used to power electrolyzers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The challenge here lies in the infrastructure required to store and distribute hydrogen safely, but advancements in hydrogen storage technologies could make this option more practical.
