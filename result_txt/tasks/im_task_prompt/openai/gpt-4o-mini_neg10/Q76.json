    "**Multi-Functional Hair Tie with Built-in Tools**: Design a hair tie that includes small, detachable tools such as a mini comb, hair clip, or bobby pins. The tools can be stored within the elastic band itself, making it easy to carry essentials without needing an extra bag. This way, users can quickly fix their hair on the go without rummaging through their belongings.",
    "**Mood Color-Changing Hair Tie**: Develop a hair tie made from thermochromic material that changes color based on the wearer’s body temperature or mood. This can serve as a fun way to express oneself, allowing users to choose colors that reflect their mood or even change throughout the day. The color change could also serve as a conversation starter, allowing for social interactions based on the tie's hue.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Hair Tie with Plantable Seeds**: Introduce a hair tie made from biodegradable materials embedded with seeds. After the hair tie has reached the end of its life, users can plant it in soil, and it will decompose while sprouting flowers or herbs. This eco-friendly alternative encourages sustainability and allows users to contribute to the environment while using a daily accessory.",
    "**Adjustable Hair Tie with Modular Components**: Create a hair tie that features an adjustable mechanism allowing users to customize the tightness and length. It could include modular components that allow users to add charms or decorative elements, making it a versatile accessory that can change style depending on the occasion—casual, formal, or festive.",
    "**Hair Tie with Integrated Hair Care Technology**: Design a hair tie that incorporates hair care technology, such as a small, refillable reservoir for essential oils or conditioning serum. As the hair tie is worn, it could gently dispense the product onto the hair, keeping it moisturized and reducing frizz throughout the day. This would appeal to users looking for convenience in their hair care routine."
