    "**Pet Grooming Aid**: Beyond its primary function for human hair, a hairbrush can be used to groom pets, especially those with longer fur. It can help remove loose hair, detangle knots, and even stimulate the skin for better blood circulation. Just ensure the brush is suitable for the type of fur your pet has, as some may have softer bristles that are gentler on sensitive skin.",
    "**Dusting Tool for Delicate Items**: A hairbrush can be an excellent tool for dusting delicate items like figurines, electronics, or intricate decorations. The soft bristles can reach into crevices and corners without scratching surfaces, making it perfect for cleaning hard-to-reach areas without damaging the items.",
    "**Fashion Statement Accessory**: A hairbrush can be transformed into a quirky fashion accessory. By attaching it to a chain or using it as a brooch, it can be worn as a statement piece that showcases individuality and creativity. This can be particularly appealing at music festivals or artistic gatherings, where unique fashion choices are celebrated.",
    "**Massage Tool**: The bristles of a hairbrush can be used for a DIY massage experience. Gently rolling the brush over your skin can help relieve tension and promote relaxation.
