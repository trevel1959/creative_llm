    "Flashlight Hydration System: A flashlight with an integratedydrationydration system that uses solar energy to power a built-in water filtration system. This system would allow the user to purify water from any source, making it a valuable tool for survival situations.",
    "Flashlight with Smart Navigation: A flashlight that uses GPS technology to provide real-time navigation information, including directions and distance to the nearest landmarks. This would be particularly useful for hikers, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "Flashlight with Built-in Camera: A flashlight with a built-in camera that allows the user to take photos and videos in low-light conditions. This would be a great tool for photographers and videographers, as well as for documenting scientific experiments and other research.",
    "Flashlight with Biometric Sensors: A flashlight that uses biometric sensors to detect changes inydration levels and other physiological signs. This would be particularly useful for athletes and other people who need to monitor their hydration levels during exercise.",
    "Flashlight with Augmented Reality: A flashlight with an augmented reality display that overlays additional information onto the user's view of their surroundings. This could include information about theydration levels of nearby plants and water sources, as well as information about theydration requirements of different types of animals and insects."
