    "Smart Snooze: Implement a smart snooze feature that gradually adjusts the snooze duration based on the user's sleep quality. If the user consistently wakes up refreshed after a short snooze, the alarm clock could decrease the snooze time. Conversely, if the user wakes up groggy after a longer snooze, the alarm clock could increase the snooze time.",
    "Mood Lighting: The alarm clock could incorporate a built-in LED light that adjusts its brightness and color to help the user wake up more easily. For instance, a blue light has been shown to help regulate the body's natural wake-up signal, while a warm yellow light can help wake up more gently.",
    "Nature Sounds: Integrate a selection of calming nature sounds, such as rain, ocean waves, or birdsong, to help the user transition from sleep to wakefulness more smoothly. This feature could be particularly useful for people who struggle with early morning wake-ups or those who find traditional alarm tones jarring.",
    "Voice Control: Equip the alarm clock with voice control capabilities, allowing users to set alarms and snooze with simple voice commands. This feature would be especially beneficial for people with limited mobility or those who prefer a hands-free experience.",
    "Personalized Alarms: Offer the option to create personalized alarms that include a favorite song or voice message to help the user feel more connected and motivated when waking up."
