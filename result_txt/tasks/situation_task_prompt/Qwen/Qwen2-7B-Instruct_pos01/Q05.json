    "**Incorporate Solar Power into Everyday Life**: Develop and utilize solar-powered devices that can store energy from the sun and release it when needed. This could include solar-powered street lights, portable solar chargers, and even solar-powered emergency kits. Confidence Score: 0.8",
    "**Create a 'Light Relay' System**: Design a system where sunlight is gathered at one location and transported to areas where it's needed using light pipes or fiber optics. This system could be used in buildings, cities, or even rural areas without direct sunlight access. Confidence Score: 0.7",
    "**Develop Artificial Sunlight Sources**: Engineer artificial light sources that mimic the sun's spectrum and intensity. These could be used in industrial settings, greenhouses, or as part of an urban lighting infrastructure. Confidence Score: 0.9",
    "**Implement Reflective Surfaces**: Deploy large reflective surfaces (like mirrors or reflective films) to reflect existing light from other sources back into areas lacking direct sunlight. This could be particularly useful in densely built-up areas. Confidence Score: 0.6",
    "**Use Light Emitting Materials**: Innovate materials that emit light over extended periods without needing direct sunlight. These could be incorporated into building facades or used in wearable technology to provide ambient light. Confidence Score: 0.7"
