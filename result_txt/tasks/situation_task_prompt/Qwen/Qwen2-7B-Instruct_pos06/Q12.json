    "**Thermal Solar Panels**: Create large-scale solar panels that absorb sunlight during the day and store the heat. The stored energy can then be used to heat your home at night or during colder seasons. Confidence Score: 0.95",
    "**Geothermal Heating System**: Install a geothermal heating system which uses the consistent temperature of the earth as a heat source. Pipes are placed under the ground and draw heat from the earth's core to warm your home. Confidence Score: 0.98",
    "**Biological Heat Generators**: Develop a system where living organisms, such as microorganisms in a bioreactor, produce heat as a byproduct of their metabolic processes. This could be integrated into a home heating system. Confidence Score: 0.90",
    "**Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV)**: Use HRV systems to recover heat from exhaust air and transfer it to incoming fresh air. This minimizes heat loss and can provide significant savings in heating costs. Confidence Score: 0.97",
    "**Advanced Insulation Techniques**: Employ advanced insulation techniques and materials like aerogel, which has one of the lowest thermal conductivities, to significantly reduce heat loss through walls and windows. Confidence Score: 0.92"
