    "On a sweltering summer day, the townsfolk of Sweetvale awoke to a peculiar sightâ€”ice cream was raining from the sky! Flavors of every kind tumbled down like a sugary downpour, covering the streets in a frosty layer. Children squealed with delight, scooping up the colorful puddles with their hands. But as the day wore on, the townspeople realized the ice cream was melting too quickly, creating rivers of sticky sweetness. To save their town, they devised a plan: they built giant cones to catch the rain, turning the chaos into a festival. That day, Sweetvale became the happiest place on Earth.",
