    "**Modular Design for Customization**: Develop a modular wheelchair design that allows users to easily swap out components based on their needs. For example, users could change the seat for comfort, the wheels for different terrains (e.g., urban vs. off-road), or add accessories like storage bags, cup holders, or even a sunshade. This flexibility would allow users to personalize their wheelchairs for different activities and environments.",
    "**Health Monitoring Sensors**: Integrate health monitoring sensors into the wheelchair that can track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced with a smartphone app, alerting users or caregivers if any readings fall outside of normal ranges. This feature would provide peace of mind and enhance the overall health management of wheelchair users.",
    "**Self-Propelling Mechanism**: Design a self-propelling mechanism that can be activated when users want to travel longer distances without physical strain. This could be a battery-powered system that assists with propulsion while allowing the user to control the speed and direction. The mechanism could be activated with a simple button or gesture, making it easier for users to navigate through large spaces or on uneven terrain.",
    "**Integrated Communication System**: Create an integrated communication system within the wheelchair that allows users to connect with their smartphones or other devices via Bluetooth. This system could enable hands-free calling, text messaging, or even video chatting through a mounted tablet. This feature would help users stay connected with friends, family, and caregivers without needing to reach for their phones.",
    "**Enhanced Suspension System**: Innovate a new suspension system that absorbs shocks and vibrations, providing a smoother ride over rough surfaces. This could involve a combination of springs, shock absorbers, and advanced materials that adapt to the terrain. A smoother ride would enhance comfort and reduce fatigue for users, especially during longer outings."
