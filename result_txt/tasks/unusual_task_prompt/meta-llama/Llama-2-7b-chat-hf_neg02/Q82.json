    "Smart Clothing Iron: Create an iron that can automatically detect the type of fabric being ironed and adjust its heat settings accordingly. This would save users time and effort as they wouldn't have to manually select the appropriate heat setting for each garment. Additionally, the iron could have a built-in sensor that detects when the garment is smooth and automatically turns off, reducing energy consumption.",
    "Steam Iron with Built-in Steamer: Design an iron that incorporates a built-in steamer function, allowing users to both iron and steam their clothes in one device. This would be particularly useful for people who have a lot of delicate fabrics or for those who live in humid climates, as it would eliminate the need for a separate steamer. The iron could have multiple steam settings and a detachable water tank for easy refilling.",
    "Portable Clothes Iron: Create a compact and lightweight iron that can be easily taken on the go. This would be perfect for people who travel frequently or for those who live in small spaces and don't have a lot of storage room for bulky irons. The iron could have a long-lasting battery and a compact design that folds up for easy storage.",
    "Iron with Automatic Cleaning System: Design an iron with an automatic cleaning system that uses UV light and water to clean the iron's soleplate and reduce buildup. This would ensure that the iron remains in good working condition and lasts longer. The system could also include a reminder function that alerts users when it's time to clean the iron.",
    "Smarter Ironing Experience: Develop an iron that can connect to a user's smartphone via Bluetooth, providing a more enjoyable and interactive ironing experience. The iron could have a companion app that offers tips and tricks for ironing different fabrics, as well as a virtual ironing board that helps users position their clothes for optimal ironing. Additionally, the app could track the user's ironing progress and provide recommendations for improving their technique."
