    "Quantum Flux Energy: Quantum Flux Energy is a new form of energy that harnesses the power of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon in which particles become connected and can affect each other even when separated by vast distances. This energy source would work by creating a network of entangled particles that can be accessed and manipulated to generate power. The energy would be clean, sustainable, and virtually limitless, as the entangled particles could be created and re-entangled an infinite number of times.",
    "Gravitational Energy: Gravitational Energy is a new form of energy that harnesses the power of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by massive cosmic events, such as the collision of two black holes. This energy source would work by creating a device that can detect and manipulate gravitational waves, using them to generate power. The energy would be clean and sustainable, as it would not produce any waste or emissions, and it would be virtually limitless, as there are an infinite number of gravitational waves in the universe.",
    "Sonic Energy: Sonic Energy is a new form of energy that harnesses the power of sound waves. This energy source would work by creating a device that can generate and manipulate sound waves to generate power. The device would use the principles of piezoelectricity, which is the ability of certain materials to generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress, such as pressure or vibration. The energy would be clean and sustainable, as it would not produce any waste or emissions, and it would be virtually limitless, as there are an infinite number of sound waves in the universe.",
    "Radiant Energy: Radiant Energy is a new form of energy that harnesses the power of light. This energy source would work by creating a device that can generate and manipulate light to generate power. The device would use the principles of photovoltaics, which is the ability of certain materials to convert light into electricity. The energy would be clean and sustainable, as it would not produce any waste or emissions, and it would be virtually limitless, as there is an infinite amount of light in the universe.",
