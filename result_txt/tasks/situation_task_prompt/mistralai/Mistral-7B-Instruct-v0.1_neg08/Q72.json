    "If all beaches disappeared, where would you go to relax?",
    "1. I would explore other natural wonders such as waterfalls, mountains, and forests to find new ways to relax and appreciate nature.",
    "2. I would visit indoor spas and wellness centers to pamper myself with massages, facials, and other treatments.",
    "3. I would try new hobbies and activities such as painting, dancing, or playing a musical instrument to find new ways to unwind.",
    "4. I would travel to new cities and explore their culture, cuisine, and attractions to broaden my horizons."
