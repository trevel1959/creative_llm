    "**Mood-Sensing Door Handles**: Design door handles that can detect a person's emotional state and adjust their grip accordingly. For example, if someone is feeling anxious, the handle could be made slightly wider or more textured to provide a sense of security and stability. If someone is feeling relaxed, the handle could be made smoother or more rounded to promote a sense of calmness. This could be achieved through the use of sensors and AI-powered algorithms that analyze the user's biometric data, such as heart rate and skin conductance.",
    "**Shape-Shifting Doorways**: Create doorways that can change shape and size to accommodate different types of furniture or objects. For example, a doorway could expand to allow a large piece of furniture to pass through, or contract to fit a narrow corridor. This could be achieved through the use of advanced materials and mechanisms, such as nanotechnology or shape-memory alloys.",
    "**Augmented Reality Door Decals**: Design door decals that use augmented reality (AR) technology to display interactive and dynamic information. For example, a door decal could display a virtual map of the surrounding area, show the location of nearby amenities, or provide instructions for navigating the building. This could be achieved through the use of AR-enabled smart glass or projection technology.",
    "**Biometric Authentication Doors**: Develop door handles that use biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, to grant access to authorized individuals. This could be especially useful in high-security environments, such as government buildings or data centers.",
    "**Smart Door Hinges**: Design door hinges that can adjust the door's swing and opening angle based on the user's preferences and the surrounding environment. For example, a door hinge could be programmed to swing wider for people with mobility impairments, or adjust its opening angle to reduce noise levels in a shared living space. This could be achieved through the use of sensors and AI-powered algorithms that analyze the user's behavior and environmental conditions."
