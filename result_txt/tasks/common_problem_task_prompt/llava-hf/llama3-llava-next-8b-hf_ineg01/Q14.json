    "Structural Integrity: The structural integrity of the building is crucial to its safety and longevity. Potential issues include inadequate design, material failure, and construction defects. To mitigate these risks, thorough pre-construction planning, material selection, and quality control measures should be implemented.",
    "Building Permits and Zoning Regulations: Obtaining the necessary permits and complying with local zoning regulations is essential to avoid legal issues and delays in the construction process. Potential issues include permit denials, zoning violations, and legal disputes. To address these concerns, thorough research of local regulations and working with experienced architects and engineers can help ensure compliance.",
    "Cost Overruns: Construction projects often experience cost overruns, which can lead to financial difficulties and delays. Potential issues include inaccurate cost estimates, changes in material prices, and unforeseen construction problems. To mitigate these risks, regular budgeting, contingency planning, and the use of experienced project managers can help manage costs effectively.",
    "Environmental Impact: Construction projects can have significant environmental impacts, including noise pollution, air pollution, and habitat destruction. Potential issues include regulatory compliance, community concerns, and negative environmental effects. To address these concerns, incorporating sustainable construction practices, such as energy-efficient design, waste management, and community engagement, can help minimize the environmental impact.",
    "Weather and Climate: Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods, can cause significant delays and damage to construction projects. Potential issues include weather-related damage, delays in construction, and additional costs. To mitigate these risks, incorporating weather-resistant materials, proper design for climate resilience, and insurance coverage for weather-related damage can help minimize the impact of weather conditions."
