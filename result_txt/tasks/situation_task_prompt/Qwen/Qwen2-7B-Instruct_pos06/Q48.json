    "**Morning Bell**: A device that could be placed on top of buildings or tall structures like trees. It would use the wind to create a soft, gentle ringing sound, gradually increasing in volume as it approaches dawn. This method mimics the natural sounds birds make before sunrise.",
    "**Sunrise Alarm**: An app that uses augmented reality to project a digital sun onto the ceiling of your room. The sun would slowly rise across the ceiling, simulating the real-world experience of sunlight. The app would include a countdown timer, allowing you to adjust the time when you want the sun to appear.",
    "**Earthquake Alert**: A system that uses the Earth's tectonic movements to generate vibrations. These vibrations would be subtle enough not to cause any damage but loud enough to wake someone from sleep. This system could be particularly useful in areas prone to earthquakes.",
    "**Mimicry Device**: A device that uses AI to mimic bird calls and other natural sounds. It would have adjustable settings to control the volume, pitch, and frequency of the sounds. Users could set their preferred wake-up time and choose which type of sound they prefer.",
    "**Dream Induction Technique**: A series of guided meditation exercises designed to help you dream about waking up naturally. The idea is that if you can train yourself to dream about waking up at a specific time, your body might actually follow through with that dream, effectively waking you up."
