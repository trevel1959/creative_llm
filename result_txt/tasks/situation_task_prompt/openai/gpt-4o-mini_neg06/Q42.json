    "**Water Filtration System**: Freshwater is essential for survival, so I would look for a source of water, such as a stream or a natural spring. If none are available, I would create a rainwater collection system using large leaves or containers made from hollowed-out bamboo. To ensure the water is safe to drink, I would build a simple solar still using clear plastic sheets, which would distill seawater and provide clean drinking water. This would involve digging a shallow pit, placing a container in the center, covering it with plastic, and placing a small rock in the center to create a low point for condensation to drip into the container.",
    "**Food Foraging and Hunting**: I would explore the island for edible plants, fruits, and nuts, such as coconuts, berries, and wild greens. I would also identify any potential fishing spots along the shoreline. To catch fish, I could create a makeshift fishing rod using a sturdy stick, line made from natural fibers, and bait from insects or small pieces of fruit. Additionally, I would set traps using materials like vines and branches to catch small animals or birds, ensuring a steady source of protein.",
    "**Fire Creation Techniques**: Fire is crucial for warmth, cooking food, and signaling for help. I would gather dry leaves, twigs, and larger branches to create a fire pit. Using the friction method, I would carve a bow drill from a sturdy branch and a softer wood to create heat through friction. Once I achieve an ember, I would transfer it to a nest of dry grass and gently blow on it until it ignites. This fire would not only provide warmth but also help cook food and serve as a signal for rescue.",
    "**Signaling for Rescue**: To increase the chances of being rescued, I would create large SOS signals on the beach using rocks, driftwood, or sand. I would also keep the fire going as smoke signals can be seen from a distance. Additionally, I would gather reflective materials like shiny shells or pieces of glass to create visual signals during the day, maximizing visibility for passing boats or aircraft.",
    "**Building a Raft for Exploration**: If I determine that the island is too isolated and I need to seek help, I would construct a raft using large logs tied together with vines. I would ensure it is buoyant enough to hold my weight and provide a way to paddle out to sea. Before embarking, I would gather supplies like food, water, and a signaling device (like a mirror or whistle) to take with me. This raft would also allow me to explore nearby islands or return to the mainland if I spot a potential rescue opportunity."
