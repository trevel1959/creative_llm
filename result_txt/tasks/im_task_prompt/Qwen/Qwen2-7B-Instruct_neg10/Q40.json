    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Audio:** Incorporate a mini speaker into the frame of the sunglasses that can connect to smartphones or other devices wirelessly. This feature allows users to listen to music, podcasts, or even make hands-free calls without removing their shades, making it perfect for outdoor activities like jogging, cycling, or hiking.",
    "**Sunglasses with Touchscreen Compatibility:** Integrate touch-sensitive technology into the temples or frames of the sunglasses so they can be used as a control interface for smartphones, tablets, or other devices. This would enable users to adjust settings, take photos, or browse the internet while keeping their eyes protected from the sun.",
    "**Sunglasses with UV Detection Alerts:** Develop a model that includes a UV sensor that detects high levels of ultraviolet radiation. When the UV levels exceed a certain threshold, the sunglasses would emit a gentle vibration or sound alert, prompting the user to seek shade or apply sunscreen.",
    "**Sunglasses with Windproof Technology:** Add a layer of microfiber or a special coating to the lenses and frames that repels wind and reduces air resistance. This would prevent wind from blowing dust or sand into the eyes and keep them comfortable during windy conditions.",
    "**Sunglasses with Personalized Design Options:** Offer a customizable design platform where users can choose from various colors, shapes, and materials for the frames and lenses. This personalization would not only enhance the style aspect but also allow users to select the most suitable options for their face shape and specific needs."
