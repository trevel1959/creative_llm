    "**Urban Overcrowding and Resource Depletion**: With the entire world condensed into a single city, the population would balloon to unsustainable levels. This would lead to severe overcrowding, with people competing for basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and sanitation. The strain on resources would be catastrophic, causing widespread shortages and famine.",
    "**Loss of Biodiversity and Ecosystems**: The collapse of ecosystems and biodiversity would be a direct result of the urbanization of the entire world. The loss of natural habitats, soil degradation, and pollution would irreparably damage the planet's ecological balance, making it difficult for life to thrive.",
    "**Social and Economic Stratification**: A single city would amplify existing social and economic inequalities. The wealthy would control the majority of resources, leading to a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. This would create a rigid class system, where the privileged few hold power and the majority struggle to survive.",
    "**Cultural Homogenization and Loss of Identity**: The uniformity of a single city would lead to the erasure of cultural identities and traditions. As people from diverse backgrounds are forced to adapt to a single, dominant culture, their unique customs and practices would be lost, resulting in a homogenized, bland society.",
    "**Psychological Trauma and Mental Health Crisis**: Living in a single, massive city would take a significant toll on mental health. The constant noise, pollution, and stress would lead to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The lack of personal space and freedom would contribute to feelings of claustrophobia and hopelessness.
