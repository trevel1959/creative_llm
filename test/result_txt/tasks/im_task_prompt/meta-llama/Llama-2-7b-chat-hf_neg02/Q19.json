    "Smart Glasses: Develop a pair of glasses that can transform into a smart device, allowing users to access information, take photos, and even make video calls directly from their frames. The glasses could be equipped with a tiny OLED display, a built-in camera, and a microphone, and could be controlled using voice commands or gestures.",
    "Augmented Reality Glasses: Create a pair of glasses that can superimpose digital information onto the wearer's real-world view. The glasses could use a see-through OLED display to project digital images and text onto the wearer's field of vision, allowing them to interact with virtual objects and information in their surroundings.",
    "Glasses with Built-In Sensors: Develop a pair of glasses that can detect and monitor the wearer's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. The glasses could be equipped with sensors that can detect these signals and display them on a small OLED display, providing the wearer with real-time health data.",
    "Solar-Powered Glasses: Create a pair of glasses that can harness the power of the sun to charge other devices. The glasses could be equipped with a small solar panel that can capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which can then be used to charge other devices, such as smartphones or tablets.",
    "Glasses with Holographic Displays: Develop a pair of glasses that can display holographic images, allowing the wearer to see three-dimensional objects and images in their field of vision. The glasses could use a laser to create the holographic image, which can be viewed from different angles and can appear to float in space around the wearer."
