    "**Quantum Energy:** This type of energy would harness the principles of quantum mechanics to store and transmit energy in a highly efficient manner. Quantum entanglement would allow particles to instantly affect each other no matter the distance between them, enabling instantaneous global power distribution. This energy could be generated by manipulating quantum states of materials, potentially allowing for the creation of compact, high-output power sources.",
    "**Bio-Enhanced Solar:** This innovative energy source combines traditional solar panels with genetically modified organisms that can absorb sunlight more efficiently than plants. These organisms would have been engineered to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) directly from light, effectively creating a living, growing solar farm. The organisms could be integrated into the ground or attached to surfaces, providing a dynamic and self-replenishing energy source.",
    "**Fusion-Fission Hybrid:** Combining the high-energy density of fusion with the stability of fission, this hybrid energy system could provide a sustainable and powerful energy source. By using a small amount of highly enriched uranium or thorium as a catalyst, the system would initiate fusion reactions within a compact, controlled environment. The resulting heat would then be used to produce electricity through a series of turbines and generators, offering a clean alternative to current nuclear technologies.",
    "**Geothermal Vortex Energy:** This concept would tap into the natural convection currents found in the Earth's core to generate energy. By drilling deep boreholes into the earth and placing turbines within them, the system would harness the kinetic energy of the heated water and steam moving upwards due to temperature differences. This would create a continuous vortex motion, which could be harnessed to produce electricity. The system would be designed to maintain stable temperatures and prevent any environmental impact.",
    "**Intergalactic Space Dust Collection:** While ambitious, this idea proposes collecting intergalactic space dust, composed primarily of carbon and silicon, which are essential elements for life and industrial applications. By deploying large-scale collectors in orbit around Earth or using specialized spacecraft to intercept dust clouds, the collected material could be refined and utilized as a renewable energy source. For instance, the carbon could be converted into graphene, which has excellent conductivity and could be used in energy storage devices, while the silicon could be processed into photovoltaic cells for generating electricity."
