    "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: One possible solution to power vehicles without oil is to utilize hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, producing only water and heat as byproducts. This technology has the potential to provide a clean and efficient source of energy for transportation.",
    "Solar Power: Another option is to harness the power of the sun to fuel vehicles. Solar panels could be installed on roads or in designated areas, capturing sunlight and converting it into electricity to charge electric vehicles. This method would provide a renewable and sustainable source of energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Nuclear Power: Nuclear power plants could be used to generate electricity for vehicles. Nuclear power produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making it a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Additionally, the energy density of nuclear power makes it a viable option for long-distance travel.",
    "Advanced Batteries: Advances in battery technology could lead to more efficient and affordable energy storage solutions. Improved battery technology could power electric vehicles for longer distances, reducing the need for frequent charging stops. This would make electric vehicles more practical for long-distance travel and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Biofuels: Biofuels, such as algae-based fuels, could provide a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Algae can be grown in large quantities and converted into fuel, offering a renewable source of energy. Additionally, algae can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This approach could provide a long-term solution for sustainable transportation."
