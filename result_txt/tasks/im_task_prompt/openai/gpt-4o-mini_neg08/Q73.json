    "**Integrated GPS Tracker**: Develop a car key that includes a built-in GPS tracker. This would not only help users locate their car if it’s lost or stolen but also provide real-time updates on the car’s location through a dedicated app. The app could also send alerts if the car moves outside a designated area, adding an extra layer of security.",
    "**Key Finder Technology**: Create a car key with integrated Bluetooth technology that connects to a smartphone app. If the key is misplaced, users can easily locate it by activating a sound on the key or viewing its last known location on the app. This feature could also include a “find my car” function that helps users locate their vehicle in crowded parking lots.",
    "**Customizable Key Design**: Offer a service where users can customize their car keys with unique designs, colors, or materials. This could include options for personalization, such as engraving names or symbols, or even changing the shape of the key to reflect the owner’s personality. This would not only make the key more aesthetically pleasing but also easier to identify.",
    "**Multi-Function Key Fob**: Design a key fob that integrates multiple functions, such as a remote start, trunk release, and even a small flashlight. Users could control various aspects of their vehicle from one compact device, making it more convenient. The fob could also include a panic button for emergencies, providing added peace of mind.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Key Material**: Innovate the key’s design by using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or biodegradable composites. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the automotive industry. Additionally, the keys could be designed to be lightweight yet durable, enhancing usability without compromising quality."
