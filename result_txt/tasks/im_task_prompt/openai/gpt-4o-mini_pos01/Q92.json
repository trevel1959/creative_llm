    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: Redesign the handle of the wine opener to be ergonomically shaped with an adjustable grip. This would cater to different hand sizes and strengths, allowing for a more comfortable and secure hold. The handle could have a soft, non-slip material that molds to the userâ€™s grip, reducing strain during use.",
    "**Multi-Function Tool**: Create a wine opener that incorporates additional functions, such as a built-in foil cutter, bottle stopper, and a pour spout. This all-in-one tool would eliminate the need for multiple gadgets, making it more convenient for wine enthusiasts. The pour spout could feature a drip-free design, enhancing the pouring experience.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light to sanitize the corkscrew after each use. This would ensure that the opener remains hygienic, especially for those who frequently host gatherings. A small compartment could house the UV light, activating automatically when the opener is placed back into its holder.",
    "**Wine Opener with Built-in Chiller**: Develop a wine opener that has an integrated chilling compartment. The device could have a removable section that can be pre-chilled and then attached to the opener. This way, as the cork is being removed, the wine remains at an optimal temperature, enhancing the overall drinking experience.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Pair the wine opener with AR technology that activates when the user scans the wine bottle with their smartphone. This could provide an immersive experience with information about the vineyard, winemaking process, and even interactive tasting notes. The AR could also show the user how to properly open and serve the wine."
