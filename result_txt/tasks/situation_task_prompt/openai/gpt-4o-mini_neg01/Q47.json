    "**Sunscreen Infused Head Wraps**: Create a collection of head wraps that are infused with sunscreen properties. These wraps would be made from a special fabric that releases SPF as it comes into contact with skin, providing continuous protection. They could come in various colors and patterns, allowing for personal expression while keeping the scalp protected.",
    "**Cooling Gel Scalp Balm**: Develop a soothing scalp balm with SPF that can be applied directly to the skin. This balm would not only protect against sunburn but also contain cooling agents like aloe vera and menthol to provide relief from heat. The balm could be packaged in a convenient, portable stick form, making it easy to apply on the go.",
    "**Interactive Sun Protection App**: Create an app that reminds users to apply sun protection based on their location and UV index. The app could feature a virtual assistant that suggests the best protective gear (like hats or scarves) based on the weather, and even offers reminders to reapply sunscreen throughout the day.",
    "**Wearable UV Detection Device**: Invent a stylish bracelet or headband that monitors UV exposure in real-time. This device would alert the wearer when they are at risk of overexposure, allowing them to take action by applying sunscreen or seeking shade. The design could be fashionable, blending seamlessly with everyday wear.",
    "**Sustainable Sun-Protection Scarves**: Launch a line of eco-friendly scarves made from recycled materials that are specifically designed to block UV rays. These scarves could be lightweight and breathable, perfect for wrapping around the head or neck. The fabric would be treated with a special UV-blocking technology, ensuring maximum protection while being kind to the planet."
