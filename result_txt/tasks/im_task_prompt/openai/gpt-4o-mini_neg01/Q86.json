    "**Customizable Seating and Support**: Design a modular seating system that allows users to customize the seat's shape, height, and support based on their specific needs and preferences. This could include adjustable lumbar support, heated seats, or even memory foam padding that conforms to the user’s body, enhancing comfort during long periods of use.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Source**: Develop a wheelchair powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or kinetic energy converters. For instance, solar panels could be integrated into the wheelchair's frame, while a kinetic energy recovery system could harness energy from the user’s movements to recharge the battery, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on traditional power sources.",
    "**Smart Health Monitoring**: Equip the wheelchair with sensors that monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data could be synced to a smartphone app or shared with healthcare providers in real-time, allowing for better health management and timely interventions if any abnormalities are detected.",
    "**Interactive Control Interface**: Create a touchless control system that allows users to operate the wheelchair using gestures or voice commands. This could enhance accessibility for users with limited hand mobility and provide a more intuitive way to navigate, change speed, or activate features without needing to physically manipulate controls.",
    "**Community Connection Platform**: Develop a built-in communication system that connects users with local support networks, events, and resources. This could include a digital platform where users can share experiences, find companionship, and receive information about accessible activities in their area, fostering a sense of community and belonging."
