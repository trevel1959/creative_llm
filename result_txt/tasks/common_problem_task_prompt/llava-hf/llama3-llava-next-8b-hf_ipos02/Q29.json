    "Water Pressure: The second potential problem is the extreme water pressure at depth. This pressure can cause damage to the submersible's hull, leading to leaks and potential loss of air supply.",
    "Communication: The third potential problem is communication with the surface. Due to the pressure and distance from the surface, communication with the surface can be challenging, and there is a risk of losing contact with the crew.",
    "Oxygen Supply: The fourth potential problem is the limited oxygen supply on board the submersible. As the mission progresses, the crew's air supply may run low, leading to a risk of running out of air.",
    "Emergency Situations: The fifth potential problem is the potential for emergency situations, such as equipment failure, injuries, or even an emergency escape from the submersible. The crew must be prepared to handle these situations and have contingency plans in place.",
    "Environmental Factors: The sixth potential problem is the impact of environmental factors, such as strong currents, underwater hazards, and the possibility of encountering marine life that could pose a threat to the crew or the submersible."
