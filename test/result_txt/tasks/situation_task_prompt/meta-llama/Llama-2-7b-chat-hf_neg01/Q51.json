    "Amphibious Vehicle: Design an amphibious vehicle that can drive on land and float on water. This vehicle could be powered by electric or solar energy to reduce its carbon footprint. It could have multiple compartments to accommodate different modes of transportation, such as bicycles, kayaks, or even pets.",
    "Riverwalk Tunnels: Build a network of tunnels under the river that would allow people to walk or bike through the water. These tunnels could be designed with transparent walls to provide an immersive experience, and could be equipped with lighting and ventilation systems to ensure safety.",
    "Floating Islands: Create floating islands that can be anchored to the riverbed or moored to the shore. These islands could be covered in vegetation and trees, providing a natural habitat for wildlife. They could also be designed with recreational spaces, such as parks or beaches, to allow people to enjoy the river from a safe distance.",
    "River Cargo Systems: Develop a cargo system that utilizes the river's water flow to transport goods. This system could include floating containers or barges that are propelled by the river's current, reducing the need for fuel-powered transportation. This could help reduce carbon emissions and improve the environment.",
    "Aquatic Robotics: Create a network of underwater robots that can transport people and goods across the river. These robots could be powered by electricity or solar energy and could be designed to navigate through the river's currents and obstacles. They could also be equipped with sensors and cameras to provide real-time information about the river's conditions and wildlife."
