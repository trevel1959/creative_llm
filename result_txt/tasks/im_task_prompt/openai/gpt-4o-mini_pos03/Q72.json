    "**Integrated Solar-Powered Navigation System**: Embed a lightweight solar panel on the top surface of the surfboard, connected to a small GPS unit. This system could help surfers track their location, find optimal surfing spots, and provide real-time weather updates. Additionally, the GPS could include a feature to log surfing sessions, allowing surfers to analyze their performance over time.",
    "**Hydrodynamic Channels**: Design the bottom of the surfboard with adjustable hydrodynamic channels that can be changed based on the surf conditions. These channels could be slid or locked into different configurations, allowing surfers to customize their board for more speed in small waves or better grip in larger swells.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a surfboard made entirely from biodegradable materials, such as plant-based resins and sustainable wood. This eco-friendly approach would reduce the environmental impact of traditional surfboard manufacturing while still providing durability and performance. The board could also feature a modular design that allows parts to be easily replaced when damaged.",
    "**Smart Surfboard with Performance Analytics**: Integrate sensors into the surfboard that measure speed, angle, and movement. This data could be transmitted to a companion app, providing surfers with insights into their performance, including tips for improvement and the ability to share sessions with friends. The app could also offer a virtual coach feature, suggesting techniques based on collected data.",
    "**Magnetic Fin System**: Introduce a magnetic fin attachment system that allows surfers to quickly swap out fins based on their preferences or wave conditions. This would eliminate the hassle of screws and tools, making it easier for surfers to customize their setup on the go. The fins could also be designed with varying shapes and materials to enhance different aspects of performance."
