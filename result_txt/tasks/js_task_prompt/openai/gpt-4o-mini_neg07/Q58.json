This could lead to a society where people are more willing to take chances, knowing they won’t be haunted by what could have been. On the flip side, regret often serves as a learning tool, prompting personal growth and better decision-making in the future. Without it, people might be less reflective and more prone to repeating the same mistakes.",

Without it, there might be a decline in empathy and responsibility.",
