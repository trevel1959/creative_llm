    "**Modular Skateboard Design**:    Create a skateboard with a modular design that allows riders to easily swap out parts such as wheels, trucks, and decks. This would enable customization based on riding style, whether for street skating, cruising, or tricks. Riders could purchase a basic frame and then select components that suit their preferences, allowing for a more personalized and adaptable skating experience.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Bamboo Skateboard**:    Develop a skateboard made entirely from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics. Bamboo is not only strong and lightweight but also environmentally friendly. By promoting eco-consciousness, this skateboard could appeal to environmentally aware consumers. Additionally, it could feature a design that highlights the natural beauty of bamboo, making each board unique.",
    "**Built-in LED Lights and Sound System**:    Integrate LED lights into the skateboard deck that can change colors based on speed or music. This would make night skating safer and more visually appealing. Additionally, a compact Bluetooth sound system could be embedded within the skateboard, allowing riders to listen to music or podcasts while skating. This feature could enhance the overall experience and make it more fun for social gatherings.",
    "**Skateboard with Adjustable Suspension System**:    Introduce a skateboard with an adjustable suspension system that can adapt to different terrains. This would allow riders to easily switch between a hard, rigid setup for tricks and a softer, cushioned setup for cruising over rough surfaces. The suspension could be controlled via a simple mechanism, enabling riders to fine-tune their board for maximum comfort and performance.",
    "**Safety Gear Integration**:    Design a skateboard that comes with integrated safety features, such as a helmet that fits snugly onto the skateboard or knee and elbow pads that attach magnetically to the board when not in use. This would promote safety and encourage new riders to wear protective gear without the hassle of carrying it separately. The helmet could also have built-in Bluetooth for music and communication."
