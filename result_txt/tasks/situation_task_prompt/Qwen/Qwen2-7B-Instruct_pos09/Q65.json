    "**Bioluminescent Wall Panels**: Designing a wall panel that uses bioluminescent algae or fungi to emit light. These panels can be installed like regular wall tiles, and when turned on, they provide a soft, ambient glow. This idea not only provides lighting but also adds a touch of nature to the space.",
    "**Infrared Light Emitting Clothing**: Creating a set of clothing items that are infused with infrared LED lights. The garments could be worn by individuals, and when activated, their movement creates a pattern of light in the room, effectively illuminating it. This concept could be particularly appealing for creating a dynamic and interactive lighting experience.",
    "**Luminous Paint**: Developing a type of paint that incorporates phosphorescent pigments which absorb light during the day and emit a glow at night. This could be applied to walls, ceilings, and even furniture, providing a gentle, continuous light source without the need for electricity.",
    "**Interactive Solar-Powered Lamps**: Building solar-powered lamps that use motion sensors to detect activity in the room. When someone enters the space, the lamp automatically turns on and adjusts its brightness based on the level of light outside. This not only conserves energy but also adds an element of surprise and convenience.",
    "**Optical Fiber Art**: Using optical fibers as a lighting medium, which can be woven into curtains, suspended from the ceiling, or integrated into wall art. Optical fibers collect and distribute light in intricate patterns, creating a visually stunning and calming effect in the room. This idea can be customized to suit various aesthetic preferences and can be used in both residential and commercial settings."
