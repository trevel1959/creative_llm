    "**Smart Laundry Basket**: Design a smart laundry basket that integrates with your smartphone through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity. The basket can track the number of clothes inside, alert you when it's full, remind you when it's time to wash the clothes, and even suggest the best washing cycle based on the type of clothes you have. It could also have an integrated air purifier to freshen up the clothes before they are put away.",
    "**Personalized Laundry Basket**: Create a personalized laundry basket where each family member has their own color-coded basket. This helps in sorting clothes more efficiently by color and type (e.g., whites, darks, delicates). Each basket can have a name tag or a QR code for easy identification. Additionally, you could add a small digital display that shows how many items are inside each basket, promoting better organization and cleanliness.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Laundry Basket**: Develop a laundry basket made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, or organic cotton. This basket would be durable, lightweight, and eco-friendly, reducing waste and promoting environmental consciousness. You could also include a small compartment within the basket to store detergent pods or powder, encouraging users to use less water and energy during washing.",
    "**Portable Laundry Basket**: Design a compact, collapsible laundry basket that can be easily carried around. This is particularly useful for dorm rooms, apartments, or anyone who needs to transport laundry between multiple locations without taking up too much space. The basket could also feature a handle and a strap system for easy carrying, along with compartments for separating different types of clothing.",
    "**Interactive Laundry Basket App**: Create an app that works in conjunction with the smart laundry basket mentioned earlier. The app could provide a visual interface to monitor the status of your laundry, suggest eco-friendly washing practices, and even offer tips for ironing and folding clothes. It could also include a feature to connect with local laundry services or delivery options, making it easier for busy individuals to manage their laundry tasks."
