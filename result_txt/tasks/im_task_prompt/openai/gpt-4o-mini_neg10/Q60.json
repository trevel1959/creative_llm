    "**Multi-Purpose Towel with Built-in Pockets**: Design a towel that includes discreet, waterproof pockets for storing essentials like keys, a phone, or cash while at the beach or pool. This would eliminate the need for carrying a separate bag and allow users to enjoy their time hands-free, while also keeping their valuables safe and dry.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Towel Technology**: Incorporate advanced nanotechnology that allows towels to clean themselves. Using a special coating that repels dirt and bacteria, these towels would remain fresh and hygienic longer, reducing the frequency of washes and extending the towel's lifespan.",
    "**Mood-Enhancing Aromatherapy Towel**: Infuse towels with microcapsules of essential oils that release pleasant fragrances when the towel is used. This would provide a calming experience post-bath or shower, turning a simple drying-off routine into a sensory spa experience. Users could choose from various scents to match their mood.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Towel with Plant-Based Dyes**: Create towels made from sustainable materials dyed with natural, plant-based colors. This eco-conscious option would appeal to environmentally aware consumers and promote sustainability while providing vibrant, unique designs that stand out.",
    "**Interactive Towel with QR Codes**: Each towel could come with a unique QR code that, when scanned, provides users with a variety of content such as yoga routines, workout tips, or self-care practices. This would turn a simple towel into a gateway for wellness and fitness inspiration, encouraging users to engage in healthy habits."
