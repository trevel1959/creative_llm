    "**Virtual Reality Time Capsules**: Imagine a world where we've developed a technology that allows us to record and relive memories in vivid detail. With VR time capsules, we could relive historical events, reunite with loved ones who've passed away, and even re-experience personal milestones. These capsules would be encoded with sensory information, allowing us to feel the emotions, sights, and sounds of a bygone era. We could access them through a neural interface, transporting us back in time to relive the past.",
