    "**Smart Shades**: Develop a pair of smart sunglasses that can change color, shape, or tint based on the user's mood, environment, or activity. The frames could be embedded with sensors that detect the user's heart rate, skin temperature, or surrounding light conditions, and adjust the lenses accordingly. For example, if the user is feeling stressed, the lenses could shift to a calming blue hue, while a bright red color could be triggered for a high-energy workout.",
    "**Virtual Try-On**: Create a platform that allows users to virtually try on different sunglasses styles and colors using augmented reality (AR) technology. Users could upload a photo of themselves, select a pair of sunglasses from a virtual catalog, and see how they would look in real-time. This feature would enable users to try on multiple styles without having to physically visit a store or receive multiple pairs in the mail.",
    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Air Quality Sensors**: Design a pair of sunglasses that includes built-in air quality sensors, which can detect pollutants, particulate matter, and other airborne contaminants. The sensors could provide real-time feedback to the user, alerting them to potential health risks and suggesting ways to improve indoor or outdoor air quality. This feature could be particularly useful for people living in urban areas or those who spend a lot of time outdoors.",
    "**Sunglasses with Integrated Hearing Aids**: Develop a pair of sunglasses that includes discreet hearing aids, allowing users to amplify sound and improve their hearing in noisy environments. The hearing aids could be designed to work in conjunction with the sunglasses' audio features, such as a built-in speaker or microphone, to provide a more immersive audio experience.",
    "**Sunglasses with Built-in Camera and Object Recognition**: Create a pair of sunglasses that includes a built-in camera and object recognition software, allowing users to identify objects, people, or environments in real-time. This feature could be useful for people with visual impairments, as well as those who want to enhance their daily experiences, such as identifying products on store shelves or recognizing friends in a crowd."
