    "**Rogue Solar Sailing**: Utilizing the power of solar energy, a solar sail could be constructed to take advantage of the sun's light pressure. By adjusting its sail orientation to the sun's position, it can steer its course towards its destination, using only sunlight. This method of traveling would be highly experimental, but could potentially be an energy-efficient way to traverse the seas.",
    "**Underwater Tunneling**: If the oceans were too vast for an underwater journey, you could consider tunneling beneath the ocean floor to connect continents. This hypothetical tunneling technology would allow for large-scale transportation of goods and people across bodies of water, eliminating the need for water transportation.",
    "**Sea-Based Superhighways**: In a post-plane world, superhighways might be extended underwater, connecting major cities across oceans. These submerged superhighways would be equipped with advanced infrastructure for seamless transportation and could cater to both cargo and passenger needs.",
    "**Space Elevator**: With spacecraft being the primary means of travel, a space elevator could be constructed in the atmosphere to deliver travelers and cargo between Earth and outer space. This futuristic technology would completely revolutionize space travel, allowing for fast and efficient transport without the need for rockets.",
    "**Mastodons and Elephant Transportation**: Considering the size of larger extant land animals, such as the elephant and the mastodon, transporting goods and even passengers over long distances might become possible again. By utilizing their immense strength and resilience, these animals could bear heavy loads and be harnessed for long-range transportation over land."
