    "**Smart Contactless Glasses**: In the absence of traditional glasses and contact lenses, a new type of smart eyewear could emerge. These glasses would be lightweight, frameless, and made from flexible materials that conform to the wearer's face. They would use augmented reality (AR) technology to project visual information directly into the user's field of vision. By analyzing the environment and the userâ€™s focus, the glasses could enhance clarity and detail in real-time, providing a tailored visual experience. Users could control the level of enhancement through a smartphone app, adjusting settings for different tasks or lighting conditions.",
    "**Biomimetic Eye Drops**: Scientists could develop eye drops that contain nanobots designed to temporarily enhance vision. These drops would work by repairing and optimizing the eye's natural functions, improving focus and clarity. Users would simply apply the drops as needed, allowing for temporary visual correction without the need for glasses or lenses. The drops could also be formulated with nutrients to promote long-term eye health, offering a dual benefit for users with poor vision.",
    "**Vision Training Pods**: To help people adapt to their new reality, specialized vision training pods could be created. These pods would be equipped with virtual reality (VR) technology that simulates various visual scenarios, allowing users to train their eyes and brain to improve focus and depth perception. Users could engage in games and exercises designed to strengthen their visual acuity over time. The pods could be placed in community centers or schools, making them accessible for everyone and promoting a culture of eye health and fitness.",
    "**Adaptive Vision Wearables**: A new line of wearable technology could be developed, resembling a combination of smartwatches and headsets. These devices would use cameras and advanced algorithms to analyze the user's surroundings, then provide auditory cues or haptic feedback to help them navigate the world more effectively. For instance, the device could alert users to obstacles, provide directions, or even describe objects in their vicinity, empowering those with poor vision to maintain independence and confidence in their daily lives.",
    "**Community Vision Sharing Programs**: In a world without glasses or contact lenses, communities could establish vision-sharing programs where individuals with good vision volunteer to assist those with poor vision. This initiative could involve pairing volunteers with those in need for daily activities, such as shopping or attending events. Additionally, technology could facilitate virtual partnerships, where people with good vision provide guidance through video calls or apps, helping others navigate their environments more easily. This program would not only enhance mobility but also foster social connections and support networks."
