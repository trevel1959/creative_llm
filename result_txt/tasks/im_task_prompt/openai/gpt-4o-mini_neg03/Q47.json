    "**Multi-Surface Adaptability**: Design a vacuum cleaner with adjustable suction power and brush types that can automatically detect the surface itâ€™s cleaning. For instance, when transitioning from hardwood to carpet, the vacuum could adjust its suction and brush speed for optimal cleaning performance. This feature would ensure that each surface is treated appropriately, improving overall cleaning efficiency and preserving the integrity of different flooring types.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Incorporate a self-cleaning feature that allows the vacuum to clean its brushes and filters after each use. This could be achieved through a built-in cleaning station that uses water and specialized brushes to remove hair, dust, and debris. Not only would this maintain the vacuum's performance, but it would also reduce the need for manual maintenance by the user.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Design**: Develop a vacuum cleaner made from sustainable materials and designed for energy efficiency. This could include using biodegradable plastics, recyclable components, and a low-energy motor. Additionally, the vacuum could have a mode that uses less power for lighter cleaning tasks, allowing users to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint.",
    "**Integrated Air Purifier**: Create a vacuum cleaner that also functions as an air purifier. By adding a HEPA filter and an activated carbon layer, the vacuum could capture allergens and odors while cleaning the floors. This dual function would not only provide cleaner floors but also improve indoor air quality, making it particularly appealing for households with pets or allergy sufferers.",
    "**Personalized Cleaning Profiles**: Allow users to create personalized cleaning profiles for different areas of their home. For example, a \"Pet Area\" profile could increase suction power and brush rotation speed to tackle pet hair, while a \"Living Room\" profile could focus on gentle cleaning for delicate rugs. This customization would make the vacuum cleaner more versatile and efficient for various cleaning needs."
