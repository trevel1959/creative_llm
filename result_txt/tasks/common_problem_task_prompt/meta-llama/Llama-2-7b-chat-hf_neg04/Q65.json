    "Modular Smartphone: Create a smartphone that allows users to swap out modules for different purposes. For instance, a user may want a camera module for photography, a gaming module for gaming, or a productivity module for work. Each module would be designed to work seamlessly with the phone's core components, such as the processor and battery. This would allow users to customize their phone to suit their specific needs and interests, making it a highly versatile and personalized device.",
    "Holographic Display Smartphone: Design a smartphone with a holographic display that projects 3D images and videos. The display would use laser technology to create a 3D image that appears to float in mid-air, providing an immersive and interactive experience for users. This would be particularly useful for gaming, entertainment, and communication, as users could interact with holographic objects and avatars in real-time.",
    "Bendable Smartphone: Create a smartphone with a flexible, bendable display that can be bent and shaped to suit the user's preferences. This would allow users to customize the shape and size of their phone, making it more comfortable to hold and use. The bendable display would also enable new forms of interaction, such as using the phone as a stylus or a virtual keyboard.",
    "Self-Healing Smartphone: Design a smartphone with a self-healing display that can repair itself in the event of damage. The display would be made of a special material that can repair cracks and scratches on its own, reducing the need for frequent repairs and replacements. This would be particularly useful for users who are prone to dropping their phones or exposing them to rough conditions.",
    "Quantum Computing Smartphone: Create a smartphone that utilizes quantum computing technology to provide unparalleled processing power and security. The phone would use quantum-resistant cryptography to protect user data and applications, and would be capable of processing complex calculations and simulations that are currently beyond the capabilities of traditional smartphones. This would make it an ideal device for scientists, researchers, and other professionals who require advanced computing capabilities on the go."
