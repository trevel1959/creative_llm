    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Robots require a reliable power source. Insufficient battery life or inefficient energy consumption can hinder performance. To solve this, integrating solar panels or exploring advanced battery technologies, like solid-state batteries, could enhance longevity and reduce downtime.",
    "**Programming Challenges**: Developing the software to control the robot can be daunting, especially if the tasks are intricate or require real-time processing. This could lead to bugs or inefficiencies. To mitigate this, employing agile development practices and continuous testing can help refine the code and improve functionality iteratively.",
    "**Sensor Integration**: A robot's effectiveness often relies on its ability to perceive its environment through sensors. Incompatibility between sensors and the robot's processing unit can lead to inaccurate data collection. A solution could involve using standardized protocols for sensor integration, ensuring compatibility and simplifying the development process.",
    "**User Interface Design**: If the robot is intended for use by non-experts, a complicated user interface can be a barrier to usability. This can lead to user frustration and decreased adoption rates. To enhance user experience, employing intuitive design principles and conducting user testing can create a more accessible interface that caters to a wider audience.",
    "**Safety and Compliance Issues**: Robots operating in public spaces or alongside humans must adhere to safety regulations to prevent accidents. Failing to comply can lead to legal issues and public backlash. To navigate this, conducting thorough risk assessments and engaging with regulatory bodies early in the design process can ensure compliance and enhance safety measures."
