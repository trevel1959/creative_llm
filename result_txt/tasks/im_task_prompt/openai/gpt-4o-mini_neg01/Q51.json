    "**Modular Design for Versatility**: Create a table assistant with a modular design that allows users to customize its components based on their needs. For example, it could include interchangeable sections for different functions, such as a food warmer, a wine cooler, or a snack dispenser. Users could easily swap out modules depending on whether they are hosting a casual gathering or a formal dinner party, making the assistant adaptable to various social settings.",
    "**Interactive Display with Augmented Reality**: Equip the table assistant with an interactive touchscreen display that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology. Users could project recipes, wine pairings, or even 3D models of dishes directly onto the table surface. This feature could make cooking and serving more engaging, as users could visualize how their meal will look or receive step-by-step instructions right in front of them.",
    "**Built-in Cleaning Mechanism**: Introduce a self-cleaning feature that uses UV light or steam to sanitize the table assistant after meals. This would be especially beneficial for families or individuals who prioritize hygiene. The assistant could also have a spill detection system that automatically activates the cleaning mechanism when it senses liquid on its surface, ensuring that the area remains tidy and safe.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Energy Sources**: Design the table assistant using sustainable materials, such as bamboo or recycled plastics, and incorporate solar panels to power its features. This would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and reduce the carbon footprint of the product. Additionally, the assistant could provide tips on sustainable dining practices, such as portion control or composting, to encourage eco-friendly habits.",
    "**Social Integration Features**: Enhance the table assistant with social media integration, allowing users to share their dining experiences directly from the device. It could include a camera for taking photos of meals and a feature for posting recipes or hosting virtual dinner parties with friends and family. This would create a sense of community around dining and encourage users to engage with others about their culinary adventures."
