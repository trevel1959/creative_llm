    "**Self-Cleaning Mechanism**: Design a hair dryer with a self-cleaning filter system. Dust and hair can accumulate in the dryer, affecting performance and hygiene. A small compartment could automatically clean itself using a combination of airflow and a rotating brush mechanism, ensuring that the dryer remains efficient and easy to maintain without requiring user intervention.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Adjustable Grip**: Create a hair dryer that features an ergonomic design with an adjustable grip. The handle could be designed to fit various hand sizes comfortably, and it could include a swivel feature that allows the user to rotate the dryer without straining their wrist. This would make it easier to dry hair from different angles, reducing fatigue during use.",
    "**Multi-Function Attachments**: Develop a hair dryer that comes with a variety of multi-function attachments, such as a diffuser for curls, a straightening comb, and a volumizing nozzle. Each attachment could have its own heat settings and airflow adjustments, allowing users to style their hair in different ways without needing multiple tools. The attachments could be easily swapped out and stored in a dedicated compartment within the dryer.",
    "**Integrated Ionic Technology**: Incorporate advanced ionic technology that emits negative ions while drying hair. This would help to reduce frizz and enhance shine by neutralizing static electricity in the hair. The dryer could have a setting that allows users to control the level of ionic output based on their hair type and desired style, providing a more tailored drying experience.",
    "**Built-In Hair Care Infuser**: Design a hair dryer that includes a built-in infuser for hair care products. Users could fill a small reservoir with their favorite hair oils or serums, and as they dry their hair, the dryer would gently mist these products onto the hair. This would allow for a convenient way to nourish and protect hair while styling, eliminating the need for separate application."
