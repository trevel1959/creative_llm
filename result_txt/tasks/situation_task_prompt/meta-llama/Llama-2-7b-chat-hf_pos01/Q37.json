    "Use a reverse-functioning bicycle: Design a bicycle with the pedals on the back wheel and the seat on the front. This way, you can pedal backwards to move forward. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Create a reverse-walking device: Design a device that allows you to walk backwards while keeping your balance. This could be achieved by attaching a harness to the waist and having a set of retractable poles that push against the ground, providing stability. (Confidence Score: 0.9)",
    "Use a reverse-propulsion system: Develop a system that uses a fan or a propeller to create a force that propels you backwards. This could be attached to a wheelchair or a vehicle, allowing you to move around with ease. (Confidence Score: 0.8)",
    "Develop a reverse-steering system: Design a vehicle or a wheelchair with steering wheels on the back instead of the front. This way, you can steer the vehicle by turning the back wheels, allowing you to move backwards. (Confidence Score: 0.7)",
    "Use a reverse-gravitational device: Create a device that generates a reverse gravitational force, allowing you to move upwards instead of downwards. This could be achieved through the use of magnets or a specialized gravitational field. (Confidence Score: 0.6)"
