    "Community-based healthcare: In the absence of doctors and medical facilities, communities could come together to provide mutual aid and support for their members' health needs. Neighbors could share knowledge and resources, such as herbal remedies, homeopathic treatments, and traditional healing practices.",
    "DIY health monitoring: With no access to medical equipment, individuals could use DIY tools and apps to monitor their vital signs and track their health. For example, they could use a smartphone app to measure their blood pressure, or create a simple stethoscope using a paper clip and a plastic bottle.",
    "Telemedicine networks: Without access to traditional medical facilities, people could connect with each other through telemedicine networks. These networks could be created using social media platforms, messaging apps, or even simple radio communications. Members could share their health experiences, ask questions, and offer support to one another.",
    "Nature-based healing: In the absence of modern medicine, people could turn to nature-based healing practices such as forest bathing, earthing, and hydrotherapy. These practices involve spending time in nature to promote physical and mental well-being, and could be an effective way to manage chronic conditions such as stress and anxiety.",
    "Bartering and trade: In a world without doctors or medical facilities, people could use bartering and trade to acquire the medical supplies they need. For example, someone with a talent for herbalism could trade their remedies for food or other essential goods, or a skilled craftsperson could create medical equipment in exchange for services or goods. This system could help to create a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system, where people contribute their unique skills and resources to support each other's well-being."
