    "**The Great Resource Shift**: With immortality, people would no longer be bound by the constraints of time. They could accumulate wealth, knowledge, and experiences at an exponential rate, leading to a massive shift in global resources. The concept of retirement and inheritance would become obsolete, as individuals would continue to work and accumulate wealth indefinitely.
