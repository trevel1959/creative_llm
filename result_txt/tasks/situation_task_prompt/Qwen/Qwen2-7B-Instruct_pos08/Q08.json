    "**Innovative Water Filtration Device**: Develop a portable, high-tech water filtration device that uses advanced nanotechnology to remove pollutants from contaminated water. The device could be compact enough to carry in a backpack or attach to a water bottle, making it accessible for daily use. It could include features like solar power for energy, a built-in test strip to verify water purity, and an app that provides real-time data on water quality.",
    "**Aquaponics System**: Create an aquaponics system where fish waste is used to fertilize plants, and the plants filter the water. This closed-loop system would produce both edible plants and clean water, making it a sustainable solution for obtaining clean drinking water. The system can be designed to operate off-grid using renewable energy sources, such as solar panels.",
    "**Water Purification via Plant Absorption**: Utilize certain plants' natural ability to absorb heavy metals and other contaminants from water through their roots. Develop a method of growing these plants in tanks filled with contaminated water, allowing them to extract impurities while providing oxygen to the water. Once grown, the plants can be harvested and the water can be further treated with traditional methods like distillation or reverse osmosis.",
    "**Community-Driven Water Filtration Stations**: Set up community-based water filtration stations that are accessible to everyone. These stations can use low-cost technologies like sand filters, UV light, or chemical treatments (like adding chlorine or iodine) to purify water. They can be easily maintained by local volunteers, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure. Additionally, these stations can also serve as educational hubs to teach community members about water conservation and pollution prevention.",
    "**Water Purification Capsule**: Design a capsule-shaped device that can be dropped into contaminated water bodies like lakes or rivers. The capsule contains microorganisms and enzymes specifically engineered to break down pollutants and toxins in the water. Once activated, the capsule releases these organisms, which then work to clean the water within hours. This method is non-invasive and could be used to rapidly treat large bodies of water affected by pollution. "
