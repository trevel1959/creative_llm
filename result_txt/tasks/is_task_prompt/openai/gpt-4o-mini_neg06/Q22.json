    "In a quiet meadow, a curious bunny named Thistle discovered an ancient pocket watch buried beneath a clover patch. With a twitch of his nose, he accidentally activated it, whisking him back to the age of dinosaurs. Thistle marveled at towering ferns and gigantic creatures, narrowly escaping a hungry T-Rex. As he learned to navigate this prehistoric world, he befriended a baby triceratops, who showed him the secrets of survival. Together, they raced through time, hopping to different eras, from medieval castles to futuristic cities. Ultimately, Thistle returned home, forever changed, with stories that would enchant bunnies for generations.",
