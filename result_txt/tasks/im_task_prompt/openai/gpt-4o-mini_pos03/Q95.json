    "**Collapsible and Modular Design**: A laundry basket that can collapse into a flat shape for easy storage when not in use. Additionally, it could have modular sections that can be detached or added based on your needs. For example, you could have a section for delicates, another for colors, and a third for whites. This way, you can sort your laundry as you go, making it easier to transport to the washing machine.",
    "**Integrated Odor Neutralization System**: This laundry basket could feature a built-in odor neutralization system using activated charcoal or a small UV light that helps eliminate odors from dirty clothes. This would be especially useful for those who may not do laundry as frequently or have workout clothes that tend to retain smells. The basket could also have a replaceable filter to maintain effectiveness over time.",
    "**Interactive Sorting System**: A high-tech laundry basket that uses RFID tags to identify the types of clothing placed inside it. As you toss clothes in, the basket could suggest sorting options based on fabric type, color, or washing instructions, displaying these options on a small screen or through an app. This feature could help prevent color bleeding and ensure proper care for different materials.",
    "**Built-in Folding Mechanism**: A laundry basket that not only holds clothes but also assists in folding them once they come out of the dryer. The design could include a flat, folding surface with integrated guides and a mechanism that helps you fold shirts, pants, and towels with minimal effort. This would save time and keep your clothes organized right out of the dryer.",
    "**Multi-Functional Laundry Basket**: This innovative basket could transform into a portable seating solution or a small side table. It could have a sturdy lid that doubles as a seat, perfect for small spaces where you might need extra seating. The basket could also have compartments for laundry supplies, making it a versatile piece of furniture that fits into a laundry room, bedroom, or bathroom."
