    "Smart Mailbox: Create a mailbox that can identify and sort mail by type and priority. It can use AI-powered sensors to detect the shape, size, and weight of the mail, and then direct it to the appropriate compartment. For example, bills and important letters can be sorted into a \"urgent\" compartment, while junk mail and promotional materials can be sorted into a \"non-urgent\" compartment. This smart mailbox can also notify the user of any urgent or important mail through a mobile app, ensuring that they never miss a crucial message.",
    "Self-Healing Mailbox: Design a mailbox that can repair itself if it is damaged. The mailbox can be made of a durable, flexible material that can withstand the elements and everyday wear and tear. If the mailbox is damaged, the self-healing properties can kick in, and the mailbox can repair itself using a special type of glue or adhesive. This would ensure that the mailbox remains functional and secure, even in harsh weather conditions.",
    "Solar-Powered Mailbox: Create a mailbox that is powered by solar energy. The mailbox can have a built-in solar panel that charges during the day and provides power to a small LED light that illuminates the mailbox at night. This would eliminate the need for electricity or batteries, making the mailbox more environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The solar-powered mailbox can also be equipped with a motion sensor that turns on the light when mail is delivered, providing a convenient and energy-efficient way to receive mail.",
    "Personalized Mailbox: Design a mailbox that can be personalized to suit the user's preferences. The mailbox can have interchangeable panels that can be swapped out to reflect the user's personality or mood. For example, a user can have a mailbox with a bright and cheerful design for a happy day, or a more subdued and elegant design for a formal occasion. This personalized mailbox can add a touch of fun and creativity to an otherwise mundane task.",
    "Smart Locking Mailbox: Create a mailbox with a smart lock that can be controlled through a mobile app. The user can use the app"
