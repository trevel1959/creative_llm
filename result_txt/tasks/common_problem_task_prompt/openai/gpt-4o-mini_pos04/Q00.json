    "**Venue Space and Safety Concerns**: Choosing a venue that is too small can lead to overcrowding, which may cause safety issues and discomfort for both kids and parents. Conversely, a venue that is too large may make it difficult to keep the children contained and engaged. To address this, it's important to assess the number of expected guests and select a venue that provides ample space for activities while ensuring a safe environment (like padded play areas or outdoor spaces with proper supervision).",
    "**Activity Overload or Underload**: Striking the right balance between too many activities and too few can be challenging. An overload may lead to chaos and children feeling overwhelmed, while too few activities can result in boredom. To solve this, a well-structured schedule can be created with a mix of guided activities (like crafts or games) and free playtime, allowing kids to choose how they want to engage without feeling rushed or disinterested.",
    "**Food Allergies and Dietary Restrictions**: With young children, food allergies and dietary restrictions can pose significant challenges, especially when planning snacks and cake. If parents are not informed about the menu, it could lead to serious health risks. To avoid this, a questionnaire could be sent out to all parents before the party to gather information on any allergies or dietary needs, ensuring that safe and inclusive food options are provided.",
    "**Weather Dependency for Outdoor Events**: If the party is planned outdoors, unpredictable weather can be a major issue. Rain or extreme heat can ruin the day and leave parents scrambling for alternative plans. To counter this, a backup plan should be in place, such as reserving a nearby indoor space or having tents ready for shade or rain cover, ensuring that the party can continue regardless of the weather conditions.",
    "**Guest RSVP Confusion**: It can be challenging to get accurate RSVPs from parents of young children, leading to uncertainty about the number of attendees. This can affect everything from food preparation to seating arrangements. To alleviate this issue, a clear and engaging RSVP method (like a fun online form or a simple text message system) can be implemented, along with a reminder a week before the event to encourage responses."
