    "**Interchangeable Plates for Diverse Waffle Styles**:    Design a waffle iron with interchangeable plates that allow users to create different types of waffles, such as Belgian, American, or even stuffed waffles. Each plate would have a unique shape and depth to cater to various styles, and they could be easily swapped out with a simple locking mechanism. This feature would encourage culinary experimentation and provide a versatile cooking tool for any breakfast lover.",
    "**Built-in Ingredient Dispenser**:    Integrate a built-in ingredient dispenser that allows users to add toppings or mix-ins directly into the batter as it cooks. For instance, users could add chocolate chips, nuts, or fruit while the batter is being poured, ensuring even distribution without the mess of separate preparation. This feature would elevate the waffle-making experience and inspire creativity in flavor combinations.",
    "**Dual-Sided Waffle Iron for Simultaneous Cooking**:    Create a dual-sided waffle iron that can cook two different types of waffles at once. For example, one side could be used for a traditional waffle while the other could prepare a savory option, like a cornbread waffle. This design would cater to families or gatherings where individuals have different tastes, making breakfast or brunch more efficient and enjoyable.",
    "**Waffle Iron with Temperature Control and Visual Indicators**:    Introduce a waffle iron that features precise temperature control with a digital display showing the exact temperature and cooking time. Visual indicators, such as color-changing LED lights, could inform users when the waffle is cooking, when it’s almost done, and when it’s ready to be served. This would help eliminate guesswork and prevent overcooking, ensuring perfectly crispy waffles every time.",
    "**Eco-Friendly, Non-Toxic Materials**:    Innovate the waffle iron by using sustainable, eco-friendly materials that are non-toxic and safe for cooking. For example, a ceramic-coated cooking surface could replace traditional non-stick coatings, providing a healthier option that is also environmentally friendly. Additionally, the exterior could be made from recycled materials, appealing to eco-conscious consumers and promoting sustainability in kitchen appliances."
