    "**Adjustable Fit System**: Develop a roller skate design with a customizable fit mechanism. Utilizing a combination of memory foam and adjustable straps, skaters can easily modify the tightness and shape of the skate to suit their foot size and shape. This would enhance comfort and support, reducing the risk of blisters and injuries.",
    "**Multi-Terrain Wheels**: Create roller skates with interchangeable wheels designed for different surfaces. For instance, skaters could switch between hard wheels for smooth surfaces and softer wheels for rough terrains. A quick-release mechanism would allow users to change wheels on the go, making it versatile for urban and outdoor skating.",
    "**LED Light-Up Skates**: Incorporate customizable LED lights in the roller skates that change colors and patterns based on the skater's movements or music tempo. This feature would not only enhance visibility during night skating but also add a fun and aesthetic element to the experience, appealing to younger skaters and dance enthusiasts.",
    "**Built-in Shock Absorption**: Design roller skates with advanced shock-absorbing technology, similar to that found in high-performance running shoes. This could include air cushioning or gel inserts in the sole, which would help reduce impact during jumps and landings, making skating more comfortable and safer for skaters of all levels.",
    "**Safety Gear Integration**: Develop roller skates that come with integrated safety features, such as a helmet with a built-in visor and Bluetooth communication system. This would allow skaters to communicate with each other without needing to remove their helmets, making group skating sessions safer and more enjoyable. The skates could also have reflective elements for increased visibility."
