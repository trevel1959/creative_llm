    "Bioregenerative Houses: In a world without natural materials, we could utilize advanced biotechnology to create biodegradable building blocks made from algae, fungi, or bacteria. These microorganisms could be genetically engineered to produce strong, lightweight materials that can be used to construct walls, floors, and roofs. As the microorganisms grow and multiply, they could also provide insulation, reducing the need for additional materials.",
    "Nanotech Shells: Nanotechnology could be used to create incredibly thin, lightweight shells that are strong enough to support entire buildings. These shells could be made from nanoparticles that are self-assembling and can be programmed to form complex structures. The shells could also be designed to change shape and adapt to different environments, making them ideal for buildings that need to withstand extreme weather conditions.",
    "Growable Structures: We could develop structures that are grown rather than built. Using advanced hydroponics and aeroponics systems, we could cultivate living materials like bamboo, straw, or even mushrooms that can be used to create walls, floors, and roofs. These structures would be not only sustainable but also able to adapt and change shape as needed.",
    "Robotically Assembled Structures: With the help of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, we could create structures that are assembled from raw materials using automated processes. These structures could be made from a variety of materials, including recycled materials, and could be assembled quickly and efficiently. The robots could also be programmed to create complex shapes and designs, allowing for greater creativity in building design.",
    "Energy-Harvesting Structures: We could develop structures that are capable of harnessing and storing energy from the environment. For example, buildings could be designed to capture solar energy and convert it into electricity, or they could be equipped with materials that can harness the energy of wind or water. These structures would not only be sustainable but also provide a reliable source of energy, reducing the need for external power sources."
