    "**Modular Design with Adjustable Compartments**:    Create a modular refrigerator design that allows users to adjust the size and configuration of compartments based on their needs. Users could easily add or remove shelves, drawers, or bins to accommodate larger items like cakes or party platters, ensuring optimal use of space. This could also include specialized compartments for specific food types, such as a wine rack that can be adjusted for different bottle sizes.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Cooling Technology**:    Develop a refrigerator that utilizes eco-friendly cooling technology, such as thermoelectric cooling or magnetic refrigeration. These methods can reduce energy consumption and eliminate harmful refrigerants. Additionally, the fridge could have a solar panel option to harness renewable energy, making it more sustainable and reducing electricity bills.",
    "**Personalized Climate Control**:    Implement personalized climate control for different sections of the refrigerator. Users could adjust temperature and humidity levels for various compartments, catering to specific food storage needs. For instance, fruits and vegetables could be kept in a high-humidity zone, while meats could be stored in a lower humidity zone, extending freshness and reducing spoilage.",
    "**Integrated Water Filtration and Infusion System**:    Enhance the refrigerator with an integrated water filtration and infusion system that allows users to infuse their drinking water with fruits, herbs, or spices. This system could include a built-in pitcher that filters tap water and a compartment for adding infusion ingredients. Users could enjoy flavored water on demand, promoting hydration and healthy habits.",
    "**Augmented Reality (AR) User Interface**:    Incorporate an augmented reality (AR) user interface that allows users to interact with their refrigerator in a more engaging way. Using a smartphone or AR glasses, users could visualize the contents of their fridge, see recipes, and receive cooking tips projected onto the fridge's surface. This interface could also assist with organization, showing where to place items for optimal storage."
