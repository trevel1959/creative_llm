    "**Built-in Hair Care Infuser**: Design a hair dryer with a built-in infuser that can dispense essential oils or conditioning serums while drying. Users could fill a small reservoir with their preferred hair treatment, and as they dry their hair, the dryer would release a fine mist of the treatment. This would not only speed up the drying process but also nourish and hydrate the hair simultaneously.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials**: Develop a hair dryer made from sustainable and biodegradable materials. This could include using recycled plastics or natural fibers for the casing, and energy-efficient heating elements to reduce power consumption. Additionally, packaging could be designed to be compostable, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.",
    "**Multi-Functional Design**: Create a hair dryer that also functions as a styling tool, such as a curling iron or straightener. The dryer could have interchangeable attachments that allow users to switch between drying, curling, and straightening without needing multiple devices. This would save space and time for users who want to achieve different hairstyles with one tool.",
    "**Noise Reduction Technology**: Incorporate advanced noise-canceling technology into the design of the hair dryer to minimize sound levels during operation. This could involve using specialized materials and sound-dampening structures to create a quieter experience, making it more pleasant for users, especially in shared living spaces or early mornings.",
    "**Ergonomic Design with Smart Grip**: Redesign the handle of the hair dryer to be more ergonomic, reducing wrist strain during use. Additionally, incorporate a smart grip that can detect when the user is holding the dryer and automatically turn it on or off. This feature would enhance user convenience and safety, particularly for those with limited mobility."
