    "Bamboo-based structure: Bamboo is a highly sustainable and renewable resource that can be used to create strong and durable building materials. It can be used to create a lightweight frame for the house, which can be covered with a breathable membrane to provide insulation. Bamboo can also be used to create walls and floors, providing a natural and eco-friendly alternative to traditional building materials. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Geodesic dome: Geodesic domes are lightweight and strong structures that can be built using a variety of materials, including plastics, metals, and even wood. They are highly efficient in terms of material usage and can be easily scaled up or down depending on the size of the house. The dome shape provides excellent insulation and can be covered with a breathable membrane to provide additional protection from the elements. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Earthship-inspired design: An earthship is a type of sustainable building that is made from a combination of natural and recycled materials. It is designed to be self-sufficient and can be built using a variety of materials, including tires, cans, and bottles. The house could be built using a combination of these materials, with the walls and floor made from a mixture of soil and recycled materials. The roof could be covered with a layer of plants, providing insulation and a natural water filtration system. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Magnesium-based construction: Magnesium is a lightweight and strong metal that can be used to create building materials that are highly durable and resistant to corrosion. It can be used to create walls, floors, and roofs, providing a lightweight and sustainable alternative to traditional building materials. Magnesium can also be alloyed with other materials, such as carbon, to create even stronger and more durable structures. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Cellular concrete-based structure: Cellular concrete is a type of building material that is made from a mixture of cement, water, and air. It is lightweight and can be molded into a variety of shapes and forms, making it an ideal material for creating complex structures. It can be used to"
