    "**Mood-Based Soundscapes**: Integrate a mood detection feature using biometric sensors that monitor heart rate and body temperature to assess the user's emotional state. Based on the detected mood, the headphones could curate personalized playlists or soundscapes (like calming nature sounds or energizing beats) to enhance or alter the user's mood, creating a more immersive and supportive audio experience.",
    "**Haptic Feedback Integration**: Incorporate haptic feedback technology into the headphones, allowing users to feel the bass and rhythm of the music. This feature would provide a more immersive experience, especially for genres that rely heavily on bass. Users could adjust the intensity of the haptic feedback based on personal preference, making the listening experience more dynamic.",
    "**Modular Design**: Design headphones with a modular structure, allowing users to customize various components such as ear cups, headbands, and sound drivers. Users could mix and match styles, colors, and sound profiles to create a unique pair of headphones that reflects their personality and preferences. This would also enable easy repairs and upgrades, extending the lifespan of the product.",
    "**Voice-Activated Personal Assistant**: Enhance headphones with a built-in voice-activated personal assistant that can perform tasks beyond music playback. Users could ask the assistant to provide information about their schedule, send messages, or even control smart home devices, all hands-free. This would create a more integrated experience for users who rely on technology throughout their day.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Materials and Production**: Develop headphones using sustainable materials, such as biodegradable plastics and recycled metals, while ensuring that the manufacturing process minimizes waste and carbon footprint. This initiative would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and promote sustainability in the tech industry, setting a standard for eco-friendly audio devices."
