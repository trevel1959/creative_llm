    "Use of nanoparticles: Develop a vaccine that utilizes nanoparticles to deliver the disease-fighting antigens to the immune system. The nanoparticles could be made of a non-toxic material and could be designed to target specific immune cells, increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "mRNA-based vaccine: Develop a vaccine that uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct the body's cells to produce a specific protein that can stimulate an immune response. This approach could be more efficient and effective than traditional vaccine methods. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine: Create a vaccine that uses virus-like particles (VLPs) to mimic the virus and stimulate an immune response. VLPs are non-infectious and cannot cause disease, but they can still trigger an immune response. Confidence score: 0.9",
    "Artificial intelligence-designed vaccine: Use artificial intelligence (AI) to design a vaccine that can adapt to different strains of a disease. The AI system could analyze the genetic makeup of the virus and design a vaccine that is tailored to the specific strain. Confidence score: 0.8",
    "Plant-based vaccine: Develop a vaccine that uses plant-based components to deliver the disease-fighting antigens. This approach could be more environmentally friendly and could potentially be more effective than traditional vaccine methods. Confidence score: 0.7"
