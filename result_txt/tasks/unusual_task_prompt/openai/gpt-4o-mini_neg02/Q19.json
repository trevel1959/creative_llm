    "**Scented Drawer Freshener**: Instead of using traditional drawer liners or air fresheners, place a small candle in your drawers. The subtle scent released from the candle will keep your clothes smelling fresh. As the candle burns, it will release a pleasant aroma that permeates the fabric, creating a delightful surprise when you open your drawer.",
    "**Candle Wax Crayon**: Melt down old or unused candles and pour the wax into molds to create your own custom crayons. You can mix different colors of wax for unique effects. Once cooled, these crayon candles can be used for art projects or as a fun, non-toxic alternative for kids to draw with, providing a sensory experience with a hint of fragrance.",
    "**DIY Wax Seals**: For a personal touch on letters or invitations, use candle wax to create beautiful wax seals. Simply melt a small amount of the candle and drip it onto the envelope flap, then press a seal stamp into the wax before it hardens. This adds an elegant and vintage flair to your correspondence, making it stand out.",
    "**Insect Repellent**: Certain candles, particularly those made with citronella or other essential oils, can be used to repel insects. Instead of just lighting them outside, you can rub the wax on your skin or clothes to create a natural barrier against mosquitoes and other pests. Just ensure the wax is safe for skin contact and that youâ€™re not allergic to any of the ingredients.",
    "**Candle Holder as a Mini Planter**: Empty candle holders can be repurposed as small planters for succulents or herbs. After cleaning out the leftover wax, fill the holder with soil and plant your choice of greenery. The holder's aesthetic can add a unique touch to your home decor while also providing a fun gardening project."
