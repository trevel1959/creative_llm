    "**Edible Foraging Map**: Instead of just wandering around for food, create a foraging map of the island. As you explore, take notes on the types of plants, fruits, and potential food sources you find. Use natural landmarks to mark your findings, and create a visual representation of what is safe to eat. This map will help you efficiently gather food while avoiding poisonous plants.",
    "**Rainwater Collection System**: Build a rainwater collection system using natural materials. Create a series of sloped leaves or palm fronds leading to a hollowed-out log or coconut shell. When it rains, the water will flow down the leaves and collect in your container. This will provide you with a sustainable source of fresh water. You can also dig a small trench to channel water from a higher ground area to your collection point.",
    "**The Island Garden**: Start a small garden using seeds from fruits you find on the island. If you have access to coconuts, plant the husks in sandy soil, as they can sprout into new coconut trees. You can also look for wild herbs and edible plants to cultivate. By nurturing a small garden, you can create a renewable food source that will sustain you over time.",
    "**Signal Fire with a Twist**: Create a signal fire using a combination of smoke and sound. Gather green leaves and damp wood to produce thick smoke, which will be visible from a distance. Simultaneously, fashion a simple drum using a hollow log and animal skin (if available) to create rhythmic beats that can attract attention. This dual approach increases your chances of being spotted by passing ships or planes.",
    "**Shelter with Solar Power**: Construct a shelter that incorporates solar energy principles. Use large leaves or palm fronds to create a roof that collects sunlight during the day. Fashion a reflective surface using shiny rocks or pieces of metal (if found) to direct sunlight into your shelter, keeping it warm during cooler nights. This innovative design will not only provide shelter but also help regulate temperature."
