    "DIY Dental Solutions: In a world without dentists, individuals could turn to DIY dental solutions to maintain their oral health. This could include using homemade toothpaste made from ingredients like baking soda, coconut oil, and essential oils. People could also use homemade dental floss made from cotton thread or wool, and mouthwash made from herbs like peppermint and chamomile. With a little creativity and experimentation, people could find effective and affordable ways to keep their teeth clean and healthy.",
    "Community Dental Co-ops: In the absence of dentists, communities could come together to form dental co-ops. These co-ops would allow individuals to share the cost of dental care and equipment, making it more accessible and affordable for everyone. Members of the co-op could take turns providing dental care for each other, using homemade dental tools and equipment. This would not only provide essential dental care but also foster a sense of community and cooperation.",
    "Mobile Dental Clinics: In a world without dentists, mobile dental clinics could become the norm. These clinics would travel from town to town, providing dental care to people in remote areas. The clinics could be staffed by dental hygienists or dental assistants, who would use portable dental equipment to provide basic dental care. This would ensure that everyone has access to dental care, regardless of their location.",
    "Herbal Remedies: In the absence of dentists, people could turn to herbal remedies to treat dental problems. For example, chewing on a piece of garlic could help to reduce toothache pain, while drinking tea made from the bark of a willow tree could help to reduce inflammation in the gums. Other herbs like cloves, ginger, and sage could also be used to treat dental problems. While these remedies may not be as effective as modern dental care, they could provide some relief for people in need."
