    "Make them more aerodynamic: Improve the shape of the roller skates to increase speed and maneuverability.",
    "Incorporate a shock absorber: Add a shock absorber to the wheels to reduce the impact on the skater's joints during rough ground surfaces.",
    "Improve the grip: Develop new wheels with better traction to prevent slipping on different terrains.",
    "Make them more stable: Adjust the center of gravity or add more weight to the front or back of the skates for better stability.",
    "Enhance the grip tape: Add a textured grip tape on the underside the skates to improve traction on various surfaces."
