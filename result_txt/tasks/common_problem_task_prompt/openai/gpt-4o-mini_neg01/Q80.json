    "**Sustainable Catering Options**: Securing a caterer that focuses on organic, locally-sourced ingredients can be challenging. Many caterers may not have experience with eco-friendly practices, which can lead to difficulties in menu planning. Additionally, ensuring that the food is not only sustainable but also appealing to a diverse group of guests with varying dietary restrictions adds another layer of complexity.",
    "**Eco-Conscious Invitations**: Choosing eco-friendly invitations can be a struggle, especially when considering the balance between aesthetics and sustainability. Couples might face issues with finding printers that use recycled paper or vegetable-based inks, or they may want to explore digital invitations, which could alienate guests who prefer traditional mail.",
    "**Transportation Logistics**: Organizing transportation for guests can be a logistical nightmare when aiming for eco-friendliness. The couple may want to minimize carbon footprints by arranging carpooling, shuttle services, or public transport options, but coordinating these efforts while ensuring guestsâ€™ convenience can be a significant challenge.",
    "**Decor and Floral Arrangements**: Sourcing decorations and flowers that are sustainable and seasonal can be problematic. Many floral shops may rely on imported flowers that have a larger carbon footprint. Couples may need to consider alternatives like potted plants or dried flowers, but these options might not align with their vision for the wedding aesthetic.",
    "**Waste Management**: Even with the best intentions, managing waste during the wedding can be tricky. Couples may want to implement recycling and composting stations, but ensuring that guests understand how to properly dispose of waste can be difficult. Additionally, they may face challenges in finding vendors who are willing to adhere to waste reduction practices."
