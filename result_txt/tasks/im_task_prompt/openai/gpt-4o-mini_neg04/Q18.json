    "**Integrated Wellness Monitoring**: Equip cars with sensors that monitor the driver's health metrics, such as heart rate, stress levels, and fatigue. The car could provide real-time feedback and suggestions, such as recommending breaks, playing calming music, or even activating massage features in the seats. This could enhance safety by ensuring drivers remain alert and healthy during long journeys.",
    "**Augmented Reality Windshield**: Develop a windshield that utilizes augmented reality (AR) to display important information directly in the driverâ€™s line of sight. This could include navigation prompts, hazard alerts, and even points of interest. The AR system could highlight road signs, lane changes, and nearby obstacles, making driving safer and more intuitive.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Energy Regeneration**: Implement a system that captures energy from braking and converts it into electricity to recharge the car's battery. Additionally, the car could be designed to utilize solar panels integrated into the roof to supplement energy needs. This would not only improve fuel efficiency but also reduce the carbon footprint of the vehicle.",
    "**Modular Interior Design**: Create a car interior that can be easily reconfigured based on the needs of the occupants. For example, seats could be rearranged for more passenger space or converted into a workspace for remote work. This modular approach would allow for greater flexibility, making the car suitable for various activities, from family trips to business meetings.",
    "**AI-Powered Traffic Management**: Introduce an AI system that connects cars to local traffic management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to driving routes based on traffic conditions, accidents, or weather. The AI could suggest alternate routes, predict traffic jams, and even communicate with other vehicles to optimize flow and reduce congestion."
