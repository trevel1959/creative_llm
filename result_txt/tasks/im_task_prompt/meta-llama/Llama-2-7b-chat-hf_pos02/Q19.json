    "Virtual Try-On: Develop an AI-powered virtual try-on feature for glasses. This feature would allow users to upload a photo of themselves and virtually try on different frames to see how they look. This can be done through a web app or mobile app, and can help users find the perfect pair of glasses without having to physically try them on.",
    "Smart Lenses: Create glasses with smart lenses that can detect and adjust to different lighting conditions. For example, the lenses could automatically darken in bright light and lighten in low light, improving the wearer's visibility and comfort. This technology could also be used to enhance the wearer's visual experience in various environments, such as reading or watching movies.",
    "Augmented Reality Display: Develop glasses with an augmented reality (AR) display that overlays digital information onto the wearer's field of vision. This could be useful for tasks such as navigation, where the glasses could display turn-by-turn directions or show the wearer's location on a map. The AR display could also be used for gaming, where the glasses could display gameplay information or characters in the wearer's field of vision.",
    "Health Monitoring: Create glasses with built-in health monitoring technology, such as a heart rate monitor or blood oxygen sensor. This could be useful for athletes or people with chronic health conditions, who could use the glasses to monitor their health in real-time during exercise or throughout the day. The glasses could also be integrated with a mobile app to track the wearer's health data and provide insights and recommendations for improvement.",
    "Voice Assistant: Develop glasses with a built-in voice assistant, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This could allow the wearer to access information, play music, or control other smart devices with voice commands. The voice assistant could also be used to answer questions or provide information on the wearer's surroundings, such as the weather or nearby points of interest."
