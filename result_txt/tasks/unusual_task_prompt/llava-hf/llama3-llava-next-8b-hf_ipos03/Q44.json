    "**Candle Holder**: Fill the compartments with water, add a tea light or votive candle, and freeze. The frozen water will act as a natural insulator, keeping the candle cool and prolonging its burn time. The frozen water will also create an aesthetically pleasing ice sculpture around the candle.",
    "**Miniature Planter**: Place a small plant or succulent in each compartment, and use the tray as a mini greenhouse. The small space will help the plant thrive in a controlled environment, and the tray can be moved to different locations to optimize sunlight exposure.",
    "**Baking Mold**: Use the ice cube tray as a mold for baking small, individual-sized desserts or cakes. The compartments will create a uniform shape and size, making it easier to remove and serve the baked goods.",
    "**Popsicle Mold**: Fill the compartments with popsicle sticks and a small amount of juice or fruit puree, and freeze. The popsicles will be individually portioned and easy to handle.",
    "**Party Game Prop**: Use the ice cube tray as a prop for a party game, such as \"pin the tail on the donkey\" but with an ice cube twist. Blindfold the participants, spin them around, and have them try to pin a small flag or ribbon onto a frozen object."
