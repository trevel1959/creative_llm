    "**Environmental Impact**: The construction and operation of Olympic venues can lead to significant environmental degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and waste generation. A potential issue is the long-term ecological footprint of these developments. To mitigate this, host cities could implement sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly materials, ensuring venues are energy-efficient, and creating green spaces that remain after the games conclude.",
    "**Security Concerns**: With large crowds and high-profile athletes, security is a major concern during the Olympics. Potential problems include threats of terrorism, crowd control issues, and safety of the athletes and spectators. To address these concerns, host cities can invest in advanced security technology, such as facial recognition systems, drones for surveillance, and increased training for law enforcement to ensure preparedness for various scenarios.",
    "**Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusivity**: Hosting the Olympics can sometimes overlook the cultural heritage and needs of local communities. A potential issue is the marginalization of local traditions and the commercialization of culture. To counteract this, organizers could incorporate local cultural elements into the ceremonies, provide platforms for local artists, and ensure that local voices are heard in the planning process, promoting inclusivity and respect for the host culture.",
    "**Economic Disparities**: While the Olympics can boost local economies, there is a risk that the benefits are not evenly distributed, leading to economic disparities. Local businesses may struggle to compete with large corporations and sponsors. To address this, the organizing committee could create programs that support small businesses, offer grants for local vendors, and ensure that a portion of profits is reinvested into the community to foster long-term economic growth.",
    "**Health Risks**: Large gatherings can pose significant health risks, particularly in the wake of pandemics or disease outbreaks. A potential problem is the spread of infectious diseases among athletes and spectators. To mitigate this, organizers can implement strict health protocols, including regular health screenings, vaccination requirements, and providing adequate medical facilities on-site to handle any health emergencies."
