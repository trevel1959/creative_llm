    "**Haptic Feedback**: Integrate subtle vibrations or tactile feedback into the mouse to provide users with a more immersive experience. This could be achieved through a series of small motors or actuators that respond to different actions, such as cursor movements or button clicks. The haptic feedback would simulate the sensation of interacting with a physical object, enhancing engagement and immersion.",
    "**Gesture Recognition**: Develop a mouse that recognizes and responds to hand gestures, allowing users to control the cursor with a range of motions, such as waving, pointing, or drawing shapes. This feature would revolutionize the way users interact with their computers, enabling more intuitive and expressive communication.",
    "**Augmented Reality Integration**: Embed a small camera and display into the mouse, enabling users to visualize and interact with virtual objects and information in 3D space. This would transform the mouse into a powerful tool for augmented reality applications, such as gaming, education, and design.",
    "**Biometric Feedback**: Incorporate sensors to track users' physical and emotional states, providing real-time feedback on their well-being and stress levels. This could be achieved through heart rate monitoring, skin conductance, or other biometric measures. The mouse would become a personal wellness companion, helping users manage their stress and improve their mental health.",
    "**Modular Design**: Create a mouse with interchangeable components, such as different grip styles, button layouts, or sensor types. This would allow users to customize their mouse to suit their preferences, making it a highly adaptable and personalized tool."
