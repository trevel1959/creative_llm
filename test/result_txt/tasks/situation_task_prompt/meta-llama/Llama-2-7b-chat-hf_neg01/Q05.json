    "Solar-Powered Lights: Invest in solar-powered lights that can be placed around the house or community to provide sufficient light during the day. These lights use energy from the sun to charge during the day and can provide light at night, reducing the need for traditional light sources.",
    "Mirror Arrays: Set up mirrors in strategic locations to reflect sunlight into the area. This method can help bounce sunlight into areas that may not receive direct sunlight, providing additional light during the day.",
    "Daylight Harvesting: Develop a system that captures and stores daylight during the day, then releases it at night. This can be achieved through the use of specialized windows or reflective surfaces that absorb and store sunlight, then release it as needed.",
    "Bioluminescent Materials: Utilize bioluminescent materials that emit light naturally, such as glowing mushrooms or plants. These materials can be placed in various areas around the house or community to provide a soft, natural light source during the day.",
    "Light-Amplifying Crystals: Develop crystals that can amplify light, allowing them to emit more light than their size would suggest. These crystals can be placed in strategic locations to provide additional light during the day, and can be recharged using solar energy."
