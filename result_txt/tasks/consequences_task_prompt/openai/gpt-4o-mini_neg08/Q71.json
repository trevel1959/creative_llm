    "**Overpopulation Crisis**: If immortality became widespread, the global population could skyrocket as people no longer age or die. This could strain resources, including food, water, and energy, leading to severe shortages and environmental degradation. Cities may become overcrowded, resulting in increased pollution, traffic congestion, and the collapse of infrastructure. Governments would need to implement drastic measures to manage population control, potentially leading to ethical dilemmas regarding who gets to live and who doesn't.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation**: With individuals living indefinitely, there may be a decline in cultural evolution and innovation. As people become comfortable in their long lives, they might resist change, clinging to traditions and ideas that no longer serve society. This could lead to a homogenization of culture, where new generations struggle to break free from the weight of the past, stifling creativity and progress in art, science, and philosophy.",
    "**Moral and Ethical Dilemmas**: The concept of immortality raises profound ethical questions. For instance, how would society address the morality of death? Would killing be considered more heinous if people could live forever? Additionally, the implications of consent in life-extending procedures could lead to exploitation, particularly of vulnerable populations. These dilemmas would force society to reevaluate its moral compass and legal frameworks surrounding life and death.",
    "**Psychological Impact**: Living forever could have significant psychological effects on individuals. The burden of endless life might lead to existential crises, depression, or a sense of ennui as people struggle to find meaning in their prolonged existence. Relationships could also become strained, as the dynamics of love and companionship change when partners can live indefinitely. This might result in a rise in mental health issues, as people grapple with the weight of eternity.",
    "**Shift in Values and Priorities**: With immortality, the value placed on life and achievements might shift dramatically. People may prioritize experiences over material possessions, leading to a renaissance of travel, exploration, and self-discovery. However, this could also lead to a lack of urgency in pursuing goals, as the fear of time running out diminishes. The societal focus might shift towards hedonism or self-indulgence, as individuals seek to maximize pleasure without the constraints of time."
