    "**Biodegradable Garbage Bags**: In the absence of trash cans, one could use biodegradable garbage bags that can be tied up and buried in a compost area. This method would ensure that waste is not just hidden but also turned into a useful resource for gardening or agriculture. The bags would need to be made from natural materials like cornstarch or potato starch to ensure they decompose properly.",
    "**Portable Composting Units**: Another idea is to create portable, compact composting units. These units could be designed to fit easily in small spaces and allow for on-site decomposition of organic waste. They could be made of durable materials that are easy to clean and maintain, such as stainless steel or plastic. The resulting compost could then be used for personal gardens or shared with neighbors.",
    "**Community Recycling Stations**: Establishing community recycling stations where residents can drop off recyclable items would help manage waste efficiently. These stations could be located at public places like parks, community centers, or along major streets. To encourage participation, these stations could be equipped with clear labeling and signage, as well as interactive displays explaining the benefits of recycling.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Waste Disposal Services**: Offer a service that picks up and manages waste in an environmentally responsible manner. This could involve using electric or hybrid vehicles for transportation, implementing waste segregation at the source (like paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste), and ensuring that all collected waste is disposed of in a sustainable way, whether through recycling, composting, or safe disposal.",
    "**Wearable Waste Collection Devices**: Develop wearable devices that individuals can use to collect their waste. For example, a belt with integrated pockets for storing recyclables, or wristbands that can hold small, detachable containers for waste collection. These devices would make waste management more convenient and less intrusive in daily life, encouraging people to take responsibility for their waste generation."
