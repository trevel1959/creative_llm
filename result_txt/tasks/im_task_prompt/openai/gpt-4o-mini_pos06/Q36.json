    "**Self-Sharpening Blade Technology**: Develop a knife with a self-sharpening mechanism that activates every time the knife is sheathed or unsheathed. This could involve a small, built-in grinding stone that lightly sharpens the blade as it is inserted or removed from its holder, ensuring the knife remains sharp without the need for manual sharpening.",
    "**Interchangeable Blade System**: Create a knife with a modular design that allows users to easily swap out different types of blades for various tasks (e.g., serrated for bread, straight for vegetables, or a fillet blade for fish). The handle could have a secure locking mechanism to hold the blades in place while allowing for quick changes.",
    "**Ergonomic Handle with Adjustable Grip**: Design a knife with an ergonomic handle that can be adjusted for different hand sizes and grips. This could involve a telescoping or expandable grip that can be customized for comfort, reducing strain during prolonged use. The handle could also feature a non-slip surface for better control.",
    "**Integrated Food Scale**: Incorporate a digital scale into the knife's design, allowing users to weigh ingredients directly on the cutting surface. This could be particularly useful for chefs and home cooks who need precise measurements while preparing meals. The scale could connect to an app to log nutritional information and recipes.",
    "**Color-Coded Safety System**: Develop a knife set with color-coded blades and handles that correspond to specific food categories (e.g., red for meat, green for vegetables, blue for fish). This would help prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen and make it easier for users to remember which knife to use for each type of food."
