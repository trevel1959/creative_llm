    "**Adaptive Ventilation System**: An innovative helmet design could include adjustable vents that open or close based on the rider's body temperature. Utilizing sensors, the helmet could monitor the cyclist's temperature and humidity levels, automatically adjusting airflow to keep the rider comfortable during different weather conditions, thus enhancing safety and comfort on long rides.",
    "**Augmented Reality Visor**: Incorporating a visor with augmented reality (AR) technology could provide cyclists with real-time information such as speed, distance traveled, and navigation cues. The visor could project this data onto the lens, allowing riders to keep their eyes on the road while accessing essential information, ultimately improving safety and performance.",
    "**Integrated LED Lighting System**: To enhance visibility during nighttime rides, a helmet could be designed with built-in LED lights that are strategically placed around the helmet. These lights could be programmable to indicate turns or stops and could be activated by the cyclist's hand signals, making them an effective tool for improving road safety and communication with other road users.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Material and Design**: A bicycle helmet could be developed using sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics or bio-based composites. Additionally, the design could incorporate a modular approach, allowing users to replace only damaged parts instead of the entire helmet, thus reducing waste and promoting environmental responsibility.",
    "**Impact-Absorbing Smart Foam**: By utilizing advanced materials, the helmet could feature a new type of foam that not only absorbs impact better than traditional materials but also adapts its firmness based on the severity of the impact. This smart foam could provide enhanced protection during minor bumps while remaining lightweight and comfortable for everyday use."
