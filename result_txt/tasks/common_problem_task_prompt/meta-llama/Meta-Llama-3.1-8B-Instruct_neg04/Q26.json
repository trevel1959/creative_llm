    "**Everest Eco-Adventures**: Develop a sustainable tourism model that focuses on eco-friendly practices and responsible climbing. This includes partnering with local communities to create environmentally conscious routes, using biodegradable equipment, and implementing a 'take nothing, leave nothing' policy. Climbers can participate in educational workshops on local flora and fauna, and contribute to conservation efforts by planting trees or cleaning up waste on the mountain.",
    "**Everest Vertical Farm**: Create a vertical farm at the base of Mount Everest that uses hydroponics and aeroponics to grow a variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs. This innovative farm would provide a sustainable source of fresh produce for climbers and local communities, while also serving as a research center for climate-resilient agriculture.",
    "**Everest 360Â° Experience**: Develop a cutting-edge, immersive experience that allows climbers to explore Mount Everest from a unique perspective. Using VR and AR technology, climbers can embark on a virtual journey up the mountain, encountering breathtaking vistas, challenging weather conditions, and thrilling encounters with wildlife. This experience would be available to climbers at the base camp or remotely from anywhere in the world.",
    "**Everest Heritage Trail**: Establish a scenic hiking trail that takes climbers through a series of historic and cultural sites related to Mount Everest's rich history. The trail would be marked with informative signs and interpretive exhibits, providing insight into the lives of early explorers, Sherpa guides, and local communities. Climbers can also participate in interactive workshops, learning traditional crafts, music, and dance from local artists.",
    "**Everest Weather Station**: Design and deploy a state-of-the-art weather station at the summit of Mount Everest, which would provide real-time data on weather patterns, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This station would be equipped with advanced sensors and AI-powered analytics, enabling researchers to better understand and predict extreme weather events. The data would be shared with climbers, scientists, and policymakers, promoting safer and more informed decision-making. [/INST] "
