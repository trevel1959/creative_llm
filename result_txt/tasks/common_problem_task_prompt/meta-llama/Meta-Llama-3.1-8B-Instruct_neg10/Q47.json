    "**Incorrect Component Selection**: Choosing the wrong components can be a costly mistake. For example, selecting a CPU that's not compatible with the motherboard or RAM that's not sufficient for the system's requirements can cause issues during installation or even render the system unusable.",
    "**Static Electricity Damage**: Static electricity can damage sensitive components like CPUs and RAM. Failing to take proper precautions, such as grounding yourself or using an anti-static wrist strap, can result in costly repairs or even render the components useless.",
    "**Overheating Components**: Insufficient cooling can lead to overheating components, which can cause damage to the CPU, GPU, or other critical components. This can be due to inadequate case ventilation, a faulty cooling system, or a lack of thermal paste.",
    "**Installation Errors**: Installing components incorrectly can cause issues with the system's functionality or even render it unbootable. This can be due to a lack of knowledge or experience with computer hardware, or simply due to human error.",
    "**Power Supply Issues**: A power supply that's not sufficient for the system's power requirements can cause issues with component stability, overheating, or even damage to the components. This can be due to a power supply that's not compatible with the system's components or a lack of research on the power supply's specifications."
