    "**Smart Brush with Integrated AI Assistant**: Develop an electric toothbrush with an integrated AI assistant that learns the user's brushing habits and provides personalized feedback and recommendations to improve their oral hygiene. The AI assistant could analyze the user's brushing technique, identify areas of improvement, and suggest specific brushing patterns to target hard-to-reach areas or areas with high plaque buildup. This feature could be enabled through a companion app that tracks the user's brushing habits and provides insights on their oral health.",
    "**Toothbrush with Built-in UV Sanitizer**: Design an electric toothbrush with a built-in UV sanitizer that uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and other microorganisms on the toothbrush head. This feature would provide an additional layer of protection against the spread of germs and would be especially useful for people with weakened immune systems or for use in hospitals or healthcare settings.",
    "**Electric Toothbrush with Real-Time Plaque Detection**: Develop an electric toothbrush that uses advanced sensors and AI algorithms to detect and track plaque buildup in real-time. The toothbrush could use a combination of visual and audio cues to alert the user when they are brushing over areas with high plaque buildup, allowing them to adjust their brushing technique and clean their teeth more effectively.",
    "**Toothbrush with Integrated Water Flosser**: Design an electric toothbrush with an integrated water flosser that uses a combination of water pressure and sonic vibrations to remove plaque and food particles from between teeth and below the gumline. This feature would provide a more effective and convenient alternative to traditional flossing and would be especially useful for people with sensitive teeth or gums.",
    "**Electric Toothbrush with Gamification and Rewards**: Develop an electric toothbrush that incorporates gamification and rewards to encourage users to brush their teeth regularly and maintain good oral hygiene habits. The toothbrush could track the user's brushing habits and provide rewards or incentives for meeting brushing goals, such as unlocking virtual rewards or earning points that can be redeemed for discounts on oral care products."
