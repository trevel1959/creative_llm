    "**Ceiling Fan with Air Quality Sensors**: Equip the ceiling fan with built-in air quality sensors that monitor pollutants, humidity, and temperature. The fan can automatically adjust its speed based on air quality readings, providing optimal airflow when the air quality is poor and slowing down when conditions improve. Users can also receive alerts on their smartphones about air quality levels in the room.",
    "**Multi-Functional Ceiling Fan with Bluetooth Speakers**: Design a ceiling fan that incorporates high-quality Bluetooth speakers into its structure. This allows users to enjoy their favorite music or podcasts while keeping cool. The fan can also include a built-in microphone for hands-free calling or voice commands, making it a versatile addition to any room.",
    "**Artistic Ceiling Fan with Customizable Blades**: Create a ceiling fan that allows users to easily swap out the blades for different designs, colors, or materials. This way, homeowners can customize the look of their fan to match their decor or personal style. The blades could be made from eco-friendly materials, and a selection of artistic designs could be available for purchase, encouraging creativity in home decor.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Aromatherapy Diffuser**: Integrate a small essential oil diffuser into the ceiling fan's design. Users can add their favorite essential oils to the diffuser, and as the fan circulates air, it will also disperse pleasant fragrances throughout the room. This feature would enhance the atmosphere, promote relaxation, and create a spa-like experience at home.",
    "**Ceiling Fan with Integrated HVAC System**: Develop a ceiling fan that works in conjunction with a home's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. This fan can detect temperature variations and adjust its speed accordingly to help distribute heated or cooled air more evenly throughout the room. It could also provide energy-saving options by optimizing airflow and reducing reliance on the HVAC system."
