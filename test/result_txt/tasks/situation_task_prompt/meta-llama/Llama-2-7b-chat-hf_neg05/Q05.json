    "Solar-Powered Lanterns: Utilize the abundance of solar energy during the night to charge lanterns that can provide light during the day. These lanterns could be powered by small solar panels or even harness the energy from the moon.",
    "Light-Emitting Plant Coatings: Develop a special coating for plants that absorbs sunlight during the night and emits light during the day. This coating could be applied to various plant species, providing a natural and sustainable source of light.",
    "Mirrored Reflective Surfaces: Utilize mirrored reflective surfaces to bounce light around during the day. This could involve constructing large mirrored domes or installing mirrored films on windows to reflect light indoors.",
    "Artificial Photosynthesis: Develop a synthetic process that mimics photosynthesis, harnessing the energy from the sun or other light sources to produce a synthetic light source. This could involve using nanotechnology or other advanced materials to create a highly efficient light-producing system.",
    "Time-Release Lighting: Create a lighting system that releases light at a controlled rate, allowing for a consistent and sustained source of light throughout the day. This could involve using specialized batteries or other energy storage devices to store energy from the night and release it gradually during the day."
