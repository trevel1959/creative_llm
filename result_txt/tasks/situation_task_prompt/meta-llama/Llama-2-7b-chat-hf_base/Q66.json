    ": Growable structures: One creative solution to the absence of natural materials would be to develop buildings that can grow with them. This could involve designing structures made of biodegradable and compostable materials, such as bamboo, cornstarch, or mycelium. These materials can be grown and harvested like crops, allowing for a sustainable and renewable source of building materials. The house could be designed with a modular system, allowing it to expand and contract as needed, much like a living organism.",
    "Structures made of air: Another innovative solution would be to harness the power of air to create buildings. This could involve using inflatable structures made of durable materials, such as polyurethane or PVC, that can be inflated and deflated as needed. These structures could be designed to provide the necessary support and stability while also being lightweight and easy to transport. They could also be equipped with solar panels and wind turbines to provide energy.",
    "Water-based structures: In a world without natural materials, buildings could be designed to float on water. This could involve using advanced materials and technologies to create buoyant structures that can withstand the elements and provide a stable living space. The house could be designed with a series of interconnected modules that can be easily moved or rearranged as needed. This would allow for a flexible and adaptable living space that can respond to changing environmental conditions.",
    "Robotic construction: With the absence of natural materials, buildings could be constructed using robotic technology. This could involve using autonomous robots to assemble and shape materials such as metal, glass, or plastic into the desired structure. The robots could be programmed to work together to create complex shapes and designs, allowing for a wide range of creative and innovative architectural styles. This approach would also reduce the need for human labor, making it more efficient and sustainable.",
    "Bioluminescent buildings: In a world without natural materials, buildings could be designed to produce their own light through bioluminescence. This could involve using specialized organisms or microorganisms that produce light, such as bacteria or algae, to create a glowing and sustainable living space. The house could be designed with a series of integrated lighting systems that harness the natural light-producing"
