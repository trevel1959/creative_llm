    "Diving or underwater equipment failure: The equipment used for deep-sea exploration can malfunction, leading to difficulties in communication, navigation, or breathing.",
    "Limited visibility: Deep-sea environments can have low visibility, making it difficult to navigate or identify potential hazards.",
    "Water temperature: The temperature in deep-sea environments can be extremely cold, which can lead to hypothermia or frostbite if proper protection is not worn.",
    "Benthic hazards: Deep-sea environments can have sharp rocks, coral reefs, or other underwater hazards that can cause injury if not navigated carefully.",
    "Pressure changes: Pressure changes at depth can cause decompression sickness, also known as \"the bends,\" which can be painful and dangerous if not treated properly."
