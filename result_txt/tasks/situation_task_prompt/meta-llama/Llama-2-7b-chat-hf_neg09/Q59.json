    "Sun-Powered Umbrellas: Develop umbrellas with built-in solar panels that harness energy from the sun during the day and use it to charge devices or power small appliances. This way, people could still enjoy the outdoors while staying connected and productive, even on cloudy days.",
    "Cloud-Piercing Towers: Build skyscrapers or towers with specialized windows that can channel sunlight through the clouds, allowing people to harness natural light. These structures could be equipped with mirrors or lenses to focus the sunlight and create a more even distribution of light inside.",
    "Sun-Catcher Windows: Design windows with unique optical properties that can concentrate sunlight into a narrow beam, allowing it to penetrate through the clouds and into buildings. This technology could be used in conjunction with other lighting sources to create brighter, more comfortable interior spaces.",
    "Cloud-Based Solar Farms: Establish solar farms on floating platforms or in remote areas, positioned in such a way that they can capture sunlight even on cloudy days. These farms could generate electricity and transmit it wirelessly to nearby communities, providing a reliable source of clean energy.",
    "Morphing Building Facades: Develop building facades with adaptive, shape-shifting properties that can change to maximize sunlight exposure. For example, a building could have a smooth, reflective surface on cloudy days and a rough, porous surface on sunny days to maximize energy absorption. This technology could also be used to create dynamic, responsive architecture that adjusts to changing weather conditions."
