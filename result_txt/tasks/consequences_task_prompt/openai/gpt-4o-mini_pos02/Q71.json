    "**Economic Impact and Wealth Distribution**: Immortality could exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones. Wealthy individuals might afford advanced medical technologies that ensure their immortality, while poorer populations may not have access to such advancements. This disparity could lead to a class divide where the rich live indefinitely, enjoying continuous wealth and power, while the poor face declining living conditions. Governments might need to implement policies to ensure equitable access to life-extending technologies, which could spark debates about ethics and governance.",
    "**Cultural Stagnation vs. Cultural Renaissance**: With individuals living indefinitely, cultural evolution could slow down as older generations cling to their established beliefs and traditions. Conversely, it could also lead to a cultural renaissance where the fusion of ideas from countless generations results in a vibrant, evolving culture. The challenge would be to encourage the exchange of ideas between the old and the new, ensuring that creativity flourishes while respecting historical contexts.",
    "**Environmental Consequences**: A world with immortal beings would face significant environmental challenges. With an ever-growing population and a finite amount of resources, the strain on the planet could lead to severe ecological crises. The increased demand for land, food, and energy could accelerate climate change and biodiversity loss. To mitigate these effects, society would need to adopt sustainable practices, invest in renewable resources, and potentially rethink our relationship with nature.",
    "**Philosophical and Ethical Dilemmas**: The discovery of immortality would raise profound philosophical questions about the nature of life and death. It would challenge the value we place on mortality and the human experience. Ethical dilemmas would arise regarding who gets access to immortality, the implications of overpopulation, and the moral responsibilities of those who choose to live forever. Society would need to engage in deep discussions about the meaning of life, the implications of eternal existence, and the responsibilities that come with it.",
    "**Shifts in Governance and Political Power**: The concept of governance would be radically altered in an immortal society. Long-term leaders could become entrenched in power, leading to potential authoritarianism. Alternatively, it could lead to a more enlightened political system where experienced individuals guide society based on centuries of knowledge. Political structures might evolve to include mechanisms for regular leadership turnover or collective governance to ensure that power remains balanced and representative of diverse perspectives."
