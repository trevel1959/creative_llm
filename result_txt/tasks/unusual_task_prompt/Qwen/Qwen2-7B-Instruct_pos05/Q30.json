    "**Portable Power Station**: Design a backpack with integrated solar panels that can recharge electronic devices on the go. The backpack would have compartments for various devices, a USB port for charging, and a foldable solar panel that unfolds when needed. This concept is perfect for hikers, campers, or people who spend extended periods outdoors without access to electricity.",
    "**Smart Travel Companion**: Create a smart backpack that integrates with a user's smartphone via Bluetooth. The backpack would monitor the user's daily activities, suggesting routes based on weather conditions, traffic, and personal preferences. It could also track fitness metrics like steps taken and calories burned, providing real-time feedback to enhance workout routines.",
    "**Emergency Preparedness Backpack**: Design a backpack specifically tailored for emergency situations. It should include essential items such as a water filter, a small first aid kit, a multi-tool, a whistle, and a survival blanket. This backpack could be customized with additional items depending on the user's specific needs (e.g., food supplies, a flashlight, or a portable radio).",
    "**Customizable Modular Backpack**: Develop a backpack with modular components that can be added or removed based on the user's needs. For example, a student could easily switch out a study module with a sports module when transitioning from class to practice. Each module could contain items relevant to its purpose, such as books, sports equipment, or art supplies.",
    "**Sustainable Eco-Friendly Backpack**: Craft a backpack made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic bottles or organic cotton. This design could also incorporate innovative features like water-resistant coatings made from natural plant-based substances. The backpack would appeal to environmentally conscious consumers looking for eco-friendly products while maintaining functionality and style."
