    "**Candle-Infused Scented Oils**: Create a new line of scented oils that can be used in essential oil diffusers or mixed with water for an ambient, scented mist. The oils could be made from the same fragrances as traditional candles but offer an alternative for those who prefer not to use actual candles. Each scent could be inspired by different themes (e.g., nature, luxury, comfort), offering versatility and catering to various moods and settings.",
    "**Interactive Candle Art**: Design a series of candles where each one comes with a QR code on its label. Scanning the code reveals a short story, a poem, or even an interactive game related to the candle's theme. This concept turns the experience of lighting a candle into a more engaging and educational activity.",
    "**DIY Candle Kits**: Offer kits containing all the necessary ingredients for customers to make their own candles at home. Include items like wax, wicks, color dyes, fragrances, and molds. Provide detailed instructions and perhaps even online tutorials to guide beginners through the process. This idea taps into the growing trend of DIY crafts and allows for customization, making it perfect for gift-giving or personal enjoyment.",
    "**Candle-Themed Subscription Box**: Create a monthly subscription box that sends out a variety of candles, each with a unique scent and story behind it. The box could also include complementary items such as books, tea, or snacks that align with the candle's theme. This provides a convenient and personalized way for candle enthusiasts to discover new scents and experiences.",
    "**Sustainable Candles**: Develop a line of candles made from eco-friendly materials, such as beeswax or soy wax, sourced from sustainable practices. Additionally, ensure the packaging is recyclable or biodegradable. Offer candles with a longer burn time to provide value while minimizing waste. This approach appeals to consumers who prioritize sustainability and ethical consumption, potentially attracting a wider market segment."
