    "**Static Electricity Damage**: When assembling a computer, there's a risk of damaging sensitive components due to static electricity. Even a small static discharge can fry a CPU or motherboard. To prevent this, it’s crucial to use an anti-static wrist strap or work on a non-static surface, such as a wooden table, and ensure that the workspace is grounded.",
    "**Incorrect Installation**: Many novice builders may misinstall components, such as improperly seating the CPU or RAM. This can lead to the computer failing to boot or causing hardware malfunctions. A detailed, step-by-step guide or video tutorial can help ensure that each component is installed correctly. Additionally, double-checking connections and ensuring everything is secure before powering on the system can help avoid this issue.",
    "**Overheating**: A common problem during and after the build is overheating due to inadequate cooling solutions. If the CPU cooler is not properly installed or if there is insufficient airflow in the case, it can lead to thermal throttling or hardware damage. To address this, selecting an appropriate cooling solution and ensuring that case fans are correctly positioned for optimal airflow is essential. Monitoring temperatures with software tools can also help identify potential overheating issues.",
    "**Power Supply Limitations**: Choosing a power supply unit (PSU) that does not provide enough wattage for the components can lead to system instability or failure to boot. It’s vital to calculate the total power requirements of all components and select a PSU with a sufficient wattage rating and good efficiency (80 Plus certified). Additionally, considering the future upgrade potential is important when selecting a PSU.",
    "**Software Installation Challenges**: After successfully assembling the hardware, the next hurdle is installing the operating system and drivers. New builders may struggle with BIOS settings or installing the OS correctly. To alleviate this, having a bootable USB drive prepared with the operating system and understanding the BIOS settings needed to boot from it can streamline the process. Following guides for driver installation and updates will also help ensure everything runs smoothly."
