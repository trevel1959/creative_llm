    "**Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH)**: Implement a large-scale AWH system that can extract clean water from the air, even in arid regions. This can be achieved using advanced condensation technology, such as membranes or mesh materials, that can capture water vapor from the atmosphere. The system can be powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Underground Water Reservoirs**: Develop a network of underground water reservoirs that can store and filter water from natural sources like rivers, lakes, or ocean water. These reservoirs can be built using advanced materials like concrete or steel, and equipped with advanced filtration systems to remove impurities. The water can be pumped up to the surface for distribution. (Confidence score: 0.8)",
    "**Seawater Desalination using Bio-Inspired Membranes**: Design and deploy a large-scale seawater desalination system that uses bio-inspired membranes to remove salt and other impurities from seawater. These membranes can mimic the natural processes of marine organisms, such as coral or shells, to efficiently filter out impurities. (Confidence score: 0.85)",
    "**Rainwater Harvesting with Advanced Filtration**: Implement a widespread rainwater harvesting system that collects and filters rainwater from rooftops, roads, and other surfaces. The system can use advanced filtration technologies like nanofiltration or reverse osmosis to remove impurities and contaminants. (Confidence score: 0.9)",
    "**Artificial Photosynthesis**: Develop an artificial photosynthesis system that can convert sunlight into clean drinking water, mimicking the natural process of photosynthesis. This system can use advanced nanomaterials and bio-inspired technologies to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, which can then be collected and used as clean drinking water.
