    "Rainwater Harvesting: Implement rainwater harvesting systems that collect and store rainwater from rooftops, parking lots, and other surfaces. This water can be used for various purposes such as irrigation, cleaning, and even drinking, depending on the quality of the water.",
    "Desalination: Develop desalination plants that use reverse osmosis or other techniques to remove salt and other impurities from seawater, providing a reliable source of fresh water even in the absence of rain.",
    "Water from Air: Utilize humidity in the air to extract water using condensation techniques. This method can be used in arid regions where the humidity is relatively high, and it can provide a sustainable source of water.",
    "Water from Recycling: Recycle wastewater from industries and households to produce clean drinking water. This method can be used in conjunction with other water collection methods to increase the overall availability of water.",
    "Cloud Seeding: Use cloud seeding techniques to artificially induce rainfall in areas that are experiencing drought. This method can be used to supplement natural rainfall and increase the overall water supply."
