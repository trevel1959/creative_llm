    "Aquaponics: Aquaponics combines hydroponics with fish farming. By creating a closed-loop system, one can grow fish and plants simultaneously, utilizing the waste products of the fish to fertilize the plants and vice versa, providing a sustainable food source.",
    "Microgreens: Microgreens are nutrient-dense and can be grown indoors with minimal space. They can be used as a substitute for traditional greens in salads, sandwiches, and other dishes, providing a variety of flavors and textures.",
    "Insect Farming: Insect farming is a way to produce food, such as protein-rich insects, while also helping to control pests and maintain ecological balance. Insects can be farmed in controlled environments, providing a source of protein and other nutrients.",
    "Food Preservation: Learning food preservation techniques, such as canning, dehydrating, and fermenting, allows for the preservation of food beyond its natural shelf life. This would enable the storage of a variety of food items, allowing for a longer period of self-sufficiency.",
    "Community-Based Food Sharing: In a post-farming world, community-based food sharing initiatives could become more prevalent. Neighbors could pool their resources, share knowledge, and support each other in finding and distributing food."
