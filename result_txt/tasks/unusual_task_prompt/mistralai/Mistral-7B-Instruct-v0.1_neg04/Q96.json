    "Voice-activated printer: Create a printer that can be controlled through voice commands. Users can say \"print this document\" or \"print this image\" and the printer will automatically start printing without the need for any physical input. This would be particularly useful for people with disabilities or those who are unable to manually input their documents into the printer.",
    "Wireless charging printer: Develop a printer that can be charged wirelessly through a charging pad. This would eliminate the need for cords and make it easier to keep the printer clean and organized.",
    "Smart printer: Create a printer that can be integrated with other smart devices in the home or office. For example, users could print documents directly from their smartphones or tablets, or they could set up the printer to automatically print out reports or invoices based on certain triggers.",
    "3D printing printer: Develop a printer that can print in 3D. This would allow users to create custom objects and sculptures with ease, and could have a wide range of applications in fields such as engineering and architecture.",
    "Inkless printer: Create a printer that uses a special ink cartridge that can be refilled with a simple household item, such as water or vinegar. This would greatly reduce the cost of printing and make it more environmentally friendly, as the cartridges would not need to be replaced as often."
