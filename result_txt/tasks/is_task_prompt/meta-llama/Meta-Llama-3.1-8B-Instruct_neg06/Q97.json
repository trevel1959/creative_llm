    "\"Smile Mirror\": A sunflower with a built-in, interactive mirror that reflects the viewer's smile back at them. The mirror's surface is designed to resemble the sunflower's petals, creating a sense of symmetry and harmony.

This interactive installation can be placed in public spaces, such as parks or plazas, to spread joy and positivity.",
    "\"Petals of Hope\": A sunflower with a unique, modular design that allows people to write messages of hope and encouragement on its petals. Each petal is made of a thin, translucent material that can be easily written on with a special marker. As people add their messages, the sunflower grows and evolves, creating a vibrant, dynamic display of collective hope and support. This installation can be used in hospitals, schools, or community centers to provide a sense of comfort and reassurance.",
    "\"Sunflower Symphony\": A sunflower that produces a unique, musical sound when someone approaches it.

As the viewer draws closer, the sunflower's \"song\" changes pitch and tone, creating an immersive, interactive experience. This installation can be used in public spaces or museums to create an engaging and memorable experience.",
    "\"Blooming Memories\": A sunflower that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to bring memories to life. When someone approaches the sunflower, they can scan a QR code or use a mobile app to access a personalized memory book. The AR technology then superimposes images and stories from the viewer's past onto the sunflower's petals, creating a dynamic, interactive display of memories. This installation can be used in museums, galleries, or personal spaces to preserve and celebrate memories.",
    "\"Sunflower Sanctuary\": A sunflower that serves as a calming, meditative space for people to relax and unwind. The sunflower is surrounded by a series of soothing sounds, gentle lighting, and calming scents, creating a peaceful atmosphere.
