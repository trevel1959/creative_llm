    "Develop a Vitamin and Mineral-Rich Soil: Create a new strain of soil that is enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, which would be absorbed by plants grown in this soil. This soil could be produced through a combination of advanced agricultural techniques and cutting-edge biotechnology. The resulting plants would provide a rich source of vitamins and minerals, making it possible to maintain a healthy diet without fruits and vegetables.",
    "Insect-Based Nutrition: Harness the nutritional potential of insects as a source of essential vitamins and minerals. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are already high in protein and could be farmed on a large scale to provide a sustainable source of nutrients. Insect-based food products could be fortified with additional vitamins and minerals to ensure a balanced diet.",
    "Advanced Food Hydroponics: Develop a hydroponic system that can grow fruits and vegetables without soil. This system would use a nutrient-rich solution to feed the plants, ensuring they absorb all the essential vitamins and minerals they need to thrive. By controlling the nutrient solution and growing conditions, it would be possible to optimize the nutritional content of the produce, making it a reliable source of vitamins and minerals.",
    "Algae-Based Nutrition: Algae are rich in vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, making them an ideal source of essential nutrients. Algae could be farmed in large quantities and processed into various forms, such as supplements, powders, or even whole food products. Algae-based nutrition could provide a sustainable and reliable source of vitamins and minerals, even if fruits and vegetables were to disappear.",
    "Personalized Nutrition Pods: Create personalized nutrition pods that use advanced technology to analyze an individual's nutritional needs and provide a customized mix of vitamins and minerals. These pods could be filled with a variety of nutrient-rich substances, such as algae, insects, or"
