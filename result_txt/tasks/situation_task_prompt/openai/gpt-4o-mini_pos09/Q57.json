    "**Submerged Habitats**: Inspired by marine life, this concept involves creating underwater living spaces made from reinforced glass and transparent materials. These habitats would allow residents to experience the ocean's beauty while remaining safe from rising waters. Each habitat could be equipped with airlocks and submerged gardens, utilizing hydroponics to grow plants and fish. Residents could enjoy panoramic views of marine life while contributing to underwater conservation efforts.",
    "**Mountain Retreats**: As ocean levels rise, relocating to higher elevations becomes a practical option. Mountainous regions could be transformed into eco-friendly retreats, featuring sustainable cabins made from local materials. These retreats would be designed to minimize environmental impact, utilizing solar energy and rainwater harvesting. Community centers could focus on permaculture and off-grid living, fostering a strong sense of community among residents who prioritize harmony with nature.",
    "**Mobile Living Pods**: In response to rising ocean levels, innovative mobile living pods could be developed. These self-sustaining units would be equipped with solar panels, water purification systems, and composting toilets, allowing them to function independently. Residents could travel between coastal and inland areas as needed, adapting to changing environmental conditions. The pods could be designed for communal living, promoting shared resources and experiences.",
    "**Vertical Farming Towers**: Urban areas could be reimagined with vertical farming towers, which not only provide living space but also grow food in a compact, efficient manner. These towers would be designed to withstand extreme weather and flooding, featuring green roofs and walls that absorb rainwater. Residents would have access to fresh produce year-round, while the towers would contribute to urban biodiversity and help mitigate the effects of climate change.",
    "**Reclaimed Land Communities**: As ocean levels rise, some coastal areas may become uninhabitable. This opens up opportunities for reclaiming land through innovative engineering. Communities could be built on newly formed islands or elevated platforms, designed with flood-resistant infrastructure. These communities would prioritize sustainability, incorporating renewable energy sources, green spaces, and efficient waste management systems, creating a model for future urban development."
