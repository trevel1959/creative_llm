    "Loss of body symmetry: If humans could regenerate limbs like starfish, it could lead to a loss of body symmetry. The regenerated limbs might not grow in the same pattern as the original limbs, resulting in an uneven and misshapen body.",
    "Uncontrollable growth: With the ability to regenerate limbs, there is a risk of uncontrollable growth. The regenerated limbs might continue to grow and divide, leading to a body that is constantly changing shape and size. This could cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty moving around.",
    "Increased risk of infection: The regeneration process could leave the body more vulnerable to infection. The open wounds from the regenerating limbs could be prone to bacterial or viral infections, leading to serious health problems.",
    "Psychological trauma: The ability to regenerate limbs could lead to psychological trauma. The constant change in body shape and size could lead to body dysmorphic disorder, where the individual becomes obsessed with their appearance and experiences anxiety or depression.",
    "Ethical concerns: With the ability to regenerate limbs, there could be ethical concerns around the use of this ability. For example, could a person with a regenerated limb be considered \"more worthy\" than someone without one? Could the ability to regenerate limbs be used to create a class system, where those with the ability are seen as superior to those without? These ethical concerns could lead to social unrest and discrimination."
