    "AquaPods: Create portable, water-based cleaning pods that can be filled with water and a small amount of soap. These pods could be used to clean the body, clothes, and surfaces. They would be easy to use, just rub the dirty area with the pod and rinse off with water.",
    "Soap-infused towels: Develop towels that are infused with a small amount of soap, allowing for a gentle cleaning of the body without the need for a separate soap and water. These towels could be washed and reused multiple times.",
    "Solar-powered showers: Create showerheads that use solar power to heat water, eliminating the need for soap. The showerheads could be equipped with a small amount of soap that is released with each use, allowing for a quick and easy clean.",
    "Smart soap dispensers: Develop smart soap dispensers that can detect when a person is approaching and automatically dispense the appropriate amount of soap. These dispensers could be connected to a smartphone app, allowing users to set reminders and track their soap usage.",
    "Bamboo soap bars: Create soap bars made from bamboo, which is a sustainable and renewable resource. These soap bars could be used for both personal hygiene and cleaning surfaces, and they would biodegrade at the end of their life cycle, reducing waste."
