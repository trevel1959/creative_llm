    "Smart Sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses with built-in augmented reality (AR) technology. The lenses could display information such as the wearer's fitness goals, directions, and notifications from their phone. The sunglasses could also have a camera that can recognize objects and provide additional information, such as the name of a building or the artist of a painting.",
    "Heat-Sensitive Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses that change color based on the temperature around the wearer. For example, if the wearer is in a hot environment, the lenses could turn dark blue, while in a cooler environment, they could turn light pink. This would provide the wearer with a visual cue to adjust their surroundings.",
    "3D Printed Sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses using 3D printing technology. The lenses could be customized to fit the wearer's prescription and could also have unique designs or patterns that are only visible when the wearer is looking at a certain angle. This would make each pair of sunglasses one-of-a-kind.",
    "Smart Tinting Sunglasses: Create a pair of sunglasses with lenses that can change their tint based on the wearer's mood or environment. For example, if the wearer is feeling stressed, the lenses could darken to provide extra protection from the sun, while in a relaxing environment, they could lighten to reduce glare.",
    "Holographic Sunglasses: Develop a pair of sunglasses with holographic lenses that display 3D images of the wearer's surroundings. This would provide the wearer with a unique and immersive visual experience, as if they were wearing a virtual reality headset. The holographic images could also be customized to provide additional information, such as the names of buildings or the artist of a painting."
