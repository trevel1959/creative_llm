This could be revolutionary for fields like medicine, epidemiology, and public health, offering new avenues for combating illnesses and improving overall global health outcomes.",
    "**Environmental Restoration:** Imagine using your power to restore damaged ecosystems or prevent environmental disasters. You could go back in time to stop deforestation, halt oil spills, or mitigate the effects of climate change by altering the past.
