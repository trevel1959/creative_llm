    "**Eco-Friendly Electric Mower with Solar Charging**: Develop a lawn mower powered by electric batteries that can be charged using solar panels integrated into the mower’s design. This would not only reduce carbon emissions but also provide a sustainable energy source for the mower. Users could place the mower in sunlight to recharge while they are not using it, making it a greener option for lawn care.",
    "**Multi-Functional Lawn Mower**: Design a mower that goes beyond just cutting grass. It could have interchangeable attachments for various tasks such as leaf blowing, snow removal, or even gardening. For instance, after mowing, the user could quickly switch to a leaf mulcher attachment to clean up fallen leaves, or a small plow for winter snow, making it a versatile tool for year-round yard maintenance.",
    "**Robotic Lawn Mower with Obstacle Detection**: Enhance the robotic lawn mower technology by incorporating advanced sensors and cameras that allow it to detect and navigate around obstacles in real-time. This would prevent it from getting stuck on objects like toys, garden hoses, or even pets. Additionally, the mower could have a feature that allows it to create a map of the lawn, enabling it to work more efficiently and ensuring no area is missed.",
    "**Self-Cleaning Lawn Mower**: Create a mower with a built-in self-cleaning system that uses high-pressure water jets to remove grass clippings and debris from the blades and undercarriage after each use. This would not only maintain the mower’s performance but also reduce the need for manual cleaning, making it more convenient for users. ",
    "**Soundproof Lawn Mower**: Innovate a lawn mower that incorporates sound-dampening technology to significantly reduce noise levels during operation. This would be especially beneficial for residential areas where noise complaints are common. The mower could feature a specially designed engine and insulated casing to minimize sound, allowing users to mow their lawns without disturbing neighbors or waking up sleeping family members."
