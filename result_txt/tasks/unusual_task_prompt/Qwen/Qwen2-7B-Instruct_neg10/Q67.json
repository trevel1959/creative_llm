    "**Innovative Task Light**: Create a smart task light that changes its color and brightness according to your task. For instance, if you're reading a book, it could emit a warm yellow glow to help reduce eye strain. When coding or working on detailed tasks, it could turn into a cool white for better visibility. It would also have a feature to adjust the lighting based on your current mood or energy levels.",
    "**Task-Themed Flashlight Stories**: Use your flashlight to create a new storytelling experience. Each time you need to use the flashlight, tell a short story related to the task at hand. For example, while cooking, tell a tale about the origins of the dish you are preparing. This can make mundane tasks more engaging and enjoyable.",
    "**Interactive Flashlight Messages**: Use your flashlight to send secret messages or reminders to yourself. For example, when you're in the kitchen, set up a code where each blinking pattern represents a specific item on your grocery list. This can make mundane tasks like grocery shopping more fun and interactive.",
    "**Flashlight Art**: Transform your daily tasks into art projects. Use your flashlight to draw or paint on surfaces like the wall or a large piece of paper. You can create patterns or even animations as you complete your tasks. This turns simple activities like cleaning or organizing into creative outlets.",
    "**Task-Themed Flashlight Challenges**: Challenge yourself to perform mundane tasks under certain conditions using only your flashlight. For instance, try to sort your mail without looking at the content by feeling the size and shape of each envelope. Or, attempt to solve a puzzle or complete a jigsaw by only using the flashlight to guide your hands. These challenges can add an element of surprise and fun to everyday activities."
