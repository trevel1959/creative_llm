    "**Smart Surround Sound**: Integrate a smart surround sound system into the Bluetooth speaker that uses advanced algorithms to analyze the room's acoustics. The speaker could adjust its sound output based on the room size, shape, and furniture placement, ensuring optimal audio quality. This feature could be controlled via a companion app, allowing users to set up their listening environment effortlessly.",
    "**Eco-Friendly Power Options**: Design the Bluetooth speaker with eco-friendly power options, such as solar panels or kinetic energy converters. This would allow users to charge the speaker using renewable energy sources, making it perfect for outdoor use. Additionally, a built-in battery management system could optimize power consumption, extending battery life and promoting sustainability.",
    "**Interactive Touch Surface**: Incorporate an interactive touch-sensitive surface on the speaker that allows users to control playback, volume, and equalizer settings through gestures. For instance, swiping left could lower the volume, while tapping could play or pause music. This feature would eliminate the need for physical buttons and provide a more modern and intuitive user experience.",
    "**Multi-Device Connectivity**: Enhance the Bluetooth speaker with multi-device connectivity that allows it to connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Users could seamlessly switch between their phone, tablet, and laptop without needing to disconnect and reconnect each time. This would be particularly useful for group settings, where different users might want to share their playlists.",
    "**Voice-Activated Personal Assistant**: Integrate a voice-activated personal assistant directly into the Bluetooth speaker. Users could control their music, check the weather, set reminders, or even make calls using voice commands. This would transform the speaker into a smart home hub, providing added functionality beyond just audio playback."
