    "The world would have a \"kindness hour\" every day, where everyone takes a break from their daily routines to perform small acts of kindness for others. This could be as simple as holding the door for someone, giving a compliment, or volunteering at a local charity. The idea is to create a ripple effect of positivity and compassion that would spread throughout the world.",
    "Everyone would have access to clean water and sanitation, regardless of their geographical location or socio-economic status. This would be achieved through a combination of technological innovations, such as water purification systems and sustainable water distribution networks, and policy changes, such as increased investment in water infrastructure and access to clean water as a basic human right.",
    "People would be required to learn a new skill or hobby every year, which would foster creativity, innovation, and personal growth. This could be anything from learning a new language, playing a musical instrument, or taking up a sport. The idea is to encourage people to continue learning and developing throughout their lives, and to cultivate a sense of curiosity and exploration.",
    "Everyone would have access to mental health services, including therapy and counseling, without fear of stigma or discrimination. This would help to reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals and society, and create a culture where mental health is prioritized and valued.",
    "The world would have a \"no-phone zone\" for one day a week, where people would be encouraged to disconnect from their digital devices and engage in face-to-face interactions. This would help to reduce the negative effects of screen time on mental health, foster deeper connections and relationships, and promote a greater appreciation for the beauty of the natural world."
