    "**DIY Phone Holder**: Transform an old sock into a makeshift phone holder for hands-free viewing. Simply cut the toe off the sock, stuff the ankle portion with a little padding (like cotton or fabric scraps), and shape it to create a stand. This way, you can prop your phone up at a comfortable angle for watching videos or video chatting.",
    "**Dusting Glove**: Turn a sock into a cleaning tool by slipping it onto your hand. The soft fabric can easily pick up dust and debris from surfaces like shelves, blinds, and electronics.

    "**Pet Toy**: Repurpose an old sock into a toy for your dog or cat. You can stuff it with crinkly paper, catnip, or even another sock to give it more structure.
